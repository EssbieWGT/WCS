The policy was enacted in […]","Razor wire and fencing surround the Orleans Parish Justice Center jail. (Richard A. Webster/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – An attorney for Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson cast state Attorney General Liz Murrill’s attempt to repeal the Sheriff’s Office’s longstanding immigration policy as baseless during a federal court hearing Wednesday, saying that the state has not offered any proof that Hutson’s deputies are violating state law.
The policy was enacted in 2013 following a court settlement in a 2011 civil rights case filed against the sheriff’s office. It places strict limitations on honoring detainer requests from federal immigrant authorities and prohibits deputies from initiating immigration-status investigations.
Murrill, who derisively refers to the directive as a “sanctuary” policy, has said she believes that the sheriff’s office is running afoul of a recently enacted state law that requires local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration officials. She has asked a federal judge to allow the state to join the case as a named party.
Speaking before federal Magistrate Judge Janis van Meerveld, Hutson’s chief of staff John Williams — who is acting as the agency’s attorney in Wednesday’s hearing — said the state has not shown that Orleans Parish deputies have hindered any ICE investigation since the law went into effect in May 2024.
“Above all, the sheriff is a law enforcement officer — she is one of the chief law enforcement officers of Orleans Parish,” Williams said. “She will continue to protect and enforce the laws of Louisiana.”
“There’ve been no direct communications [with ICE] where we were not collaborating or partnering in ways that were appropriate,” he said.
Murrill’s move to dissolve the policy is part of a broader conservative push — in Louisiana and across the country — to eliminate so-called “sanctuary cities,” places where local law enforcement is restricted, to one degree or another, from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.
Earlier this week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order calling on the federal government to publish a list of localities that “obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration laws.”
And last week, the U.S. Department of Justice, which had never formally objected to the policy in the 12 years it’s been on the books, filed a “statement of interest” in support of Murrill’s intervention and the dissolution of the Sheriff’s Office’s policy.
It wasn’t immediately clear whether Hutson’s office has refused any ICE requests since the law took effect. Reached for comment after the hearing, Williams said he is “not personally aware” of the Sheriff’s Office refusing to honor an immigration detainer from ICE.
But after the hearing, Brian Acuna, deputy director of ICE’s regional office in New Orleans, said the Sheriff’s Office has long ignored  immigration detainer requests, and has continued to do so even after the state law took effect.
“That [OPSO] policy has an effect of allowing criminal aliens back onto the street,” Acuna said in a phone interview. “That is a huge public safety issue.”
‘This is all premature’
The current policy stems from a suit filed by two construction workers — Mario Cacho and  Antonio Ocampo, who were picked up in New Orleans on minor charges in 2009 and 2010. At the request of ICE, which was investigating their immigration statuses, the two were illegally held in the city’s jail for months beyond their short jail sentences. Under the law, such requests only allow local jails to hold people for 48 hours after they were scheduled to be released.
The pair sued in 2011. Two and a half years later, then-Sheriff Marlin Gusman agreed to a settlement, or consent decree.
As part of the agreement, Gusman adopted the current policy, which bans the Sheriff’s Office from honoring ICE detainer requests without a court order — except for inmates charged with a short list of especially serious crimes —  and bans sheriff’s deputies from initiating immigration investigations or offering ICE information about inmates’ release dates or address.
The existence of the policy itself appears to go against the new state law, which bars any law enforcement policy that places limits on honoring ICE hold requests or providing information to ICE. But in court on Wednesday, Williams told van Meerveld that the Sheriff’s Office is reviewing the policy and may suggest revisions.
On Wednesday, attorneys for Cacho and Ocampo urged van Meerveld to remember the reason for the consent decree in the first place.
“Our clients were overdetained without due process for months on end,” Matt Vogel, supervising attorney at the National Immigration Project, said in court. “This case was about justice for them and about making sure that that doesn’t happen again.”
Zachary Faircloth, principal deputy solicitor for the state, argued on Wednesday that the recent change to state law should have dissolved the OPSO policy based on the language in the 2013 consent judgement, which says the provisions in the order have “permanent effect, absent a change in federal or state law applicable to immigration detainers.”
“The consent decree turns on whether or not there was a change in state or federal law,” Faircloth said in court.
But Vogel, like the Sheriff’s Office, argued that until Murrill can prove that OPSO has violated state law, it’s too early for the judge to reconsider the policy.
“This is all premature. It’s all speculative,” Vogel said.

(Courtesy of Office of Gov. Jim Pillen)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers gave final approval Thursday to merge two state agencies this summer and create one central department intended to increase the state’s focus on water.
Legislative Bill 317, from State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, passed 34-12 without debate. This July 1, the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources will be folded into the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy, creating the Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment.   
Gov. Jim Pillen is expected to sign the bill, which Brandt introduced on his behalf. The governor has also created a “Water Quality and Quantity Task Force.” 
A revised fiscal analysis said the merger, which was expected to initially cost the state for rebranding rather than cost savings, could be absorbed. The same statement said efficiency savings could be made and realized in the 2027-29 biennium. No specifics were given.

Jesse Bradley currently serves as the joint interim director of Natural Resources and Environment and Energy. The two agencies already co-locate in the same northwest Lincoln office building.
Natural Resources has a budget of more than $104 million, largely from cash funds ($89.5 million). Environment and Energy has a budget of nearly $99 million, split roughly in half between federal ($48.9 million) and cash funds ($43.2 million).
In addition to a new combined agency director, the state will hire a “chief water officer” who essentially takes on the role of the director of Natural Resources. While LB 317 is 511 pages, much of that is dedicated to renaming the different departments and division directors across hundreds of state statutes.
The Nebraska Association of Natural Resources Districts (representing the state’s 23 NRDs), Nebraska State Irrigation Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska chapter of the Sierra Club and Nebraska Farmers Union opposed the bill at its hearing.
Many opponents expressed concern at a February public hearing for the bill that the merger might divide rather than focus attention on water resources.
Only Pillen, Bradley, a member of the state’s budget division and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission (limited to a small section of LB 317) testified in support of the bill.
Brandt said he felt good that the bill passed and that the longer he met with opponents to the bill, the more that initial concerns began to fade. He noted that during the second-round debate, he sought to address concerns from a couple of senators.
“The missions won’t change,” Brandt said of the merger. “It will just become one agency.”



History of the Nebraska Departments of Natural Resources, Environment and Energy
Current: Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy

The Nebraska Department of Environmental Control is established (1971).
The department is renamed the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (1992).
Nebraska Energy Office is folded into the Environmental Quality Department, becoming DEE (2019).
State-delegated environmental health programs from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, housed in the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, are moved over to DEE (2021).

Current: Nebraska Department of Natural Resources

The State Board of Irrigation is established (1895).
The board is renamed the State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage (1911).
The name changes again to the Department of Public Works, expanded to include the Bureau of Roads and Bridges; Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage; and the Motor Vehicle Records Division (1919).
The department is renamed the Nebraska Department of Roads and Irrigation (1933).
The Nebraska Department of Water Resources is established as the prior department is divided into three separate state agencies, alongside the Department of Roads and the Department of Motor Vehicles (1957).
The Natural Resources Commission merges with the Nebraska Department of Water Resources to become the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources (2000).

Future: Nebraska Department of Energy, Water and Environment
Nebraska is the only state with separate natural resources districts, which were created in 1972 as multipurpose, locally elected management bodies. There are currently 23 NRDs statewide.
Water management in the state is largely shared by the Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Environment and Energy and NRDs, with specific support from the Nebraska Department of Agriculture and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.

I started out working with individuals with autism and eventually began working with people struggling with mental health and substance use issues. Later, I supported adolescents and teenagers carrying deep trauma. Today, I work behind the scenes at a Managed Care Organization (MCO) in North Carolina. I help develop plans and connect individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD), including autism, to essential services. 
I hold an associate’s degree in psychology and a bachelor’s in social sciences, and I am currently pursuing my master’s degree in social work at NC State University. These credentials don’t just represent my education—they represent a lifetime of witnessing how our systems fail the very people they are supposed to serve. 
What I’ve seen—and what many of us working in the field see every day—is a system weighed down by red tape disguised as checks, balances, and accountability. Bureaucratic processes meant to ensure “quality” have instead become barriers. I’ve seen life-changing care delayed or denied, not because of clinical judgment but because of outdated rules, disconnected policies, and constant administrative hurdles. 
Worse, the people we serve are no longer seen as human beings — they are numbers on a spreadsheet, authorization codes in a portal, or units of service to be approved or denied. But behind every case number is a person — someone’s child, parent, or friend — who deserves compassion, dignity, and timely care. 
A glaring example of systemic failure is how county borders restrict Medicaid services. If a person on Medicaid moves from one North Carolina county to another, they may lose access to their provider simply because the new county operates under a different MCO. They haven’t left the state. They haven’t stopped needing care. But now they’re disconnected from the providers they know, forced to start over, or worse, left with no care at all. That’s not how a safety net is supposed to work. 
Let’s talk about the bigger picture: 

In 2021, more than 150 million Americans lived in areas designated as Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (KFF, 2022). 
Black and Brown communities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people in poverty experience higher rates of untreated mental health conditions, yet are less likely to receive care (SAMHSA, 2023). 
The substance use crisis continues to claim over 100,000 lives a year, yet we continue to criminalize instead of treat. 
And mental health workers? We’re exhausted. A 2022 report found that more than half of behavioral health workers are experiencing burnout and considering leaving the field, not because we don’t care, but because the system makes it impossible to provide the care, we know people need.

Many of the policies in place today were written by individuals who have no background in mental health or substance use treatment. Lawmakers and decision-makers, without training or input from frontline professionals, are drafting rules that dictate how care is delivered. It’s not just frustrating. It’s harmful. 
This isn’t just about inefficiency. It’s about injustice. We need legislation that centers people, not paperwork. We need lawmakers willing to listen to social workers, therapists, peer support specialists, families, and those with lived experience. We need policies informed by practice, not politics. 
To the public: demand better. This is your issue, too, because when systems fail one group, they eventually fail us all. Vote for those who understand or are willing to learn. Speak up when silence means complicity. 
To policymakers: If you lack experience in mental health, listen to those who do. Invite us to the table. Include our voices when you write the rules. Our communities depend on you to transform the system, not manage it. 
I am writing this letter because I believe change is still possible. But we can no longer afford to pretend the current system is working. Lives are being lost, families are being broken, and professionals are being pushed to the edge — all while the system protects itself instead of the people it was built to serve. 
We deserve better. And we demand better.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AdobeStock_mentalhealth-commitment.jpg,,,2025-05-01 11:07:43.839084

Delaware’s annual open burning ban goes into effect today, May 1, and will remain in place through September 30, as part of the state’s ongoing efforts to improve air quality during the high-risk ozone season.
The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) reminds residents and visitors that most forms of outdoor burning are prohibited during this time.
The seasonal ban aims to reduce the formation of ground-level ozone, a pollutant that becomes more prevalent with warmer temperatures and longer daylight hours.
READ: First State Military Academy to celebrate 10 years with community day event
“The burning ban is critical for continuing to improve our air quality,” said Environmental Scientist Gerald Mood of the DNREC Division of Air Quality. “As summer temperatures rise, and as we get longer daylight hours, the conditions which allow for the formation of ground level ozone become more prevalent.”
Ground-level ozone forms when pollutants from sources such as smoke interact with sunlight.
In addition to causing environmental harm, ozone can pose serious health risks, especially for children, the elderly, and people with respiratory conditions.
While the ban restricts most burning, exceptions are made for small-scale activities such as cooking fires, recreational campfires, and ceremonial bonfires.
However, these too may be temporarily banned if an Air Quality Action Day is declared or if the State Fire Marshal imposes additional restrictions.
The ban covers agricultural and prescribed burns, as well as the burning of yard debris like brush and tree limbs.
It is illegal at any time of year to burn leaves, grass, trash, or other refuse materials, including tires, plastics, and construction waste.
DNREC encourages residents to use safer alternatives for disposing of yard waste, such as curbside pickup services, drop-off sites, mulching, or composting.
More information on these options is available here.

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.

Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.

“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”

Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.


 
A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing.


– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America


Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

Young International Airport in Detroit | Ken Coleman A bill introduced in the Michigan House of Representatives would rename a section of highway in Jackson County after a missing Tuskegee Airman who grew up in the city of Jackson.
State Rep. Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson) said that her sponsored legislation, House Bill 4145, would name a section of U.S. 127 between mile markers 39 and 40, near the I-94 interchange, after 2nd Lieutenant Roosevelt Stiger, a Tuskegee Airman and Purple Heart recipient.
“It is a real privilege to advocate on behalf of a true American hero,” said Schmaltz in a press release. “2nd Lieutenant Stiger served our country with courage, broke barriers, and gave his life fighting for freedom. This memorial is a small but meaningful way we can ensure his legacy lives on in the community he once called home.”
Stiger was born in Mississippi in 1919 and moved to Jackson with his family during his childhood. He trained as a pilot through the Tuskegee Aviation Cadet program. Stiger graduated in 1944 and was deployed overseas with the 99th Fighter Squadron, 332nd Fighter Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II.

During a bomber escort mission over the Adriatic Sea on Oct. 7, 1944, he reported issues with his oxygen system. Stiger’s aircraft was seen descending toward the water and he was never recovered, remaining listed as missing in action.
The Tuskegee Airmen were the first African American military aviators in the U.S. Armed Forces, breaking racial barriers during a time of segregation and limited opportunity. Despite facing systemic racism, these men trained rigorously and flew countless successful missions during World War II. 
About 1,000 pilots were trained as Tuskegee Airmen, along with thousands of support personnel. Notable members include Coleman A. Young, who later became the first Black mayor of Detroit, and Charles McGee, a decorated fighter pilot who served in three wars. 
The Tuskegee Airmen National Museum, which honors their legacy, is located in Detroit at the historic Coleman A. Young International Airport. The bill was approved by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and now goes to the full House for consideration.

A U.S. Census Bureau […]","A mixed-use residential and commercial building under construction on June 13, 2023, in downtown Rapid City. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974 — while South Dakota led the way in approval of new housing units — but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.
Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
Apartment construction cools rents in some regions, including SD

“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Board awards $10.5 million in federal, $760,000 in state funds to affordable housing projects

Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.










A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing.


– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America


Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Former Kansas foster care leaders accused of defrauding their old employer of millions of dollars indicated in court that they plan to change their not guilty pleas, avoiding a trial.
William Whymark, the former IT director for the regional foster care provider Saint Francis Ministries is expected to change his plea later this year as attorneys continue to negotiate a deal. His co-defendant and former Saint Francis CEO Robert Smith is also “actively engaged in plea negotiations,” Smith’s attorney said at a Wednesday hearing.
Whymark and Smith face federal charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud and one count of money laundering amounting to $4.7 million in damages. A federal grand jury indicted the two in November 2022. 
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse set a May 28 hearing for Smith, whose attorney expressed concern Wednesday with some of the case’s numbers and calculations. Whymark is expected to change his plea at a Sept. 3 hearing. 
The two defendants were not present at the April 30 status conference. Whymark’s attorney said Whymark was in the emergency room the night before and is scheduled to receive additional treatment. Smith, who lives in Tennessee, waived his right to appear. 
A court filing from Feb. 25 showed that Whymark and Smith are “presently involved in plea negotiations and anticipate resolving this case without a trial.” They face a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison, plus fines and restitution. 
Court documents allege that Smith used Saint Francis Ministries’ credit cards for personal expenses and that “materially false invoices” paid Whymark’s IT company over $10 million. Court documents say Saint Francis Ministries had to spend an estimated $3.2 million to repair Whymark’s “grossly deficient and overpriced” work.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Topeka-federal-court-house-4--1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-01 09:08:33.796125

(Kinross photo)North of Fairbanks, hundreds of workers at Alaska’s biggest gold mine dig up, haul, crush and grind thousands of tons of ore each day, year-round. 
The sprawling Fort Knox mine consumes $40 million worth of power every year — more than any other business in the state, and some 16% of the power produced by Fairbanks’ electric utility.
Generating all that energy isn’t cheap. It’s also a huge source of planet-warming greenhouse gases.
Kinross, the global company that owns Fort Knox, operates five other mines, spread across the U.S., South America and Africa. Power at Fort Knox costs more and accounts for more greenhouse gas emissions than each of the company’s other operations, according to Meadow Riedel, a Kinross spokesperson.

The story is similar for Pogo, the Interior’s other major gold mine and the state’s second largest. 
In other countries, Kinross and Northern Star, the Australian company that owns Pogo, have spent millions of dollars on solar and wind power to curb carbon emissions and costs at their mines. 
In Alaska, they’ve opted for a different approach, at least for now: pushing the cooperatively owned utility that sells them electricity.
Behind the scenes, the two multinational gold mining companies have emerged as key players in the movement to get that utility, Golden Valley Electric Association, to invest more in renewable energy. 
 
Mining exec: Alaska’s pricy, fossil fuel-based power could thwart investment

	So far, their efforts have not fully succeeded: The utility has yet to commit to any large new wind or solar projects, and it continues to generate most of its electricity by burning coal and oil.
But the miners’ push underscores how multibillion-dollar resource development corporations have turned into odd bedfellows with Alaska’s climate activists — both calling for the state’s utilities to limit their contributions to global warming.
The corporations, based outside the U.S., have faced social and political pressure from shareholders and government regulators to reduce their environmental impacts. They’ve also seen the cost of solar and wind power fall due to government subsidies and technological improvements, making renewables more competitive with fossil fuels. 
New obstacles have arisen, though, as the Trump administration promotes carbon-based fuels and threatens to claw back billions of dollars of clean energy funding. 
The stakes are high not only for the mining corporations, but also for Golden Valley Electric Association’s more than 36,000 members — including many residents of Fairbanks, who pay less for electricity as a result of the utility’s massive power sales to the mines.
Renewable energy advocates say replacing fossil fuels with new wind and solar power could lower long-term costs for homes and businesses in Fairbanks and other towns in the Interior. At the same time, a looming shortage of natural gas in Cook Inlet is putting pressure on Golden Valley Electric Association, known as GVEA, to find new ways to generate power.

 Offshore oil and gas platforms in Cook Inlet, like this one, once provided a cheap source of energy to Anchorage-area electric utilities, which sold power to the Fairbanks area. But gas has become increasingly expensive to extract from the Inlet, and the utilities have stopped selling power to the Interior and are now looking to import cargoes of LNG to power their generators.

“The gas crisis and the new administration have really changed how people are approaching this,” said Eleanor Gagnon, who works on energy policy at the Fairbanks Climate Action Coalition. “I think it has the potential to push us forward toward renewables and carbon neutrality — or push us deeper into our fossil fuel track.”
So far, GVEA has taken a cautious approach, with some board members worried that moving too quickly away from conventional energy sources like coal could drive up costs. 
But if the utility doesn’t invest in new wind or solar and keeps burning large volumes of fossil fuels, Kinross and Northern Star might be compelled to build their own, independent renewables projects. 
That would have consequences across the region: Losing the utility’s two biggest customers could raise electricity costs for thousands of people in Fairbanks, according to Phil Wight, an energy historian at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who is also a GVEA member. 
“If GVEA does not commit to building out the next generation of renewables, and doing so relatively soon, the mines may go out and get alternative sources of lower-carbon power — and all GVEA ratepayers would be paying more,” Wight said.
 “This is the million dollar question,” Wight added. “Why is GVEA not moving forward with building generation that, everywhere else in the world, utilities are pursuing because it’s cheaper?” 
High costs, high emissions
To separate valuable metals from plain rock, mining companies crush and grind ore into tiny pieces — a heavy industrial process that uses loads of electricity.
That means energy is usually one of the top expenses for mining companies. If that energy comes from fossil fuels, it’s also one of companies’ largest sources of planet-heating emissions. 
That dynamic is magnified in Alaska, according to company officials.
Fort Knox’s 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions in 2023 represent 20% more greenhouse gases per ounce of gold produced when compared to the company’s second highest-emitting mine, in Nevada, corporate disclosures show.

	The $40 million in yearly power consumption at Fort Knox represents a disproportionate financial expense, too. In Nevada, where the company operates two mines, electricity costs half as much, according to Riedel, the Kinross spokesperson.  
The company’s high costs and emissions in Alaska put Fort Knox at a “disadvantage” in Kinross’s internal decisions about future investments, Riedel said in an emailed statement.  
“Kinross Alaska is always competing with other Kinross sites for investment,” she said.
The company has already been working to reduce energy consumption and climate impacts in Alaska as it seeks to eliminate or fully offset carbon pollution at its mines by 2050. Fort Knox has tweaked its ore grinding process to make it more efficient and shortened haul routes to cut down on diesel use, Riedel said.
For now, Kinross isn’t developing any of its own large-scale clean energy projects in Alaska, according to Riedel. 
Building renewables at the mine “would be challenging due to Alaska’s expansive geography and extreme climate,” she said.
But Kinross might consider a “smaller scale” development, she said. She would not elaborate on how big of a project the company might build, or on what timeline, though the company spent $55 million on a solar farm at a huge mine in Mauritania.

	Northern Star, which also has a goal of fully offsetting emissions at its mines by midcentury, has indicated that it might invest in wind power at the Pogo mine, which is about 40 miles northeast of the Interior community of Delta Junction. But the company hasn’t disclosed any concrete plans to do so. 
In a corporate report published last year, Northern Star suggested that it expects to develop a project at Pogo in 2025 that would move it toward a companywide goal of lowering emissions by 35% this decade. 
A Northern Star spokesperson would not provide details about that project, which is labeled simply in the report as “Pogo GRID 16 MW.” That figure appears to refer to 16 megawatts of power that Pogo draws from the grid.
No major operating mines in Alaska are powered by private solar or wind farms. 
At the massive Red Dog zinc mine in Northwest Alaska, which runs on expensive, shipped-in diesel, Vancouver-based Teck Resources said last year that it would install a weather tower to study the potential for generating renewable power. 
But those plans fizzled, according to a company spokesperson who declined to comment further. 
Frozen funds
Last year, GVEA generated more than 80% of its power from fossil fuels — primarily coal, diesel and naphtha, which is a refined oil product. 
The rest comes from a mix of existing wind, solar and hydropower projects. 
Until last year, GVEA bought relatively inexpensive gas-fired electricity that other utilities generated in the Anchorage area. But a shortage of natural gas in Cook Inlet has severed that supply indefinitely.
Looking to diversify, GVEA announced last year that it had secured nearly $500 million in federal loans and grants that would help it vastly expand its use of renewables. 
That money would pay for two battery systems to store power from new wind and solar projects when it’s not sunny or windy. It also would cover more than 60 miles of new transmission lines, allowing the utility to tap into proposed wind farms in the Interior. 
But boosters of renewables have grown frustrated that the utility still lacks firm plans to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. And now, the federal funds for GVEA’s infrastructure upgrades are in limbo amid the Trump administration’s broad freeze on green energy spending, according to Ashley Bradish, a spokesperson for the utility.
Federal officials on March 25 gave funding recipients a month to propose project changes that align with President Donald Trump’s executive order on “unleashing American energy” and to “remove far-left climate features.” GVEA was given only 500 characters to outline those revisions, utility officials said. 
“Just within the last few weeks, GVEA’s job got a lot harder,” said Wight, the energy expert. 
GVEA’s board voted in 2022 to shut down one of its two big coal power plants — a step toward lowering emissions and moving to renewables.

	But the utility reversed course last year, citing the natural gas supply crunch and saying it would keep operating the coal plant until lower-cost alternatives became available. 
Then, in August, it signed a new contract with Usibelli Coal Mine — the state’s only supplier of the fuel — to buy more feedstock for the plant, which burns some 200,000 tons of coal each year.
While coal comes with high carbon emissions, it’s relatively cheap, and utility leaders fear that replacing it with renewables could boost costs and reduce reliability for consumers.
If Golden Valley adds more wind and solar power, it would need a way to store energy and consistently distribute it, and “there’s a cost associated with that,” Bradish said. “Our current battery can’t provide that regulation.” 
The utility has not released an analysis showing how rates would change if it were to replace fossil fuel-fired power with renewables.

	“That’s part of what we’re studying,” Bradish said.
Some advocates, like Gagnon with Fairbanks Climate Action Coalition, say there’s also a cost associated with continuing to burn fossil fuels. GVEA is paying some $14 million to build two storage tanks at the Fairbanks-area oil refinery that it buys fuel from.
“The mines’ support of renewables is evidence for the cost-effectiveness of renewables,” said Gagnon. “Their bottom line is going to be cost.” 
Kinross and Pogo — whose mines collectively account for about 30% of the utility’s energy sales — haven’t said how long they’ll wait on GVEA before building their own wind or solar farms. 
Riedel, with Kinross, said her company wants to see GVEA take steps “soon,” but she would not elaborate. 
“It is not our role to specify to GVEA as to its generation and power supply portfolio,” Riedel said. “What we need from our provider is electricity that is reliable, low cost and the least environmental impact possible. It is up to the provider to determine how to get there.” 
GVEA communicates closely with Kinross and Northern Star about their emissions reduction targets, Bradish said.
Losing them as customers “absolutely would have an impact on our membership,” she added. “It’s something that is definitely thought about when we’re moving forward.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz’s administration wants to eliminate a program that allows low-income parents to take out loans from nonprofit organizations for tutoring services, using their tax refunds as collateral.
The proposal comes after the Reformer and Sahan Journal reported on mothers losing thousands of dollars from their tax refunds to pay debts to Success Tutoring and Achievers Tutoring for instruction they say their kids barely used and didn’t benefit from.
The mothers say they were told the tutoring was free and would help their kids recover from pandemic learning loss. Instead, they were outraged to discover their tax refunds had been transferred to a nonprofit organization, which in turn paid the companies for online tutoring with overseas instructors the kids couldn’t understand.
The Reformer interviewed three instructors based in the Philippines, one of whom said she was paid less than $5 an hour to supervise mostly Somali-American students as they worked through online modules in reading and math.
The loan program was intended to help more low-income families take advantage of the K-12 Education Tax Credit, which reimburses families earning less than about $80,000 for three-quarters of their eligible educational expenses, up to $1,500 per child per year. Most eligible families can’t afford to spend thousands of dollars up front and wait to be repaid when they get their tax refund the next year.
But it also made low-income households vulnerable to losing money if they didn’t submit the correct paperwork or the tutoring services they received were later deemed ineligible by the Department of Revenue. In those cases, the tax credit wouldn’t be awarded — but the loan to the nonprofit would still be repaid directly from the Department of Revenue through the rest of their refund, including money from Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit.
Families interviewed by the Reformer tried to recover the money missing from their refunds but found themselves trapped in a Kafkaesque maze, carrying stacks of different colored papers to the nonprofit lender, Minnesota Afterschool Advance, the state Department of Revenue, the Attorney General’s Office and, finally, to the press.
“The benefits of receiving the credit early are diminished by the potential confusion for the taxpayer when it is time to file their tax return,” the Walz administration wrote in its budget proposal.
The Walz administration also noted that less than 1% of eligible taxpayers who claimed the credit used a lender to advance them the funds, making it harder to justify the resources needed to oversee financial compliance and preapprove tutoring providers.
That tax credit won’t go away under the governor’s proposal, but nonprofits and financial institutions will no longer be able to loan families money for tutoring, computers and books to be repaid by their tax refunds.
Both Democrats and Republicans have introduced a slew of proposals aimed at clamping down on a crisis of fraud in state government, with hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly siphoned away from programs supposed to fund child nutrition, autism services, transportation and interpretation assistance.
Minnesota Afterschool Advance, the organization that loaned the families money to pay for tutoring, said it’s not issuing new loans in 2025 as they are “focused on systems change.”
“MAA is aware of the governor’s proposal. While we are not opposing it, MAA remains committed to working with government stakeholders to improve access to the Minnesota K-12 Education Tax Credit,” spokeswoman Lynne Matthews wrote in an email to the Reformer.
Minnesota Afterschool Advance, which is a collaboration between Youthprise and Venn Foundation, was founded by Rep. Matt Norris, DFL-Blaine. Norris helped grow the program to $1.8 million in funding for educational programs in 2022, according to his campaign website.
Norris, who left Minnesota Afterschool Advance when he entered the Legislature in 2023, said last year he was unaware of the mothers’ complaints — and debt.
Norris declined to comment on the governor’s proposal through a spokesperson.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250425_0411-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 09:08:33.796125

Let’s dive into some immigration news:

Proposed detention center?: As President Donald Trump and his administration continue to crack down on immigration, the federal government is eyeing opportunities to dramatically expand the number of immigration detention centers. Federal officials in April started eyeing Fairfield’s Travis Air Force Base as a possible site, according to KQED. The base is one of at least 10 other military bases in the U.S. under consideration. A month earlier, demonstrators rallied at the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin after internal emails revealed that the Trump administration was considering the now-shuttered prison for women as another possible detention facility.


A lack of proper care: The California Department of Justice released a 165-page report Tuesday detailing the conditions of the state’s six, privately-operated active immigration facilities, writes CalMatters’ Wendy Fry. State investigators found that the sites had “deficiencies in suicide prevention and intervention strategies,” staffing shortages and a lack of coordination between medical and mental health care providers. The conditions, such as solitary confinement, can exacerbate mental health issues that many detainees already have, including anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The report also found that more than 3,100 people were held in immigration detention centers as of April 16 — up from the daily average of about 1,750 in 2021. About 75% of those detained had no documented criminal history. Read more here.


Temporary order on Border Patrol: Wendy and CalMatters’ Sergio Olmos also report that a California judge has temporarily barred Border Patrol agents from making immigration stops unless they have a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the U.S. illegally. The injunction also prohibits agents from carrying out warrantless arrests unless they have probable cause that the person is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. The order stems from a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the United Farm Workers, after Border Patrol agents in January conducted a three-day sweep in Kern County. A CalMatters investigation revealed that agents had no criminal or immigration history on 77 of the 78 people it arrested from the sweep. Read more here.

A ‘reading wars’ compromise

On Wednesday state lawmakers reworked a bill that now seeks to provide funding for phonics-based instruction in K-12 classrooms without requiring schools or teachers to implement it.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, the measure’s new language signals a compromise between two camps of educators who argue that reading programs should either emphasize phonics, or the sounding-out of words; or sight reading, which focuses on memorizing words by sight.
The measure would require the state to provide training for teachers and instructional materials on the phonics reading approach. Because English learner advocates have criticized the phonics method for being too confusing for students who are not English proficient, the bill also requires materials and training to address the specific needs of English learners. (About 18% of California’s K-12 students, or 5.8 million, are English learners.)
The bill replaces another proposal, which died last week, that would have required schools to use the phonics-based approach.

Two chairpersons get ‘rolled’

A Senate bill that would boost housing development near public transportation hubs has advanced through two Senate committees — despite strong objections from both leaders of the committees, writes CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.
The rather unusual development could indicate a “philosophical split” among Democrats related to the state’s approach to building more housing, said longtime California lobbyist Chris Micheli. 
In one corner are the Democrats, including bill author Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, who want housing to be easier, quicker and cheaper to build. In the other are Democrats who do not oppose more housing, but are concerned with issues related to private development, regulation and affordability. This group includes the two chairpersons of the Senate’s housing and local government committees, Sens. Aisha Wahab of Fremont and María Elena Durazo of Los Angeles, respectively.
Wiener, however, disagrees that there may be a deep rift within the party when it comes to housing.

Wiener: “You have two chairs who have just a different perspective and that’s normal and, you know, I appreciate that we’ve been able to go through this process very respectfully. We’re all grown ups.”

Extreme temperatures pose a health risk on both ends of the spectrum as increasingly hot days can contribute to heat stroke and worsening seasonal allergies, while the bitter cold can aggravate respiratory health issues and cause hypothermia.
The post How higher temperatures and more pollen are affecting the health of Boston residents appeared first on Comm[...]","IN HER 20 YEARS of practicing medicine in Boston, Dr. Robyn Riseberg has seen symptoms of illnesses like asthma and seasonal allergies worsening, and she’s observed personally how the flu and RSV seasons seem to be getting longer. As a pediatrician and founder of Boston Community Pediatrics, Riseberg has seen patients through countless cold New England winters and hot summers, the Covid-19 pandemic, and various strains of common illnesses. “We’ve definitely seen an increase in respiratory infections,” Riseberg said. “The different flu strains have changed over the course of the last 20 years as well. And so we’ve had some seasons which have been much worse than others.” Experts say climate change exacerbates these trends. Extreme temperatures pose a health risk on both ends of the spectrum as increasingly hot days can contribute to heat stroke and worsening seasonal allergies, while the bitter cold can aggravate respiratory health issues and cause hypothermia. They also affect water and air quality, the latter of which can be negatively impacted by high temperature, airborne allergens and carbon emissions. As climate change intensifies, different communities will see different effects. “The impacts are highly localized,” says Greg Wellenius, director of Boston University’s Center for Health and Climate. Heat is the leading weather-related cause of death in the United States, and Boston, along with much of New England, had not been built to withstand it.  Since 1982, the Earth has been warming three times as fast per decade as it did between 1850 and the early 80s, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Massachusetts has seen temperatures increase by almost 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Even with efforts to reduce emissions, Boston will see the average number of days over 90 degrees rise from 10 days to 46 per year by the 2070s, city planners expect. Buildings and infrastructure were designed with the traditional New England climate in mind – very cold winters and moderate summers, but both are becoming more extreme. Most of Boston’s buildings were built before 1950 and the popularization of central air and heating, according to a 2019 report from the city. “We build our buildings in a way that they tend to trap heat because that was a good way to reduce the energy needed in order to survive the winter,” Wellenius said. “But now those same design features keep our houses probably too warm in the summer.” In Massachusetts, there have been about 700 emergency department visits for heat stress on average per year since 2000, according to state tracking data. While heat advisory warnings ask people to stay indoors, usually in an air-conditioned space, not having that option at home can create unsafe situations, especially for children and seniors, who are the most vulnerable to extreme heat.  Riseberg said doctors “really worry” about kids because “they need to be able to regulate their temperatures.”  “Children are at sort of a higher risk of climate related health concerns because they’re not like small adults, they’re different,” she said.  In 2022, Boston released a heat resilience plan to serve as a roadmap for how the city would address climate change and extreme heat as part of the Climate Ready Boston plan, which was first created in 2016. The “Heat Resilience Solutions for Boston” plan lays out a number of ways the city will try to tackle extreme heat, including by providing full-shade canopies to reduce surface level temperatures, improving public transportation for cooler commutes, enhancing the city’s green space and drinking fountain network, and planting more trees.  Chris Osgood, director of Boston’s Office of Climate Resilience, said that in addition to the plans outlined in Climate Ready Boston, the city has “expanded their toolkit” to address heat emergencies by having more shade structures at community centers and libraries.  “Last year, we installed a series of misting tents, misting coolers, and misting towers, ways that residents in the city can sort of cool off,” he said. The city’s heat website “posts all the cooling centers, places open to members of the public who may need a place to be able to keep cool during the hottest parts of the day.” Another way to address the heat and keep cities cooler is by planting more trees. Massachusetts’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs has identified the loss of the urban tree cover as a climate concern for the Boston Harbor area. The city has planted more than 4,000 trees over the past few years and is partnering with local organizations to provide grants to property owners to expand the tree canopy in their yards. “We are particularly focused on those areas of our city that are urban heat islands,” Osgood said. “The mayor has significantly expanded our work around tree and canopy cover.” As winter is getting shorter and summer is getting hotter, springtime is bringing worsening respiratory issues and air quality. A 2023 study published in eBioMedicine, a division of The Lancet, showed a connection between global warming, longer growing seasons, and more potent pollen. “That’s driven by changes in the average wintertime temperature and essentially, the number of months during which vegetation, primarily trees and grasses, are able to grow enough to generate the pollen,” Wellenius said.  Because of this, symptoms of seasonal and respiratory allergies, such as itchy eyes, asthma, and nasal congestion are getting worse, leading to more allergy-induced asthma attacks that result in hospitalizations.  Riseberg said she has started seeing patients earlier in the season about their seasonal allergies compared to the beginning of her career.  “It seems like the majority of them are getting worse,” she said. “All of the symptoms that we are used to seeing just seem to be a little bit more pronounced.”  Riseberg said the causes of asthma attacks can be “multifactorial” and are not only due to air quality. Poor housing conditions, mold exposure, air pollution, and even mice droppings can be contributing factors in asthma attacks.  In addition to fostering an increased pollen count, rising temperatures make it easier for air pollutants like ozone, which increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, to become trapped in the lower atmosphere. “We’ve made dramatic improvements as a country in reducing the levels of most air pollutants,” Wellenius said. “Recent gains are threatened because our average temperature increase creates conditions that are more favorable to pollutants.”  Air quality can vary between Boston neighborhoods. East Boston, for example, where Logan International Airport is and where 1-90 and I-93 intersect is a particular concern. “[They] breathe in the tailpipe emissions from airplanes every single day,” said Hessann Farqooi, executive director of the Boston Climate Action Network, a grassroots climate justice movement.  The Climate Ready Boston plan considers East Boston as a focus neighborhood for dealing with rising temperatures and excess heat, but it does not state how it will address air quality issues in the neighborhood.  “Climate change affects everyone, but not everyone is starting in the same place,” Farqooi said.  “The people who are hit first and worst by the effects of climate change are very often the people who have the least social, political, and economic power.” The post How higher temperatures and more pollen are affecting the health of Boston residents appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Transportation_Logan-Airport_Plane_Sunset-edited.png?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 09:08:33.796125

Here’s what happened next.","In summary
After reading a CalMatters article, two people were able to reconnect with their homeless relatives. Here’s what happened next. 


The last time Julie Crossman saw her little sister, Nanie Crossman, it was 2019 and Nanie was moving out of Julie’s San Francisco apartment, destination unknown. 
For the next six years, Julie worried — especially every time it rained. She assumed Nanie was homeless, but she had no idea where she was or how to find her. 
“I just couldn’t sleep at night because I was so scared,” Jule said, her voice breaking. “I was really scared that she was just, like, cold and alone.”
Then, in January, Julie got a text from her half-brother. It was a link to a CalMatters article about unhoused people voting. And it quoted Nanie.
That article launched Julie on a quest to find her long-lost sister, rekindle their relationship and — maybe — help her get off the street.
It’s estimated more than 187,000 Californians are homeless. But no one counts the number of people like Julie, who stay up late worrying, compulsively Googling their sister, father or child’s name for a clue to their whereabouts. The people who scan every face each time they pass a homeless encampment.
Their numbers are likely far greater. 
Some nonprofits that work in the homeless services sector say reconnecting with family is a crucial, and often overlooked, step in getting clients off the street. Even if a family member can’t offer up their guest room or couch, they might help their loved one find housing, access addiction treatment, sign up for benefits, or simply provide emotional support — reminding them that they are important and worthy of love. But the process of finding and reconnecting with someone living outside can be difficult, both logistically and emotionally, for everyone involved. 
Once the person is found, it opens up a new question: What, if anything, can be done to help? The answer is almost never simple. Despite a growing effort by homeless service providers to reunite clients with their families, there’s little data to show how often those reunifications end someone’s homelessness.  
And, as Julie found when she searched for guidance, few resources exist to help families navigate this terrain. 
“I haven’t found anything,” Julie said. “It’s frustrating because this whole thing is happenstance and coincidence and lucky breaks but there’s not really a road map that I can find of other people’s methods, or things they’ve done that have been helpful.”
Two sisters reunite
From the CalMatters article, Julie gleaned one important fact: Nanie was living in an RV parked on a West Oakland street. It felt like a lucky break – Julie had since moved to Oakland as well. She emailed the CalMatters reporter to find out more. 
Three weeks later, on a sunny Tuesday morning, she and the reporter stood outside a row of RVs on a trash-strewn side street next to a graffiti-covered warehouse wall. It had taken a few tries to get there. Police had forced Nanie to move from her prior parking spot a week and a half earlier, so Julie and the reporter walked up and down the nearby streets, asking other RV-dwellers if they knew her. 
Eventually, they found an RV that had Nanie’s name sketched near the door. Julie was scared. She worried Nanie wouldn’t want to talk to her after all these years.
They knocked — no answer. Nanie wasn’t in her RV. But they soon found her in the RV next door.
“Julie!” Nanie exclaimed, stepping outside. The sisters threw their arms around each other in a tight hug.
“What’s up, dude?” Nanie asked when they separated, as if it hadn’t been six years.
“Nothing is up,” Julie replied, beaming. The resemblance between the two sisters, now both in their 40s, was obvious: Matching dark hair, pale complexions and smiles.

Julie and Nanie immediately launched into a remarkably ordinary conversation, updating each other on their lives. They discovered they both have cats. Neither has a driver’s license. Nanie described what it was like being homeless in San Francisco during the COVID-19 pandemic (she liked having the streets to herself) and talked about the time she spent living in Sacramento. Julie wanted to know about the logistical details of her sister’s life: How do you get clothes? What about food?
They kept it light. They didn’t unpack old traumas or air past grievances. Julie didn’t ask Nanie if she was using drugs or badger her about getting a job and moving inside.
Later, Julie said it took some willpower to tamp down her protective, older-sister instincts. 
“I don’t want to judge her life where it’s just a fact of life. I just don’t think that’s a good way to approach it,” Julie said. “If it were me, I would just shut down. I would not want to talk to someone like that, who was asking me that kind of question.”
Julie presented Nanie with the offerings she brought: A few cans of sparkling water, wet wipes, socks and a fancy pen. She offered to do Nanie’s laundry.
“Nanie, I’m so glad to see you,” Julie said with a squeal, giving her sister another hug. “I feel like we’re just chit-chatting.”
‘It’s tougher than I even imagined’
Julie and Nanie were close as kids growing up in Boston’s Beacon Hill neighborhood. They invented games, such as using a Barbie boombox to record themselves reading children’s books in funny voices. As they got older, their conversations were so full of inside references that outsiders, including one of Julie’s former boyfriends, were left in the dark. 
Nanie told a CalMatters reporter that after she became homeless, she avoided trying to find Julie. She was afraid her sister would be mad at her or judgmental — or worse, that she’d died in an accident and Nanie hadn’t known. Seeing her again was a big relief.
“I feel a lot less all alone out here,” Nanie said.
Julie walked away from their meeting with mixed emotions. She was relieved that overall, Nanie seemed OK. The fears she had — that Nanie might have physically or mentally deteriorated due to drugs, or been forced to do sex work to survive — seemed unfounded. Nanie was safe from the elements in her RV and had a community of friends.

But the meeting also raised a big question: What could Julie do to help her sister?
Nanie says she wants a relationship, not help. In the past, after moving indoors, she became depressed. In her RV, within her street community, she feels like herself.
“For now,” Nanie said, “I’m content out here. And I guess what I want from her is to understand that.” 
Julie understands that as well as someone who hasn’t lived on the streets can — which is to say, not completely. She still wants to help, but she’s struggling with how. Part of her wants to open up her home so Nanie can shower, do laundry and hang out, while another part of her thinks she should instead set boundaries.
And then she feels guilty for even considering keeping her sister at a distance. 
“It’s tougher than I even imagined it would be,” Julie said. 
Does reconnecting with family help?
Programs throughout the state offer bus tickets out of town to unhoused people trying to reunite with family or friends. That can result in people simply becoming homeless again in a new location. But proponents say that if done with the proper support, sending someone back into the arms of loved ones can be a lifesaver. 
“We heal in community,” said Gabby Cordell, who runs the reunification program at the San Francisco-based nonprofit Miracle Messages. “We’re not meant to go through life alone. And everyone matters. Everyone is someone’s somebody.”
Using Google, social media and anything else they can think of, Miracle Messages helps unhoused clients find their mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, or anyone else they are looking for.
The organization receives about 50 referrals a month — mostly for cases within California, Cordell said. She and her team are able to find and get a hold of the person they’re looking for about half of the time. Sometimes, the family member is thrilled.
“It’s astounding how often we get an, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve been looking for him,’” she said.
Other times, the relationship has been badly damaged, and the family member isn’t interested in reconnecting. 
The group also offers the reverse, helping people who are housed find loved ones living on the street. That’s much harder, Cordell said. 
“Trying to find your brother is looking for a needle in a haystack,” she said. “Trying to find your brother who is unhoused is looking for a moving needle in 10 haystacks.”
The nonprofit has succeeded in arranging more than 115 of these more difficult reunions since around 2017, according to its website.
Nonprofit LifeMoves also offers reunification services across 17 of its homeless shelter and temporary housing sites in Silicon Valley. Only a small percentage of clients leave homelessness that way (the nonprofit doesn’t track exactly how many), said Heather Griffin, director of shelter and services for Santa Clara County. 
It’s impossible to know how successful these efforts are. Neither LifeMoves nor Miracle Messages tracks what happens to people after they reunite with family. 
‘That was hard:’ Another family reconnects after decades on the street
Ashanti Terrell lived a lot of her life without her father, Ashby Dancy. 
He was on and off the streets of Oakland for most of her childhood, while she grew up in and out of foster care and then with her mother’s family. She lost touch with him as the years passed and she earned a master’s degree, launched a career in public safety and had three children of her own in Atlanta. 
But as she got older, she felt a void. Her mother had died and her father was all she had left. 
“When I was 18 years old, (I) graduated, I had nobody to go to my graduation,” Terrell said. “I wanted my dad to at least be at my graduation. I haven’t gotten married because I wanted my dad to be there, you know. I haven’t done a lot of stuff because I wanted my dad.”
Terrell had glimpses of her father over the years. Two years ago, he landed in subsidized housing in Oakland and she went to visit him. But he didn’t know who she was, she said. Whether that was because of drug use, mental illness or both, she wasn’t sure. 
Last fall, Terrell got a call from a social worker. The social worker said her father was trying to get to Atlanta to see her, but got stuck in Texas and ended up in a hospital. Terrell started planning with her sister to help him. But when she called the hospital again, he was already gone. No one knew where. 
She decided to pack up her life in Georgia, move to the Bay Area, and find him.
Then, while Googling her father’s name, Terrell saw him quoted in an October CalMatters article — coincidentally, the same article that helped reunite Julie and Nanie Crossman. The article said he was at a tent encampment in East Oakland.

Terrell went looking. She drove around the area at different times of day, hoping to catch a glimpse of her father. She asked the workers at a nearby Burger King if they’d seen him. 
In March, Terrell emailed the CalMatters reporter for help. The reporter showed her where to find her father’s tarp-covered tent, sitting by itself on the sidewalk. 
After that, Terrell started visiting her father, stopping by to check on him, talk and give him food. 
On a recent Friday afternoon, she brought her 7-year-old son, Mekhi. Dancy gave the boy a fistbump and asked about his school, and about the family’s upcoming move to Oakland’s Temescal neighborhood. But then he started talking about the 22 kids he’d had with his ex-girlfriend (something Terrell is positive didn’t happen). He mumbled, making it hard for her to understand him. 
Mekhi asked his mom if they could buy Grandpa some Burger King, and she said yes, promising to come back with a burger after they picked the other kids up from school. 
“I just wanted to let you know that I’m here,” Terrell told her father, as they left. “As soon as I get myself together, I’m going to help you out.”
“I love you, sweetheart,” he said. And then to Mekhi: “Take care of your mom, OK?”
Terrell teared up as she and Mekhi walked away from her father’s tent. “That was hard,” she said.
He had admitted he was drunk, which disappointed her. Just like today’s Oakland — with its massive homeless encampment along East 12th Street — is unrecognizable as the city she grew up in, the man she just talked to is not the father who raised her. The father she remembers won trophies for boxing. He was a “big kid,” a gentle soul who ran around and played with her and her two sisters, did their hair in cute braids and took them camping.
“I don’t know who he is,” she said of the man in the tent. “I come from him, but I don’t know him.”

The last real memory Terrell has of her father is from July 1998, at the same Burger King across the street from her father’s tent. It was Terrell’s 8th birthday. She was in foster care, but was visiting with her parents at the fast food chain — her favorite — to celebrate. 
She moved with her mother to Chicago and then Atlanta shortly after, and lost touch with her father, who stayed behind in Oakland.
Now, Terrell wants to repair their relationship. She wants him to get to know his grandchildren, and she wants to take him to visit his 86-year-old mother in Stockton. 
She also wants to save him, before it’s too late. He’s 63, and Terrell is scared that if he stays outside, he’ll fall victim to fentanyl, or one of the many other dangers of the street.
Terrell imagines helping her father will involve rehab and an assessment of his mental state — if he’s willing. She wants to figure out why he lost his subsidized housing, and if he can get it back. But she’s not sure where to start.
“Maybe 20 years might be too late,” she said. “I don’t know.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/040825_Reunification_FM_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 09:08:33.796125

The $250 million, which would fund about 500 electric trucks serving the ports of LA and Long Beach, remains frozen as a legal dispute plays out between the EPA, a bank and a green energy group.


The Trump administration has frozen $250 million in grants to a nonprofit helping companies replace diesel trucks at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, part of a broad federal effort to claw back $20 billion in green energy funding.
The program by Climate United, announced last October, would offer affordable leases for new electric heavy-duty trucks operated by small fleets and individual truckers serving the ports.
Communities near the ports, including Wilmington, San Pedro and Long Beach, have been battling for years to clean up noxious fumes that waft into their neighborhoods from the long lines of trucks carrying cargo to and from the massive ports.
The freezing of the funds comes after California had to abandon a regulation that phased out diesel trucks because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump wouldn’t approve it. 
The grant, which would have funded about 500 electric trucks, remains frozen by Citibank, which holds the funds, as a legal dispute plays out between the EPA, the bank and Climate United, a nonprofit based in Maryland.
“We don’t have any money at all, not even operational money,” Climate United spokesperson Brooke Durham told CalMatters in an interview. “We are having to raise philanthropic grants to be able to cover operational expenses and payroll…. and then all of the projects are in limbo.”
The EPA had threatened to terminate the contracts, and climate groups sued over not being able to access the money when it was frozen. The groups argued that the EPA and the bank were illegally withholding the money because Congress had appropriated it through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. A federal judge ordered Citibank to pay some of the funds, but then an appeals court blocked that decision as the case continues.
In a March announcement, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin accused the $20 billion federal green energy grant program of “misconduct, conflicts of interest, and potential fraud…I have taken action to terminate these grants riddled with self-dealing and wasteful spending.” The agency, however, has not produced evidence of those claims.
Zeldin has repeatedly referenced a video by Project Veritas, a conservative group known for recording undercover videos, which secretly filmed a man it said was an EPA employee under the Biden administration saying the agency was “throwing gold bars off the Titanic,” meaning it was seeking to disburse funds after Donald Trump was elected but hadn’t taken office yet. 
Known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund but also called the “green bank,” the grants are awarded to nonprofits, banks and other groups. The $20 billion was awarded for a variety of projects nationwide.
Climate United representatives said Zeldin’s accusations don’t apply to their programs; the money was allocated before Trump was elected.
Climate United had launched other programs nationwide in addition to the California electric trucks program, according to the lawsuit. The EPA also froze its grants for $31.8 million in loans for solar power projects in rural communities in Arkansas and $63 million for solar power plant projects in partnership with tribal governments and communities. Its initial tribal and community solar projects were supposed to be located in Eastern Oregon and Idaho, according to the suit.
In addition, $30 million to help communities plan projects that “improved energy independence, cut pollution and lower costs” was frozen. Climate United had awarded $6.35 million to 22 projects in 18 states, focusing on tribal communities.When asked about the freezing of the funds for the port trucks, the EPA press office told CalMatters in an email that it “was not a party to grant agreements with subrecipients within the Biden-Harris ‘Gold Bar’ scheme, so we wouldn’t have that information.”
The freezing of the money has meant that the electric truck program cannot move forward at the nation’s busiest port complex. The investment was seen as a significant step toward electrifying California’s diesel trucks, which are among the biggest sources of air pollution in the LA basin.
The grants were intended to help small operators purchase cleaner vehicles in an industry that operates on a “razor thin profit model,” said Matt Schrap, chief executive of the Harbor Trucking Association.
Many small operators can’t afford electric trucks. An electric big rig can cost $400,000, compared to less than half that for a new diesel truck. What’s more, it’s often too difficult for small operators to get them financed, as they are a relatively new technology. Because there is currently no used market for them, banks have trouble assessing their value.
Residents of port communities have long complained of health effects, including asthma and headaches, from diesel trucks, which emit large quantities of soot and other pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses.Cleaning up diesel exhaust “is a literal case of life and death for a lot of our community members and our loved ones,” Paola Vargas, a Carson resident and organizer with nonprofit East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice, told CalMatters in December. “Every day matters. Every day we don’t have (truck emissions) rules…is a day wasted and a day of harmful impacts for us.”

Finding a homeless loved one can be difficult. So can helping them once you’ve found them. Here are some tips from people who’ve been there.


If you’ve lost touch with a loved one and suspect they are living on the street, in their car or in shelters, it can be difficult to find them again. Once you’ve found them (or if you never lost touch) it can be just as hard to figure out how to help. CalMatters has compiled some tips from people who have been through that process, or have helped others through it.
How to find a homeless loved one

File a missing persons report, suggested Gabby Cordell, director of reunion services for the San Francisco-based nonprofit Miracle Messages. That way, every time the missing person has contact with law enforcement or enters a hospital, that report should come up, she said. The officer or hospital may tell the person that their family is looking for them. In some cases, the facility may even reach out to whoever filed the report.Families also can submit their case to Miracle Messages for help at miraclemessages.org/findthem.
Turn to social media. Robin Wells Plantz created the Missing & Homeless Facebook group 10 years ago to help reconnect families. She posts the stories of missing people, complete with photos and identifying details, in the hope that someone will see it and recognize the person. The page now has more than 100,000 followers, and Plantz has lost count of how many dozens of people it has helped reunite. She invites anyone searching for a homeless loved one to send a message to her via that group.She also encourages people to create a new Facebook page dedicated to finding their loved one, and share it as widely as possible. That way, anyone with a tip can send it to that page.
Hire a private investigator.
Try Googling, just in case your loved one was photographed or quoted in a news article about homelessness.
Talk to street outreach workers. Homeless shelters, soup kitchens and other facilities (especially medical facilities) probably won’t tell you if they’ve seen your loved one, in an effort to protect their privacy, Plantz said. You’ll have better luck asking the people who go to encampments and hand out food and other necessities, she said. Make fliers with your loved one’s photo and hand them out to as many outreach workers as you can, she advised. 
Don’t focus on their name. Many unhoused people go by a street name, or multiple street names, that are different from the name you know. When asking about your loved one, show photos instead, Plantz suggested. 
Be careful about sharing your phone number. Don’t put your phone number on a flier or Facebook page that will be widely distributed — that can lead to harassment and other problems, Plantz cautioned. Instead, direct people to Facebook or other places to report tips.
Don’t give up. Cordell remembers one case where she reconnected a man with his family after 40 years. In another case, a woman in Southern California was getting ready to hold a memorial for her sister, when the sister turned up on a street corner in San Francisco.“That’s the biggest thing: Don’t give up,” said Plantz, who has been searching for her mother for 30 years. “Would you want somebody to give up on you?”

How to help a homeless loved one

“Be patient. Manage expectations,” Cordell said. Don’t assume that you will be able to solve your loved one’s homelessness quickly or easily. “A lot happens for someone to typically end up in the situation they’re in, which means we can’t expect an immediate solution or an immediate fix,” said Heather Griffin, director of shelter and services for Silicon Valley-based nonprofit LifeMoves.
Allow time to repair the relationship. It will take time for both sides to heal emotionally, Griffin said. 
Ask questions. “I wouldn’t try to tell them to do anything,” said Deborah O’Dell, who runs a support group for the families of people with mental illnesses in Los Angeles County, which includes multiple participants who have a homeless loved one. “Just ask: ‘Hey, what’s your day like? What’s going on? What are you doing?’ And just listen. Don’t be judgmental. Just be an ear and listen. And then ask, ‘Is there anything that I can do to help?’ If there’s not, don’t try to do anything. Because you’ll just push them away from you.”
Touch them. “Be willing to give them a hug,” O’Dell said. “Just show them unconditional love.”
Call to check in. When O’Dell’s adult son was living in his truck, she called him every other day to make sure he had food, blankets and other necessities. If he needed something, she put money in his bank account. 
You can still help, even if your loved one doesn’t want to or isn’t ready to come inside – or if you aren’t ready to invite them into your home. You might be able to help them with other needs, such as accessing health care, searching for jobs or signing up for social services, Griffin said. 
Provide an address. It’s often difficult for unhoused people to receive money from Social Security and other benefits because they don’t have a fixed address. Consider letting them use your address to get checks and other important mail. You could also offer to keep their birth certificate and other identification safe, until they need it to apply for housing or other services. 
Create boundaries and stick to them if you invite your loved one into your home, O’Dell said. That could mean, for example, requiring that your loved one go to therapy once a month, or prohibiting drugs in your home. 
Understand that sometimes, you won’t be able to get your loved one off the streets – at least not yet. “Sometimes, you’ve got to love them where they’re at,” Plantz said. “And that’s the hardest. That’s the hardest of it all, is loving them where they’re at.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/041825_Reunification_JK_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 09:08:33.796125
,California,2025-05-01 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,‘We’re here every day’: Inside the painstaking effort to heal LA’s troubled MacArthur Park,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/inside-effort-heal-macarthur-park/,"As many as 10 nonprofit organizations are working to resuscitate MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, cleaning streets, treating drug overdoses and calming gang tensions, among other things.","On a recent morning, Terry Bates approached a chain-link fence across from MacArthur Park as the Los Angeles neighborhood slowly came to life. His crew, Team 21, was responsible for cleaning the sidewalk and curb line along Alvarado Street, between Wilshire Boulevard and 6th Street.
Bates unlocked a padlock that tied two fences together, erected in January to keep out illegal vendors. Several workers, all employed by Chrysalis, a nonprofit under contract with the city, followed him inside.
They scooped up trash, scraped up debris and swept up patches of vomit. Everything went into bags. Fifteen minutes later, the stretch of muck had given way to a clean sidewalk. Team 21 moved on.
Bates, who grew up nearby and has been servicing the park since early this year, snapped a picture of the sidewalk before his team arrived, and another after they finished. 
“That’s our work,” he said. “Every day.”
Back from the curb, away from the street, merchants opened up their shops, nodding appreciatively to the clean sidewalk in front. 
“The businesses,” Bates noted, “love us for sure.”
This is civic reclamation in action. It is painstaking rather than revolutionary, methodical rather than abrupt. 
And it is a test of at least two important questions: Can Los Angeles, by devoting time and attention to the long-suffering area around historic MacArthur Park, actually make a difference for those who live and work there, those who have despaired as the park has become a magnet for drugs, gangs and crime? And, perhaps more importantly, even if the city can effect that change, can it make it last? 
Chrysalis, an organization that employs people who are or have recently experienced homelessness, is 1 of 10 nonprofits working to resuscitate the park and surrounding neighborhoods. Under contracts with the city and county, these groups are cleaning streets, intervening during drug overdoses, calming gang tensions and treating wounds, among other things. 
Together, they represent a kind of strike force, swarming the community with assistance on the theory that reviving the area starts with stabilizing it after a long descent.
Nonprofits tasked with healing the park 
MacArthur Park once was a source of civic pride in Los Angeles, home to fancy hotels and swanky residences. Its playgrounds were full. Its bandshell was a desirable place to gather for musical performances. But that was a long time ago.
In recent years, the park has slid from attraction to nuisance. By last year, the park was home to scores of unhoused people, and its periphery had become a bustling market for drugs, available to anyone with the desire to approach a street vendor and put up cash for meth or opioids. Drugs and desperation drew the interest of gangs, which used the park to fence stolen goods and sell drugs. Violent crime followed. Neighbors and businesses cowered in fear or fled the area.

It was the crime that drew the city’s attention, and in early 2025, the city leadership sent in the Los Angeles Police Department. Foot patrols are seemingly constant. Police cars regularly stop at entrances, as officers fan out to check for drugs or other illicit activity. Serious crimes — homicides, assaults, robberies — have fallen as the police have made their presence known.

But a neighborhood is more than the sum of its crimes. And law enforcement can only do so much to construct and sustain community life.
That’s where the nonprofits come in.
Led by City Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, local community groups have been tapped to handle many of the park’s most critical needs. Homies Unidos and Healing Urban Barrios connect with gangs in the area, easing tensions when there is violence or the threat of it. The L.A. Care MacArthur Park Care Collaborative and Field Medicine Program provides so-called wraparound care to the homeless people in the area. An overdose response team from Homeless Health Care Los Angeles roams the park during the day looking for signs of people experiencing a drug crisis. 
Opioids are what rivets their attention. When meth users take too much, they get frantic and can be alarming. When the drug is an opioid, however, the user can quietly slump away, breath ebbing, heart slowing, until they simply die. The mobile units are attuned to the sight of slumping bodies and have intervened in some 60 cases since launching late last year.
“The work these groups are doing on the ground is part of a bigger movement we’re leading to end the cycle of neglect and disinvestment at MacArthur Park,” said Naomi Villagomez Roochnik, deputy director of communications for the council member. “Since 2023, we’ve brought over $25 million in new funding into the park and the Westlake neighborhood.”
Life in the park reflects the combined efforts of all these organizations. Men and women in yellow vests snap up trash and pick their way through pockets of older men lolling under the influence and younger men keeping an eye out for the police.
The groups keep eyes on each other, and residents thread their way through them. One morning last week, a father walked his son to a bus stop, the boy holding on tight to his dad’s hand as they picked through the morning rush. The boy smiled at the Chrysalis team, which waved back. Nearby, a young woman with threadbare clothes and a face smudged with dirt slowly wheeled through an intersection in her wheelchair.
Jessica L., who declined to share her last name, said she’d been living on the streets near the park for about three months, since her husband died of a heart attack and she could no longer afford her rent. A native of New York, she said incidents in the park were common but were under better control in recent weeks.
“They keep it pretty neat,” she said of the cleanup crews.

It’s a difficult job, and there have been unwelcome surprises. When police initially swarmed to disrupt the illegal vending, it drove down violent crime but also produced a brief uptick in overdoses. Buyers were forced to find new dealers, and the new batches of drugs were sometimes of different potencies. 
“Substance supply wasn’t consistent,” said Aurora Morales, associate director of community initiatives for Homeless Health Care L.A.
As the effort unfolds, many people involved are learning as they go.
For the neighborhood, this influx of help is a welcome relief, visible in the greetings of store owners and parents walking children to the bus stop. But it’s not the ultimate measure of success. 
Lasting change will come when the nonprofits and the police are not needed, at least at this intensity. It will be recognizable when the playgrounds return to life, when the streets are clean without fences, when Bates and Team 21 don’t need to arrive before shops open to make their rounds.

Until then, “we’re here every day,” Bates said. And we’re making progress. You can see,” he continued, pointing to the area his crew had just finished, “the guys do a really good job.”
He locked up the fence again, and the crew moved on.

(Courtesy of Marcella Patino)Marcella Patino, 34, knows the difficulties of navigating work requirements. 
Patino, who works full time as a nail technician and esthetician at a salon in Holladay, is a single mother of three. She relies on financial assistance for child care — $600 a month for day care — so she can keep working full time, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits — around $400 a month — to keep food on the table for her family. 
To receive that financial assistance, she and her employer must already prove to state officials that she’s working. Lately, Patino said it’s been easier to produce the required documentation and jump through the administrative hoops. But she said that’s only because her employer keeps track of her hours and willingly validates them with the government. 
That hasn’t always been the case, she said. 
“It was a huge issue,” she said, adding that “in the past, it was really hard” because her previous employers did not log her hours on her paychecks. She said she’d been cut off from those benefits multiple times because her previous bosses wouldn’t fill out the required paperwork or would drag their feet to prove she indeed worked the required hours.

Luckily, she said now her current employer cooperates. So balancing her job, taking care of kids and making ends meet has been easier than it has been in the past, but Patino said the work requirements still add “constant” stress and uncertainty to daily life. 
“I still worry about my hours,” she said.
Child care assistance and SNAP benefits already have work requirements. But there’s another crucial program for low-income Utahns that state officials are looking to re-impose that requirement on — after more than five years of it being suspended amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
And it could put thousands of Utahns at risk of losing their medical coverage. 
Utah is the next state in a national movement looking to impose work requirements on certain Medicaid recipients under a Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump. 
Leaders of the Utah Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intend to submit for a new federal waiver to re-implement work requirements on the state’s Medicaid expansion program, with a list of allowable exemptions. That list excludes those working at least 30 hours a week, those who are 60 or older, pregnant, physically or mentally unable to meet the requirements, parents with a child dependent under the age of 6, among others. 
Currently, about 75,000 adult Utahns are enrolled in the state’s expansion program, which allows Medicaid eligibility to Utahns whose annual income is up to 133% of the federal poverty level (roughly $20,800 for an individual or $42,760 for a family of four, according to national thresholds). The federal government covers $90% of the cost of the medical coverage, while the state pays for the remaining 10%. 
Of those 75,000 adults enrolled, an estimated 7,900 (or 10%) would not fall under an exemption and be subject to work requirements if the state submits the waiver and it’s approved by federal officials under President Donald Trump’s administration, according to state Medicaid officials. 
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

That means 7,900 Utahns — if they don’t start working or submit documentation showing they’re applying for at least 48 jobs during a three-month period, along with completing required online job training with the state — could lose their Medicaid coverage. 
That’s according to Jennifer Strohecker, the state’s Medicaid director, who this week confirmed to Utah News Dispatch that leaders of DHHS intend to re-submit the work requirement waiver to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) “sometime in June.” 
But first, state officials must hold a 30-day public comment period to field input on the proposed waiver. Friday, the DHHS will be holding the first of two public hearings. It’s scheduled to take place at 12:30 p.m., at the Multi-Agency State Office Building, at 195 N. 1950 West in Salt Lake City. The state will also be offering a virtual option to join the meeting. 
“I can say now the intent is to submit (the waiver), but we will evaluate all the public comments that we receive … and take that into consideration as we evaluate the proposal that’s been drafted and consider what the next steps are,” Strohecker said. “But at this point, yes, the intent is to submit the waiver.” 
‘Inefficiency and cruelty,’ advocates say of work requirements
Low-income, disability and health advocates are sounding alarms about state officials’ decision to pursue that work requirement again, raising concerns that it will impose administrative burdens on an already vulnerable population of Utahns and will inevitably result in loss of medical benefits for many. 
“It’s forcing red tape upon people that will ultimately just act like scissors because it’s going to cut so much coverage,” said Stephanie Burdick, consumer representative on the state’s Medical Care Advisory Committee. 
Evan Done, advocacy and public policy director for USARA, a nonprofit serving Utahns recovering from the effects of substance use disorders, said implementing the work requirements would be a cut to Medicaid, plain and simple.

– Stephanie Burdick, consumer representative on the state’s Medical Care Advisory Committee


“A cut by any other name is still a cut,” Done said. “Medicaid serves as a vital lifeline for many Utahns. Evidence shows work requirements often cause people to lose healthcare coverage due to the administrative complexity of navigating the system, rather than an unwillingness to work. Utah’s attempt to implement a work requirement for Medicaid beneficiaries aims to save money by cutting otherwise deserving recipients from care.” 
Nate Crippes with the Disability Law Center, an organization that advocates for Utahns with disabilities, also described the proposed work requirement as “nothing more than a cut to (Medicaid) services.” 
“While the state has exempted people with disabilities, we know the paperwork required will also lead to numerous individuals with disabilities, especially those with mental illness, being kicked off of Medicaid,” Crippes said. “We are working hard to oppose cuts at the federal level, and we would encourage our state leaders to rescind this proposal and help us ensure that Medicaid is protected.”
Of the 75,000 enrolled in Utah’s Medicaid expansion program, 22,000 were homeless last year, according to DHHS estimates, and many have substance use or mental health conditions that they receive treatment for, Burdick said. 
Burdick acknowledged that yes, 90% of Utahns enrolled in the state’s Medicaid expansion program would be exempt, “but how they prove that they’re exempt is where it becomes an administrative burden.” 
Bill Tibbitts, deputy executive director of the Crossroads Urban Center, an advocacy group for low-income Utahns, encouraged state leaders to instead create a voluntary program to help people working low-wage jobs without healthcare benefits to get better jobs.

“People who are homeless and working out of their car do not need extra negative incentives to want to find a better job,” Tibbitts said. “Threatening to take away people’s healthcare if they do not do a bunch of busywork is not really helpful – especially if most of the 48 jobs people are being forced to apply for do not have better pay or provide health insurance benefits.”
Burdick urged state leaders to take a different route, not resort to requirements that will only create a “vicious cycle of inefficiency and cruelty.” 
“(These people) deserve to be treated with dignity,” she said. “They don’t deserve to be stacked with paperwork that could lead to them losing coverage and potentially losing their life or having severely more negative health outcomes.” 
Strohecker stressed that Utah’s yet-to-be filed waiver is not yet final, and state officials welcome feedback. 
“This is a proposal. It can be modified, we can make adjustments based on the feedback that we get,” she said.

Addressing advocates’ concerns, Strohecker said “there’s also opportunities to build good supports that will help people actually connect to training or education or even employment services. And what do those support services look like?”
Strohecker also pointed out some details that differentiate Utah’s proposed waiver. She noted that previously, if a person did not fulfill requirements for Medicaid coverage within the first three months, their coverage would be terminated.
“But in this iteration we’re actually suspending coverage, giving them additional opportunity to fulfill those requirements for an additional three months,” she said. 
Strohecker also said in their proposal, state officials have “built in something that we’re calling member supports, and that’s to be defined as we work with CMS and work with our partners to really consider what are the opportunities that we have to really connect a person to job training to employment opportunities, to really fulfill some of the community engagement requirements that are outlined, and how do we support the individual along that pathway of compliance?”
That’s a “key piece that would be really helpful,” Strohecker said, to have partnership with our advocates and community stakeholders to really envision the array of services that we could build to assist the person in fulfilling community engagement and actually truly getting connected to job training, employment supports … that we could actually help facilitate that in a meaningful way.” 
Why is Utah looking to re-impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion?
Strohecker said there’s important historical context that precedes state agency leaders’ decision to resubmit the waiver. 
After Utah voters approved Medicaid expansion by a ballot initiative in 2018, the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature was forced to act. In 2019, the Utah Legislature passed legislation to implement the state’s Medicaid expansion program. Strohecker pointed to that law, which requires state officials to apply to CMS for a waiver that, among other provisions, includes “a path to self-sufficiency, including work activities” as defined by federal law. 
In 2020, state officials included a work requirement in their waiver request, and after it was approved by CMS (at the time under Trump’s first administration) that requirement went into effect January that year. However, it only lasted a few months, because by April 2020 it was suspended amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Then, in 2021, when Utah’s waiver was up for renewal, former President Joe Biden’s administration required the state to remove that work requirement.

Now, with Trump back in the White House and a new administration that’s likely to approve a waiver that includes a work requirement, Utah officials have decided to resubmit it.  
“There is historic precedent to this, but also as we consider what’s happening on the federal side of things today, it is our intent to align our program with our current federal initiatives and priorities,” Strohecker said. “Certainly mandated work requirements are considered a top item by Congress as far as looking at the budget reconciliation package. And I think our intent was to align with sort of our past approved waiver, and this administration’s current initiatives.” 
Pressed on who specifically made the decision to include the work requirement in the new waiver application, Strohecker said leaders of Utah Department of Health and Human Services ultimately made the decision, but that they also did so based on talks with legislators and Gov. Spencer Cox’s office. 
“It’s actually a decision by the department to take this step,” she said. “It was definitely done in consultation with the governor’s office and lawmakers. But I would say it was a decision by the department.” 
Advocates say Utah doesn’t need to pursue a new waiver — and shouldn’t
Burdick argues Utah’s Medicaid statute does not explicitly require state officials to submit the waiver again years after it was pulled back. She also contends it’s not needed, pointing out Utah’s Medicaid expansion fund “has gotten quite large,” with more than $300 million available to use. 
“It’s not like they’re running out of money,” she said. “There’s definitely people who are eligible and not enrolled in Medicaid expansion right now. … We have a bunch of money, and yet we’re going to implement a work requirement?” 
Utah is just the latest state to pursue the work requirement under the new federal landscape. Republicans in Congress and several other states including Ohio, Iowa and Montana are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage people to find jobs and ultimately reduce their need for public assistance, the health policy outlet KFF Health News reported. But, the outlet also pointed out, few programs actually help enrollees find jobs. 
Under Trump, many states might pursue Medicaid work requirements

Last week, Paul Ray — who served as a Republican House lawmaker before resigning in 2021 and taking a position as director of legislative affairs for the DHHS — sent an email to lawmakers notifying them of the looming waiver request.
In that email, Ray said the state aims to implement the requirement (referred to as a “community engagement requirement”) to “increase an individual’s health and wellbeing through incentivizing work and community engagement; increase their sense of purpose; help build a healthy lifestyle; and increase employment and wage earnings of able-bodied adults while focusing funding on the state’s neediest individuals.” 
However, Burdick argued states like Arkansas that have tried work requirements for Medicaid have found they were burdensome, led to adverse effects on even working adults, and resulted in loss of coverage for thousands. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services also recently issued a report estimating the financial impact of implementing work requirements, which would result in an increase of up to $6 million a year for administrative costs and $60 million a year for employment and training services. 
Burdick said work requirements are actually less fiscally responsible — not more. 
“You’re wasting taxpayer dollars by not spending the expansion money,” she said. “Then you’re going to take more taxpayer dollars to deal with the administrative burden.” 
Asked about whether state officials have an estimated cost of what it would cost the state to implement its work requirements, Strohecker said given it’s still a proposal that has not yet been formalized, “we don’t have costs estimated.” 
In response to calls to implement an employment support program rather than hinging Medicaid coverage on a work requirement, Strohecker said state officials “want that feedback” during the public comment period that’s now open. 
“We’d like to hear what the public has to say regarding employment supports and how this could be meaningful for folks, recognizing that we’ll have to work to mitigate what could be an administrative barrier,” she said. “We could work through some of those challenges … to support individuals in achieving our goals.”

Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, speaks to a colleague on the floor of the Alabama House of Representatives on Feb. 11, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama Senate committee approved legislation that enhances immunity protection for law enforcement when they are faced with either criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits.
HB 202, sponsored by Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, changes the standard by which law enforcement can claim immunity as they perform their jobs and gives them additional procedural protections during litigation.
“I know a couple of the members have worked closely with our team on a couple of amendments,” Reynolds told the Senate Judiciary Committee during a meeting on Wednesday.

The committee approved the bill 9-4 along party lines after approving amendments that would review the impact on the legislation and report the race of individuals and the circumstances surrounding the incidents.
Reynolds’ bill has faced opposition from Democrats and civil rights groups, who said the legislation would make it difficult to hold law enforcement accountable for alleged wrongdoing.
Supporters including the Alabama Sheriff’s Association said it reflects the decisions made in the courts on immunity.
The bill changes the standard for immunity from prosecution. Currently, law enforcement officers may have prosecution or lawsuits if they act “willfully, maliciously, fraudulently, in bad faith, beyond his or her authority, or under a mistaken interpretation of the law.” Under Reynolds’ bill, the officer would have to violate rights specifically laid out in the constitutions of Alabama or the United States.
The legislation allows law enforcement a hearing at the start of any civil or criminal case to determine whether the law enforcement officer was acting within his or her discretionary authority. If the court rules the behavior acted within that discretionary authority, the case is dismissed.
If the appeal is rejected, the law enforcement officer may appeal the verdict to the Alabama Supreme Court. Lawmakers approved an amendment that sets a time limit for submitting appeals. If the appeal is rejected, the officer may continue to assert that defense as the case proceeds in court.
The legislation also prevents a plaintiff from gathering evidence in discovery in civil cases when the law enforcement officer requests the court dismiss the case.
Members of the committee approved a few amendments that modified the legislation on the periphery. One was proposed by Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville, that allowed plaintiffs to obtain video footage of the incident that pertains to civil lawsuits, but not criminal cases.
Another amendment proposed by Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, creates a study commission to evaluate the impact the legislation had on law enforcement recruitment and retention, one of the main justifications that Reynolds proposed the legislation.
A third amendment, also by Singleton, requires law enforcement agencies to collect and submit data to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency regarding the type of excessive force committed by law enforcement officers and the race and ethnicity of both the officer and the victim.
One proposal offered by Singleton was rejected that would have required law enforcement agencies to adopt written policies that officers would follow while performing their duties before they are given immunity.
“The impetus of this is to make sure there is a written policy that these officers have to go by, we are not just going out there going against the Constitution, so that there is a policy where they can be trained on,” Singleton said. “We will know there is a written policy to go by.”
Reynolds said he agreed with the proposal in principle but said he was against the amendment.
“I would not want to impose this on sheriffs in the state because they are not even APOSTC (Alabama Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission) certified,” Reynolds said. “There may be some throughout those ranks, but it impacts a lot of things.”
Other Democrats also agreed with Singleton’s amendment.
“To me, there is nothing like transparency, and everybody knows the rules and regulations so they can all be on the same page and be all treated the same,” Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile.
Republicans on the committee opposed the amendment.
“While I think, especially in my department, we have very sophisticated police departments and sheriff’s offices, this is a model, written policy that may or may not exist currently from APOSTC and specifies what should be in the policy,” said Sen. Chris Elliott, R-Fairhope. “That may or may not differ from the policies that are in effect in our local police departments or sheriffs.”
The bill moves to the Senate. There are four days left in the 2025 legislative session.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)A bill before state lawmakers would allow Southwest Gas and other natural gas utilities in the state to ask the Public Utilities Commission to depart from traditional rate-setting in favor of alternative rate-making, a policy shift that could pose a cost burden to customers, according to opponents. 
Southwest Gas currently applies for rate increases via a general rate case every three years, in which the PUC analyzes the utility’s expenses and revenue requirements, and adds in a permitted rate of return for the company. 
Alternative rate-making allows the utility to submit a rate plan determined by additional factors, and potentially extend the rate, which could be automatically adjusted via a predetermined formula, for longer than three years. 
“Nothing in this bill removes any of the PUC’s authority over the rate-making process. It does not issue Southwest Gas, or any other natural gas utility, a blank check to raise rates on its customers,” said Scott Leedom, director of regulation and public affairs for Southwest Gas, at a hearing before the Senate Committee on Growth and Infrastructure in April. 
Senate Bill 417 suggests a number of rate-making mechanisms for which natural gas utilities could apply:  

Performance-based rates, which are tied to outcomes, such as a utility’s ability to reduce carbon emissions or increase efficiency. The utility’s success in achieving the goal determines the rate;
Decoupling, or disassociating a utility’s financial results from the sale of natural gas, thereby eliminating the utility’s incentive to promote consumption; and,
Multi-year rate plans, which call for the PUC to set rates beyond the three-year duration set in general rate cases. 

An amendment to SB 417 proposes allowing the PUC to establish methods to automatically adjust rates based on a pre-determined formula. The formula can include a method to recover the costs of capital expenditures, be adjusted for accumulated depreciation, deferred taxes, property taxes “and any other costs established by the Commission.” 
Proponents suggest formula rates streamline the lengthy and complicated process of a general rate case.
Alternative rate-making creates more predictable rate changes and lowers administrative costs, with the savings passed on to consumers, Leedom said, adding rate changes would “potentially no longer have the cumulative stair-step increases to reflect the cost of providing service and rates. Instead, these adjustments would be smoother and incrementally smaller.” 
Proponents, which include the Retail Association of Nevada, the Nevada Trucking Association, and a variety of chambers of commerce, cited predictability and the potential for lower costs in their testimony supporting the measure. 
SB 417, they contend, mirrors a 2019 bill sponsored by then-Sen. Chris Brooks, which allowed electric utilities to apply for alternative ratemaking.  The measure was signed into law by then-Gov. Steve Sisolak. 
“It is not a mirror of SB 300,” said  Ernest Figueroa, Consumer Advocate and Chief Deputy Attorney General of the Bureau of Consumer Protection. The measure, unlike SB 300, Figueroa said, does not state how the plan “aligns an economically viable utility model to state public policy goals.”   
Additionally, Figueroa said he believes the inclusion of provisions regarding formula rates “unfairly tips the scales in the utility’s favor to the detriment of the ratepayer.”
Other opponents, including the Sierra Club and the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, argue the proposed process is opaque.
Kristee Watson of the Nevada Conservation League noted that lawmakers, in the 2023 legislative session, established an integrated resource planning process for natural gas utilities.  Southwest Gas is slated to file its first IRP this summer. Watson said that process should be permitted to play out before considering alternative rate-making. 
“This is not the time to give gas utilities more tools to raise rates with less scrutiny,” she said. 
Last year, Arizona’s five-member elected body of utility regulators passed a measure approving formula rate plans for utilities, including Southwest Gas, which also operates in that state. 
“Consumer advocates in Arizona and nationally have warned against ratemaking plans that reward utilities for engaging in high risk planning that can often lead to devastating consequences for ratepayers,” reports the Energy and Policy Institute. 
Jermareon Williams, government affairs manager for Western Resource Advocates, an environmental nonprofit, testified that general rate cases “act as safeguards for customers and shelter them from unneeded investments a utility may choose to pursue to increase their profits.” 
The Senate passed the measure 21-0. 
Reno resident Bari Levinson, a member of the Energy Coalition, testified that former Nevada Consumer Advocate Jon Wellinghoff, who also served as a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), opposes the measure.  In a statement read by Levinson, Wellinghoff said that giving Southwest Gas “the right to have their rates set on a future test year with estimated costs used to set rates charged to customers, rather than using actual known and experienced expenses will definitely drive up costs for consumers. We do not want our rates to skyrocket like they have in California.”
California began decoupling electric and gas rates in the early 1980s. 
Sen. Rochelle Nguyen, who chairs the Senate Committee on Growth and Infrastructure, asked PUC attorney Garret Weir if the bill lacks guardrails present in SB 300, as opponents asserted. 
Weir, who testified in neutral, said he was unaware of any guardrails in SB 300, but noted the PUC imposed “robust regulations” via rulemaking. He also noted the legislation only allows natural gas utilities to apply to the PUC for alternative rulemaking.
“Ultimately, the commission would still have the obligation to ensure that any rates adopted pursuant to this statute were just and reasonable and in the public interest,” he said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC06367-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 08:02:33.957945

Jackie Ormes became the first known Black cartoonist whose work was read coast to coast through the major black publication, the Pittsburgh Courier. 
Her cartoon told the story of Torchy Brown, a Mississippi teenager who sang and danced her way from Mississippi to New York City, mirroring the Great Migration, when millions of African Americans trekked from the South to the North, Midwest and West. 
In 1945, her cartoon, “Patty-Jo ‘n’ Ginger,” started. The strip proved so popular that department stores sold Patty-Jo as a doll. Five years later, Torchy returned, this time as a confident and courageous woman who dared to tackle such issues as race, sex and the environment. Readers applauded this strong model of what young Black women could be. 
Ormes died on Dec. 26, 1985, at the age of 74.

Emily brings more than three decades of experience covering Mississippi. She joins the newsroom’s leadership team to help guide our editorial strategy, mentor young reporters and grow our relationship with newsroom leaders across the state and region.
The dean of the Mississippi Capitol Press Corps, Emily served as The Associated Press’s Mississippi Capitol correspondent from 2001 until January 2025. She previously reported for The Clarion-Ledger, The Vicksburg Evening Post and The Oxford Eagle. She is a graduate of the University of Mississippi.
“Emily is, in so many ways, a trailblazer for Mississippi journalists,” said Adam Ganucheau, Mississippi Today’s editor-in-chief. “Her steadfast, tough-but-fair reporting has inspired many journalists — myself included — to serve Mississippians in similar ways. I can’t overstate how excited we are to have her join our newsroom, where her insight and perspective will be invaluable to us and will help shape our future. And, of course, everyone is thrilled about the return of Emily’s byline after a few months of well-deserved rest.”
Emily’s reporting has been widely praised for its fairness, accuracy and depth. In March 2025, the Mississippi Legislature honored her with a resolution recognizing her contributions to journalism and public understanding. She is also a past recipient of the University of Mississippi’s prestigious Silver Em Award.
“I’m looking forward to working with smart, energetic journalists at Mississippi Today, many of whom are friends and former colleagues,” Emily said. “It’s important to report with depth and historical perspective on the complex issues of this state and to demand accountability from public officials, elected and appointed.”

“When a student enters a school, they still carry with them their First Amendment rights. They can absolutely talk to a nurse, a teacher, a counselor, whoever they want,” Butler said. “This is banning classroom discussions.”

The Senate Education Policy Committee also held a public hearing on the legislation, which was heavily populated by opponents.

Paige Gant, a math professor, said the legislation does not accomplish anything.
“Kids in middle school and high school are aware that gay and transgender people exist as they have access to the internet,” she said. “Attempting to stifle discussions of such topics will not change these realities.”
The legislation also bans insignia like pride flags from being displayed in a classroom. Gant added that the bill only bans such in a classroom and not in a hallway where students could still be around them.
“This bill is frankly a waste of the Senate’s time,” she said.
Erin DeJager also spoke against the bill, arguing that it bans something that is not defined in Alabama law. The Legislature rushed a bill that defines sex-based terms at the beginning of the 2025 session.
“This term, ‘gender identity,’ is used to describe flags or insignia. This can be interpreted to be a box of girl scout cookies, as the Girl Scouts are certainly based on gender identity,” she said. 
The lone supporter of the bill that spoke, Ted Halley, who said he “detransitioned” back to male after 12 years of identifying as a woman, repeated his comments from other related public hearings.
“When you enter the glitter club, you’re welcomed. But when you leave, you get a target on your back,” he said. 
Detransition and regret are different concepts, a Harvard Medical School study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism suggests, which may overlap in some people, but they are “sometimes mistakenly viewed as synonymous.” Halley also spoke in favor of a bill Wednesday to allow parents to claim religious exemptions from vaccines without giving a reason.

Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, said the Legislature does not get to legislate morality.
“You lost me when you said the executive order of President Trump. The gentleman has 34 felonies,” he said. “In addition to that, woke is this strange kind of language that’s being used. I’d rather be woke than asleep.”
Hatcher was the sole “no” vote, but Sen. Randy Price, R-Opelika, said he had reservations about the bill. 
“If you’re going to take a bill that’s going to take this type of stand in our school systems, we should have seen this bill the first week,” he said in an interview. “It’s just a timing thing.”
Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, the chair of the committee, told Butler after the bill was approved that it is unlikely the Senate will pass it because of the timing. 
“We’re going to get it out of committee, but I’m not going to make any promises as to where this bill goes from here,” Chesteen said. “If you’re going to bring something like this next year, you need to get it early so that we’re not backed up with all the House bills that we currently have before we try to move forward with anything like this.”
Although the bill was filed early in the session, the House Education Policy committee did not approve the legislation until April 10, after a public hearing on April 3.
There are four legislative days left in the 2025 legislative session.

(Photo courtesy of City of Las Vegas)AmeriCorps service members who helped with tutoring students, school literacy programs and wildfire mitigation were among the 163 people in Nevada recently terminated after President Donald Trump’s administration abruptly stopped federal funding to the 30-year-old program.
AmeriCorps is a federal agency that supports and funds national service throughout the country.
Organizations in the state, as well as throughout the country, that relied on AmeriCorps grant funding  received letters last week telling them to “immediately cease all award activities” after the administration “determined that the award no longer effectuates agency priorities.”
Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford on Tuesday announced he joined a lawsuit along with 22 other Democratic attorneys general challenging the constitutionality of the administration stopping funding. 
“The Trump administration does not have the legal ability to dismantle this agency unilaterally. Congress has created AmeriCorps to give Americans the ability to help their communities during times of need, and the president cannot handwave away the decisions of Congress,” Ford said in a statement.
Nevada Current asked Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has made education the centerpiece of his agenda, about the cuts to AmeriCorps programs in Nevada and whether he supported the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of those cuts. 
His office didn’t respond. 
The lawsuit argues that the administration “is free to ask Congress to abolish AmeriCorps, but it cannot simply terminate the agency’s functions.” In doing so is a violation of the separation of powers under the U.S. Constitution.
Though the lawsuit seeks to restore already allocated funding, the cuts are already “going to have a significant impact on Nevadans,” said Zanny Marsh, executive director with Nevada Volunteers, which oversees AmeriCorps funding in Nevada. 
The 163 AmeriCorps members terminated were placed in programs ranging from Pre-K through 12 tutoring programs to health and wellness programs throughout the state, Marsh said. They had served a combined 144,925 hours, she said.
“We have service members who are mitigating areas more prone to wild fire and creating more wild fire resilience and resistance in communities,” Marsh said. “We had mentors and tutors in Nevada classrooms all over the state.”
The positions still had about a third of their contract still remaining. The swift termination of funding caught Nevada Volunteers off guard.
Rather than abrupt cuts, Marsh said it would have made more sense if the administration reached out and had “given a dollar amount” of how much needed to be cut, allowing Nevada Volunteers to “approach it using a criteria that made sense to us.”
“If circumstances were different, we would have loved to be consulted with the agency in determining what cuts we could have made,” she said. “It would still have been painful but we would have done it differently. Because we weren’t consulted and the decisions were already made then it just felt like it caught us off guard.”
AmeriCorps had grants terminated for programs with the City of Las Vegas, the City of Henderson, Walker Basin Conservancy, Nevada Outdoor School, United Way of Northern Nevada and the Sierra, the Good Deed Project, Improve Your Tomorrow, Healthy Communities Coalition of Lyon and Storey Counties, Volunteer Generation Fund, and VISTA Intermediary.
In an email to the Current, City of Las Vegas spokesman Jace Radke said AmeriCorps grants supported 66 positions.
ReInvent Schools Las Vegas, which served several underserved schools within the city, relied on AmeriCrops grants to fund 32 literacy mentors, eight chronic absenteeism mentors and four nutrition mentors, Radke said. 
Four positions with the city’s mobile pre-K program were cut as well as four mentors with the city’s charter school, Strong Start Academy Elementary School.
Radke said programs are expected to continue operating but may have to scale back certain components.
The City of Henderson said it is still “currently assessing the potential impact of these cuts on our program” in an email to the Current Tuesday. 
Not every program that relied on AmeriCorps was affected, Marsh said. Opportunity Village, Great Basin Institute, Nevada Conservation Corps, and Truckee Meadows Parks Foundation weren’t included. 
Despite much uncertainty, Marsh didn’t discount the possibility of Nevada seeing future funding for AmeriCorps.  
“We are hopeful and planning that our grantees will have another opportunity to participate in the AmeriCorps program this fall,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/43270865240_dff471c502_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 08:02:33.957945

SB 85, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would also require public institutions of higher education to offer both religious and medical exemptions to vaccine or testing requirements.
“The [current] process is cumbersome. Some feel like it’s harassment,” claimed Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, who is handling the bill in the House. “You have to go to the Department of Education, watch a video and sign some stuff, and some parents have really felt harassed by that for their religious liberties and parental rights.”

Alabama’s measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination rate among kindergartners was just under 93.8% in the 2023-2024 school year, a decrease from the 95% rate in the 2021-2022 school year, which is considered herd immunity.
Apriell Hartsfield, Kids Count director for VOICES for Alabama Children, said immunosuppressed children and infants too young for vaccinations could face consequences if more people choose to skip vaccinations. She said that the current system allows for effective monitoring of exemptions and rapid response to potential outbreaks of contagious diseases.
“This bill, by throwing out a system that works in favor of one that is random and unsystematic, will prevent health officials from being prepared to respond rapidly to outbreaks, and with highly contagious diseases that can spread rapidly, such as measles … time is of the essence, and systems that allow rapid response benefit the public’s health,” Hartsfield said during the hearing.  
Hartsfield said after the meeting that measles outbreaks are particularly dangerous, saying that children don’t receive the MMR vaccine until about 18 months of age, making day care centers particularly vulnerable, which could have a negative impact on the economy. She said that if day care centers have to close temporarily, as they did during the height of the COVID pandemic, parents may not be able to get to work.
“What are these parents going to do who are relying on childcare to be able to work and provide for their families? What are these businesses going to do who are relying on their workers to come in and do their job? It’s just going to put everybody in a really bad position,” Hartsfield said.
One person spoke in favor of the bill. Ted Halley, a Prattville resident who spoke Tuesday in favor of banning drag performances in libraries and public schools, said that vaccines should “not [be] forced on down our throats.”
 “As you know, there’s two sides of every coin. Some people love the COVID vaccine. Some people like me hate it,” Halley said, pointing to unfounded claims of adverse effects from the vaccine. Halley also spoke Wednesday in favor of a bill extending the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” ban in public schools.

Rep. Frances Holk-Jones, R-Foley, asked about the bill’s language, specifically the term “testing,” and asked for clarification on whether it referred to school tests or medical tests.
“Your bill is not specific. It just strictly says all testing,” Holk-Jones said.
Butler said that is something they can fix.
Rep. Neil Rafferty, D-Birmingham, also expressed concern about the religious basis of the exemption, saying that he couldn’t find any religious denomination that explicitly forbids vaccines.
“So, I’m just wondering, why don’t we just call this what it is, which is a personal exemption, instead of trying to call it a religious exemption?” Rafferty asked, but Butler maintained it is a religious exemption.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A coalition of ranking Indiana University alumni voiced “alarm and anger” Wednesday to new state policy that eliminates alumni input in the selection of university trustees and instead gives decision-making power over the board’s membership to the governor. 
The letter signed by 26 former chairs of the Board of Managers for IU’s Alumni Association was in response to provisions that were quietly added to the final draft of the next state budget giving Gov. Mike Braun full control over the membership of IU’s board of trustees. The Board of Managers is the supervisory panel for the university’s alumni association.

Separately, the board of trustees serves as the governing body for the state’s largest postsecondary institution. 
Under current law, Indiana’s governor appoints five members to IU’s board and picks one student representative with the help of a student-led committee. Three other members must be IU graduates and are elected by other alumni.
“This short-sighted act, written in a cowardly way so as to prohibit public discussion, tells our alumni that their voices through the ballot box are less important than that of one person who will do the choosing in the future,” alumni wrote. Four of the letter’s signatories additionally served terms as board trustees.
“Trustees are not elected due to their politics but for their beliefs about improving and strengthening the quality of education for students and operating the university in a fiscally sound manner,” the letter continued. “If disenfranchised from voting, how would alumni ever feel they have a voice in the affairs of the university in other ways? Why would they ever want to provide any support?”
Braun defended the policy move, emphasizing to reporters Wednesday afternoon that just 1.7% of IU alumni participated in past votes to elect trustees.
“It wasn’t representative. It enabled a clique of a few people to actually determine three board members. And I don’t think that is real representation,” Braun said. “If it was more broadly ascribed to, it would be different.”
Story continues below.
Governor&PresidentLetter
 
He said the language “came collectively from folks in the legislature” while legislative leaders refused to say who requested it. 
“All the other universities seem to have more value in terms of the education they’re giving us for the cost, and those three trustees that were being arranged by just a small percentage of alumni didn’t make sense,” Braun said.
The provision slipped into the new state budget stipulates that all nine members are to be appointed by the governor. Another section gives the governor authority to, “at any time,” remove and replace a board member who was previously elected by the IU alumni.
Braun says he’ll keep current board members
If the governor swaps a member out, the new appointee serves until the expiration of the term of the replaced member. Otherwise, any of the existing members elected by IU alumni are allowed to serve out the rest of their term. 
The governor suggested Wednesday that he will retain the board’s three sitting alumni appointees and allow them to serve out the rest of their terms.










Trustees are not elected due to their politics but for their beliefs about improving and strengthening the quality of education for students and operating the university in a fiscally sound manner.

“I don’t think their terms are that far away from expiring,” Braun said. “I haven’t thought about anything other than … you can’t imagine the number of people that are interested in being a trustee at IU.”
Other new rules require that at least five of the members appointed to the board must be alumni, and five must be residents of Indiana.
The provisions did not appear in previous versions of the state budget.
When questioned about the last-minute move by lawmakers to approve the language, Braun held that “some things, yes, maybe should go through committee and so forth.” But he did not make clear whether the IU provision should have been more thoroughly — or publicly — vetted.
“You look at all the other things we did — I mean, they were up until two in the morning to get it done, and there was a lot of significant legislation that crossed the finish line,” the governor said. “You know why that happened? You can ask any legislator — even the ones that didn’t come along with us — this is the most anybody from the second floor has been dealing with the third floor in a long, long time.”
“I don’t know how much Mitch did it back then, but we were wearing (lawmakers) out in a good way. We were there talking to them,” Braun said, referring to former Gov. Mitch Daniels. “And I think that was welcomed. They’re going to have a partner on the second floor that’s interested in really working with them to take Indiana into places I think we can go that no one imagined before.”
How trustees are chosen
At present, all IU trustees serve three-year terms, except the student member whose term lasts just two years.
The new provisions shorten student terms to one year and sets a three-term limit on appointed board members.
No other university boards were altered by the latest budget language.
How trustees are selected at other Hoosier colleges and universities varies somewhat — but like IU, others have also traditionally allowed alumni to have a say on one or more members.
Quiet budget addition would give Braun full control over Indiana University Board of Trustees

At Purdue University, for example, three of the 10 board members are elected by the school’s alumni association, one of whom must be a graduate of the College of Agriculture. The governor appoints the remaining seven members, including a student trustee.
“When it comes to our flagship university, I wish it was paying more attention to what the other flagship university was doing,” Braun said, referring to Purdue University. “(Purdue) is giving Hoosiers real value by keeping tuition and room and board to where you can afford it. And even though some of our other universities have done it, that’s the only place that initiated it, and that was done many years ago.”
The governor said he wants “better value for Hoosier parents,” noting that only half of Indiana’s high school graduates go on to college, and many of those “don’t make it to the finish line.”
“They’ve lost time, and they’re taking debt along,” Braun said. “I think Indiana (University) needs to look at how they’re producing degrees that are more marketable, that they’re lined up with where the high-demand, high wages are in our own state economy, and start running (the school) in a way that’s more efficient.”

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont businesses: Getting data privacy right.","This commentary is from a group of Vermont businesses, listed below the text.Just last month, the Vermont Senate passed reasonable data privacy legislation that ensures consumer data is secure, while at the same time fostering regional compatibility and protecting Vermont’s businesses from excessive compliance costs and litigation. We are proud to support the bill, S.71 — the New England model, and encourage our lawmakers in the House to swiftly advance it as currently written to avoid subjecting local businesses to increased costs, vague language and profit-seeking lawsuits that not only stifle innovation, but prevent them from reaching their customers.Businesses and nonprofits want clear guidelines to ensure compliance with any new data privacy law. We shouldn’t make that harder than it needs to be. As amended and passed by the Senate, S.71 sets clear standards, definitions and guardrails for businesses to ensure consumers are empowered, even granting the option for Vermonters to opt out of certain types of data processing. Regional compatibility is critically important for our collective efforts to grow a 21st-century economy. Vermont can’t afford to be on an island. Fortunately, our senators agreed, and we are looking to our lawmakers in the House to follow suit.Much like privacy legislation already on the books in New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut, the New England model limits the collection of consumer data to what is “adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary” for the purposes disclosed to the consumer. This language is not only regionally compatible, but consistent with California and Europe as well. We owe it to Vermont’s businesses to ensure new privacy legislation does not impact their ability to remain regionally, if not globally, competitive. But make no mistake: under the New England model, businesses and nonprofits will still have the tools necessary to reach new customers, maintain regulars and otherwise thrive right here in the state. Digital advertising, custom online experiences, loyalty programs and other core components of modern marketing campaigns must remain intact — and affordable for smaller outfits. READ MORE





 


Final Reading: Vermont Senate passes pared-down data privacy bill  

by Habib Sabet 
March 27, 2025, 6:30 pmMarch 27, 2025, 6:30 pm 



At the end of the day, we have to strike a balance. The New England model sets responsible guardrails for data-driven commerce while empowering consumers and protecting Vermont’s operators from needless litigation. Between workforce shortages, rising cost of living, and taxes, keeping the lights on is hard enough. Vermont’s businesses and nonprofits deserve clear guidance, and a chance to compete. And as the smallest economy in the United States, I know we all share the goal of climbing up the rankings — not staying at the bottom. That will take a purposeful approach to policy making, including and especially on issues like data privacy. Last year, the Legislature tried to pass data privacy legislation that ultimately failed. We cannot afford to make the same mistake twice — let’s learn our lesson from 2024, and get behind the New England model for data privacy. We look forward to working with lawmakers in the statehouse to support this Senate-backed data privacy bill and send it to the governor’s desk. It’s imperative that the voices of businesses and nonprofits are heard loud and clear by the House this session. A-1 FlooringDriven MarketingVermont Canoe & KayakingKevin Smith SportsCreative Design Lavoie Construction, LLCHyperRelic Sports CardsStanislas Property ServicesFaradayMytiBlade Shumway Excavating & HardscapeScout Digital The Wilson House of East DorsetKS DecoratingRail City Plumbing and HeatingTim Scott Real EstateShawn Cheney Group, LLCTC’s LLCJess Driver PhotographySierra Environmental DrillingThe Pine Cone RestaurantFirst Response LaborTuttle’s Trucking & RecyclingSteven Wright – Jay Peak ResortBillings Farm & Museum Rail City Plumbing & Heating  Shumberries Liberty Hill FarmRead the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont businesses: Getting data privacy right.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-01 08:02:33.957945

H.91 as written is not bold, it is reckless.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont shelter providers: Homeless legislation overhaul risks existing successful programs.","This commentary is by Vermont shelter and homeless service providers. Their names are listed below the text of the commentary.We are shelter and homeless service providers throughout the state of Vermont writing to express our concerns with bill H.91, commonly known as VHEARTH, which was referenced in the VTDigger article on dissolving the motel program. When homelessness is discussed in Vermont the spotlight is frequently trained on the General Assistance program. Some criticize GA — often referred to as the hotel/motel program — for “warehousing” people without a long-term plan. Others argue it provides shelter to vulnerable individuals who would otherwise be on the streets, at risk of exposure. Some feel the eligibility is too lax, others too strict; that it spends too much, that it’s underfunded. For over two decades many of us in the fields of housing, homelessness and anti-poverty work have been pulled into a parade of task forces, advisory groups and councils charged with finding an elusive compromise. That tension provides context, but it’s not what we’re here to opine on. This session, a House committee is proposing another transformation of the polarizing GA program. It involves the state pulling back from its role as operator and providing block-grant funding to five designated community organizations. The legislation leaves much to be sorted out and creates yet another advisory group for that purpose. READ MORE





 


Plan would overhaul Vermont’s response to homelessness, dissolving statewide motel program 

by Carly Berlin 
April 18, 2025, 3:43 pmApril 18, 2025, 4:27 pm 



There are pros and cons with a regional alternative to GA. But a few lines in H.91 would simultaneously eliminate a less-well-known program, the Housing Opportunity Grant Program. HOP is a high-performing program that provides the lion’s share of funding for community-based shelters and services for Vermonters experiencing homelessness. HOP funding keeps shelters open and staffed. It supports case managers working with people along a continuum from crisis, to emergency shelter, to permanent housing. HOP funding pays for security deposits and back rent to Vermont landlords to support tenancies. It’s the program that keeps Vermonters out of GA motels through effective eviction prevention programs. HOP also gets people out of GA motels and into community-based shelter apartments and permanent housing. Last year HOP funds assisted 39 non-profit organizations in Vermont, allowing them to shelter 3,200 Vermonters. It provided over $4 million in security deposits, back rent and rental assistance to stabilize 2,246 Vermont households who were homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness. HOP does all this and more which is why we are advocating for its preservation. We ask Vermonters — residents, legislators, landlords, partners — to look closely at this legislation which we feel has the potential to destabilize a network of high-performing shelters and services at a moment it needs to be strong. The chaotic federal landscape is not projected to make things easier for operators or to reduce the need for emergency shelters.We ask that people not paint with the same brush the GA program and the Housing Opportunity Program. We ask that a proven and high-performing HOP program be held harmless from the next experiment with re-envisioning General Assistance, and that the Legislature affirm and direct the State to uphold and support the State Office of Economic Opportunity and the important role they play in serving our most vulnerable neighbors. In recent testimony, we heard H.91 described as “bold.” Transitioning General Assistance from a centralized, state program to a regional model administered by select nonprofits might warrant the adjective “bold.” But attempting that while destabilizing Vermont’s existing shelters and services supported through the HOP program would, we believe, be reckless. We support the Legislature and our community partners in efforts to reimagine GA funding and how it is put to use. As service providers, we would like to be at that table. We support harnessing the full capacity of the state Departments of Health, Health Access, Mental Health, Disabilities Aging and Independent Living, and Corrections in creating meaningful, transformative support systems for our most vulnerable neighbors. The people we serve day in and day out with severe health issues, debilitating substance use disorders and chronic mental health issues have been pushed from other systems of care in the name of cost savings and driven into our shelters and motels. We further support the use of GA funds to bolster successful programs such as HOP and others that are helping Vermonters and are not fully funded. This type of action will truly help the most vulnerable in our communities and would be bold. H.91 as written is not bold, it is reckless. The HOP program must be removed from H.91’s concept for redesigning General Assistance. Signed, Angus Chaney, executive director, Homeless Prevention Center Jonathan Farrell, executive director, COTS Julie Bond, executive director, Good Samaritan Haven Kim Anetsberger, executive director, Lamoille Community House Libby Bennett, executive director, Groundworks Collaborative Michael Redmond, executive director, Upper Valley Haven Constance S.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)After years of delay, Hoosiers and other state residents will need a Real ID to pass through airport security and enter federal government buildings starting on May 7. In Indiana, a black star cutout in the upper right-hand corner signifies if a driver’s license is Real ID compliant. 
The law establishing a Real ID passed in 2005, following a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission to establish a national standard for government-issued identification, such as driver’s licenses.     

 
 
 
But implementation took longer than anticipated. Federal entities repeatedly extended the deadline for 14 years to give state motor vehicle departments time to comply, according to a 2022 NPR story.
An Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles spokesperson told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that Indiana started offering Real ID on Jan. 1, 2010. A recent CBS News analysis found that 81% of Indiana driver’s licenses are compliant — which the agency attributed to “slow and steady growth” over the years. 
“Since the introduction of Real ID, the BMV has adhered to all federal mandates regarding the documentation required to apply for a Real ID credential,” said Sarah Dickerson, a communications and engagement manager, in a statement. “We encourage Hoosiers who are interested to reference the Real ID Checklist on our website, since many specific documents are needed.”
Such documentation includes the following: proof of identity, proof of name or gender changes, proof of lawful status, proof of social security and proof of Indiana residency. 
As detailed in a BMV list, this can include multiple other forms of identity, such as an unexpired U.S. passport, original birth certificate, social security cards, certificate of naturalization and more.  
 Difficulties rolling out Real IDs

The requirements can be challenging for some to meet. For instance, a W-2 form can be proof of Indiana residency — but only if it includes the full, nine-digit social security number and not only the last four digits. 
Married women or those who changed their name for another reason face another hurdle, especially those who married decades ago and must produce their original marriage certificate to prove their name change. 
Dorothy Ballone, who changed her name seven decades ago, had her Real ID application rejected when she couldn’t produce her original marriage certificate, she told a Rochester, New York TV station. 
Neither the church where she got married nor the town hall kept records that far back.

The rule also impacts those who transitioned to another gender, adoptees or couples who choose to hyphenate their last names. 
The BMV documentation checklist includes a caveat at the bottom specifically for Hoosiers who fall into this category. 
“If your current name does not match your identity document due to a name change … you may need to provide additional government-issued documents to support any or all name changes,” according to the footnote. “For example, if you were born Jane Smith and then married Tom Cooper and your legal name is not Jane Cooper, you will need to bring your marriage license.”
Having a valid passport with your changed name would also meet the requirement. 
Dickerson, with the BMV, urged Hoosiers in this category to work with their local branch to meet documentation requirements.
“Customers with complex situations face challenges similar to those they’ve had for years. This is seen more frequently with married women and those going through a divorce,” said Dickerson. “Our branch staff are well-trained and skilled in completing Real ID transactions. Often, if a customer doesn’t have all the proper documents, a staff member will explain what is needed to ensure they are able to complete the transaction next time.”
To learn more about Real ID and answer specific questions, visit the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website or contact your local BMV branch.

(Photo via Florida State Archives)When I was a kid growing up in Pensacola, I’d come home from school and immediately turn on “The Big Show” on WKRG-TV. The avuncular host, Max Goodman, showed a lot of ’50s monster movies, and that’s where I learned about the transformative power of radioactivity.
Those movies taught me that radiation can make a normal-sized octopus into a sucker-armed giant (“It Came from Beneath the Sea,” 1955). It can turn a lot of little ants into a really big insect army (“Them!” 1954). It can even make an average guy grow into the tallest, strongest man on earth (“The Amazing Colossal Man,” 1957)!
So you can imagine how happy I was to hear about Senate Bill 832. This bill will make it far more likely that Central Florida’s new residents wind up living on top of radioactive waste that will turn them and their household insects colossal.
Picture how big the flying cockroaches will get. Won’t that be fun?
Members of the Florida Senate and House sure seem to think so. The Senate voted 33-3 to approve the bill two weeks ago. Then the House voted 80-20 to pass it last week. However, the House version differs from what passed the Senate and, as of Wednesday afternoon, the Senate had rejected the House version and sent it back to the lower chamber.
Perhaps, on this return trip, someone will ask them what the heck they think they’re doing.
  Sen. Danny Burgess via X
My colleague Mitch Perry wrote about this bill for the Florida Phoenix in March, when the bill, sponsored by Sen. Danny Burgess passed the Senate Judiciary Committee. He reported that it “would provide new legal protections to companies that mine phosphate in Florida and leave behind radioactive spoils.”
Yeah, the largest phosphate company in the world, Tampa-based Mosaic, needs protection from being sued. From what I’ve seen, Mosaic needs protection about as much as the Amazing Colossal Man did.

  Glenn Compton of ManaSota-88 via Glenn Compton
I first heard about this bizarre bill’s impending passage from Glenn Compton of the venerable environmental group ManaSota-88.
“It’s not a good idea to have residents living on top of this,” he told me. “It’s not a good idea to build houses on these properties.”
Yet we’ve built thousands of them.
Some people contend that being exposed to radiation is not the magical shortcut to greater size and strength that those ’50s movies led me to believe. In fact, it’s actually bad, because it causes cancer.
That’s the argument of the attorneys suing Mosaic on behalf of some Mulberry homeowners. Their mobile homes in Anglers Green and the ironically named Paradise Lakes sit on land where Mosaic once mined, then piled the dirt back on top when they were done.
Because no one warned them, the buyers of these lots had no idea it was polluted property when they sank their money into it, the suit says. Then family members fell ill.
“The ground and soil that support and form the very foundation upon which [the plaintiffs’] homes sit is contaminated with uranium and radium-226 caused by Mosaic’s phosphate mining operations,” the 2020 lawsuit says.
For years, Mosaic has been all over TV with ads bragging about their commitment to Florida’s environment. Meanwhile, though, the company has been leaving cancer-causing contaminants behind on the land that’s been mined and then “reclaimed”.
Mosaic digs deep into the ground for the phosphate rocks that it needs, exposing radioactive soils that had been hidden 20 or more feet below the surface. Humans were safe from the radiation while the soil was buried. But when Mosaic covers the holes back up to sell to developers, the radioactive material winds up on the surface.
“Exposure to levels of radiation similar to those identified in the Angler’s Green and Paradise Lakes communities,” the suit contends, “translates to residents receiving over one chest X-ray per week — with obviously no diagnostic or health purpose whatsoever.”
  Ryan Ellis via law firm
  Chris Nidel via law firm
I talked to two of the attorneys representing the homeowners, Ryan Ellis and Chris Nidel. They told me that Burgess’ phosphate bill is clearly aimed at protecting Mosaic from their lawsuit, which has so far survived all the company’s efforts to persuade a judge dismiss it.
“It’s just hurdle after hurdle to prevent them from being sued,” Nidel told me. If it passes, “Mosaic is in the end zone about to declare victory.”
This affects more than just their clients, the attorneys told me. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found widespread Central Florida development atop old phosphate mine locations.
“They found 50,000 people living on these sites,” Nidel told me. “There’s acres and acres of them.”
He mentioned that one former mine was disguised as a park for riding mountain bikes. “They’re radioactive waste pits and now people are riding around in them.”
 Something the Legislature should know
The Mulberry homeowners weren’t the first to sue over their contaminated land. In 2017, residents of Lakeland’s Oakbridge and Grasslands communities sued the developer who built their homes on top of old mining properties.
They settled the suit last year but, in announcing the settlement, their law firm pointed out, “EPA testing before development of the subdivisions showed radiation levels 11 to 21 times higher than the acceptable risk limit.” The builder went ahead anyway.
I heard about that 2017 case from Rachael Curran of the Jacobs Public Interest Law Clinic for Democracy and the Environment at Stetson University’s College of Law.
  Rachael Curran via Stetson Law School
“I have no idea how many homes are presently built [or] planned to be built on reclaimed lands in Florida,” Curran told me. “That’s something the Legislature should know before it limits recoverable damages for these exposed Floridians.”
But our fine lawmakers aren’t interested in those kinds of numbers. They only care about the numbers on Mosaic’s campaign contributions.
Independent journalist Jason Garcia, who wrote about this bill in February, noted that Mosaic has hired half a dozen lobbyists to push Burgess’ bill.
He also pointed out that “Mosaic has been cutting large checks to key lawmakers this month — including a $10,000 donation to Burgess that was deposited four days before the senator filed his bill to help Mosaic.”
In defending his bill before the Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee last month, Burgess called it “a necessary piece of legislation, with a naturally occurring geological feature in the state of Florida.”
Not a single senator voted against it.
 Playing havoc with ecosystems
The quest for phosphate rock didn’t start with Mosaic. Miners seeking the ancient rock used for making fertilizer have been ripping up the Florida landscape for more than a century.
  Albertus Vogt via Find A Grave website
In 1889, a man named Albertus Vogt — a onetime Confederate soldier with an impressive mustache and a curious marital history — noticed, in a spring near Dunnellon, some prehistoric fossils.
Vogt recalled similar fossils turning up near phosphate deposits in South Carolina and hired someone to dig. Sure enough, the Florida fossils turned out to be a sign of extensive phosphate, the remnants of prehistoric animals.
What happened next was like the California gold rush, but without the frequent gunplay, the Mark Twain stories, and, of course, the bullion.
“News of this great find spread,” the Phosphate Research Institute reports. “Thousands of prospectors and speculators flooded the area and the great Florida phosphate boom had begun. By 1894 more than 215 phosphate mining companies were operating statewide.”
Now there are 28 phosphate mines in Florida, covering more than 450,000 acres, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. Eleven phosphate mines are currently active, and a series of corporate mergers have led to Mosaic becoming nearly the last miner standing.
Drive through the part of Central Florida known as Bone Valley and you’ll see the strange creations that mark the location of the mines and processing plants: Massive mounds of waste known as phosphogypsum stacks, often the highest point for miles around. Each one has a huge pond of acidic water pooled on top.
The other thing that marks these industrial sites: a series of disasters that have plagued the industry and repeatedly played havoc with our ecosystems.
In 1994, a sinkhole opened up beneath a stack in Mulberry that was so big, local wags later dubbed it the new Disney World ride, “Journey to the Center of the Earth.” The hole measured 160 feet across and about 400 feet deep and its sudden appearance dropped at least 2 million gallons of acidic wastewater down into the Floridan Aquifer.
In 1997 a dam atop a gypsum stack at a Mulberry Phosphates fertilizer plant broke during heavy rains, spilling 56 million gallons of acidic wastewater into the Alafia River. As the pollution flowed downriver, everything in the 42 miles between Mulberry and Tampa Bay was killed, including more than 1 million fish. The company declared bankruptcy and shut down.
Seven years later, in 2004, something similar happened. Tropical Storm Frances broke the dam atop a gypsum stack at Mosaic’s Riverview plant, sending 65 million gallons of the acidic waste into a creek that flowed into Hillsborough Bay. The pollution killed fish, mangroves, and seagrass.
Then, in 2016, less than 2 miles from where the 1994 sinkhole occurred, another sinkhole opened beneath a Mosaic gypsum stack. This hole wound up being 45 feet wide and 220 feet deep. Down went 215 million gallons of acidic water, gurgling into the aquifer that supplies the region’s drinking supply.
And I haven’t even mentioned Mosaic’s $2 billion settlement with the EPA, which a government spokesman called “the most significant enforcement action in the mining and mineral processing arena” in the U.S.
Or the horrific Piney Point disaster, which resulted from Florida environmental regulators repeatedly bending the rules to accommodate industry.

 Save Mosaic!
Yet our legislators treat the phosphate industry like it’s a miner celebrity (ba-dum-bum!), not a major polluter.
I picture them wandering the marble halls of the Capitol like that misinformed high school kid in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” who was carrying a Pepsi can full of change and calling out “Save Ferris!” Instead, they’re chanting, “Save Mosaic!” and collecting legislation to help the company succeed.
The company wants to use its radioactive waste to build roads? Sure, no problem! Happy to help!
How about we also spend $20 million of taxpayer dollars to research using those gypsum stacks as a source of rare earth metals? Sure, no sweat!
And now they’re ready to build a wall around Mosaic’s bank account so not a single cancer-stricken mobile home resident can get at it.
But it’s not just the trailer park folks who’d be blocked from getting any of Mosaic’s moolah.
In 2013, Mosaic took one of its Polk County phosphate mines that had played out in the 1960s and converted it into a 36-hole golf resort called “Streamsong.” Two years ago, the company sold Streamsong to a Chicago sports management business for $160 million.
I sure hope they warn all the golfers to wear hazmat suits when they tee off.
 The backup plan
I tried repeatedly to get Mosaic officials to comment on their use of the Legislature to make an end-run around their losing battle in the courts.
For some reason, they were too busy to respond my questions. Perhaps they were preparing medical bills to send to those lucky Mulberry mobile homeowners getting all the free X-rays.
Meanwhile, fearing the Burgess bill might not make it across the finish line before the legislative session ended, the Florida Senate came up with a backup plan.
The pertinent content of the “Save Mosaic” bill was added as an amendment to SB 492, which has to do with wetlands destruction, which is also something Mosaic is good at. It has passed both the House and Senate unanimously.
Because they’ve doubled the company’s chances of success, it’s likely one of these bills makes into law. That would end any further legal challenge to Mosaic’s failure to clean up its mess
According to those ’50s movies, that means we should look for a lot of colossal basketball and football players coming from the high schools built on top of the formerly mined lands. Buying their clothes could be tricky. I’d recommend investing heavily in Spandex.
If you’re considering buying any Bone Valley property, you should definitely ask your realtor if it used to be at the bottom of a ginormous phosphate mine.
And if you know anyone who’s just purchased a home there, remember that the best housewarming gift is probably a Geiger counter.

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.



Federal education cuts and Trump DEI demands leave states, teachers in limbo  




In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
 ‘It’s the system that needs fixing’

Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version focused on the science of reading passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed a similar bill into law Monday to outlaw three-cueing.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”



Debate over holding back third graders roils state legislatures 




Sen. Kemp’s bill requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
 Opposition to ‘science of reading’

Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.



A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute


In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz and the Legislature are busy working on the state’s budget for the next two years. 
Their efforts to reduce state spending, however, are focused on two other realities: the state budget deficit forecast in 2028-29, and what is happening in Washington, D.C. 
The chaos in Washington is the bigger wild card. 
The actions of the Trump administration create two problems for the state budget. First, an increased risk of a recession. And, second, direct cuts of federal funds to the state.  
The funding cuts have already started, with reductions impacting public health, behavioral health, food shelves, transportation, housing projects and more. 
Whether it’s DOGE or Congress, there is no sign the cutting will stop any time soon. 
The biggest budgetary threat for Minnesota — and most states — is cuts to federal Medicaid spending. 
The U.S. House budget plan proposes to reduce funding for Medicare and Medicaid by $880 billion over the next ten years. Most observers expect Medicare will be held harmless and the bulk of the cuts will come from Medicaid. 
Medicaid, called Medical Assistance in Minnesota, serves about 1.3 million Minnesotans. It provides health coverage to low-income families and individuals, and long-term care for seniors and people with disabilities. 
Minnesota spent $18.5 billion on Medical Assistance in fiscal year 2024. Sixty percent of that funding — $11.1 billion — came from the federal government. 
Medical Assistance is the largest program in the state budget, and it is growing fast: Due to the rising cost of health care and the aging of the population, spending will exceed $26 billion in fiscal year 2029 — a 42% increase over five years according to the Department of Human Services. If the $880 billion federal reduction is spread proportionately across all states, DHS estimates Minnesota would lose about $1.4 to $1.6 billion per year in federal Medicaid funding. 
The actual impact depends on what policy changes Congress adopts. 
One of the most likely changes is adding work requirements for some Medicaid enrollees. Work requirements are a bad idea for a variety of reasons, as nicely summarized in this space a few weeks ago. 
It’s a bad policy, and it also doesn’t save a lot for the federal budget. A similar proposal in 2017 was estimated to save $109 billion over ten years, only a fraction of the $880 billion Congress is now pursuing. 
It’s not clear where Congress will look for additional Medicaid savings, but targeting the expansion population — a new group of people that were added to Medicaid coverage as part of the Affordable Care Act — is a definite possibility. 
The “expansion population,” as it is called, consists of adults without children. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, which enacted the Medicaid expansion, health coverage for these low-income adults was a significant gap in our nation’s health care system. Some states — including Minnesota — cobbled together some basic coverage, but it is difficult for a state to provide broad access to health care coverage without federal funding.

Dismantling a part of the ACA — aka, Obamacare — may be politically appealing to the GOP-controlled Congress. There would also be no impact on the 10 states that do not cover the expansion group — nine of which are solidly Republican, including Florida and Texas. 
KFF, an independent source for health care research and news, says one prominent proposal is to end the enhanced 90% federal funding match for the expansion population. States could continue to serve the expansion population but would get their normal rate of federal reimbursement.  
That normal match rate for Medicaid is called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP. These rates vary by state based on per capita income, ranging from 50% to 77%. Minnesota’s current FMAP is 51.16%.
If all states continued to cover the expansion population at the lower rate, KFF estimates the federal government would save $656 billion over the ten-year horizon.
But it is likely many — probably most — states would discontinue Medicaid coverage for the expansion group because they could not afford to make up the lost federal funding. 
It would cost Minnesota about $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2026 to continue covering the adults without kids expansion group. It is hard to see how the state could afford $1.2 billion a year under normal budget conditions, much less with the looming deficit and the threat of a recession. 
In Minnesota, 230,000 people would lose coverage. 
This population is one of the most marginalized groups in our society. Access to Medicaid has been particularly helpful in providing better access to mental health and substance use services.  
If this coverage goes away, it puts pressure on counties and underfunded community resources; many people will simply lose access to health care and behavioral health services. Uncompensated care — when people without insurance receive care in an emergency room, for instance — would increase, impacting community hospitals and shifting costs onto people who have insurance. 
The need for health care doesn’t go away — it just gets delayed, more serious and shifted to other budgets. 
Federal funding cuts across the state budget will force hard choices. The usual default is to say that the state can’t plug holes from federal cuts. 
And you can’t plug all the holes. But if the cuts are deep and broad, the state may need to reprioritize its own funds to fill the most crucial gaps. 
In this instance, recreating full Medicaid coverage is probably fiscally impossible. Some cobbled together gap filler, maybe. 
Progress is not a straight line going up — it is often two steps forward and one step back. 
But this would be a deeply harmful step back.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.
GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Sponsored by state Sen. Ben Brown, a Republican from Washington, the bill would prohibit public and charter schools from banning homeschooled or full-time virtual students from taking part in school athletics and activities.
A similar bill proposed by Brown in the last session stalled in the House. This year, Brown’s bill passed unanimously out of the Senate and passed the House Wednesday on a 91-53 vote.
Because the House made minor changes, it will return to the Senate for a final vote. Brown said he anticipates the bill will pass should it be taken up by the full Senate. The legislative session adjourns May 16.
State law allows public school districts to ban or restrict the participation of homeschoolers in athletics. The policy of the Missouri State High School Activities Association, which many schools follow, is to allow homeschoolers to participate in sports if they are enrolled in one credit hour of coursework at a public school.
State Rep. Ben Baker, a Republican from Neosho, said the bill “ensures that every child has access to opportunities that add to and foster their academic, social and personal growth.”
Baker, whose children have been homeschooled, argued that homeschoolers’ parents who pay taxes should be able to send their children to programs in publicly funded schools.
State Rep. Kathy Steinhoff, a Democrat from Columbia and former teacher, said she was sympathetic to the bill’s intent, but expressed concerns that the passage could lead to an unfunded mandate.
State funding for education is partially determined by the level of enrollment in a school. Steinhoff’s concern is that potential homeschoolers who take part in public school programs or utilize school resources would not be considered in enrollment counts.
“(Schools) will not be getting state money to support these students participating in these activities,” Steinhoff said.
Baker said the strain brought by increased participation would likely be minimal, as few homeschoolers would be likely to participate in each school.
Several Democrats also expressed concerns that the bill could be unfair to public school students as homeschoolers may not have to meet the same standards as public school students. Steinhoff pointed specifically to grade and attendance requirements for some athletic programs in schools.
“There’s also some requirements and conditions in accessing the privileges provided by our schools,” Steinhoff said. “Often you have to keep your grades up, you have to keep your attendance up, you have to maintain positive relationships with peers and adults.”
Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, spoke to the long history of this legislation, beginning with its first proposal in 2014 by former House Speaker Elijah Haahr. Deaton, along with other legislators, have taken up the bill unsuccessfully since then.
Deaton also pointed out a provision of the bill which allows schools to require homeschoolers to attend courses, rehearsals or practices related to their participation in school activities.
“For example, if you’re going to be involved in a band, and there’s a band class directly related to that, you absolutely should have to play in that band class,” Deaton said.
Another concern, voiced by Rep. Michael Burton, a Democrat from Lakeshire, involved vaccine requirements.
Missouri public school students are required to have several vaccines to attend school. Burton said he worries that unvaccinated homeschoolers participating in school activities could put public school students at risk.

(Preston Keres | USDA)In the first months of the administration of President Donald Trump, organizations working to keep Wisconsin’s environment healthy have seen cuts to key grant programs. Now they are watching for  Trump’s retreat from environmental protection to hit communities across the state. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it was cancelling the Climate Smart Commodities Program — a $3 billion effort to fund projects across the country to improve soil health, sequester carbon, reduce methane emissions and encourage other climate-friendly farming practices. 
Trump administration officials called the program a “Biden era slush fund,” saying that not enough of the money went directly to farmers. The USDA cancelled projects that did not meet three criteria: a minimum of 65% of funds needed to be going directly to producers, grants must have had one producer enrolled by the end of 2024 and at least one payment must have been made to a producer by the end of 2024. 
“The Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative was largely built to advance the green new scam at the benefit of NGOs, not American farmers,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement. “The concerns of farmers took a backseat during the Biden Administration. During my short time as Secretary, I have heard directly from our farmers that many of the USDA partnerships are overburdened by red tape, have ambiguous goals, and require complex reporting that push farmers onto the sidelines. We are correcting these mistakes and redirecting our efforts to set our farmers up for an unprecedented era of prosperity.”
A USDA fact sheet published last year states that 28 Wisconsin-based projects were funded by the program. One of the organizations receiving funding was the Fox-Wolf Watershed Alliance, which has worked to protect the Fox and Wolf Rivers — which are connected to Lake Michigan — for more than three decades in the region of the state most densely occupied by industrial agriculture operations. 
On April 22, the Alliance received an official termination notice for two grants it had received through the program to share costs with farmers to institute practices such as cover cropping and no-till planting, according to a statement from the alliance. Both practices help farmers maintain soil health and prevent potentially harmful nutrients such as phosphorus from running off fields and into the local water system. 
The grant funding also supported 10 technical support jobs at county land and water departments, Pheasants Forever and the Wisconsin Farmers Union. The loss of the money has resulted in the cancellation of 37 contracts with farmers, 4,000 acres of planned no-till planting going unfunded and, this fall, 16,000 acres of farmland that may not have cover crops planted. 
In its statement, the Alliance said that government support for programs like these is an investment that helps farmers long term, even if some of the money doesn’t go directly into their hands. 
“We fully support the goal of directing more resources to farmers. In fact, we design our programs with low overhead to ensure dollars go where they matter most,” the Alliance stated. “However, the review process did not account for one important factor: technical assistance is direct farmer support.” 
Just because the money doesn’t go straight to the farmers doesn’t mean they don’t benefit, according to the Alliance.
“Farmers often pay out-of-pocket for the kind of expertise our technical staff provide — support that is essential to the success and longevity of conservation practices,” the statement continued. “Excluding this from the ‘producer-directed’ category overlooks the real-world value of those services. Without that guidance, funding becomes a one-time transaction instead of a long-term investment. Fox-Wolf’s model is built not just on providing financial support, but on ensuring that practices are implemented effectively and sustained over time. That’s what makes our work effective — and why this funding mattered.” 
Jessica Schultz, the Alliance’s executive director, told the Wisconsin Examiner that the goal of the grants was to help the region’s farmers transition to these soil-friendly practices beyond just one season, allowing the organization to help protect the watershed, which is suffering from “excess phosphorus and sediment loading,” in the long term. 
“These practices also improve soil health, but transitioning to a continuous cover system requires a new approach to farm management. This shift can result in short-term yield losses or necessitate investment in new equipment,” Schultz said. “The cost-share provided through our grants would have played a vital role in helping farmers overcome these initial barriers. However, to realize lasting water quality improvements in our rivers and lakes, these conservation practices must be adopted consistently — not just for a single season, but year after year — across the majority of farmland in the basin.”
“The technical assistance offered through our projects was intended to support farmers through this transition, providing both expertise and access to equipment from across the region,” she continued. “Our goal was to foster long-term adoption by equipping producers with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed — not just for one growing season, but for the future health of our local waterways.” 
Climate and sustainability grants worth $100K canceled
The Fox-Wolf Watershed Alliance isn’t the only organization that has lost grant funding since Trump’s inauguration. Wisconsin Green Fire has already had two grants, totaling nearly $100,000, canceled, according to Meleesa Johnson, the organization’s executive director. 
The first grant, worth about $32,000, was aimed at working with the Wisconsin Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy to develop resources for local governments seeking to implement climate change mitigation strategies such as improving stormwater management and planting more trees to reduce heat island effects. The second grant was a $65,000 contract with the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service to establish a farm sustainability rewards program. Similar to the alliance’s grant, that program would have given farmers money in exchange for implementing practices such as no-till planting or reducing the use of nitrogen. 
Green Fire had already spent money on getting the farm sustainability program off the ground, and now, according to Johnson, it’s unclear if the organization will be reimbursed. 
“We’re not the only ones,” she said. “There’s a lot of groups out there that have been moving along, doing the work, meeting the benchmarks of contract expectations, and now, well, many of us are, most of us are not being paid for the work that we’ve all begun. So it’s hard. It’s not impossible for organizations to regroup, but it just makes it more difficult.”
Johnson said that this program was about getting money directly to farmers — even if the program’s description used the word “carbon.” 
“First and foremost, this was about getting money into the hands of farmers either already deploying good conservation practices or wanting to, [who] didn’t have the resources to do it,” she said. “This wasn’t about Green Fire. This was about farmers, and we were just developing the metric and the strategies to make sure that high performing farms with good conservation practices were being rewarded for doing really, really good work.” 
Without programs like these, Johnson said, Wisconsin will continue to “see that continual slow degradation of farm fields and water quality.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cattle-Iowa__USDA-photo.jpg,,,2025-05-01 07:00:54.357268

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Some Idaho education organizations and a local school board chairman said they are feeling squeezed by the public school budgets the Idaho Legislature set during the recent 2025 legislative session at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
In interviews this month, officials with the Idaho School Boards Association, the Idaho Education Association, a member of the Madison School District Board of Trustees and the superintendent of the Post Falls School District said they are frustrated with the new fiscal year 2026 public school budgets. They said the public schools budget provides no new additional state funding for anything other than pay increases and benefits for school staff.
Meanwhile, a key state legislator said the Idaho Legislature chose to focus on funding school facilities and reducing taxes.

The education officials say they appreciate the increased state funding to provide raises and benefits for teachers, school administrators and other school staffers who do not hold teaching certificates. But the school officials noted the Idaho Legislature provided additional funding for all state employees in all agencies and departments to receive pay raises.
Meanwhile, there is no additional new funding in the public school budgets for special education programs, classroom upgrades, technology, extra curricular programs or operations funding.

“Excepting the Luna laws budget that we had, this is the worst year for public schools from the state Legislature that I can remember,” Madison School District school board chair Brian Pyper said in a phone interview Friday.
Pyper was referring to a trio of education laws passed in 2011 that were named for former Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Luna. Idaho voters repealed the Luna laws at the polls in the November 2012 general election.
Post Falls School District Superintendent Dena Naccarato agreed.
“In my opinion, it’s the worst legislative session in my time in Idaho, and I’ve been an educator for 31 years,” Naccarato said in a phone interview Wednesday. 
 Calls to change Idaho’s school funding formula intensify 

Naccarato said one of the biggest problems is the public school funding formula that funds education based on an attendance calculation, not enrollment. Post Falls is the 11th largest school district in Idaho, and attendance averages about 92.6% of enrollment. 
Because of that, Naccarato said her district takes a 7.4% hit on operations funding – the difference between 92.6% attendance versus the 100% enrollment number. 
If 7% of the students are absent, Naccarato said that doesn’t mean she can turn down the heat by 7% or send 7% of the district’s teachers home without pay.  
Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield praised the Idaho Legislature for providing additional money for salaries and benefits this year.
But Critchfield said districts depend on operations funding. Critchfield also called for Idaho to change its funding mechanism for public schools.
“Clearly, I believe the time to address the overall limitations of the current funding mechanism is past due, and that need was reiterated in the Legislature’s most recent Office of Performance Evaluations report,” Critchfield said in a written statement Tuesday. “A longterm fix of how we distribute funding and effectively use the money we have must be on the table.”
 JFAC co-chair says Idaho legislators are focusing on tax cuts and payments for school facilities. Meanwhile, school enrollment is down. 

Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, said the Idaho Legislature actually provided $400 million in new funding for public education this year, just in different places outside the school budget.
Horman wrote a column earlier this month praising the Idaho Legislature’s budget process and highlighting a $400 million increase for public schools. 
  Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, speaks from the House floor on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun on Monday, Horman said the money is located outside of the public school budgets –  in tax cuts and in facilities payments to school districts that are used to pay down supplemental levies and bond issues for school facilities.
“If you’re only looking at the general fund, yeah, there’s $97.7 million, but that’s not all we gave to public schools – not by a long shot,” Horman said Monday. 
Horman said she has consistently pushed for $100 million-plus increases in public school funding over a decade of working on public school budgets in the Idaho Legislature. 
“(The public schools budget) has doubled in the time I’ve been on JFAC – It’s gone from $1.4 billion to $ 2.8 billion, plus this year,” Horman said. 
“We have been exceedingly responsive to the school districts when they have told us where they need the funds – that’s where we’ve put them,” Horman said. “But you can’t look at any one year in isolation. You have to look at the context. We focused on insurance. We focused on salaries. Now, the last couple of years, we’ve been focusing on facilities because that’s what people told us they needed.”
 Idaho Legislature’s budget committee co-chairwoman says state lawmakers have shifted funding priorities

Horman acknowledged school leaders may be feeling a pinch with the budget this year. But she said it is not because the Idaho Legislature is short-changing schools.

Horman said other factors are also at play, such as a decrease in public school students and changes in the types of students in Idaho. The Idaho Legislature has also chosen to shift its funding priorities to pay for salary increases for educators, funding for school facilities, paying down school levies and bond issues and lowering taxes, she said.
Horman cited budget documents prepared by the Idaho Legislative Services Office as the source for her $400 million claim. The documents list:

$97.8 million increase in state general fund spending on public schools.
$246 million in school facilities payments through a combination of House Bill 304, a property tax relief bill from this year’s legislative session, House Bill 521 from the 2024 legislative session and House Bill 292 from the 2023 legislative session.
$50 million from House Bill 338 from the 2025 legislative session for the Public School Facilities Cooperative Fund.
$5 million from Senate Bill 1069 from the 2025 legislative session for literacy professional development and curriculum. 

Horman also said she has fought to change the public school funding formula for 10 years and favors giving school boards discretion over spending. This year, Horman sponsored House Bill 279, an unsuccessful bill that sought to move Idaho to a per-student funding model based on attendance. 
 Why are education groups concerned with the Idaho public school budgets? 

Idaho School Boards Association Deputy Director Quinn Perry said school board members have been asking about Horman’s column and questioning if the budget increase adds up.
“Our members are asking questions based on what they read from policy makers, and they are asking, ‘where did it increase that much?’” Perry said in a phone interview. “We are having to over-explain in our breakdown of the budget why that is not new money and why it can’t go into operations. It’s specifically for facilities infrastructure.”
Pyper said the facilities money is valuable, but districts don’t have any flexibility in spending it. The facilities money is being used to reduce tax rates or pay off debt that voters agreed to when  they passed a school bond to finance large long-term projects, such as the construction of new school buildings or roof repairs.
“I recognize that has been allocated to help school districts pay off bonds and levies but that’s all it can be used for,” Pyper said. “If we have levies or bonds, it goes to that and not operations. So that’s when we have to get creative or shuffle money around from other places.”
Another concern is that charter schools, which are public schools in Idaho, are not able to access the facilities funding because they cannot run school bonds or levies, Perry said.
 What about discretionary spending for Idaho’s public school districts?

Perry and Pyper said they have big two concerns with the new public schools budget the Idaho Legislature set.
First, there is an overall decrease in the amount of discretionary funding that public schools receive.

The money is called discretionary spending because school leaders have flexibility in how they spend it on local needs and priorities.
Critchfield, Idaho’s superintendent of public instruction, said discretionary funding is crucial for local school districts. Education officials and superintendents often use the terms “discretionary funding” and “operations funding” interchangeably.
“A priority area of a local school budget is always operational dollars, which provide the greatest ability to address local needs due to their flexibility,” Critchfield said Tuesday. “Without an inflation-related adjustment in operational funding, districts will continue to pay for things like special education, fuel and utilities with discretionary dollars that have remained flat.”
Pyper, from the Madison School Board, said the decrease in discretionary/operations funding could force school districts to be creative financially or consider supplemental levies to pay for unexpected expenses, enhancements or any new programs.
“We have huge uncertainty with all the tariffs, and we are still looking at 6-to-7% inflation,” Pyper said.  
Horman, the legislator who co-chairs the budget committee, said discretionary spending is going down because of a decrease in Idaho students and changes to the types of students. 
One of the calculations driving Idaho’s public school budget is the number of support units in the budget. For budget purposes, one support unit is basically the equivalent of one school classroom. Because there is a decrease in the number of public school students in Idaho, the number of support units the state’s public school budget is built around decreased, which led to a decrease in the amount of discretionary spending for public schools.

“Discretionary funding impacts local taxpayers the most because patrons are often asked to supplement the variable costs of educating their students and running their local schools,” Critchfield said. “Statewide enrollment has experienced slight changes the last several years, but the cost of running a school district continues to increase.”
 New evaluation report highlights special education funding gap in Idaho 

Perry and Pyper also said the state is underfunding special education and special needs students. 
This year, the Idaho Legislature did not provide any additional money to bridge an $82.2 million special education funding gap that the nonpartisan Idaho Office of Performance Evaluations highlighted in a March report. 
House Bill 291 would have created a new $3 million state fund to help high-needs students with disabilities. Horman voted for it, but when House Bill 291 reached the Idaho Senate, senators killed it by a single vote.
“The Legislature’s own report showed they are underfunding special needs by about $85 million across the state and they refused to provide us a $3 million stopgap to address critical needs, saying the money is sufficient when their own report says it is not,” Pyper said. 
Naccarato, the superintendent of the Post Falls School District, said her district receives about $5.6 million in state and federal funding for special education, but it spent about $8.2 million because the number of special education students is increasing. Naccarato said there is a $2.6 million gap that she has to make up with money from elsewhere. 
“My discretionary budget is fake news,” Neccarato said. “It’s not discretionary, it’s operations funding because the legislative body continues to do nothing to support public education in the 21st century.”  
Naccarato said the Post Falls School District is seeking a supplemental levy in the upcoming May 20 election. She said the district is seeking the levy due to funding gaps Naccarato blames the Idaho Legislature for, as well as a desire to pay staff more than what the Idaho Legislature provides. 
“Most school districts in Idaho have to rely on supplemental levies for operations costs,” Naccarato said, adding that is why she calls them fundamental levies, not supplemental levies. 
 Idaho Legislature approved tax credits for tuition at private schools this year 

Along with concerns about the state’s public school budget, many of the education officials interviewed in this article are concerned about House Bill 93, a new law co-sponsored by Horman that provides a refundable tax credit to Idaho families for education expenses, including tuition at private religious schools.
“There is a definite hesitation this year on the back of HB 93 where the big fear among school board leaders is their needs will be overshadowed,” Perry said. 
Horman disagreed and said House Bill 93 did not take money from the public school budget and is a separate program and initiative. 
“As I explained on the (House) floor multiple times, they are unrelated,” Horman said.




 Behind the numbers: enrollment and school funding 

The first spreadsheet posted below this box shows 10 years’ worth of enrollment data at Idaho public schools. Total enrollment this school year is down by almost 500 students compared to last year.
The second document shows how support units are calculated in public school budgets. For budget purposes, a support unit is roughly equivalent to one Idaho school classroom.
The documents were provided by Horman via the Idaho Legislative Services Office.

Though the islands are interested in Wyoming coal, deals might not come in time to help beleaguered Kemmerer coal mine, Gordon said.
The post Governor: Trade mission to Japan, Taiwan could increase Wyoming fossil fuel exports appeared first on WyoFile .","Gov. Mark Gordon recently joined several Wyoming business proprietors at a trade show in Taiwan, where Casper-based Backwards Distilling Company and Gillette-based Big Lost Meadery are highly regarded and very popular, he said. But the popularity of Wyoming spirits wasn’t the main thrust of the visit.
In both Taiwan and Japan, Gordon and other Wyoming dignitaries visited with business and ministry officials who are interested in Wyoming’s coal and natural gas, as well as strengthening partnerships to push carbon capture technologies to help those fossil fuels fit within their low-carbon-emission goals.
Both potential markets rely heavily on energy fuel imports, Gordon said, while officials in Taiwan believe that “about 20% of their energy mix is going to remain with coal and they’re very anxious to get Powder River coal.”
Taiwan has its own elected government, but the People’s Republic of China claims it has sovereignty over the island off its coast.

Gordon called a press conference Wednesday to highlight his trade mission to the region earlier this month. He was joined by officials from the University of Wyoming, Wyoming Energy Authority as well as representatives from energy producers Jonah Energy, Williams Companies and coal-to-products company Kanata Clean Power & Climate Technologies Corp.
“It builds confidence, which is very important in Asia,” Gordon said of the international talks. “And so this leads us to believe that there is a lot of very exciting opportunity.”
One primary tangible outcome Gordon hopes to come of strengthening ties with the two foreign markets is to reinvigorate efforts to build coal and natural gas port terminals to increase the international export of those Wyoming commodities. While the U.S. has increased its capacity to export liquified natural gas, efforts to expand coal ports, particularly on the West Coast, have faltered for years.
But Gordon believes that with public-private investment, along with policy support from President Donald Trump, those efforts will be revitalized.
It will require “looking at whether the Millennium Bulk Terminal can be reinvigorated, or Jordan Cove [terminal] or whether a couple of these other things in Oakland that have been talked about from time to time could come to fruition,” Gordon said. Increasing Wyoming’s fossil fuel exports might also require “going out of the Gulf of America [Gulf of Mexico] and going through the Panama Canal,” he added.

Asked whether the state’s trade efforts might help the beleaguered Kemmerer coal mine land export contracts in time to save it from potentially closing, Gordon said, “I don’t have a silver bullet for that right now. But I can tell you, I’m rummaging around in my ammo box for it.”
Carbon capture hopes and Kemmerer coal
Kemmerer Operations LLC recently laid off 28 workers, and many in southwest Wyoming worry there may be more job losses, or that the mine might even close.
The mine’s biggest customer — the nearby Naughton power plant, which accounts for about 42% of the mine’s coal production, according to federal documents — will stop burning coal by the end of the year as its owner, PacifiCorp, converts the plant to natural gas fuel. 
There remains a mix of hope and skepticism for two proposals to tap the Kemmerer coal mine for coal-to-products projects — potentially making up for the pending loss of the Naughton coal contract. In fact, an official from Kanata Clean Power & Climate Technologies Corp. joined Gordon on the Japan and Taiwan trade mission.

The company proposes a multi-billion-dollar effort to cleanly convert about 1.8 million tons of Kemmerer coal annually into ammonia, primarily as an agricultural fertilizer. Another company, TriSight LLC, claims to have “unlocked” a process to convert the coal into myriad products, including graphite, agricultural fertilizer and makeup — using about 1 million tons per year from the Kemmerer mine, all while avoiding coal’s typical carbon emissions. 
But neither project appears on the Wyoming Industrial Siting Council’s working list of applications — a required regulatory step for such projects. Taken at face value, the lack of an ISC permit application indicates that neither proposal is likely to consume Kemmerer coal within the next year or so.
“The Wyoming coal-to-ammonia project team is evaluating multiple siting alternatives, a list of alternatives that includes the Kemmerer mine surface lease,” F.E. “Wally” Wolski, who works with Kanata, told WyoFile via email.

Although WyoFile has not fully investigated the financial preparedness of either TriSight or Kanata, some southwest Wyoming officials regard both coal-to-products proposals as a potential lifeline for the mine. Kemmerer City Administrator Brian Muir told WyoFile that both projects underscore signs of a potential rebound in the coal market and the potential for technologies to find new uses for coal.
“This is not over yet,” Muir told WyoFile in March. “There’s years and years of coal reserves here, and technologies to convert [coal into products].”
Among the most exciting topics discussed on his trade mission to Japan and Taiwan, Gordon said, was an agreement to support coal technologies that reduce its carbon footprint.
“[We talked] about the progression of technologies that could go forward, and that generated a lot of excitement,” Gordon said.

Complaints about fees and timeliness led a legislative committee to prioritize the issue this off-season. 
The post Wyoming legislators to review public records, open meetings laws appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming lawmakers are set to discuss the state’s public record and open meetings laws next week in Lander. What changes, if any, the Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee may seek remains to be seen, but legislators made the subject an off-season priority due to a variety of concerns. 
“Complaints have arisen in a few areas,” according to a letter sent by the Joint Corporations Committee chairmen to the Legislature’s Management Council in March. 
Those concerns related to the effectiveness of the state’s ombudsman program, the costs government entities impose on records requesters and the “ignorance and disregard of public records and public meetings statutes by public officials,” the letter states. 
“I know we can tackle the fee question and the timeliness and maybe some small changes. A bigger rewrite is a big lift,” Senate Corporations Committee Chairman Cale Case, R-Lander, told WyoFile. 
“But I think we should hear what’s wrong with our open meetings, public records, all that stuff,” he said. 
How Wyoming compares
Ahead of the meeting, the Legislative Service Office prepared a memo comparing Wyoming’s laws with neighboring states. There are multiple notable differences.
For one, Wyoming’s definition of public records differs from most other states, according to the memo, in the way it specifies that public records only include information in physical form. 
“In contrast, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Utah define records as public regardless of format,” the memo states. 
The Equality State also requires public records to relate to official functions or public business, whereas most neighboring states define it more broadly to encompass any document belonging to, used by, or maintained by a public entity. 
While Wyoming does not specify fee amounts for copies or staff time, according to the memo, other states have established fixed rates. That includes Colorado, which stipulates that the cost of copying a page may not exceed 25 cents, and the hourly rate for staff time is set at $30 and is adjusted every five years for inflation. Colorado and other neighboring states also offer a certain number of copies or staff time hours free of charge before fees apply. 
“Some states, including Colorado, Idaho, South Dakota and Utah, provide fee waivers if the requester can demonstrate that releasing the records is of public interest, is not for personal gain, or the requester experiences financial hardship,” the memo states. 
Wyoming is one of four states in the country to have specific exemptions for lawmakers, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Meaning, that unlike city council or school board members across the state, legislators are largely not subject to public records requests. 
The Legislature passed such an exemption in 2006, and then doubled down and voted to override Gov. Dave Freudenthal’s veto of the bill. 
Ombudsman

Wyoming’s public records ombudsman also sets it apart from most of its neighbors. 
For about three years, it’s been Darlena Potter’s job to educate public officials about what’s required of them under the law and to help resolve issues regarding records requests of state and local government agencies. 
Complaints can be submitted to the ombudsman, who can then mediate disputes, prescribe timelines for the release of records and waive fees charged by a governmental entity. 
The Legislature created the position in 2019 as part of a broader public records reform effort. The changes also created a 30-day deadline for the release of most records and required governmental entities to designate a public records person and post their contact information on the Department of Administration and Information’s website. 
What the 2019 law did not do was authorize the ombudsman to enforce Wyoming’s public records laws. And as a result, government entities don’t always comply and disputes continue to land in court. 
As Potter told WyoFile last month, she’s optimistic about lawmakers’ renewed interest in her role and improving public record statutes. She’s scheduled to address the committee at next week’s meeting.

A birth certificate stamped Wyoming doesn't qualify as authority or expertise, guest columnist Marion Yoder writes.
The post Nativism is no virtue appeared first on WyoFile .","Amazingly, I’ve found common ground with Freedom Caucus legislators Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, and Steve Johnson, R-Cheyenne. They recently wrote in Cheyenne’s paper about the fallacy that one must be born in Wyoming to want to help the state. They correctly stated, “If the only qualification for good policy is a birth certificate stamped in Wyoming, we’re in trouble.” Too bad they didn’t stop there and omit claiming the Freedom Caucus, infamous for recent blunders like unconstitutionally gutting public education and encouraging guns in grade schools, aspires to “uphold the Constitution.” 

Opinion

Still, they’re right that Wyoming birth qualifies no one as an authority on Wyoming. Like so much else, you don’t choose your birthplace. Same with skin color, sexual identity and family of origin. Everyone’s entitled to relish heritage, but not to borrow glory.
Not that I don’t try. The good representatives continued, “Ideas should rise or fall on their own merit — not on where someone’s great-grandfather ran cattle.” As it happens, mine ran his in Laramie County, which then reached to Montana. My forebears were, wait for it, immigrants, having struck out twice further east. Like many others, they came here seeking a better life. They relied upon the kindness of a Native American family who looked after my 12-year-old grandfather for the winter while my great-grandfather went back to Iowa to bring out more Yoders.  
To the extent that this story might inform my own ideas about the value of immigrants today, wonderful. But I deserve no points for the postholes they dug for the Swan Company or the homestead they bought out and improved on Bear Creek.  
When Becket Hinckley, born and raised in Basin, ran successfully for a Cheyenne seat in the 2000s, he was vilified as a Californian — he’d attended Stanford. Such parochialism inspired my letter to the editor, with which Pendergraft and Johnson should logically agree.  
Today, protesters are showing up all around Wyoming to resist the excesses and abuses of the Trump administration. Harriet Hageman has received her fair share of complaints about it. What has been her reaction?  
When her responses were jeered in Laramie on March 19, she called the protesters “organized.” Her apologists claimed they were paid and brought into the state to flood the event. I attended her March 20 town hall in Wheatland, which was packed with what looked and sounded to me like Wyoming people. I heard, “I’m a lifelong Republican, but I’m worried about __________” repeatedly.   
Hageman thereafter switched to virtual town halls but is now doing very controlled in-person events. You must preregister, giving your full name, address, and email address, and agree to receive her newsletter. It’s not clear if out-of-staters or even out-of-county Wyomingites will be allowed in.
I bet no one except police is being paid to show up at the rallies I attend. I recognize lots of people — from church, volunteer work and around town. They’re hardly out-of-staters “being brought in” or “paid.” At one, I asked a mother and daughter where they were from and they said Saddle Ridge, north of Cheyenne. Most people driving past the Capitol honking in support display the ugly new Wyoming plates.
But so what if some protesters aren’t from Wyoming? Does it make their concerns about the state of the country any less compelling if they call Nebraska or Colorado home? I write to senators from other states whenever the spirit moves me. To his staff’s credit, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., answers, even though I live here. His recent reply was quicker and lots better than what I get from Barrasso. His milquetoast assertions about the “waste, fraud and abuse” co-president Musk has “found” fall flat and ignore the fallout Barrasso’s constituents are suffering under Musk’s chainsaw.
Call me a foolish optimist, but I think it’s great for America that people are exercising First Amendment rights and demanding that our leaders know just how dimly we view the improper rejigging of our government. It’s good for the body politic to remind itself where the real power in this country is — vested in us. If that means that we, the people, have to walk around carrying signs, so be it. I just wish I’d needlepointed one I saw on TV: “I’m so angry I stitched this so I could legally stab something 4000 times.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Leaders of the Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM), a national network of immigration reform activists, held a virtual press conference Wednesday, ahead of a nationwide day of action on May 1. Although May Day demonstrations are held annually, this year the protests carry a new gravity. Leaders of organizations including FAIR, composed of 38 immigrant-led groups across 32 states, drew attention to the arrest of Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan, and growing concerns about the Trump Administration targeting immigrant communities. 
Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of the Wisconsin-based Voces de la Frontera, said momentum to resist Trump’s  policies has grown after the April 1 Wisconsin Supreme Court election. “It was a resounding defeat at the voting booth for Trump’s endorsed candidate for our state Supreme Court race, and a resounding rejection of Elon Musk’s blatant efforts to buy our election,” Neumann-Ortiz said during the Wednesday press conference.

After the election, Wisconsinites mobilized to participate in mass protests against Trump and Musk’s firing of federal workers and canceling of federal programs. United, mass actions, Neumann-Ortiz said, will be crucial in the days ahead. The May Day protest, she said, “really represents the next iteration in this warring resistance to Trump’s efforts to impose dictatorship in this country, and to really challenge the scapegoating of immigrants and refugees for social inequality [while]  he is contributing to significantly widening that gap.” 
May Day also will be an important platform to build alliances between working-class people, she said. Neumann-Ortiz said communities in Wisconsin had recently experienced “an operation that was being conducted by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security investigators under so-called ‘wellness checks’ of unaccompanied [immigrant] minors and their sponsors’ homes.” 
Voces de la Fronterea learned of the operation through a 24/7 immigration emergency hotline the group operates. Neumann-Ortiz told Wisconsin Examiner that Voces de la Frontera is aware of such cases in Milwaukee, Whitewater, and Waukesha. The group had received a call involving an 8th grade student who was home alone when several armed agents arrived, allegedly saying they didn’t need a judicial warrant to enter. 
“So again, it was just these manipulative tactics,” Neumann-Ortiz told Wisconsin Examiner. After Voces de la Frontera was contacted, the group sent an immediate community response to assess what was going on. “What we uncovered is that basically this was an operation that’s being conducted to check in on unaccompanied minors who had come through and had a sponsor like, in this case, a family member. But again, this is not the role of the FBI. Their job is to target organized crime, or trafficking, things like that. They do not…This is not how any kind of wellness check is conducted. This is not the body…the agency that would do that.”

Neumann-Ortiz said that Voces members insisted that if agents wanted to interview the minor, they should go to an attorney’s office to do the interview. “We do feel that this is, I would say, highly suspect in terms of what could unfold.”
Wisconsin Examiner reached out to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) offices in Milwaukee regarding the “wellness checks.” A FBI spokesperson said in an emailed statement that, “The FBI is assisting our partners including, Homeland Security Investigations and Office of Refugee Resettlement, with a nationwide effort to conduct welfare checks on thousands of unaccompanied children who have been identified as crossing the border without a parent or legal guardian. Sadly, children crossing the border alone and living in the U.S. without the protection of a loving parent or guardian can be vulnerable to exploitation, trafficking, and violence. Protecting children is a critical mission for the FBI and we will continue to work with our federal, state, and local partners to secure their safety and well-being.”
An ICE spokesperson said in an email the agency is “familiar” with the Wisconsin Examiner’s inquiry, and said to contact the Department of Homeland Security. In response to Wisconsin Examiner’s inquiry, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement, “The previous administration allowed many of these children who came across the border unaccompanied to be placed with sponsors who were actually smugglers and sex traffickers.” 
McLaughlin added, “DHS is leading efforts to conduct welfare checks on these children to ensure that they are safe and not being exploited. Unlike the previous administration, President Trump and Secretary Noem take the responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to reunite children with their families. In less than 100 days, Secretary Noem and Secretary Kennedy have already reunited over 5,000 unaccompanied children with a relative or safe guardian.”

Since late March, at least three people have been arrested by ICE agents as they appeared at the Milwaukee County Courthouse for routine proceedings. The most recent arrest also resulted in an FBI investigation being launched against Judge Dugan, who federal agencies accuse of obstructing their effort to arrest a man who was appearing before her. The arrest drew thousands of people into the streets to support Dugan. On Saturday, April 26, over 1,200 people gathered outside the Milwaukee FBI office, decrying Dugan’s arrest as authoritarian, fascist, and inconsistent with American values. 
On the press conference call Wednesday, Neumann-Ortiz was joined by leaders of FIRM-member organizations from across the country. May Day protests are expected in states across the country. David Chiles, interim executive director of Sunflower Community Action in Kansas said Trump’s policies are “a race to the bottom” and “a war on wages, on benefits, on dignity itself.” Chiles said that on Thursday, “we’re fighting back.” Cathryn Jackson, public policy director of CASA, who will march with groups toward the White House, said, “Immigrants and allies are rising up to say ‘enough is enough.’  May 1, international day of action, we are joining hundreds of marches, rallies, walk-outs, demonstrations with one very clear unified message” — One struggle, one fight, workers unite.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)For more than a year, state LGBTQ advocates spearheaded a campaign that helped hundreds of transgender individuals obtain U.S. passports that reflect their gender identity and physical appearance after Tennessee ended gender updates for state drivers’ licenses. 
But an executive order issued on President Donald Trump’s first day in office — declaring U.S. policy is to “recognize two sexes, male and female” — ended the ability of transgender people to get passports that reflect their gender. A federal court temporarily blocked the order last month, but a final legal outcome has yet to be decided.
In Tennessee, where state officials in 2023 denied trans people the right to make gender changes on driver’s licenses, Trump’s executive order has jeopardized the only available form of government-issued ID available that accurately reflects the gender of transgender and nonbinary Tennesseans.
“Tennessee has the least amount of access to change gender markers,” said Molly Quinn, executive director of OUTMemphis. “A lot of transgender people here used passports as their primary gender marker.”
Trump’s order, she said, has created anxiety and uncertainty. On the day the president issued it,  Quinn’s organization fielded 27 calls from individuals anxious to learn whether they could still begin the passport application process, she said. 
Tennessee has long prevented trans people from amending their gender designation on birth certificates, the only state in the nation to explicitly do so. 
The 1977 law was upheld last year by the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit Court, which found “there is no fundamental right to a birth certificate recording gender identity instead of biological sex.”










Tennessee has the least amount of access to change gender markers. A lot of transgender people here used passports as their primary gender marker.


– Molly Quinn, OUTMemphis


Gender, however, could be amended on Tennessee drivers’ licenses until Republican-backed legislation in 2023 defined “sex” in Tennessee law as “a person’s immutable biological sex as determined by anatomy and genetics existing at time of birth.” Evidence of biological sex, the law said, is listed on a birth certificate.
The Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security then posted notice of new rules that it would not accept requests for gender marker changes that were inconsistent with an individuals’ birth certificate.  A legal challenge to the department’s rules, filed last year by the ACLU of Tennessee in Davidson County Chancery Court, remains ongoing.
Immediately following the drivers license notice, OUTMemphis, ACLU of Tennessee and other advocacy organizations made a statewide push to help individuals secure U.S. passports.
Between the passage of the 2023 Tennessee legislation and Trump’s inauguration, the groups assisted more than 200 people in obtaining a U.S. passport to reflect their gender identity and physical presentation, Quinn said.
Government issued documents that reflect accurate gender identity and appearance can be critically important, Quinn noted. 
Interactions with police or Transportation Safety Agency officers at security checkpoints examining IDs that appear at odds with an individual’s physical appearance may subject individuals to interrogation, allegations of fraud or criminal behavior and harassment. IDs are also checked by employers, financial institutions and election officials.
Christian Mays, community center coordinator for OUTMemphis, said all his official identity documents identify him as female. Mays, a transgender man, said he was pulled over once by police who accused him of impersonating someone else, because he presented as a man but his ID listed him as a woman. 
Mays recently got his name legally changed. He submitted his passport application to include his male gender identity the day before Trump’s executive order. His chief concern at the time was the ability to apply for a part time job at a pizza restaurant, which would require an ID. 
He said he is now uncertain whether a passport reflecting his gender identity will come through.
“I was thinking it was finally my time,” Mays said.

For Wisconsin, the longer term outlook appears more certain, although there may be little comfort from that.

Speaking at an economic forecast luncheon hosted by the Wisconsin Bankers Association and the news outlet WisBusiness, part of WisPolitcs.com, Dale Knapp, director of research at Forward Analytics, reviewed the persistent demographic slump that has put Wisconsin on a troubling trajectory for the coming decades.
That trajectory has been evident already for some 20 years, Knapp said, and it centers on the population bulge from baby boomers — people born between 1946 and 1964. That generation was 65% more numerous than the group born in the previous 19-year period, he said. And the subsequent generations have been about 20% smaller in number or even less.
The baby boom produced an explosion of demand for everything from toys to homes to schools and universities, Knapp observed. Now the last of that generation is passing into retirement, and with smaller populations in the generations that follow there are “worker shortages all across the state,” Knapp said.

Between 2020 and 2040, the working age population, ages 18 to 64, is projected to fall by 15% on average in all but six Wisconsin counties, Knapp said. Automation may pick up the slack in some industries, including manufacturing and possibly fast food service, he suggested.
Immigration is another remedy, Knapp said — but also “a challenge given what’s going on in the White House now.”
“We need to fix the border problem to a degree,” Knapp said. “If you do that, then maybe you can get the two parties in Washington together and say, ‘OK, we need to fix legal immigration by expanding it.'”
Knapp’s other proffered solution is to invest funds to offer families $16,000 to move to Wisconsin from out of state. With 3,000 families a year, the money could be repaid with the added income and sales tax revenues, “and we could fund it forever,” he said.
National economic uncertainty
Outlining the current state of the nation’s pocketbook and its near-term forecast, economist Andrea Sorensen of US Bank in Minneapolis said that the economy “is actually doing probably better than most people think.”
That’s despite the uncertainty that has ballooned since President Donald Trump took office in January, she said. That uncertainty also looms over the horizon, however.
The nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) — the broadest measure of the overall economy — has been growing by more than 2% over the last couple of years through the end of 2024.
  US Bank economist Andrea Sorensen speaks at a Wisconsin Bankers Association luncheon Wednesday, April 30, 2025. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)
Data issued Wednesday morning showed GDP shrank 0.3% in the first quarter. Sorensen said that was for an unusual reason, however.
U.S. businesses stocked up on goods from overseas to get ahead of the tariffs Trump imposed after taking office, she said. She attributed the slight first-quarter dip to those imports, because their value is subtracted from GDP.
The GDP estimate released Wednesday is the first of three that will be produced for the quarter, and Sorensen said her economic team believes the next two estimates will be better.
She views other indicators as relatively favorable.
The national labor market remains strong. Month-to-month employment growth has cooled some since the hiring spikes that followed the economic crash from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Still, “we still consider it to be quite healthy,” she said.
“People who have jobs have money to spend,” Sorensen said. “So as long as the labor market is holding up, we think the economy could be OK.”
Consumer spending also remains strong, she said, even though surveys show dramatic declines in both consumer and business confidence.
“We know it means people are not happy and they don’t have high hopes,” Sorensen said. “But if we’re talking recession, that sort of depressed sentiment needs to translate into actual economic activity. And so far, it hasn’t. And we’re not actually sure if it will.”
Tariffs are a wild card
The Trump administration’s tariff policies, however, remain a major wild card.
A broad 10% tax on imports that took effect April 5 remains in place with a few exceptions. Tariffs of up to 50% on about 60 countries are on a 90-day pause. An active tariff remains on goods from China — initially 125% and more recently raised to 145%.
Overall that’s netted out to a U.S. effective tariff rate — the net tariff on all imports from other countries — between 25% and 30%. That’s 10 times the effective tariff rate of 2.5% a year ago.
“This hasn’t happened in over 100 years,” Sorensen said. “The economy is just structurally very different, and we can try to make forecasts and comparisons —  and we do all day every day —  but we don’t know. There is just so much unknown what this will do.”
For that reason, economic uncertainty is “sky high,” she continued. “I don’t think anyone really knows what’s going on.”
Businesses “are kind of paralyzed,” Sorensen said. “How can you make a business investment decision if you have no idea what tariffs are going to be tomorrow, next week, next year?”
Some larger employers have already begun announcing plans to reshore work in the U.S. But Sorensen said in response to one audience member’s question that isn’t an option for many smaller employers.
A company that sources products overseas might gain a temporary advantage by returning production to the U.S., she said.
“They can’t risk making the wrong choice,” however, Sorensen said. “What we’re hearing is they don’t trust that that tariff will remain in place. So, they can’t make the investment decisions to bring production back to the U.S. because they might want to undo it again as soon as policy changes.”
In addition, “our supply chains are so intertwined that everything has some input that’s imported,” she said.
Tariffs will also squeeze low- and middle-income households, where spending takes a larger share of their earnings — “households that were already struggling,” Sorensen said.
Migration presents another pressure point. Policies to reduce immigration and deport immigrants will hurt some states and some sectors of the economy more than others, she said.
Yet an additional unknown is how the escalating trade conflicts with the rest of the world will affect services — where the U.S. has a trade surplus.
“President Trump has never mentioned that, because he probably doesn’t want us to know that, right? It makes trade look a little more fair, but that’s not the story he wants,” Sorensen said.
So far, other countries haven’t targeted U.S. services in retaliation for the tariffs it has imposed.
Nevertheless, “if countries really want to get us economically, they would go after services,” Sorensen said.

(Michael Loccisano | Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
‘It’s the system that needs fixing’
Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed it into law Monday.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
The new law requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading. That bill died in House Education.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
Opposition to ‘science of reading’
Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.










A student's likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute


In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

The Census is the oldest continuous data collection effort run by the federal government, and is collected every 10 years, shaping the country’s data infrastructure for over two centuries. 
At its core, it is meant to be an official, complete count of the United States’ population. It may record details about people such as age, gender and living arrangements. But more than that, the census is critical to the well-being of children and the entire U.S. 

Why? Here are a few things the census can do for all of us:
Representation: The census determines how many seats each state gets in the House of Representatives and is used to draw Congressional and state legislative districts.
Funding: It plays a pivotal role in determining how we fund federal programs like Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), highway planning and the Pell Grant program.
Research: Governments and nonprofits utilize the census data to make decisions, such as planning community services, infrastructure and housing developments, and determining where hospitals get built.
Equity: If done correctly, the census can shed light on disparities within states and communities, helping to fight for racial, economic and geographic equity.
The census isn’t perfect, though. Unfortunately, children — especially young children, Black and Brown children, children experiencing homelessness, and children in low-income households — are most often routinely undercounted. This creates serious consequences for education, health care and other pivotal support programs.
And recently, there have been emerging efforts to erode trust in the census through misinformation, loss of advisory committees and attacks on census participation.
In March, following executive orders to terminate “unnecessary” advisory committees, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick disbanded three critical groups: the Census Scientific Advisory Committee, the National Advisory Committee on Racial, Ethnic, and Other Populations, and the 2030 Census Advisory Committee. 
These groups offered scientific and technical guidance, including cybersecurity, survey methodology and strategies for reaching diverse populations. They have historically been bipartisan, improving census quality and community trust. Their loss will make it harder to design effective outreach and ensure vulnerable populations are fully counted.
Undermining the census in these ways weakens the foundation of the Kids Count data we use at the Michigan League for Public Policy — and important data used by organizations across the nation who serve kids and families. Kids Count relies heavily on accurate resident population and demographic estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
When census data is incomplete or unreliable — due to disbanded advisory committees, underfunded surveys, or the strategic addition of sensitive questions to suppress participation — it directly compromises our ability to measure and track child well-being at national, state and local levels.
According to Count All Kids, the count of young children was even worse in 2020 than in 2010. Researchers and advocates can’t make the case for necessary policy solutions if we are undercounting vulnerable children. When kids are counted, it gives their communities more power to secure funding for programs that matter.
Trust is crucial to ensuring full census participation. Title 13 of the United States Code guarantees the confidentiality of census responses, making it illegal for the Census Bureau to publish or share identifiable information. It is important that people know their information is protected under federal law — this helps maintain public trust and participation, even amid political concerns. Building trust through community-based outreach, using locally trusted messengers, remains key. We must also demand policies that restore advisory committees and protect childrens’ data. Investing in census education and community engagement hubs, and ensuring strong data privacy protections, will be critical for the 2030 Census.
The census is not simply a count — it’s the cornerstone of fair resource distribution and democratic representation. Preparing and advocating for the 2030 Census shouldn’t begin in 2029. It begins today. Protecting our data is protecting our democracy, and we must act to ensure that every person is seen, valued and counted.

Jim Risch, R-Idaho, met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in June 2022 in Kyiv. (Screenshot from Instagram video)Although U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, is one of those congressional lifers who does not have a particularly distinguished record on domestic issues, he has exercised good sense on some national security issues. He has long seen the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance as an essential component of America’s national defense. For instance, in 2023 he called NATO “the most successful political and defensive organization that’s ever been on the face of the planet.” He elaborated: “NATO is important because the national security of the United States of America is the most important issue that the federal government exists for. And there is nothing that gives us better security than the NATO organization.”
Risch has correctly understood that the national security of the United States and other NATO nations would be seriously endangered if Russia were to win its genocidal war against Ukraine. In December of 2022, the senator listed a long list of actions he had taken that year to “ensure Ukraine has the equipment and support it needs to win.” It included his Senate Resolution 713, condemning Putin’s genocidal war against the Ukrainians, including countless “heinous crimes against humanity.” 
Risch has sounded the alarm that, “Putin is not going to stop with Ukraine” if he wins the war. If we end up in war with Russia, what we’re spending here is a drop in the bucket by comparison.” That is, a win by Russia in Ukraine would lead to a follow-on attack against some of our NATO partners, which would require the United States to enter the hostilities. It does not get more serious than that.
The U.S. has stood strong with Ukraine because of the threat the war poses to U.S. security. President Biden could have been more forceful in providing sophisticated weapons and few restrictions on their usage. Nevertheless, the Ukrainians were able to hold their own, largely because they were fighting for their very freedom and existence. The U.S. was filling the support role that France had played during the dark days of America’s Revolutionary War, a role that was instrumental in the birth of our nation.
Tragically, that all changed on Jan. 20, 2025, when Donald Trump assumed the presidency and began unraveling the NATO alliance, as well as our support for Ukraine. We have seen American support for Ukraine evaporating at an alarming rate. 
Trump consistently pushes the false claim that Ukraine started the war. His United Nations delegation even joined Russia, North Korea, Iran and 13 other cut-throat nations in voting against a resolution condemning Russian aggression against Ukraine. Trump has floated a so-called peace plan that will give Putin practically everything he wants, while seriously endangering the future existence of Ukraine as a sovereign and free nation. The peace deal would leave all of the NATO nations on the Russian border in imminent danger. 
As this disastrous situation plays out at a rapid and frightening pace, we hear very few Republican voices in Congress speaking out and sounding the alarm. One who stands out is U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican and retired Air Force brigadier general, who implored Trump and Congress to continue our support of Ukraine and “advance America’s long-term national interests in the process.”
With his strong past support for NATO and Ukraine and a clear understanding of the approaching calamity, it is inexplicable that Sen. Risch, the chairman of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee, would not be raising the roof and demanding a change of course. If we sell out Ukraine and allow it to fall to Putin’s atrocious war, it will be a disaster for that gallant nation and a contemptible stain on America’s honor.
If Putin’s war is genocidal, as both Risch and I believe, silence and non-action on the part of one who is in a position to speak out and avert it is cowardice of the first order. It amounts to complicity in the slaughter and enslavement of Ukrainians that will inevitably follow. What could possibly explain Risch’s failure to rally opposition to this travesty? Perhaps a change of heart on the critical importance of Ukraine and NATO? 
Or, maybe a pat on the head and a coveted endorsement from Trump for six more years in the prestigious U.S. Senate?

John Cavanaugh of Omaha publicly acknowledging he is exploring a bid. The prospects of a potentially crowded midterm primary field could excite local Democrats. State party officials have said they talked with “strong candidates” for months.,"Denise Powell, known for her work helping new candidates run for office, is running for Congress in Nebraska's Omaha-based 2nd District. (Courtesy of Denise Powell for Congress)LINCOLN — Denise Powell, known for her role boosting new candidates with Women Who Run, is running for Congress in 2026 in Nebraska’s 2nd District. 
Powell told the Nebraska Examiner on Wednesday that she is running because many people in the Omaha area have lost a “voice in D.C.,” and the district needs more “everyday working” people. 
She said she would prioritize protecting Medicaid and Social Security, vote to ensure the federal government does its part to boost quality K-12 education and push back against the Trump administration.
“I am not a politician,” said Powell, who is stepping away from her role with the nonprofit she helped found. “And quite frankly, I think at this moment that’s actually a good thing.”  
Her announcement comes on the heels of Bacon confirming last week that he is considering retiring and State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha publicly acknowledging he is exploring a bid. The prospects of a potentially crowded midterm primary field could excite local Democrats. State party officials have said they talked with “strong candidates” for months.
Bacon’s seat a target

Nebraska Democrats, who view Bacon’s seat as vulnerable with him in it or not, have a first major candidate. Powell is trying to do what former State Sen. Tony Vargas fell short of twice — becoming the first non-Republican to represent Nebraska in Congress since the late former U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford in 2017. 
Powell said she’s hopeful this will be a political moment when voters are done with partisan lines, as people are “really frustrated by our elected officials who were supposed to represent us.”
“That’s the message that I’m bringing to this campaign,” Powell said. “This is a campaign to support all Nebraskans.”
Though Powell hasn’t held an elected office, she has played a role in Nebraska politics. She has helped with organizing recent ballot initiatives seeking to codify the right to an abortion, which failed, and to repeal a publicly funded voucher program for private K-12 schools, which succeeded. 
She said her experience running the Women Run Nebraska, a political action committee that aims to get more women in elected office, has shown her just how much people from all parties “care deeply about their communities.”
“I think our community needs that voice,” Powell said. “The working mom’s voice who’s gonna just step in there and fight for them.”
Once again, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates Bacon’s seat as a Republican toss-up. The slightly GOP-leaning district is Nebraska’s most politically divided and diverse.
The 2nd District voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 and former President Joe Biden in 2020 after voting for President Donald Trump in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012. It backed then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama in 2008. 
Bacon has fended off Democratic challengers in close races in previous years and has bucked the “blue dot” voting trend in the past two presidential elections. The retired Air Force brigadier general is a reliable House Republican vote on most matters. But he has again stepped into the national spotlight as one of the few House Republicans willing to criticize the Trump administration.
Frustration with Washington

Powell said people are uncertain, frustrated, and worried about what’s happening in Washington, amid economic uncertainty, including high inflation and efforts to cut social programs like Medicaid.
“Unfortunately, Don Bacon is somebody who is really good at saying all the right things,” Powell said. “But at the end of the day, he is taking votes in DC that are hurting Nebraskans.”
Bacon told the Examiner late last month that he was considering retirement, but has raised funds to leave him the choice of running again. Bacon’s campaign manager said his recent fundraising “keeps all options open ahead of 2026.” 
Regardless of whether Bacon retires from Congress, the outlines of a potential midterm race are becoming clearer after independent Dan Osborn focused his efforts on the U.S. Senate, and potential Republican suitors line up to jump in if Bacon gets out. 
Former 2022 GOP gubernatorial candidate Brett Lindstrom has told people in political circles that he is interested in a potential bid if Bacon retires. Another name being discussed is Dan Frei, who ran against Bacon in the 2024 GOP primary. 
National attention
The 2nd District has already drawn attention from state and national Democrats this year, with Democrats leading in-person town halls and advertising buys from multiple Democratic-aligned groups.
In addition to Cavanaugh, perennial candidate Evangelos Argyrakis has said he is running. Argyrakis withdrew from the 2018 attorney general’s race after facing a charge of abuse, neglect or exploitation of a vulnerable adult, has said he’s running. 
Cavanaugh said this week that he plans to decide whether to run after the legislative session or sooner, regardless of who else is running or when they enter the race. He pointed to his “record of effective leadership and experience crafting legislation to make people’s lives better and defeating bad public policy, which is equally important.”
“I know if I run, I have the record to earn the vote of the people of The 2nd District of Nebraska,” Cavanaugh told the Examiner. 
Powell said she is not worried about a potential primary because she believes her message will resonate with voters.
“What’s happening in Washington, DC, is impacting their family budgets,” Powell said, “People are really scared, and they feel like nobody is speaking for them or fighting for them.”

Those living near the corridor were take to a state-operated transitional center in Gentilly. (John Gray/Verite News)A bill to criminalize public camping and create “homelessness courts” in Louisiana passed its first hurdle Tuesday, despite objections from housing advocates and religious groups.
Senate Bill 196, sponsored by Rep. Robert Owen, R-Slidell, would make “unauthorized public camping” a crime punishable by six months in jail, a $500 fine or both for the first offense. The second offense imposes a sentence of one to two years in jail and a $1,000 fine.
A Senate committee advanced the bill in a 4-3 vote along party lines, with Republicans prevailing. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry supports the legislation.
The proposal would also allow parishes to establish a court program for unhoused people, versions of which already exist in other states. They would give defendants the option to have their conviction set aside if they agreed to be placed on supervised probation and enter into long-term substance or mental health treatment. If the person failed to complete the program, they would face criminal sentencing. The defendant would be responsible for paying program costs, unless a judge waives them.

Prosecutors and judges would have the authority to decide whether homeless defendants, facing a misdemeanor or felony charge, could be diverted to the homelessness court program. People charged with a violent crime or sex offense, or with a past homicide or sex crime conviction, would not be eligible to take part. Owen’s bill also excludes persons accused of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs that resulted in someone’s death.   
Disagreement over the bill came down to views on housing solutions. Its supporters argued enough resources exist for homeless people, but they need to be convinced to accept assistance.
“We need to have some kind of stick and carrot, essentially, attached to the bill that gives it a little teeth,” Owen told the Illuminator after the hearing. He added that amendments to his proposal are likely.
Organizations against the bill are those that advocate and support people without housing. They include the Travelers Aid Society and Unity of Greater New Orleans. Representatives with the Louisiana Interchurch Conference and the Louisiana Conference of Catholic Bishops also testified against the proposal. 
They argued the bill criminalizes homelessness without offering housing solutions, funding or support services. Sufficient affordable housing and needed treatment programs simply don’t exist in Louisiana, they said.
“Housing costs have doubled in the last 10 years. Sending these people to jail is a travesty,” said David Larsen, 50, who told lawmakers on the committee he was homeless for seven years.
Sens. Joe Bouie and Royce Duplessis, both Democrats from New Orleans, expressed skepticism about the expense of setting up homelessness courts falling on state and local governments and lack of housing support for people as they go through addiction or mental health treatment. 
Bouie specifically took issue with the bill’s requirement for a 12-month treatment plan. 
“What’re they doing during that time if they don’t have housing?” Bouie asked. “Where do they go? Back on the streets?”
Duplessis noted he lives near encampments in New Orleans, where he often sees homeless people who are not suffering from behavioral health issues and would benefit from simple financial support. According to federal data, 40% to 60% of homeless people in the U.S. have a job, but their wages have not kept up with the cost of housing.
“They literally can’t afford a place to live,” he said.
Meghan Garvey of the Louisiana Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys said Owen’s bill would only exacerbate homelessness in the state. 
“This isn’t informed by any of the best practices” the American Bar Association recommends for homelessness courts, Garvey said, stressing the bill is “creating a whole new crime.” 
Will Harrell of the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, which operates the city jail, testified against opposed the bill. He warned it would worsen chronic capacity issues there. “There is no more room in the inn,” he said.
According to Orleans Sheriff Susan Hutson, it costs $53,000 to keep someone in jail for a year. Permanent supportive housing costs about $16,000 annually, said Angela Owczarek with the New Orleans housing advocacy organization Jane’s Place.
‘These resources don’t exist’
Christopher Walters, the governor’s deputy general counsel, appeared before the committee to support Owen’s bill and rejected opponents’ framing of it. 
“I don’t believe this is criminalizing homelessness,” he said. “It’s criminalizing actions like erecting tents on public property.” 
Walters and Owen suggested sufficient housing vouchers and nonprofit services already exist to help people. Owen also rejected the idea that housing is the solution to homelessness.
“I just don’t think building more housing is the way out of this,” the senator told the committee.
Housing advocates provided data in the meeting to contradict Owen’s statement.
Jennifer Carlyle of East Baton Rouge’s Continuum of Care said her homelessness service provider coalition has 2,000 people on its waiting list for housing vouchers, many of whom have waited for months or years for rental assistance. 
Louisiana is short 117,000 affordable housing units, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
“We’re asking people to get housed without having housing to put them in,” Carlyle said.
Some bill opponents also stressed that a person’s homelessness does not reflect a lack of desire to be housed. Donna Paramore of Travelers Aid said 98% of the people her nonprofit places in homes stay housed.
Detox and treatment centers often have weeks-long waitlists for beds, according to Owczarek. 
“These resources don’t exist in our state,” she said.
Detractors of the bill also said it would likely disproportionately affect people of color, noting that more than 55% of tenants facing eviction in New Orleans are Black women. 
“Just weeks ago, a single mom with five kids was sleeping in a van on my corner because no family shelter spaces were available,” Owczarek told the committee. “There’s nothing to stop this bill from leading to her arrest.”
Owen’s bill comes in the wake of a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that asserted it is not cruel and unusual punishment to arrest people who are sleeping outside when no shelter space is available.
The bill is similar to model legislation supported by the Cicero Institute, a public policy group whose backers include Elon Musk. Cicero has two lobbyists registered in Louisiana.

The program employs about 3,000 people. (Getty Images)Samantha Casto, a preschool teacher at Ravenswood Head Start, is making the outdoors her classroom this spring. Her four- and five-year-old students are learning about bug habitats and digging their tiny hands into the dirt.
“It’s not ‘sit down at a desk and learn,’” said Casto, 33. “They get to learn in a fun way.”
Head Start offers free child care, early education, meals and more to thousands of low-income children in West Virginia. There are support services for families, as well. 
Under President Donald Trump, the program could be terminated. 
The Trump administration is asking Congress to eliminate funding for Head Start, which would shutter programs nationwide.
In West Virginia, it would terminate preschool and services for nearly 8,000 children and cut 3,000 jobs. 
“I can’t imagine how West Virginia would fare — our children, families, even our economy … I don’t know how these families would go to work,” said Lori Milam, executive director of the West Virginia Head Start Association. “It would be devastating. It really would.”
  Samantha Casto
Casto has worked at Ravenswood Head Start for 11 years. “I’m devastated and upset,” she said.
The Trump administration has already slashed Head Start staff, closed half the program’s regional offices and delayed funding.
Several states, including Pennsylvania, and advocacy groups are suing the Trump administration over the looming Head Start funding cuts. The lawsuit alleges that the actions already taken against the program, including shuttering its regional offices, required congressional approval.
Milam said West Virginia Head Start is waiting on grant money needed May 1 for programs that serve 1,000 children.
“There’s no communication because of closing the [regional] Head Start offices,” she said. 
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said in an email, “At this point in time, Sen. Capito is continuing to work with [the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] to ensure that West Virginia Head Start centers receive their grant money.”
  Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio
Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., and Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., did not return comments for this story. 
West Virginia’s Head Start programs are solely reliant on federal funding and received $83 million in 2024.
State Sen. Laura Chapman, who chairs the Senate Health Committee, said she would see if the state could fund the program should the federal cuts go through. 
“A cut to Head Start would be devastating, however, I do support the Trump administration’s goals in reducing bureaucracy and administrative costs,” said Chapman, R-Ohio. “If it does happen, I believe that the state should step up and try to fill in the gaps.”
“I support Head Start and our families,” she added.
Head Start closure would worsen state’s child care shortage 
Head Start’s potential closure would worsen the state’s child care shortage. More than 25,000 children in West Virginia don’t have access to child care, and hundreds of child care facilities have closed in the state in the last few years.
Northern Panhandle Head Start serves five counties, including Wetzel County, where there is no licensed child care center. The program partners with five nearby child care centers to provide funds that help pay teachers. 
“Our Head Start [programs] are some of the only available centers that children can go to,” said Jackie Bell, executive director of Northern Panhandle Head Start. “I’m very concerned about the proposed budget cuts. It threatens the stability and the future of our early childhood education.”
“We’re more than a preschool program,” she continued. “It allows [families] to go out and get jobs and work during the day and know their child is taking care of and receiving quality programming.”
Bell said 120 staff will lose their jobs if her Head Start program is forced to close. 
The National Institute for Early Education Research recently ranked West Virginia as fourth in the nation for preschool for four-year-olds, which was influenced by Head Start access statewide.
Head Start also serves a referral program, connecting young children with free services like speech and physical therapy through the Birth to Three program. Milam worries that children, including children in foster care and those with developmental disabilities, will slip through the cracks without screenings and services before they enter kindergarten.
Program employees also made nearly 44,000 home visits last year to check on children and provide in-home support for parents. The service plays a role in preventing children from entering West Virginia’s overburdened foster care system, Bell said.
“One of the unique pieces of our program is the parent education and training side of it,” Bell said, adding that the organization also makes referrals to Child Protective Services when necessary. 
“We’re serving the vulnerable children and families, and that’s what’s really scary about these potential cuts,” she said.
  Savannah Shamblin
Milam planned on spending this year celebrating Head Start’s 60th anniversary. Now, she is collecting testimonials and calling elected officials in hopes of saving the program. 
“I am still very, very hopeful,” she said.
Savannah Shamblin, 32, is a Head Start teacher at the Fairplain Center in Jackson County. Her students are learning the alphabet, how to spell their names and how to use silverware.
“Whenever that clicks, I get super excited … because I know I’m making a difference, and the kids get excited too,” she said.
Shamblin is worried about her job, but said, “I worry more about the children and families more.”
“We need to continue it for the next 100 years because it’s helping children that really need it,” she said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The federal government’s chief witness in Tennessee’s political corruption trial sparred Wednesday with a defense attorney, repeatedly saying she had to lie and conceal the identity of the person running a shadowy company that handled constituent mailers for lawmakers in early 2020.
Under questioning from Cynthia Sherwood, the attorney for defendant Cade Cothren, a former staffer who secretly ran New Mexico-based Phoenix Solutions, former Rep. Robin Smith said she testified “in error” previously when she said she was unaware of committing a crime when they were running the secret company.
Yet she also said at one point, “I was very well aware of lying and doubling down and concealing” the roles of Cothren and former House Speaker Glen Casada in the business scheme. Smith also said she pressured the state’s director of legislative administration to expedite payments to the company when they hit a delay.

Smith, who resigned from her legislative seat and signed a plea agreement with federal prosecutors, is charged with one count of honest services fraud in connection with a fraud and kickback scheme she allegedly ran with former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff, Cothren. According to testimony, they had to conceal Cothren’s role in running Phoenix Solutions after he resigned the post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal in April 2019. Casada stepped down from the House speaker’s post in August because of a no-confidence vote by the House Republican Caucus.
Casada and Cothren, in contrast, face 20 charges ranging from theft to fraud and honest services fraud.
Asked by Sherwood if she understood the elements of honest services fraud, Smith responded it meant she told numerous lies to keep the invalid vendor in operation. The trio grossed nearly $52,000 from work on Republican lawmakers’ constituent mailers, which are paid for through the state’s postage and printing program.
Apparently put off by Smith’s continual expounding on answers, Sherwood said, “A lot’s on the line for you today.”
Smith responded, “There’s a lot on the line for everybody.”
Sherwood then reminded her the jury already heard that Cothren hid his identity.
Under questioning, Smith also said she talked with her attorney, Ben Rose, since taking the stand Monday and had met with U.S. attorneys at least six times since her home and office were raided in January 2021.
  “Stunned,” said former state Rep. Robin Smith, pictured with her attorney, Ben Rose, of her reaction when FBI agents raided her home in January 2021. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Sherwood asked her to describe the discussions she had with Rose, eliciting laughter from the courtroom. U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson advised Smith that attorney-client talk is private, yet she still tried to give explanations to yes-or-no questions.
Sherwood told the judge she might request later that Smith waive her attorney-client privilege because of her answers.
Smith described the morning FBI agents came to her home in early 2021, saying she went to the door in her sweat pants while holding back her dog. She said she chatted with them until they gave her the chance to call her attorney. She said she left a message and resumed the conversation until her attorney told her not to talk anymore.
Smith said she welcomed the FBI into her home but “tried to withhold as much as a talkative person like myself can.” Early in Wednesday’s testimony in U.S. District Court in Nashville, Sherwood displayed several mail pieces produced by Phoenix Solutions and asked Smith if she thought the work was good. She agreed it was.
Smith said when federal agents came to her home on Jan. 8, 2021, she was “stunned” and wasn’t certain what was happening.

Workers had to drill through rock that contained high levels of silica, making workers sick within months. (National Park Services photo)As the West Virginia Legislature wound up its less than stellar session this year, the titled words to this commentary, rooted in the teachings of Hillel the Elder, a Jewish sage who lived in the first century CE, echoed in my mind, reaching an even greater, fevered pitch knowing that JFK and John Lewis were known to echo the phrase often in the context of political and social activism. The power in those five words resounds loud and clear to each of us — at least we can hope they do.
While state legislators were tasked with a number of vital pieces of legislation, I honed in on the continued and shameful disregard for the certain and necessary protections of West Virginia’s coal miners whose lives continue to be threatened from the inhalation of silica dust particles, which is the leading cause of black lung disease, along with lung cancer, kidney disease, COPD and cardiovascular illnesses. 
In learning that a federal appeals court issued a temporary stay on the implementation of what advocates have called a long overdue industry rule that would have limited how much silica dust coal miners are exposed to, I recalled one of the nation’s worst industrial tragedies — the building of the Hawks Nest Tunnel in Fayette County, West Virginia, in the early 1930s, when an economic depression plagued this country. Stop for a minute to consider the incredulity of a period of time fighting the same issue that spans nearly one hundred years. It’s outrageous.
In the fall of 1990, shortly after completing my graduate work, I wrote a piece for Goldenseal titled, “Hawks Nest, the Novel.” Since my graduate thesis focused on the history of early West Virginia authors, it would not have been complete without a discussion of Hubert Skidmore’s controversial work. Still, after all these years, the same threat to every coal miner’s life continues. It’s unfathomable that this is still an issue. In fact, it’s obscene. The silica rock that the builders of the Hawks Nest Tunnel drilled through — completely unprotected — is being breathed by Appalachian coal miners today, in 2025.
The tunnel workers developed horrendous coughs and had trouble breathing, ending their shifts covered in a thick blanket of dust. Some died and were buried in unmarked graves in a field in Summersville, often before their families were informed of their death. The only time the dust was abated was when the foreman announced the arrival of the mine inspector and turned on the water to keep the dust down. Once the mine inspector left, the water was turned off and remained off. A reviewer for the New York Times reported in 1941, “It is a story of crass injustice to make the reader’s blood boil.”
Fast forward decades later and the problem persists. Why? The answer is simple — money. Imposing regulations in order to keep the related diseases caused by the breathing of silica dust at bay cost money, and coal operators/owners don’t want their bottom lines (i.e., profits) affected negatively. Valuing profits over people’s lives is incomprehensible. How can basic, decent concern for your fellow man, the very men who risk their lives to line your pockets with even more profit, be ignored?
Yes, we are a country that is divided at every turn, wrestling with politicians who, on one side, fight for the worker and who, on the other, quite simply don’t. Corporate profits versus tighter safety measures for coal miners has a long history, none more obvious than in West Virginia.
Are we going to be writing this same story in yet another decade from now? Are we going to leave it to the next generation to tackle? At what point are we going to say, “Enough!” 
Theodore Roosevelt issued these resounding words: “There can be no life without change, and to be afraid of what is different or unfamiliar is to be afraid of life.”
I don’t think it’s inherent in the human spirit to belittle the worker and be concerned only with corporate greed. I think that the latter is a conscious choice that must certainly plague the conscience of those who choose to put their own interests above everything that is inherently decent and good about mankind. I often wonder what events, experiences led someone to toss aside respect and decency and concern for their fellow man and prioritize only their own agenda. I guarantee there is a reason, for to suggest that the workers’ concerns are irrelevant is a clear example of pure disregard for those who built this country, brick by brick and shovel by shovel, asking only that they be protected as they reaped enough to provide the basic necessities for their families, while the industry barons rode their backs all the way to the banks, not feeling the least bit responsible for the price paid by the workers. It was unacceptable then, is now, and always will be unacceptable. Yet still, it continues.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Louisville’s air pollution regulator will dispute the Trump administration’s termination of a grant that funded an air toxics monitoring study in West Louisville, a larger community effort to study air pollution health impacts in neighborhoods near the Rubbertown industrial complex. 
The Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District (APCD) received a memo from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency March 31 stating a $1 million grant from the Environmental Justice Government-to-Government Program would be terminated because, in part, it was “inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, agency priorities.” An EPA official in a court filing wrote recently that the agency was canceling hundreds of EPA grants, most of them involving environmental justice programs.  
Matt Mudd, a spokesperson with APCD, told the Lantern Wednesday the regulator planned to dispute the grant termination with the EPA through an internal process. Rachael Hamilton, the executive director of APCD, in an April 16 board meeting described the option to dispute the grant termination as an “administrative remedy” that would be sent to a regional EPA administrator. Hamilton said in the meeting last month there had been a “fair amount” of litigation from other grantees that have had grants terminated. 
The funding, announced in 2023 during the Biden administration, was set to support the placement of canisters measuring volatile organic compounds and two other monitors measuring airborne metals. Some of the monitors were to be placed downwind of Rubbertown, a cluster of chemical plants near West Louisville that have long been the subject of complaints from the adjacent neighborhoods and beyond. 
The monitors were to be a part of a one-year study to compare the amount of air pollution and health impacts to a previous study done in the early 2000s that found levels of a number of cancer-causing pollutants to be unacceptable high. Mudd said the study’s start date was “imminent” before the grant was terminated.
Terry Johnson, a spokesperson for the EPA regional office that covers Kentucky, in a statement said the EPA was reviewing all awarded grants “to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities.” 
“Maybe the Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment,” Johnson said in his statement. 
Johnson did not answer emailed follow-up questions from the Lantern asking what specific issues the agency had with the grant. 
Rep. Joshua Watkins, D-Louisville, who represents parts of West Louisville neighborhoods in the state legislature, said he hoped the city would exhaust all resources “to ensure that their mission isn’t hindered by any changes — this sort of whiplash of changes — that we see coming from the federal government.”
“Environmental justice is a freedom issue, and if you don’t have a high quality of air, you aren’t free to breathe and live a quality of life,” Watkins told the Lantern. “Clean air is nonpartisan. You need it if you’re Republican, you need it if you’re a Democrat.”

Watkins, who noted city residents in predominantly Black neighborhoods in West Louisville have significantly lower life expectancies compared to the east half of the city, questioned why the air toxics monitoring study wouldn’t align with the EPA’s mission of protecting human health and the environment. 
“What neighborhoods align, I guess, with the EPA mission?” he said. “If not for the residents of West Louisville who have documented evidence of significantly worse health outcomes, why would we not focus on those citizens?”
The air monitoring study was a piece of a larger project addressing the health impacts of air pollution, involving other community partners including the University of Louisville’s Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, the West Jefferson County Community Task Force, Park DuValle Community Health Centers and Louisville’s public health and wellness department. 
UofL researchers planned to conduct a wastewater sampling study alongside the air toxics monitoring study and collect data from both to determine “community health risks”; Park DuValle Community Health Centers would use the health impact findings from the project to train health professionals on how to treat exposure to air pollution; and the West Jefferson Community Task Force would hold community meetings to provide feedback on the project’s findings and policy recommendations.
Arnita Gadson, the executive director of the West Jefferson County Community Task Force, told the Lantern she was especially interested in how the “much needed” project planned to help inform community health workers and doctors on how to treat the impacts of exposure to air pollution. She said the health impacts of air pollution can also extend beyond West Louisville, given that residents impacted by pollution can move elsewhere and bring their health issues with them. 
“This grant was to help everybody,” Gadson said. “I think we were on the precipice of actually establishing a platform that meant that doctors really could start using some of this.” 
Attempts on Wednesday to reach the CEO of Park DuValle Community Health Centers and a key UofL researcher involved with the project were not successful. 
Eboni Cochran, the co-director of the grassroots organization Rubbertown Emergency ACTion that seeks to push back against pollution from industries in Rubbertown, told the Lantern while the termination of the grant was sad, APCD could do more to address immediate air pollution impacts. Cochran pointed to ongoing complaints of dust and fires at an industrial plant in the Parkland neighborhood of Louisville. 
“An important part of what they were doing was to engage medical professionals, right? I think that is vital to the work of environmental justice,” Cochran said. “However, you can even prevent or reduce people’s likelihood of them even having to get to the medical professional if you listened to the people who live near these industries.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1088-1024x695.jpg,,,2025-05-01 06:01:37.501899

(Audrey Carleton/Capital & Main)
This story was originally published by Capital & Main.
Just beyond a fenced-off access road in fields of tall grass on public land in Pennsylvania’s northwest sits a natural gas well pad that sat idle for close to a decade. The old fracking site suddenly roared back to life in 2022, spewing noise and pollution and rattling residents who were used to hunting pheasant on the quiet, bucolic terrain.
Diversified Energy turned on the well pad, known as Longhorn Pad A, to funnel the natural gas into on-site generators powering cryptocurrency-mining supercomputers that churn away at numbers at all hours . The company set up and started the mine in Elk County without securing a required air quality permit from state regulators, Capital & Main reported last year.
Now, after a little more than two years, the company has packed up and left, abandoning the wells and associated crypto infrastructure in violation of state law, according to state regulators.
Diversified Energy, which disputes the state’s finding that it abandoned the wells, has billed itself as innovative, giving new life to aging, low-producing gas wells that would otherwise be uneconomical to operate. Cryptocurrency aids that goal: It allows the company to monetize wells that lack pipeline infrastructure that is typically crucial to selling gas.

Pennsylvania has an estimated 350,000 orphaned and abandoned oil and gas wells, more than any other state.

The company has, in just a few years, amassed a portfolio of wells bigger than that of any of its peers in the U.S., many of those wells low-producing, despite evidence that Diversified may not have adequate resources to plug them all at the end of their lives. This has stoked concerns among environmentalists about who will be on the hook for cleanup should the company abandon them. When a wellhead crypto mine suddenly shuts down it raises a host of new concerns, chief among them: What happens when operators decide it’s time to move on without plugging the wells?
Worries about the long-term environmental costs have mounted in Appalachian and other oil and gas-producing communities across the country. Diversified appears eager to try to squeeze a few more years’ profits out of old wells by burning the remaining gas to power energy-hungry computers. But they have shown less zeal when it comes to safely closing them, often shirking their obligations to plug them to prevent the ongoing release of greenhouse gas pollution.
Companies abandon wells when they walk away from them without plugging them after they are no longer lucrative, increasing the likelihood that they will be left to leak planet-warming methane gas into the atmosphere for years to come. Abandoning wells violates the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Act and saddles states with the cost and responsibility of plugging them. Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the U.S. oil industry, has an estimated 350,000 orphaned and abandoned oil and gas wells, more than any other state and responsible for close to 8% of the state’s methane emissions.

The wells, which sit atop a pad called Longhorn A on state game lands in rural Horton township, were drilled under the ownership of another natural gas company, EQT, in 2011, but sat inactive for all those years, considered abandoned by regulators. Diversified Energy brought them back to life in December 2022. The company applied for a permit for generators to power cryptocurrency mining equipment atop the pad but didn’t wait to receive them from state regulators before firing up the loud and polluting equipment.
Capital & Main reported last year that the firm was unresponsive to questions from state agencies about its plans with the well pad, even as residents raised concerns about noise and its threat to neighbors and wildlife. The company received its permit to add crypto-mining equipment to the well pad in December 2023.
A Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection inspector visited the well pad earlier this year to find the cryptocurrency mining equipment gone. Inspectionreports from a March 4 visit show metallic sheds sitting empty on the gravel well pad.
The department issued Diversified a notice of violation for abandoning the well on March 10, requesting a response from the company within two weeks.
Daniel O. Frick, a director in the Environmental Health, Safety Regulatory Department at Diversified Energy, told regulators in a March 18 email that “technically the site isn’t abandoned,” and that the company plans to resume pulling gas from the well.

Plugging an oil well can cost more than $100,000, so it’s common for operators to try to avoid those obligations.

Regulators have also accused the Birmingham, Alabama-based company of violating a consent order and agreement when it abandoned Longhorn A. In the 2021 agreement that company representatives signed when it acquired the wells from fracking company EQT, Diversified agreed to plug them and 13 others at the end of their lives.
Diversified Energy did not respond to Capital & Main’s requests for comment.
State officials aren’t the only ones concerned. Environmental advocates have warned for years about the environmental risks of Diversified Energy’s large portfolio of low-producing wells across Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio. They now fear abandonment of wells snatched up by the company across Appalachia for short-term windfalls will leave the public with the long-term costs of closure and cleanup.
“Diversified must not be allowed to walk away and leave others to clean up its mess,” said Charles McPhedran, senior attorney at Earthjustice, an environmental law nonprofit. McPhedran has previously urged regulators not to issue Diversified a permit for crypto mining at the site, citing noise concerns and the company’s unaddressed environmental violations.
Dave Gustafson, deputy executive director of the Pennsylvania Game Commission, which regulates and leases out the state game lands on which Longhorn A sits, said the agency “wouldn’t consider these wells ‘abandoned’” and that the company had “not expressed their plans to move forward with production nor have they indicated they intend to plug the well.”
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection disagrees.
“The wells are not equipped for production,” Tom Decker, a department spokesperson, told Capital & Main in an email. “Diversified’s claim that the wells are still equipped is contrary to the Department’s observations during the recent inspection and has not been further verified by Diversified.”
The department has given the company until September to plug the wells.
Plugging a well can cost more than $100,000, so it’s common for operators to try to avoid those obligations, said Ted Boettner, senior researcher at the nonprofit think tank Ohio River Valley Institute.
They “lift the well and get it to produce some puffs of gas and say, ‘We’re back in our active status,’ and they won’t check for another 10 years,” Boettner said.

Diversified one of many natural gas companies throwing its weight behind the coming AI boom.

A 2022 report by the Ohio River Valley Institute argued Diversified Energy was operating with “a business model built to fail Appalachia” because it relied on obtaining aging wells from other operators and squeezing the value out of them before the end of their useful lives, all without having “enough funds to plug its entire inventory of assets.”
In doing so, Diversified has acquired the largest portfolio of low-producing wells in Appalachia, which the Institute researchers wrote could become a “wave of soon-to-be-orphaned wells that could be offloaded onto the public.”
In recent months there have been new doubts raised about the company’s commitment to well-plugging. In December, Diversified reached a settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by West Virginia landowners who argued the company had abandoned wells on their properties; it agreed to plug nearly 3,000 wells across Appalachia by 2034. Within the first two weeks of January, the Department of Environmental Protection slapped Diversified with 11 notices of violation for abandoning shale gas wells in Pennsylvania.
Boettner said the state should do more to penalize the practice of abandoning wells. Without strong enforcement, he said, “We’re going to end up left with all of these wells to plug. There’s nothing stopping them.”
Meanwhile, even as it is walking away from well pads, Diversified is expanding its offerings. Just days after inspectors visited Longhorn A, Diversified announced a large-scale partnership with fuel cell company FuelCell Energy and energy infrastructure company TESIAC to power a growing industry of off-grid data centers using natural gas from fracking wells and coal mines. It’s one of many natural gas companies throwing its weight behind the coming AI boom, threatening to prolong the life of polluting industries.
But the Longhorn A well abandonments raise questions about the company’s ability to care for such projects at the end of their lives, as a broader data boom raises concerns among environmentalists about air pollution. The company has also applied for state grants for well-plugging elsewhere in Pennsylvania, according to records Capital & Main obtained under Pennsylvania’s Right-to-Know Law.
Diversified CEO Rusty Hutson Jr. bought his first set of oil and gas wells in 2001 as a personal investment, taking out a home equity loan to afford a package of 35 wells that his father, a third-generation oil and gas worker, found in a deal, he said in a 2023 interview with Mountaineer Media.
“We’d go out in cold, heat, fix leaks, work on wells together,” Hutson said. “And I did that for two or three years before we started really growing the company.”
As it has added new wells to its portfolio, Diversified has written into its balance sheets lower-than-industry-standard asset retirement obligations — or estimates for the cost of plugging and closing off wells at the end of their lives.
The strategy has alarmed environmentalists, who fear the company is, at best, giving a lifeline to wells in need of decommissioning and, at worst, creating a massive taxpayer liability should it go under.










“The only thing they can do is keep buying wells, and as long as they don’t have to be accountable for those liabilities, it works.” ~ Ted Boettner, senior researcher, Ohio River Valley Institute


But Hutson is proud of his firm’s unique strategy. While most oil and gas companies focus on drilling new assets, Diversified keeps its eyes on their leftovers.
“Our game is acquiring existing mature production, operating it more efficiently than everyone else would, driving costs down, enhancing production on wells that hadn’t been given much time, or attention, or capital, driving margins and then paying dividends to our shareholders,” he told Mountaineer Media.
The company was listed only on the London Stock Exchange until December 2023, when it went public in the U.S. on the New York Stock Exchange.
That same day, House Democrats opened a probe into the firm’s practices and emissions.
“Diversified Energy is responsible for remediating a substantial share of the country’s aging oil and gas wells, but we are concerned that your company may be vastly underestimating well cleanup costs,” members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce wrote in a letter to Hutson. The company responded at the time, saying its business model is based on “stewardship” that includes “delivering well retirement and reclamation efforts.”
Boettner estimates that all but a small fraction of the vast trove of old wells Diversified has acquired in recent years are “totally uneconomical,” and one of his reports found that more than half could, by some definitions, be classified as “inactive.” In 2022, the company offloaded a set of 2,500 of them in Ohio. In January 2024, the company sold another part of its stake in Appalachia.
“They’re able to squeeze out this money in these assets because of economies of scale,” Boettner said. “The only thing they can do is keep buying wells, and as long as they don’t have to be accountable for those liabilities, it works.”
On the ground in Horton township, home to Longhorn A, local supervisor PJ Piccirillo said he’s heard nothing from Diversified staff about their plans to abandon the wells and remove the associated crypto mine. He believes the company stopped running the well pad after the township issued an ordinance setting noise and light pollution limits on Bitcoin mines in 2023, shortly before the state issued Longhorn A its permit.
“The generators had been pulled and those big tanks had been pulled out,” he said.
Without any communication from the company, Piccirillo is concerned about future industrial development. He runs into abandoned wells in his corner of Elk County often that, he said, “I don’t know if anybody knows about.” The township lacks jurisdiction over well abandonment, so there’s nothing he can do about them from his position as a supervisor.
“All we know is that that property seems to have been abandoned,” he said of Longhorn A. “What might be next?”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LNGH-scaled-1-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-05-01 06:01:37.501899

It passed the House on a 69-45 vote, as protesters and visiting members of the historically Black Divine Nine fraternities and sororities looked on from the gallery.
State workers who violate the measure could be subject to removal, a fine of up to $5,000 and potential civil litigation. And the state auditor’s office, currently held by Republican Dave Boliek, would conduct “periodic” audits on agencies.
Over the course of an extensive, wide-ranging and tense debate, Republican proponents described the bill as a long-overdue return to the idea of prioritizing merit in government.
“It restores the principle that should never have been lost: can you do the job?” said House Majority Leader Brenden Jones (R-Columbus). “Did you earn it? Are you qualified?”
Democrats warned that the bill would set the state further back as it struggles to fill vacancies within government, and that it could dissuade agencies from hiring workers who could be perceived as “DEI hires.”
“Why would you want to be … somebody that sets off those alarms?” House Democratic Leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) said. “We know that’s the effect. Don’t pretend otherwise. This makes people say, ‘it’s not worth the trouble.'”
The hours-long discussion featured lawmakers speaking on terms both broad and personal.
Rep. John Blust (R-Guilford) read passages from books he described as “seminal documents for DEI,” while remarking that the U.S. “gets a bad rap” relative to the global history of slavery. (Reives later commented that he was “happy to help with history lessons.”)
“I don’t think we’re getting an honest assessment of what DEI is from the debate opponents,” Blust said.

And Rep. Carolyn Logan (D-Mecklenburg) recalled being recruited as the only Black woman to serve on the NC Highway Patrol for more than a decade. And she asked who had taken issue with diversity and equity being used within the state workforce.
“Who was complaining about this? Who are the state agencies who say they were having a problem?” Logan said. “Is it going to be cookie cutter? We’re going back to all white males?”
Republicans, who control the North Carolina legislature, have made a more concentrated push against DEI efforts this session in the wake of the White House’s crackdown on those programs and practices nationally.
The legislation now goes to the Senate. Bills banning DEI in both higher education and K-12 schools have already passed that chamber and are awaiting further action in the House.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_8143-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 06:01:37.501899

People behind bars labor every day — cooking, cleaning, maintaining prison facilities, even fighting wildfires. Yet unlike other workers, they have few rights, are paid pennies or nothing at all, and are without access to the most basic human needs and at the mercy of others with little to no recourse. 
In Colorado, people in prison can be denied family visitation — calls, video chats, or in-person visits — if they choose not to participate in a prison work program. This practice is cruel, coercive, and completely out of step with the values May Day represents.
The Right to Family and Community Connection Act, House Bill 25-1013, would enshrine the right to family visitation as a matter of law — one that cannot be stripped away for refusing to work.

Prison labor is already a form of economic injustice. But when you tie a worker’s ability to see their children or speak to a parent to their willingness to work under these conditions, it’s not just economic coercion, it’s inhumane. 
Coloradans — regardless of party — know that family isn’t a reward. It’s a lifeline. It’s also one of the most powerful tools for rehabilitation. Research shows that people in prison who maintain strong family bonds are less likely to reoffend and more likely to successfully reintegrate into society. 
This isn’t just smart public policy. It’s basic humanity. 
We don’t have to look far to see the human cost. David Turner, a 24-year-old father of two, was placed on Restrictive Privileges status for “failure to work” — punished after being marked absent on days he wasn’t scheduled and for a shift he missed while receiving medical care. For 43 days, David was confined 22 hours a day, cut off from his family — not even allowed to send letters to his children. 
As David put it, “Getting out of prison and back to my family is very important to me, and knowing I can be kept in prison longer if I attempt to choose not to work coerces me to work against my will … I feel like a slave being forced to work against my will by CDOC. Everybody does.” 
No one should be forced to choose between enduring forced labor or losing all contact with the people they love. 
May Day reminds us that the dignity of labor must be fiercely protected — and that includes the dignity of those whose rights are denied and whose voices are often silenced.
This May Day, let’s extend our solidarity to all workers, including those behind prison walls. Let’s fight for fair wages, safe conditions, and freedom from retaliation — and for the fundamental human right to stay connected to the people we love. 
Every person — no matter where they are – needs the right to stay connected to their loved ones without fear of retaliation or exploitation. The Right to Family and Community Connection Act would guarantee that right.

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)From last year to now, Virginia raised teacher pay by an average of $3,000. Still, the commonwealth’s average pay rate for educators remains stagnant compared to other states, according to the latest salary report published by the National Education Association.
The commonwealth dropped by one spot to 26th, paying teachers an average of $66,327, an increase from a year ago. Virginia’s average teacher pay is $5,703 below the national average of $72,030, the NEA report states.
Education leaders and lawmakers in the commonwealth said inflation and investments are some of the factors contributing to mixed results in the national salary report.
“Clearly (the report) shows that we have made good improvement in recent years, and we have a long way to go,” said House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke. 
Rasoul admitted that the commonwealth is thousands of dollars below the national teacher pay average, “but when we started this journey a few years ago, we were in the bottom third of states, and so we’re approaching where we need to be.”
The Virginia Education Association (VEA), representing the largest group of K-12 teachers in the commonwealth, said that while the national data shows gains have been made in Virginia, pre-kindergarten to higher education teachers are still not making enough to support themselves after being adjusted for inflation.
According to VEA, the average public school teacher salary increased by 3% from the previous year, but when adjusted for inflation, teachers made only $108 more.
“While it might look like teachers are getting support, they are actually losing money, which has a direct impact on student learning,” VEA said.
While recognizing recent gains, VEA president Carol Bauer said Virginia’s teachers are “still losing economic ground” while schools continue weathering the state’s education staffing shortages.
“True historic investment means decisively closing salary gaps, adequately funding schools, and ensuring every classroom has a qualified teacher. Virginia must commit to real, sustained investments to attract and retain educators, rather than relying on incremental gains that barely keep pace with inflation,” Bauer said.
 What can Virginia do now?

Virginia has an opportunity to boost educator pay even more, after the General Assembly recommended changes to the state budget.
This week, Gov. Glenn Youngkin will decide whether to support lawmakers’ budget proposal to provide bonuses to teachers and lift a cap on state funding for non-instructional school staff positions. This would give school divisions greater flexibility to hire the staff they need without being “restricted” by outdated student-to-staff ratios.
In 2009, during the Great Recession, lawmakers initiated the cap to reduce state spending on non-instructional school staff positions, including central office and administrative, technical, clerical, maintenance, and instructional support positions.
The governor’s office did not immediately respond to comment on the report. However, in the governor’s budget recommendations in March, Youngkin wrote that Virginia has raised teacher pay by 18% over the last three years.
The budget amendments now being considered by the governor contain $166 million more for public education, including $84.7 million to raise the cap.
Last year, state lawmakers formed a joint committee to work on overhauling the Standards of Quality (SOQ), the state’s funding formula determining the financial needs of school divisions, after a state study group found local governments have been shouldering a disproportionate share of K-12 education costs compared to the state’s contributions.
Lawmakers arranged for the state and localities to pay an even split of contributions in 1972, but they changed it in 1993, urging localities to start paying for K-12 fringe benefits.
According to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the state’s share was established at 55%, while localities paid 45%.
 What’s next?

House Education Committee Vice Chair Shelly Simonds, D-Newport News, carried the support cap bill and budget language to support non-instructional positions.
As a former teacher and school board member, Simonds said a core issue her legislation will address is the administration’s prioritized focus on overhauling testing and accountability measures — part of the administration’s efforts to combat learning loss and raise student testing scores — instead of recruiting and maintaining teachers.
Virginia’s learning recovery falls short as NAEP scores show mixed results

Simonds said some ways to make teaching the best job in Virginia could involve creating competitive pay, treating educators as professionals in the school buildings, and offering maternity leave, professional development and planning periods to collaborate with colleagues.
“The only thing that has been really proven to improve education is highly qualified teachers,” Simonds said. “Having a highly qualified teacher in every classroom is the way we move the needle on test scores for our children.”

(Photo courtesy of Meals on Wheels of Chesapeake)Some sad – and also hopeful – truths emerge every time Meals on Wheels volunteers deliver nutritious food to disabled residents and senior citizens around Virginia, as my wife and I have done in Chesapeake over the past two years. The national program is now under a pointless attack in Washington, putting thousands in the commonwealth at risk of missing the meals and social connections they rely on.
Plan to axe SNAP would harm poorest Americans so richest ones could live more luxuriously

Plenty of Meals on Wheels recipients have so many mobility and other health-related problems that just reaching the front door is a hurdle. A sizable number would strain or exhaust their budgets without the sustenance from these low-cost or free meals. A huge portion of recipients – 67% in Chesapeake over a recent three-month period – live alone and crave the brief interaction from the program’s 500-plus volunteers.
The hopeful part? The program’s 26 chapters statewide ease social isolation and are a daily wellness check. Meals on Wheels is a key factor in allowing the elderly to stay in their homes longer. The nonprofit organization provides dignity and connection for people who worked for decades and now need some help to survive in their twilight years.
Nearly 13,000 Virginians received just under 2.3 million meals through Meals on Wheels in 2024, a spokesman with the Virginia Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services told me.
So I’m aghast that the current White House and supine Republican members of Congress want to cleave the program as part of the Trump administration’s downsizing of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as The New York Times reported last week.
The Administration for Community Living is a small government agency responsible for overseeing programs including Meals on Wheels. It would be dismantled under the administration’s proposed budget in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Already, about half of the staff has been laid off, The Times said.
“It’s heartbreaking to think of seniors hungry and without social support,” said Megan Mann, executive director of Meals on Wheels of Chesapeake. She’s had to start a waiting list for the first time.
Meals on Wheels typically receives money from federal, state and local government and private donors. In Chesapeake, for example, Mann said the current operating budget is $477,000. Some 20% of revenue comes from the feds. The biggest portion, 56.5%, comes from the private sector – foundation grants, individual donations, faith and civic groups, and more.
That means local communities do their part to keep the chapters running. The federal portion, though, is a significant amount of the revenue stream.
The proposed federal cuts are yet another noxious development from this administration, coming on the heels of possible reductions to food stamps, Medicaid and Head Start. President Trump and his minions are determined to decimate programs targeted to the most vulnerable and least politically connected.
Virginia weighs response to potential Medicaid rollbacks affecting 630,000

That’s not a coincidence.
Call it fiscal irresponsibility, especially at a time when the administration wants to extend tax cuts that would overwhelmingly help the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Programs on the chopping block, though, have shown their viability and cost benefits over the long term. Bean counters in Washington should recognize that.
For example, a review of studies about Meals on Wheels found the programs “improve diet quality and increase nutrient intakes among participants.” 
As The Washington Post reported years ago, when the budget chief early in Trump’s first term criticized the program, Meals on Wheels was instead cited as being “aligned with the federal cost-containment policy to rebalance long-term care away from nursing homes to home- and community-based services by helping older adults maintain independence.”
We shouldn’t ignore the human side, either. Its value is intangible, yet it means something to allow people to live with self-respect and the familiarity of their own homes for as long as possible. It’s more cost-effective, too.
I’m thinking of the Navy veteran living in Chesapeake, a widower, who’s recovering from back surgery and welcomed chatting a while with The Boss (my nickname for my wife, the one in charge). Or the man who was exceedingly gracious when I dropped off food last week, in spite of his health issues. He uses oxygen and a walker just to get around the house.
Sharon Adams is a retired nurse who’s been receiving Meals on Wheels fare for more than three years. She grapples with high blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension and bipolar disorder. The 62-year-old counts on the program.
“It’s a reassurance in the back of my mind that the need will be met,” Adams told me. She still pays rent, utilities and car insurance, but Adams has one fewer bill to worry about. “This gives me peace.”
Her favorite item from Meals on Wheels? Chicken stir fry. “It’s so good!” she told me. “I actually put hearts on the (menu) calendar the day I know it’s coming.”
“It’s a good program,” Adams continued. “It would be a shame if the government completely wiped it out.”
Then there’s 96-year-old Willie Cahoon. The Army veteran has enjoyed a varied life, working at Sears in electronic and electrical tasks, at an auto parts store, and running a marine repair business. He once owned a Cessna plane.
He’s outlived two wives. Cahoon still lives in the home he and his first wife built in 1965. His daughters live in the area, but Cahoon would love to stay in his own home as long as possible. Meals on Wheels helps him do that, and it’s a step up from the frozen dinners he often ate  before joining the program. 
When Meals on Wheels volunteers visit, “That is the high point of each day,” he told me. “I got to know so many of them. Those volunteers are special people.”
So is the program.
Our federal government can afford to do its share. The benefits outweigh the costs, and the elderly and disabled who depend on Meals on Wheels don’t deserve the unnecessary uncertainty emanating from D.C.

The new waiver will allow for the shipment of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho for the purposes of conducting research at Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho, officials said.
The waiver specifically allows for a high burnup nuclear fuel cask from the North Anna Power Station, a commercial nuclear power plant located in Virginia, to be sent to Idaho National Laboratory for research, according to a press release issued Tuesday.

The waiver was necessary because the 1995 settlement agreement called for limiting shipments of, and removing certain types of, spent nuclear fuel in Idaho.
“The collaborative effort between the state of Idaho, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Idaho National Laboratory showcases our commitment to advancing nuclear energy research while upholding the goals of the 1995 Settlement Agreement,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in a written statement.
“We are proud to support innovation in nuclear energy that will support national security and energy independence into the future.”
 Research at INL to support licensing for extended storage of spent fuel at nuclear power plants

Idaho National Laboratory, or INL, is one of 17 Department of Energy national labs, and it employs or contacts with about 6,400 researchers and support staff.
Much of the nuclear research and energy research conducted by Idaho National Laboratory occurs at a vast research complex referred to as “the site” that is located in the eastern Idaho desert, between the town of Arco and Idaho Falls.





“Idaho National Laboratory is DOE’s lead lab for nuclear energy research and development, and it is critical that we continue to grow this research capacity and maintain American competitiveness,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a written statement. “This agreement between the State of Idaho and DOE ensures the lab can continue its cutting-edge research to advance nuclear technology, helping to meet President Trump’s commitment to unleash American energy dominance.”
In today’s press release, state and federal officials said the research will provide data to support licensing for the extended storage of spent fuel at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states.
“As the nation’s center for nuclear energy research and development, we look forward to utilizing our unique facilities and expertise to support this critical national need,” Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner said in a written statement. “We are thankful to the Department of Energy and the state of Idaho for entrusting us with the safe and secure execution of our vital mission.”
 1995 settlement agreement came after environmental, health concerns from disposal of nuclear waste in Idaho

As part of the new waiver, Idaho National Laboratory will also be allowed to safely manage small amounts of spent nuclear fuel from domestic university reactors. Without the waiver, some U.S. universities could have been forced to shut down their research reactors due to limits on spent fuel storage, officials said.
Signed in October 1995 by then-Gov. Phil Batt, the 1995 settlement agreement resolved a lawsuit filed by the state amid public concern about the environmental and health risks resulting from disposal of nuclear waste in Idaho. The lawsuit was filed in order to keep Idaho from becoming a dumping ground for the country’s spent nuclear fuel, according to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality.
The new waiver relaxes the annual limit on the amount of spent nuclear fuel and materials that can come into Idaho, officials said.
The fuel cask is just under 17 feet tall and is just over eight feet in diameter. During storage, it weighs about 105 metric tons, or 231,000 pounds, officials said.
The cask would be shipped by train, and shipment could occur in 2027 under the waiver.

Free.,"Three-quarters of Americans oppose Medicaid cuts, poll shows",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-quarters-americans-oppose-medicaid-cuts-poll-shows,,"WASHINGTON — A majority of Americans, including most Republicans, oppose major cuts in federal funding for Medicaid, according to a poll released Thursday by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.The survey shows that 76% of those questioned wouldn’t support  Congress slashing the amount of spending dedicated to the state-federal health program for lower-income Americans and some people with disabilities.Democrats held the highest rate of opposition at 95%. A small majority of Republicans surveyed, 55%, said they don’t support substantial federal spending cuts for the program.The breakdown was nearly even among respondents who identified as Make America Great Again supporters — President Donald Trump’s base — with 51% of that group saying they support less federal funding for Medicaid and 49% saying they oppose major cuts to the federal allocation.The survey comes just days before House Republicans are expected to release a bill that will likely propose cutting hundreds of billions in federal funding for Medicaid.That legislation, as well as bills from several other committees, is supposed to help Republicans offset some of the $4.5 trillion deficit impact that comes with extending the 2017 tax law.The KFF poll also showed strong opposition to slashing federal funding to other health care programs — 74% were against cuts to states for mental health and addiction prevention services, 71% didn’t support reducing federal spending to track infectious disease outbreaks, 69% opposed limiting federal dollars for research at universities and medical centers, 65% were against cuts to HIV prevention program allocations and 65% didn’t support reducing federal funding to help people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.Polling of 1,380 U.S. adults took place from April 8 to April 15 via telephone and online. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.Senate GOP watching House actionSenate Republicans are closely watching how their House colleagues restructure federal funding for Medicaid, and will likely propose changes when the entire 11-bill package comes over from the House later this year.Several GOP senators told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday they will judge the package based on how changes to Medicaid will impact their constituents.Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said he’s unlikely to support any changes to Medicaid that “will result in cutting benefits or denying eligibility for people who are otherwise working.”

“I'm all for work requirements,” he said. “I don't think you get any Republican objection to that.”But Hawley said going beyond that might be pressing the issue too far to get his vote.""I just met with the governor of my state this morning. He's in town. We just sat down and we talked about this issue,"" Hawley said, adding that Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, was “very worried about” potential changes to federal Medicaid funding.Maine Sen. Susan Collins said she’s planning to evaluate the House bill once it makes it through that chamber based on “the impact on low-income seniors who are dual eligible, families with children with disabilities, low-income families, our rural hospitals, healthcare providers.”Dual eligibility refers to people who are on Medicare and Medicaid.“I am open to carefully crafted work requirements for able-bodied adults who do not have preschool children,” Collins said. “But I have no idea what the package is going to contain at this point.”Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran said he’s told his chamber’s Republican leadership that “Medicaid is an important issue” for him in determining whether he votes for the entire package once it’s on the floor.“I’m going to look at overall how it impacts citizens, particularly people with disabilities, and how it impacts my state and the hospitals that provide services to people in Kansas,” Moran said.North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said “the challenge is going to be to find savings in line with what the president has described.”“He said he doesn't want any cuts to Medicaid,” Hoeven said. “But how do you make sure that you eliminate waste, fraud and abuse? And that the folks that should be getting it are getting it, rather than an able-bodied person who should be out there working and is able to do that and take care of themselves.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-05-01 06:01:37.501899

Aaron Dana testifies in support of prohibiting eminent domain on tribal lands before the Judiciary Committee on April 4, 2025. (Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)The Judiciary Committee advanced legislation on Wednesday to prevent the state from being able to seize Wabanki land for public use without consultation, though amended it in a way that appears to assuage at least some of the concerns raised by Gov. Janet Mills’ administration. 
The committee voted 10-4 in favor of an amended version of LD 958, incorporating a proposed amendment from the Maine State Chamber of Commerce that the prohibition would only apply to current tribal trust lands, meaning land for which the federal government holds the legal title of on behalf of a tribe, and not land that may be put into trust in the future. 
Earlier in April, the governor came out in opposition to the bill, with her legal counsel citing the inability to predict the future needs of state government and uncertainty over the future location of tribal trust land, as the Wabanaki Nations are still eligible to acquire more under the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. 
This thinking was why some on the committee did not back the plan. Sen. David Haggan (R-Penobscot) said he cast an opposing vote because he believes the power of seizing private property for public use, a principle known as eminent domain, is vital for government to properly function. 
The vote did not fall along party lines. Haggan was among the three Republicans who voted against the legislation — also including Reps. Rachel Henderson of Rumford and Mark Babin of Fort Fairfield — with Democratic Rep. Dani O’Halloran of Brewer joining them in opposition. 
While the Judiciary Committee may often be known to complicate matters, Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), who voted for the legislation, argued this issue is straightforward.
“Our relationship with the Tribes is a government relationship and we should not be able to take their land, full stop,” said Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn).
The relationship between the Wabanaki Nations and the state is complicated by the 1980 Settlement Act, which has overall resulted in the Wabanaki Nations being treated more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations.
LD 958 is the next piecemeal change lawmakers and Wabanaki leaders are seeking to make to afford the Tribes greater sovereignty. While incremental alterations to the Settlement Act have been made in recent years, sweeping change has so far failed due to opposition from Mills, a Democrat. 
Mills did not respond to a request for comment about the amendment by the time of publication. 
The U.S. government’s authority to exercise eminent domain is restricted by the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which requires just compensation for land taken, as well as some federal laws.
The 1834 federal Indian Nonintercourse Act prohibited land transactions with tribes unless authorized by Congress. However, the Settlement Act specified that that federal law was not applicable to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation.
LD 958 would amend the Settlement Act to prohibit the state from exercising eminent domain on current trust and reservation land, which is protected under federal law, though fee land — private property for which the owner owns the title — would still be subject to the state taking.
The bill would also amend the 2023 Mi’kmaq Nation Restoration Act to make this change for the Mi’kmaq Nation, which wasn’t included in the Settlement Act.
As advanced by the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, the bill was also amended at the request of Wabanaki leaders to remove the portion that had stipulated how the Tribes could reacquire land with such proceeds, which Passamaquoddy attorney Corey Hinton criticized as a paternalistic process. Instead, the bill now simply points to the federal takings process.
LD 958 now heads to the Maine House of Representatives and Senate for floor votes.

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.

Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
Fast-building states get more babies

“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Apartment construction cools rents in some regions

Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.










A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing.


– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America


Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

And it’s even more remarkable (and troubling) when the leaders doing the sharing are all women and the officials blocking action are all men.
But that’s what happened this week at the state legislature when a trio of female lawmakers who are also breast cancer survivors demanded action on legislation that would require health insurance companies to cover the cost of diagnostic imaging for the disease.
Amazingly, many insurers don’t cover those tests and even more amazingly, the male legislators who run the General Assembly have repeatedly blocked bipartisan bills to require it.
It’s an outrageous situation that, as Senator Val Applewhite of Cumberland County rightfully observed, should leave all women, quote “as mad as hell.”
The bottom line: The all-male crew behind the breast cancer screening blockade should be ashamed. Let’s hope their mothers, wives and daughters let them know about it.

The sweeping legislation aims to encourage investment in new power generation by building a moat around the market and offering tax incentives to new entrants.
Meanwhile the distribution utilities on the outside looking in will get similar tax breaks for new transmission infrastructure, as well as a ratemaking overhaul. For those so-called pole-and-wire companies, some changes are welcome. Others a bit less so.
The legislation equips the ratemaking process with a statutory ‘shot clock’ to keep deliberations to about a year at most. Utilities will also get to set rates for three years at a time, so long as there’s an annual “true up” of charges and expenses. But a system they’ve relied on for years to avoid full rate cases is going away. So is the controversial coal plant subsidy approved as part of 2019’s House Bill 6.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The legislation amounts to a substantial reworking of the state’s energy marketplace, but at least in the near term, it’s unlikely to address the concerns that drove a bipartisan coalition of backers to approve it.
The 13-state energy grid operator PJM predicts energy demand will surpass its supply in the next few years. At the same time, it’s struggling to get new power plants plugged into its system. Some leaders point to so-called behind-the-meter generation — small, purpose-built power plants for individual customers — as a potential short-term answer to the problem. Others suggest if the line with PJM is too long, maybe it’s time to look for a different line.
Senate debate
In the Senate, state Sen. Brian Chavez, R-Marietta, spoke in support of House Bill 15. Earlier this week, lawmakers tacked on several tweaks hammered out in negotiations with the House.
“In essence,” Chavez argued, “it reduces the barriers to entry for power generation, it increases the flow of investments into the state, and it makes Ohio more competitive for industries, while stimulating job creation and economic development.”
He also highlighted one important compromise. Instead of eliminating a tax on machinery and equipment, the final version reduced the tax from 25% to 7%.
State Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, urged lawmakers to revisit provisions left out of the final bill. He argued Ohio should launch a pilot program for community solar, saying lessons can be learned “in a small scale first, so we can help develop this across the state of Ohio.”
But most important, Smith applauded the measure for finally turning the page on H.B. 6.
“House Bill 15 contains huge wins for consumers that have been scarred by the House Bill 6 scandal,” he said. “But most importantly, it will keep money in the pockets of hardworking Ohioans as we end the legacy generation rider, which is costing Ohio ratepayers over $450,000 a day.”
The Senate put the proposal to a vote quickly and approved it unanimously.
Speaking after the vote, Senate President Rob McColley emphasized the importance of behind-the-meter generation. He argued the policy could be “one of the most transformational” changes state lawmakers make in the energy sector. McColley said he’s already hearing from companies that believe it will dramatically reduce the time it takes to get up and running. He added the policy could also offer a way for some power producers to sidestep the PJM backlog.
“Eventually some of these projects, once they’re built behind-the-meter, will file an application at PJM to interconnect,” McColley said. “They will not need permission to interconnect before they can build because they won’t be interconnected yet, but the ultimate goal could be that they generate enough power to send it out onto the grid.”
House debate
Across the rotunda, House sponsor state Rep. Roy Klopfenstein, R-Haviland, praised the legislation as a “great step” toward making Ohio “energy independent.”
“We know that PJM has issued significant warnings throughout the last few years,” he said, “that we are heading towards an energy shortage crisis across the entire market — as soon as next year.”
The House overwhelmingly approved the measure, by a vote of 94-2.
Speaking afterward, House Speaker Matt Huffman echoed McColley’s praise for behind-the-meter generation. He argued giving large power users an alternative will reduce their impact on the grid and give the system greater flexibility overall.
“What that does is make sure there’s more reliable energy, and with fewer users on the grid, the cost goes down,” he said. “So that’s hopefully the immediate effect.”
But far from suggesting the approach could help generators sidestep a long interconnection queue with PJM, Huffman floated the idea of sidestepping PJM altogether.
“Is PJM the right fit for the state of Ohio?” Huffman wondered. “There’s another choice, MISO, to the West, which includes Indiana and much of the Big 10 — or the old Big 10 when there was only 10 schools in it.”
Huffman said he’s already begun talking with people at MISO. The 15-state grid operator covers much of the Midwest, and stretches as far south as Mississippi and Louisiana and as far west as the Dakotas and part of Montana.
The speaker complained about PJM agreeing to changes sought by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro that “restrict the free market.”
Shapiro sued PJM arguing the price cap at an upcoming auction was too high, and customers in his state could see bills increase $21 billion over the next two years. PJM settled, and federal regulators signed off on the agreement earlier this month.
“That gives me, personally, great pause,” Huffman said. “Is that PJM board acting in the best interest of all of the members, including the state of Ohio? So, we need to ask that question that may help us some on the future issues.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)At 16 beds, Colebrook’s Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital is the smallest licensed hospital in New Hampshire.
“We call it ‘frontier medicine,’” Tom Mee, CEO of the hospital’s parent company, North Country Health, said. “It’s the lifeblood of health care for that community.”
Situated in rural northern Coös County near the U.S.-Canada border, Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital is the only hospital nearby, which makes it vital to the health and well-being of area residents.
“When an urban hospital closes or cuts back programs, you just go to the other hospital that’s five miles away,” Mee said. “In our community, you’re driving hours.”
That’s why Mee and other rural health providers are so afraid of Republican proposals in Washington, D.C., to gut Medicaid, the country’s public health care program for those with low incomes and unique needs. They argue this move would further destabilize an already challenging rural health system.
In early April, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives voted to approve a resolution outlining the federal budget, an early step in the lengthy federal budgeting process. That outline called for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to renew President Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — which his opponents and many economists decry as a tax break for the richest Americans.
The resolution tasks several legislative committees with cutting different areas of the budget. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has been instructed to cut its portion by about $880 billion over 10 years. While it doesn’t explicitly specify these cuts come from Medicaid, the program comprises about $8.2 trillion of the almost $9 trillion the committee can cut from. This means, experts say, it would be impossible to do so without reducing Medicaid or Medicare. Some Republicans have proposed shrinking Medicaid by about a third over 10 years.
If that cut went into effect, an estimated 24 million people receiving Medicaid would lose their health care coverage; 10 million of those would be children. In New Hampshire, that’s 60,000 people and 30,000 children. One in 7 New Hampshire residents in total receive Medicaid, and 17.1% of all New Hampshire Medicaid recipients live in Coös County, despite the county comprising roughly 2% of the state’s population.
North Country challenges
Mee said the country must “get past this notion that getting people off Medicaid saves money.”
“There is no model where, from a taxpayer perspective, taking somebody off the Medicaid rolls is a net positive for the taxpayer,” Mee said. “In the short term, yeah, it sounds good that we’ve got somebody off the Medicaid roll or that they’re working, but the flip side of that is that these patients then become uninsured, they don’t get preventative health visits in general, and they show up in our ERs months later, sicker than they ever were before.”
Hospitals cannot turn away patients who are unable to pay like most businesses can. They are legally required — through a 1986 law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act — to provide emergency treatment to all patients who need it regardless of ability to pay. Without Medicaid, more people will be unable to pay. Hospitals are forced to absorb that cost.
Mee called it “a long-term drain on the system.”
Coös County is the state’s largest county by area (about 1,800 square miles) and its smallest by population (about 32,000 residents). The county has three hospitals — Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital, Androscoggin Valley Hospital, and Weeks Medical Center — all operated by North Country Health. All three are designated as critical access hospitals by the federal government, meaning they’re far enough from any other hospital that the government believes they’re essential to ensure that an area has access to care.
“On a perfect day, we can drive about 90 minutes between sites,” he said. “But on a snowy day, you’re talking about real life and death at that point if we have to start cutting back on services.”
Mee said that if these Medicaid cuts go into effect, North Country Health would have to consider doing so. About 15% of North Country Health’s patients are on Medicaid, he explained.
“I don’t lie awake at night worrying about our hospitals closing,” he said. “But I do worry about whether or not we’re going to continue to offer the full scope of services that we do today.”
He said the first services they’d have to consider eliminating are in women’s health, including OB-GYNs and baby deliveries, and behavioral health, including psychiatry and substance use disorder. He said the results would be disastrous.
“If we’re not able to deliver babies in Coös County, pregnant women and neonates will die,” he said. “It’s a fact.”
Mee said the health system has already eliminated every non-essential cost.
“We’ve already picked all the low-hanging fruit,” he said. “So if Medicaid reductions, or however it looks, force us to look at it again, then we’re going to have to look at something a bit more draconian than what we’ve done in the past.”

U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander, who represents the North Country — as well as Nashua, Concord, and the western half of New Hampshire — said she’s worried about the viability of rural hospitals like those in the North Country and other rural parts of New Hampshire should these cuts be enacted.
“What I’m hearing from so many rural hospitals in our state is just how fragile they are,” Goodlander said. “I mean, they’re operating on the slimmest of margins.”
Fears of the trigger law in Peterborough
The congresswoman visited Monadnock Community Hospital in Peterborough, another rural critical access hospital, last week to hear from some of those health care leaders.
“We are really concerned about what’s going to happen with Medicaid,” Richard Scheinblum, executive vice president and CFO at Monadnock Community Hospital, said.

McGuire, president and CEO, is at left, and Richard Scheinblum, executive vice president and CFO, is at right. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)
In New Hampshire, the fear of federal Medicaid cuts is twofold. Medicaid is funded jointly by the federal government and states. New Hampshire has a trigger law on the books mandating that if federal funding for the expanded Medicaid program falls below 90%, the state government will revoke its portion of the funding for about 60,000 of New Hampshire’s recipients who receive coverage through the 2014 expansion.
“If expanded Medicaid blows up, that’s between a $1 to $2 million loss to us,” Scheinblum said. This figure is per year, he said, and he calculated it by examining figures from before expansion was enacted, factoring in recent market developments and updated variables.
Goodlander said she’s spoken with state lawmakers who don’t seem to understand what the impact of this trigger law being activated would be.
Cynthia McGuire, president and CEO at Monadnock Community Hospital, said the hospital isn’t sure they’d be able to continue employing the entirety of their current staff with Medicaid cuts. The hospital is one of the largest employers in Peterborough. Additionally, Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital, Androscoggin Valley Hospital, and Weeks Medical Center are the largest employers in their respective towns.
Scheinblum and McGuire said if these cuts went into effect, like North Country Health, they’d also have to look carefully at downsizing their operations.
“What I’d hope we could do is look at some alternative revenue sources or some other areas to scale back,” Scheinblum said, listing philanthropic grants and donations and partnerships with other hospitals as examples. “Everything would be on the table.”
They noted that due to their community’s financial support they’re really well positioned compared to other hospitals.
“There are a lot of hospitals in our state that will not survive,” Goodlander noted.
The hospital leaders emphasized the importance of critical access hospitals.
“We’re the last stop,” McGuire added. “We can’t shut our door and say we’re not going to take care of any more people today. That’s what we are here for.”
Uncertainty in Claremont
Matt Foster, president and CEO of Valley Regional Hospital, a critical access hospital in Claremont, said this moment feels like “December to January 2020 pre-COVID when something’s coming but you’re really not sure how to plan.”
He said the hospital has “started to think about” a contingency plan should these cuts be enacted.
“This has come on so quickly we’re kind of in the reactive phase,” he said. “It’s like Mike Tyson said, which is, ‘Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.’”
Foster noted the challenges their community faces: Roughly 15% of the population lives below the poverty line, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. About one-third of Claremont’s population is on Medicaid.
“Finances are like oxygen,” he said. “They’re not why we’re here but they’re necessary for life.”
Foster, too, explained that Medicaid would force their hospital to make tough decisions about services, specifically on their payroll.
“We’re about as efficient as we can be,” he said. “There’s only so many things you can do that don’t rely on (employees).”
Officials at Valley Regional Hospital, which is operated by Dartmouth Health, explained that cutting Medicaid keeps people from obtaining preventative care and forces them to go to the emergency department for things that should be handled by a primary care physician. Jocelyn Caple, interim CEO of Valley Regional Hospital, likened it to “taking a water balloon, going and squeezing it.”
“It ends up somewhere else, which is not the most efficient or effective place to pay for it,” she said.
U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen spoke with Foster, Caple, and other Valley Regional Hospital officials during a visit to Claremont last week.
“You talk about uncertainty, and one of the challenges that we’ve had in Washington is also uncertainty,” Shaheen said.
Shaheen said she’s also concerned about rural New Hampshire hospitals’ ability to remain solvent amid these cuts. Asked what recourse New Hampshire Medicaid proponents have in the event that the trigger law is enacted, Shaheen, who is a former New Hampshire governor, deflected, noting it is a state-level decision, not within her jurisdiction as a federal lawmaker.
Still, she encouraged constituents to “call your legislator, call the governor, call everybody you can think of, and let them know that that’s not acceptable.”
At the same time as federal lawmakers weigh trimming Medicaid, state lawmakers are also proposing changes to the program in New Hampshire. The state Senate passed a bill —  Senate Bill 134 — in March requiring people to work in order to receive Medicaid in New Hampshire, and the House approved a plan to charge certain Medicaid recipients premiums and increase the share of prescription costs recipients are responsible for in the budget they passed in April.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s office, which originally proposed the premium and prescription cost plan, and would have to sign off on work requirements for them to be enacted, did not respond to the Bulletin’s requests for comment about state or federal proposals.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shaheenrural-1024x659.jpg,,,2025-05-01 06:01:37.501899

Senate bill 754 would let schools start up to a week earlier than currently allowed. It passed the Senate with on a 39-7 vote. 
Since 2004, a law backed by the tourism industry required schools to start no earlier than the Monday closest to Aug. 26 and end no later than the Friday closest to June 11. 
Over the years, House members approved bill after bill to lift those restrictions. The Senate resisted any changes and the House bills died there.  
Local school boards have been defying the law. One quarter of the state’s 115 school districts voted last year to defy it, according to WFAE.
Sen. Amy Galey (R-Alamance) told senators the bill was a product of weeks of discussions with the NC School Boards Association and the state’s travel and tourism industry. The industry has a strong financial interest in school calendars, she said.
The change senators endorsed Wednesday would allow traditional calendar schools to open no earlier than the Monday closest to Aug. 19 and close the academic year no later than the Friday in May before Memorial Day. 
In the House, the chamber’s K-12 Education Committee on Tuesday approved repealing the calendar law with a bill allowing local school boards to decide on their own when the school year starts and ends.  The House Rules Committee was set to vote on the bill Wednesday evening, likely its last stop before it reaches the House floor. 
The Senate bill establishes the State Board of Education as a gatekeeper. It will decide whether districts deserve to open a week early. The bill includes penalties for school districts that defy the law. The board would be required to withhold financial support for districts’ central office administration until the districts comply. Individuals and businesses within school districts would be able to sue those that don’t comply with the law. Courts would be able to award claimants up to $10,000 and attorney’s fees.

Ohio Senate Bill 86 would require intoxicating hemp products to be sold only at adult-use marijuana dispensaries instead of allowing them to be sold at CBD stores, convenience stores, smoke shops, or gas stations. The bill now moves to the Ohio House for consideration.

“Current intoxicated hemp products are untested and unregulated,” said Ohio state Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City. “The bill protects buyers from gaining access to these intoxicating products and ensures adults can still purchase them from existing regulated operators.”
Huffman introduced the bill with state Sen. Shane Wilkin, R-Hillsboro. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has implored lawmakers to regulate or ban delta-8 THC products. 
The bill would also impose a 10% tax on intoxicating hemp products, ban sales to anyone under 21, and would only allow intoxicating hemp products to be sold at dispensaries if the products have been tested and comply with standards for packaging, labeling, and advertising. 
During discussion on the bill on Wednesday, senators talked primarily about how the bill would protect Ohio kids. 
“This bill regulates intoxicating hemp products and removes the untested, unsafe items that are marketed toward children from corner stores and vape shops and gas stations,” said state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus. “It includes requirements for product testing, safe packaging, age verification. These are all common sense measures.”
Wilkin spoke about how a health commissioner in his district came across an intoxicating hemp product that looked like Rice Krispies cereal box. 
“That is marketed to kids,” he said. “We don’t know what’s in them and unfortunately they are, without question, ending up in our kids’ hands and that’s not right.”
Children’s safety and standardization got the Senate Democrats on board with the bill as well, according to Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood. 
“The more we can narrow in the standardization and some oversight … and the safety of them, the better we are,” she said. “Is it perfect? No, but does it really get to some of the positive changes for safety’s sake? I think so.” 
CBD store owners previously testified against the bill, arguing this could potentially put them out of business. During testimony in March, Bellefontaine business owner Jaimee Courtney said the bill would eliminate 90% of the “non-intoxicating full-spectrum hemp products” her business offers, and that the bill would “drive consumers to unregulated online markets.”
“I don’t have a lot of sympathy for some of those businesses that are now being forced to not offer a product that was very clearly dangerous and targeted towards children,” said Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon. “I still think if (shops) were operating before (intoxicating hemp), they’re going to be able to operate after.” 
Members of the marijuana business, poison control workers, and religious organizations testified in support of the bill.  
The 2018 U.S. Farm Bill says hemp can be legally grown if it contains less than 0.3% THC. Ohio is one of about 20 states that does not have any regulations around intoxicating hemp products, according to an Ohio State University Drug Enforcement and Policy Center study from November 2024.

(Mark McCormick)When I learned that William “Buggs” Polite, one of my oldest friends and a person I deeply admired from my old neighborhood, had died following a stroke, my thoughts turned to Ta-Nehisi Coates’ 2015 masterpiece, “Between the World and Me.”
In one passage, Coates discussed losing his friend and classmate Prince Jones. Buggs wasn’t young, but to many of us, he was every bit the prince, and one who’d long been denied his crown. Buggs experienced the plunder of opportunities so common for Black professionals.
Still, he continually gave and continually served.
“I would smile whenever I saw him,” Coates wrote of his friend, “for I felt the warmth when I was around him and was slightly sad when the time came to trade dap and for one of us to go.”
That passage suits Buggs, the quintessential example of the good person you wanted good fortune to bless.
Buggs was a fixture of my childhood.
Playing 21 on a homemade goal behind Tony Hill’s house. Tackle the Man football along Don Eaton’s red duplex. Bumper pool and basketball pickup games at the MEFSEC (Moving Effectively for Social and Economic Change), now the Lynette Woodard Center.
Buggs stood out. He didn’t bully us. He seemed interested in what us little kids said. He encouraged us. I remember playing an entire summer of baseball and him smiling there in his bowlegged stance, at the last game of the season, after I swatted my one and only hit.
At North High, Buggs blazed trails.
One of our beloved counselors, Tommie Williams, bragged about how Buggs posted a near-perfect ACT score, and that Buggs had broken the classroom barrier of a teacher who’d said Black students couldn’t excel in his class.
He wrote an insightful editorial for the North Star newspaper, explaining how men wearing an earring could symbolize ties to African culture. He launched “B-BASE,” or Blacks for Better Academics and Social Equality.
Buggs then headed east to Atlanta’s historic Morehouse College, the school that accepted Martin Luther King Jr. when King was only 15. Buggs majored in math and eventually led charter schools. He once worked for one of basketball icon Magic Johnson’s foundations.
That meant little when he returned to Wichita and applied for a leadership position at a neighborhood youth center. We were shocked and angry when he wasn’t chosen. He was one of our brightest stars.
You might expect someone so accomplished to join in the orgy of self-promotion that seems so commonplace, but I don’t remember him ever bragging, even though he was one of the few who justifiably could. He wanted that job. I sensed his disappointment.
I’d once written an article about the city’s Black brain drain. Famed architect Charles McAfee inspired the article. He said our segregated community produced numerous Ph.D.s who were forced to leave Wichita to find opportunity.
That’s theft. That’s plunder. Too often, our hometown served as a killing field for Black professionals’ dreams. I felt that was a crown that had been denied him.
Undaunted, Buggs continued to give, and he eventually gained his crown as a stalwart in the public school system.
He tutored kids in math. He and Hercules Finley visited incarcerated youths and encouraged them. Buggs secured a building allowing him to expand his vision. He excitedly raised money and the hopes of community youths.
“The thing to understand about Prince Jones is that he exhibited the whole of his given name,” Coates wrote. “He was kind. Generosity radiated off him, and he seemed to have a facility with everyone and everything. This can never be true, but there are people who pull the illusion off without effort, and Prince was one of them.”
Buggs, too.
A lasting image of him came after my mother’s funeral. I had just slipped Pastor Lincoln Montgomery folded bills through a handshake as my family patriarch instructed, and there stood Buggs, his face registering the hurt and concern you’d expect from a friend.
“There are people,” Coates said, “whom we do not fully know, and yet they live in a warm place within us, and when” we lose them, “and the dark energy disperses, that place becomes a wound.”
This wound, for me and for that community, will take years to heal.

Andy Harris (R-1st), Maryland Matters has learned.","Maryland Housing Secretary Jake Day speaks at the Maryland Sustainable Growth Awards ceremony on April 3, 2025. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Jake Day, the secretary at the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, is beginning to raise money for a possible challenge to U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), Maryland Matters has learned.
At the urging of leading Democrats, Day, a former mayor of Salisbury and one of the most high-profile members of Gov. Wes Moore’s Cabinet, has set up an exploratory campaign committee under the Federal Election Commission’s “testing the waters” guidelines for candidates. He is soliciting donations to pay for a poll to gauge his strength in a hypothetical general election against Harris, the lone Republican in the state’s congressional delegation.
Day has hired Adeo Advocacy, a powerhouse Baltimore-based fundraising firm that works for Moore and other leading Maryland Democrats, and is expected to engage a pollster soon, several Democrats said.
In a brief interview Wednesday evening, Day confirmed the exploratory effort but was otherwise circumspect.
“I’m flattered that people are interested in this,” he said. “I’ve heard a lot of messages of support over the past few weeks. I’m focused on my day job and time will tell on everything else.”
WBOC-TV in Salisbury first reported the existence of the exploratory effort three weeks ago, but the full extent of Day’s political activities ahead of a potential congressional bid have not previously been publicly known.
Early GOP candidate for governor taps former delegate as running mate

Maryland Democrats have long dreamed of knocking off Harris, the chair of the arch-conservative House Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill who is serving his eighth term. But under the gerrymandered congressional district lines fashioned by Democrats in the General Assembly, the 1st District, which includes the Eastern Shore, Harford County and a slice of Baltimore County, is overwhelmingly Republican. Even highly touted Democratic challengers like former state delegate and ex-gubernatorial candidate Heather Mizeur have fallen far short of defeating Harris over the years.
Harris won reelection last fall by 22 points over Democrat Blaine Miller III, at the same time President Trump was carrying the district by almost 17 points. Harris reported  having $884,283 in his campaign account as of March 31, according to his latest report with the FEC.
But hope springs eternal for the Democrats, who believe Trump’s current polling slump and Americans’ plunging confidence in the U.S. economy could provide rare opportunities for the party in the 2026 midterm elections. At a minimum, Day’s potential candidacy could bolster Moore’s reelection efforts next year — particularly if he faces a tough challenge from former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) — by engaging Democrats in a congressional district that the party does not often prioritize.
Day, a 42-year-old Army veteran, has long been considered a rising star in Maryland politics — and perhaps one of the few Democrats who could give Harris a tough race in the 1st District. He served on the Salisbury City Council from 2013 to 2015 and as mayor from 2015 to 2023. But it is often difficult for ambitious and accomplished Eastern Shore Democrats to progress far politically given the region’s conservative lean.
Adam Wood, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party — whose chair is Harris’ wife, Nicole Beus Harris — referred questions about the congressman’s reelection to the Harris campaign. The campaign did not immediately respond to an email Wednesday evening seeking comment.
Day endorsed Hogan for reelection, rather than the Democratic challenger, Ben Jealous, in 2018. At the time, he argued that Hogan would be a more effective partner for the city than Jealous, though there was undoubtedly a political element to the endorsement as well.
Municipal elections in Salisbury are nonpartisan affairs.
Day also endorsed then-Comptroller Peter Franchot over Moore in the 2022 Democratic gubernatorial primary, citing his longstanding ties to Franchot and his top advisers. But as telegenic, energetic military veterans, Day and Moore have quickly bonded, and Moore has made housing affordability and availability a top priority, elevating Day’s role in the administration.
Day has created a fundraising entity through the IRS. If he chooses to run for Congress, he’ll have to set up another campaign committee with the FEC, and any contributions for his exploratory effort will then be made public. Individual donations for the Democratic primary are capped at $3,500.
But if Day does not go ahead with a congressional bid, the donations to his exploratory committee will not be disclosed.

The CO2 gas fills pore spaces located within these formations. 
Recently, Ohio’s legislators introduced bills HB 170 and SB 136, which will give the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) primacy (primary control) over Ohio’s Class VI carbon dioxide injection wells. Currently, the U.S. EPA has control and issues the permits for Class VI wells. 
H.B. 170 and S.B. 136 will allow the ODNR chief to force non-consenting property owners to surrender use of the “pore space” under their private property. 
“A storage operator who has obtained the consent of owners of at least 70 percent of the pore space proposed to be used in a storage facility may submit a statutory consolidation application for the operation of the entire proposed storage facility to the chief of the division of oil and gas resources management,” H.B. 170 states.
Private landowners have no rights or the ability to stop this dangerous asphyxiant from being stored under their homes.
CCS does not remove any existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but rather captures carbon dioxide from industrial processes, including ethanol fermentation, methane reforming, Portland cement production, and emissions from fossil fuel power plants. The process is energy intensive and expensive. The CCS equipment can require up to 30% of the energy that a power plant produces.  
A recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change found “the levelized costs of electricity (LCOEs) for thermal power generation with CCS are at least 1.5 to 2 times above current alternatives, which include renewable energy plus storage.” 
In addition to increased electricity bills, taxpayers will be picking up the costs for the 45Q tax credits for carbon dioxide captured. The Inflation Reduction Act established rates per ton of CO2 sequestered at $85 per ton. Considering that a large coal power plant emits 15 million tons of CO2 per year; the subsidy would be $1.25 billion in taxpayer dollars per year for one power plant.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLEThere are many concerns about safety throughout the entire process, including the toxic chemicals needed to sequester the CO2 gas, the pipelines used to transport the gas, and issues with Class VI wells leaking CO2 gas. Some estimates say at least 900 miles of pipelines would be required to carry CO2 across the state from sources to injection wells in eastern Ohio. 
In 2020, the Mississippi town of Satartia experienced a pipeline rupture in a 24-inch pipe. The pipe spewed out CO2 at a pressure of 1300 psi for more than three hours. The accident resulted in 200 people being evacuated and 45 taken to the hospital, with many having resulting chronic illnesses.
Nearby cars shut off or failed to start because of lack of oxygen needed to operate internal combustion engines. Carbon dioxide gas is odorless, colorless, doesn’t burn, is heavier than air. It is also an asphyxiant and intoxicant, which makes releases from CO2 pipelines harder to observe and avoid especially when it spreads and migrates off the pipeline right-of-way.
In 2009, concerned citizens living in Darke County successfully mobilized over a 14-month period to stop a proposed carbon sequestration project. 
“The 35-member Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Project (MRCSP) cancelled the $92.8 million dollar proposal to inject one million tons of carbon dioxide captured over four years from an ethanol plant in Greenville, Ohio,” according to a report from Recharge News.
There is no guarantee that the CO2 will remain in the rock strata in perpetuity. Several factors could contribute to leaking of the super-critical CO2 gas from the underground storage locations. One of these is seismic activity. 
“The presence of seismic activity, both natural and induced, is of great importance when evaluating CO2 sequestration potential. Extensive fault zones may provide leakage pathways along which CO2 could migrate,” according to a study published in Environmental Geosciences. 
Additionally, the very act of injecting high-pressure CO2 into continental crusts could induce earthquakes and jeopardize carbon storage. 
“Deep borehole stress measurements at the Mountaineer coal-burning power plant on the Ohio River in West Virginia indicate a severe limitation on the rate at which CO2 could be injected without the resulting pressure build-up, initiating slip on preexisting faults,” according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.
The fact that Ohio has over 36,000 orphan oil wells also adds to the risks of injecting high pressure CO2 into Ohio’s Appalachian counties.
Finally, current CCS projects have shown that the process fails to capture the promised amounts of CO2 and many of the taxpayer subsidized projects have been terminated. 
According to the Geoengineering Monitor, after decades of research, “there is no evidence that CCS can address the causes of the climate crisis or significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
CCS is too risky and too expensive.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
 ‘It’s the system that needs fixing’

Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed it into law Monday.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
The new law requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
 Opposition to ‘science of reading’

Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.













A student's likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute





In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

After spending 25 years on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Intel was replaced on the index by Nvidia, a leader in artificial intelligence, in late November. The company also had mass layoffs in October, cutting 15,000 jobs.
An Intel spokesperson declined to answer questions about how this could impact Ohio but pointed to Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s statement, which said, in part: “We are navigating an increasingly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment … We are seen as too slow, too complex, and too set in our ways—and we need to change.”
Still, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine remains positive that the plant will be built by Intel’s updated date — in the 2030s.
“They put now close to $8 billion into the ground,” DeWine said. “There’s going to be chips that are going to be made there, I will guarantee you that.”
But he acknowledged the struggles the company is facing.
“What happens with Intel, what the future is with Intel — we certainly don’t know,” the governor said.
They are not the only major corporation cutting the work of thousands of Ohio workers. Microsoft recently stopped a $1 billion project to create multiple data centers in the state. The company did not respond to requests for comment.
“It would be a bad look for all of Ohio, including us with the trades, if everything went south and they just walked away,” Knisely said about Intel.
Still, the governor is telling Knisely not to worry.
“No company is going to invest as much money as they have already put into Ohio and walk away from it,” DeWine said.

Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s only filed candidate for governor has tapped a former state delegate as his running mate.
John Myrick, a Republican candidate for governor, tapped former Del. Brenda Thiam to round out his ticket as lieutenant governor.
Myrick, who ran a brief and unsuccessful campaign for U.S. Senate in the 2024 Maryland Republican primary, was the first — and so far, only — candidate to officially file for office in February. Following that, Myrick said he established a panel of advisers to seek a running mate.
“Quite frankly, one name was at the top of that list from the very beginning,” said Myrick, who announced Thiam had filed the required paperwork at the Maryland State Board of Elections just prior to their public announcement.
Myrick has spent the first part of the year speaking to Republican groups. It is not clear how much money he has raised. His first report will not be filed with the state until next year.
Democratic Gov. Wes Moore and Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller are expected to seek re-election in 2026 backed by a well-funded campaign machine.
Other Republicans, including Gov. Larry Hogan, have been mentioned as potential contenders in the Republican primary. Hogan, the first two-term Republican governor in Maryland since Theodore McKeldin, is a seasoned campaigner and adept fundraiser. His entry into the race could present challenges for other Republican primary candidates.

Myrick, a Prince George’s County resident, is a staunch critic of Moore especially on budget, tax and economic policies.
“Every Marylander wants lower taxes. Every Marylander wants safer streets,” Myrick told a crowd of about a dozen supporters gathered Wednesday on the grounds below the south side of the Maryland State House. “And we’re going to give that to them. In order to do that, it takes a bit of common sense, and more importantly, integrity and accountability.”
Myrick, in an interview after the announcement, said the cuts to federal jobs in Maryland and other adverse decisions by President Donald Trump are a direct reflection of Moore’s refusal to “work with” Trump.
“Pennsylvania hasn’t suffered like this. They have a Democrat governor,” Myrick said. “You know why they haven’t suffered on this? Because Gov. [Josh] Shapiro up there will work with this administration. He will maintain a cordial relationship with this administration, and he has.
“Our governor has publicly said he can’t. So what incentive does the federal government have to not savage Maryland? You know, I use that because I honestly feel that way,” Myrick said. “They’ve savaged Maryland over our top political personalities who refuse to work with them.”
It’s a punishment on Maryland he said would have also happened had Moore’s predecessor, Larry Hogan, been in office.
“I say that because of Larry Hogan’s animosity with Donald Trump, the animosity that they have between each other,” Myrick said.
Myrick, who will be 61 later this year, lives in Lanham with his wife Nancy Nevarez-Myrick. He is a federal consultant who previously served as a Harford County deputy sheriff and is a 23-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force Reserve, as well as a civilian intelligence officer, according to his campaign biography.

Myrick, in promoting his lieutenant governor, offered his stark contrasting comparison to Miller.
“I cannot govern the state by myself,” he said. “Unlike the current governor, I knew we needed a lieutenant governor who was the most qualified, best person for the job — not just somebody who can stand there and look cute. That’s what he’s got. That’s unacceptable.”
Miller, 60, served two terms in the House of Delegates representing Montgomery County. She holds a bachelors degree in civil engineering and has experience as an engineer, planner and transportation official in Montgomery County and Los Angeles County, California.
While in the House, Miller served four years on the Ways and Means Committee and four years on the Appropriations Committee. She worked on  paid family leave, transportation, domestic violence and STEM education, among other issues.
A Maryland Democratic Party spokesperson blasted the “blatant sexism” of Myrick’s remarks about Miller.
“It’s why John Myrick is a failed Republican politician that finished fifth in the Senate primary last year,” the spokesperson said. “Lt. Gov. Miller is a transportation engineer, former legislator, and proven statewide leader with years of service to the people of Maryland and continues to fight for us as the state’s lieutenant governor.  The remarks today show he doesn’t understand what governing actually means, or what kind of leadership Marylanders look for.”
Speaking to the gathered supporters Wednesday, Thiam (pronounced “cham”) said she planned to help “right this ship, to champion the values that are important to all of us.” Included in those, she said, were reducing taxes and “burdensome regulations” and a focus on the creation of  nongovernment  jobs.

“We’re going to make Maryland great again,” Thiam said. “I can guarantee you that.”
Thiam, a Washington County Republican, was the first Black woman Republican to serve in the House when she was appointed in October 2021 to fill Paul Corderman’s seat, when he was appointed to replace retiring Sen. Andrew Serafini. She lost her bid for election to the seat in 2022.
Thiam holds a master’s degree in education, focusing on special education, from the University of Maryland, College Park, a doctoral degree in special education leadership from Capella University and a post-graduate certificate in applied behavior analysis from Penn State University.
She has worked in special education for more than 20 years in both public and private Maryland schools as a teacher and, later, as an administrator managing teaching staff and budgets, as well as students with special needs.
“My favorite thing is fixing education and returning it to teaching the students, giving them the tools they need to be successful in their life and forgoing all the indoctrination that our current administration seems to think is important to us,” Thiam said. “All those strains of ideologies that we will not tolerate for our children.”
In an interview after the announcement, Thiam was asked to elaborate on the “strains of ideologies” that concern her in public education.
“Well, when you think about the conversations that are occurring, particularly in Frederick County, with what they’re going through, and having bathrooms for young people who may consider themselves of a different identity, but they can use the (different) bathroom,” Thiam said.
When asked if she was referring to students who identify as transgendered, she said “absolutely.”
Thiam also expressed concerns about “books that are questionable on our bookshelves for students to check out and read.” She said she did not believe those books were in libraries in Washington County “but in Frederick County, that does exist.”
In addition to her time in Annapolis, Thiam also ran an unsuccessful campaign last year for the 6th Congressional District seat.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Thiam stumbled out of the gate at Wednesday’s announcement, saying the “lieutenant governor is the president of the Senate. So, the fact that I have served in the House of Delegates, I’ve served in this fine institution. I know that I am prepared to get the work done.”
In Maryland, the lieutenant governor does not serve as Senate president, who is elected by senators from their own ranks. Sen. Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) has held the position for the last six years, and before him the position was held for more than three decades by Sen. Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr.
The Maryland Constitution defines the role of lieutenant governor, who is  the second-highest officer in state government, but whose duties are limited. Primarily, the lieutenant governor succeeds the governor in the event of a vacancy or fills in as acting governor if the governor is temporarily unable to fulfill the duties of the office. Other than that, the role is limited to duties delegated by the governor.
The lieutenant governor also chairs a half-dozen state panels, including the State House Trust, and serves as a member on four other panels.
Thiam later acknowledged the error when asked by a reporter, saying it was the result of late night research and a historical reference to the duties of the position.
Christopher Christian Cox was the only lieutenant governor to serve as Senate president. He was elected in 1864, at a time when governor and lieutenant governor were elected independently, and served one term before the position was abolished under the 1867 version of the Maryland Constitution, according to the Maryland State Archives.
The position was reestablished by voters in a 1970 constitutional amendment. The recreation of the office fulfilled a promise by Gov. Marvin Mandel, who was House Speaker in 1969 when the legislature elected him to fill the vacancy created when Gov. Spiro Agnew became vice president under Richard Nixon. At the time, there was no clear line of succession for the state’s chief executive officer.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0182-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-01 05:00:31.089238

(Photo by Joe Zimmermann/ Maryland Department of Natural Resources)The Trump administration’s dismantling of the federal AmeriCorps program will be felt in Maryland state parks, classrooms, nonprofits and food pantries, state officials said during a Wednesday news conference.
About 250 Maryland AmeriCorps workers were dismissed over the weekend, said Paul Monteiro, Maryland Secretary of Service and Civic Innovation.
“We had to start making calls Friday evening into Saturday morning to inform them of the immediate termination of their grants,” Monteiro said. “Many of our members will likely face subsistence-level challenges, given that they’re ineligible for unemployment insurance and were already living on very modest stipends.”
The list includes 41 members of the Maryland Conservation Corps, who were expecting to continue working through the popular summer season at state parks, maintaining hiking trails, clearing invasive species and educating visitors, said Rachel Temby, deputy director of the Maryland Park Service.
“The impacts of this hasty decision have been felt from the mountains of Western Maryland to the shores of the Atlantic,” Temby said.
After a stop-work order was issued Saturday, state officials rushed to call all of the workers, some of whom were helping with weekend events such as the Pollinator Festival at Assateague State Park and the Market Fair at Fort Frederick, Temby said.
“They were pulled from service, and then many of them made the independent — and very considerate — decision to return as park volunteers to those activities that weekend, wishing to continue with their commitment to serve in any capacity they could,” Temby said.

A primary concern is that the AmeriCorps members will suddenly lose their “very modest” cost-of-living stipends, Monteiro said, forcing them to reconsider things like housing and health insurance.
“Our department is doing our level best to support demobilized members,” Monteiro said. “The first of the month is here in short order, and [members will be] accessing housing, accessing food, on top of being separated from organizations and networks they’ve been invested in over the course of the year.”
The members, between 17 and 25 years old, also expected to receive an educational stipend of about $7,000 at the end of their service terms, which they could use to pay student loans, Now, they are likely to receive a pro-rated portion of the stipend — not the whole thing.
A Moore administration official said Wednesday that the “bare bones” administrative staff at AmeriCorps, “gives me a lot of heartburn” about workers’ benefits.
Maryland is one of 24 states and the District of Columbia that are suing the Trump administration over its steep and sudden cuts to AmeriCorps. The lawsuit says that on April 15 AmeriCorps officials, at the behest of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), put all members of the National Civilian Community Corps on leave, and told them their service would be terminated on April 30. A day later, the suit says, AmeriCorps put about 85% of its paid staff of about 700 workers on administrative leave.
Last week, AmeriCorps began sending reduction-in-force notices to the paid staff and on Friday, after regular business hours, it began notifying states that about $400 million of AmeriCorps programs were immediately terminated.
The lawsuit argues that only Congress, not the administration, has the power to slash the agency.
“The Administration’s abrupt decision to dismantle AmeriCorps flouts Congress’s creation of AmeriCorps and assignment of agency duties; usurps Congress’s power of the purse and thereby violates the Constitution’s separation of powers,” the suit says.
Maryland Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz said Wednesday that the Conservation Corps program, which began in 1984, has had an immense impact on state parks.
“If you’ve hiked on a trail, if you’ve gone to a bathroom in a state park, you most likely are touching a project that the Maryland Conservation Corps has done over the years,” Kurtz said.
Maryland leads 25 states in suit to block Trump administration efforts ‘gutting’ AmeriCorps

DNR was projected to contribute about $1.6 million to the Conservation Corps program this year, the agency said, with AmeriCorps contributing about $922,000.
According to a DNR news release from last August, that year’s graduating class improved more than 2,400 acres of parks and public lands; planted more than 9,963 native trees, bay grasses and plants; treated more than 7,902 trees against harmful insects and diseases; and taught environmental education programs to more than 23,750 visitors.
Conservation Corps members have been instrumental in protecting one of the state’s older forest ecosystems, located in Swallow Falls State Park, said DNR spokesman AJ Metcalf. The area includes thousands of eastern hemlock trees, which have been victimized by invasive hemlock wooly adelgids.
In 2024, Conservation Corps members treated more than 7,000 of the trees, saving them from early deaths. The pesticide application took six days, but will last seven years, Metcalf said.
“Hemlock treatment is a simple process but requires significant human energy,” Metcalf wrote. “Many MCC members report that hemlock restoration work was one of the most rewarding projects of their term.”
For the individuals who spend a year in the corps, the program is a “career ladder,” Kurtz said, allowing them to gain skills that fuel careers in conservation fields. More than 50 current staff members at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources are Conservation Corps alumni, Temby said.
Temby said she supervised teams of Conservation Corps members for about six years, in her role as a Maryland Park Service ranger, and watched the program evolve, propelled by energetic workers.
“The sudden decision to terminate AmeriCorps funding for this program has dire impacts on the hopes and dreams of our corps members, but also the operations of the Maryland Park Service,” Temby said.

,California,2025-05-01 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Lawmakers might undermine California’s landmark public pension reform,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/public-pension-reform-california/,A bill that would usher in a major change in pension law could cost local governments billions. Yet it is sailing through the Legislature without any opposition.,"Thirteen years ago, a minor political miracle occurred in California’s Capitol.
A Democrat-dominated Legislature passed and a Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, signed a significant overhaul of state and local public employee pension systems.
It was a miracle because the reform was universally opposed by public employee unions, which were and still are the Capitol’s most potent political interests with long-standing ties to Democrats.
The overhaul, championed by Brown, made it into law because the state was then recovering from a very severe recession that had devastated government finances, and pension obligations — which had expanded sharply during the prior Gray Davis governorship — had become unsustainable burdens.
Mandatory pension payments into the California Public Employee Retirement System had been factors in the bankruptcies of two cities, and unfunded obligations for future benefits totaled many tens of billions of dollars.
The legislation capped benefits, increased retirement ages, blocked maneuvers that artificially increased some pensions, created a two-tier system that maintained benefits for current workers but limited them for future hires, and required workers to pay for at least half of pension costs.
“This is the biggest rollback to public pension benefits in the history of California pensions,” Brown said as he signed the bill. “We’re lowering benefits to what they were before I was governor the first time and reducing costs by up to $55 billion in PERS and billions more in other local pension systems. Under the new rules, employers and employees alike are going to contribute their fair share of the costs, resulting in a more sustainable system.”
Not surprisingly, some unions challenged aspects of the reform, particularly those outlawing pension-spiking maneuvers, but Brown fought back and won in the state Supreme Court. However the court refused to take a further step Brown sought, eliminating the “California rule” that prohibits reducing benefits for workers once they are enrolled in the system.
This bit of political history forms the background of new legislation that would, if passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, begin to undo what the 2012 reform wrought.
Assemblymember Catherine Stefani, a San Francisco Democrat, is carrying the legislation, Assembly Bill 569, which would repeal one of the major provisions of the reform banning local governments from enacting “supplemental retirement benefits” for their workers.
Stefani and the Teamsters Union, the measure’s sponsor, contend that Brown’s reform leaves workers without sufficient pension benefits to offset California’s notoriously high costs of living and makes it difficult for local governments to fill vacancies.

California’s immense pension dilemma 

by Dan Walters 
August 10, 2020August 6, 2020 




“It simply gives local governments and their employees another option at the bargaining table, one that might make the difference between losing or keeping a talented worker,” Stefani told the Assembly Public Employment and Retirement Committee last week.
The bill whipped through the committee on a 7-0 vote, including the committee’s two Republicans, Tom Lackey and Juan Alanis, both of whom are former police officers.
While the bill’s advocates say that it would merely be permissive, giving local governments the option to increase benefits, its practical effect would be to gut one of the reform’s most important safeguards. It would restore the ability of local government unions to put political pressure on city councils, county boards of supervisors and other local officials to expand benefits for the workers who have been hired since the reform was enacted, long a sore point for unions.
It’s amazing that such a major change in pension law would begin moving through the process without, so far, any opposition or even comment from the local governments that it would affect.

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/05/01/judge-says-lawsuit-against-health-department-can-proceed-over-missed-nursing-home-inspections/,"A group of nursing home residents can press their lawsuit against the Maryland Health Department over lapsed nursing home inspections, and the case can proceed as a class-action suit, a federal judge has ruled.","The U.S. District Court in Baltimore. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)A group of nursing home residents can press their lawsuit against the Maryland Health Department over lapsed nursing home inspections, and the case can proceed as a class-action suit, a federal judge has ruled.
Those findings came after U.S. District Judge Matthew J. Maddox denied the department’s request to dismiss the case.
In that April 22 ruling, Maddox approved “class certification” for nursing home residents “who have disabilities and mobility impairment, and who live in nursing facilities” overseen by the Department of Health. Some 9,000 Marylanders fit that description and will be represented as the case continues, according to Justice in Aging, one of the advocacy groups leading the lawsuit.
“At this early stage of the litigation, the Court finds the facts alleged in the Complaint sufficient to draw a chain of causation between MDH’s oversight and enforcement failures and Plaintiffs’ particularized and unique injuries and risks as mobility-impaired residents of nursing facilities,” according to Maddox’s opinion. “Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Complaint … shall be denied.”
Attorneys representing five nursing home residents filed the complaint in the U.S. District Court for Maryland last May against the Health Department and its then-secretary, Laura Herrera Scott. The lawsuit alleges that the state’s failure to conduct annual nursing home inspections, as required, has led to substandard care for residents of those facilities.
“It’s a very positive step that we survived the motion to dismiss and provided sufficient evidence to the court for class certification,” said Liam McGivern, an attorney at Justice in Aging, while noting that there is still a long court process ahead.
Health officials cut inspection backlog of nursing homes, advocates demand more

The complaint asks the court to force the department to conduct nursing home surveys on the federally required 12-month schedule and ensure that complaints issued against nursing homes are answered in a reasonable time frame. It also asks for attorney’s fees and any other relief deemed appropriate by the court.
With its motion to dismiss rejected, the department has until May 20 to respond to the complaint. A department spokeperson did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Maddox’s ruling comes at a time when the health department is actively working through a years-old backlog of nursing home inspections. The department said it is making progress, with more than half of the state’s 220 nursing homes receiving an annual inspection within the last 16 months.
But with some facilities being more than four years overdue for an inspection, advocates fear that some Maryland seniors may be languishing in unsafe living conditions while the state plays catch-up.
“They’re still woefully behind,” McGivern said. “When complaints are not timely investigated, it often means that they’ll never be meaningfully investigated … The backlog is so bad when the state finally gets around to investigating a complaint months or years later, they’re not really able to adequately conduct that investigation — records are lost, residents have moved on, staff have moved on, the facility has changed ownership”
The initial court complaint outlines some nursing home residents’ troubling experiences in their facilities, some of which had not been inspected by the health department for four years. The plaintiffs have mobility-related disabilities and rely on nursing staff for moving around the facility, eating and personal hygiene. The lawsuit alleges that residents were often left unattended for extended periods, leaving them isolated from community events or sometimes left in soiled clothing for hours, among other concerns outlined in the lawsuit.
“When the state does not go in to survey and make sure that nursing facilities are doing what they’re supposed to be doing, that falls most harshly on people with mobility impairment – and so, discriminates against them within the meaning of the ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act],” McGivern said. “They have no way to remedy, for example, their call not being answered or the facility not helping them leave their beds, leaving them confined and isolated in their room.”
In the time that has passed since the initial court filing, one plaintiff has died, a 75-year-old identified by the pseudonym “Herman Dressel.” The complaint said Dressel had mobility limitations that required staff assistance bathing, dressing and getting in and out of bed. But as with other plaintiffs in the case, he did not receive the daily support to help him move about the day and receive the incontinence care that was expected for his services.
McGivern noted they are not claiming that his March 30 death “is the result of any lack of oversight,” but should be a reminder of the vulnerable people who are at the center of the lawsuit.
“Often times, it seems that the issues that arise in a nursing facility are in the shadows,” he said. “There’s not any light shown on them and a lot of that has to do with the fragility of some people in nursing facilities who aren’t able to raise these issues for themselves and who unfortunately often times die while waiting on the state to investigate their claims, or that complaint. That is quite common, I’m afraid.”

Marjorie Taylor Georgia U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is making noises like she might make a run for U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff's seat in 2026. Al Drago/Getty ImagesBrian Kemp is not a large man, but he is the Big Dawg. The scramble doesn’t start until the two-term governor says it starts.
But once Kemp makes up his mind whether to run for the U.S. Senate next year, he will set off a mad dash by politicians of both parties hoping to move up a notch or two in Georgia’s political hierarchy. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is making noises like she might be one of them.
I don’t mean to scare you. Greene is one of those politicians who can’t be beaten within her district, but who can’t win outside that district. She can’t win a statewide general election in Georgia. She probably can’t win a statewide primary either. 
Look at the numbers: In the 2024 election cycle, Donald Trump carried Greene’s north Georgia district by 37 percentage points, while Greene won it by 29 points. If you underperform Trump by 8 points in your own district, if a good number of your own voters are willing to embrace Trump but find you too bizarre, then trying to win statewide is a fool’s mission.
Which by definition means she might try anyway. 
On Saturday, standing before a banner reading “Save America. Stop Communism,” Greene told an annual convention of her home-district Republicans that “the Democrat Party is overcome with evil,” and she urged them to help the GOP take back the U.S. Senate seat won five years ago by Jon Ossoff.
“It was never theirs to begin with,” Greene said to cheers and applause. “That was stolen, that Senate seat was stolen, and so was Warnock’s Senate seat stolen, just like Donald Trump’s election was stolen in 2020.”
It’s always tempting, and often unfair, to use a party’s more extreme personalities to characterize the party as a whole. Republicans do it, and so do Democrats. But in listening to Greene’s comments, I was struck by the fact that in the second Trump administration, Greene is closer in tone and content to the Republican mainstream than she was in his first term. She has gone from outlier to MAGA mainstream, and it isn’t Greene that has moderated her attitude. The second Trump regime has moved much closer to Greene.’s view of the world
Consider the role of free trade. In her remarks, Greene offered a pretty accurate description of Georgia and its current importance in the global economy.
“Georgia is the economic hub of the Southeast,” she noted. “Georgia has the third largest port in America. That is incredible control of shipping and trade. Georgia has the busiest airport in the world, in the city of Atlanta. Georgia has two corridors, I-75 and I-85, that run through our state, branching out into our neighboring states. That’s more trade, that’s interstate, that’s commerce. Georgia is the economic hub of the Southeast, and the Democrats want to take control of it just like they took control of California years ago and just like they control New York.”
The economy that she describes is the investment of generations, investment that has made Georgia more productive and prosperous than most of its Southern neighbors. Everything she cites – our ports, our highways, Hartsfield-Jackson airport – are publicly funded infrastructure. 
But as we’re about to be reminded in the next few months, a Georgia economy built on logistics and global commerce is also much more vulnerable to the disruptive, chaotic and undisciplined trade policies of the Trump regime. In fact, it’s probably not accurate to describe them as policies at all. They seem to be more the product of urges and resentments than of rational planning.
That’s certainly how Greene’s economic “theory” comes across.
“I’m tired of our state leaders importing foreign countries’ companies to our state, claiming job creation,” she told the crowd. “You want to know the reality? That big old battery plant in Cartersville….? Here’s the reality: They’re bringing in something like 200 to 300 families from Korea to work in that battery plant.
“They didn’t create jobs in Georgia by doing this, they are importing jobs into Georgia.”
That “big old battery plant” is a joint venture between two Korean firms, expected to employ thousands to build enough electric batteries to power 300,000 electric vehicles a year. At the Indeed job-search site, the plant is advertising engineering jobs paying up to $120,000 a year, shift supervisors making $34 an hour, jobs that provide 401ks and health insurance, with production slated to begin later this year.
But according to Greene, “that’s not what Georgia needs to be doing … they’re not helping Georgia be Georgia. It’s changing Georgia, and we’ve all witnessed this for years now, starting with the Hollywood tax credits.
“I do not want to associate with those (Hollywood) people. I don’t like their values, I don’t like their award ceremonies, I don’t want them living in our state and taking advantage of our tax dollars … We need to be supporting Georgia-born and -bred companies in our state.
“Georgia has been invaded,” she asserted. “Georgia has been watered down.  Georgia is on the verge of being lost.”
As Greene noted, that’s the Georgia First version of the America First approach taken by Trump, and both versions are economically illiterate and irrational. The damage that they could potentially do – the damage that has already been done – will undo the work of generations and require generations to repair.

Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) has second thoughts about a Trump impeachment resolution.","President Donald Trump speaks at a “Make America Wealthy Again” trade announcement in the White House's Rose Garden on April 2. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)President Donald Trump (R) reached his first 100 days in office this week, a milestone that appeared to spark 10o opinions from Maryland lawmakers on his performance so far during his second term.
But like most things Trump-related, those opinions largely fell into just two camps — love him or loathe him.
The seven-member Freedom Caucus was clearly in the first camp. The MAGA-aligned Republicans in the Maryland House of Delegates applauded Trump for his “decisive actions during the first 100 days of his second term,” according to a statement from the group Wednesday.
“His leadership has focused on prioritizing American interests, ensuring long-term economic stability, and safeguarding individual freedoms,” their statement said, adding that Trump’s various executive orders increasing immigration enforcement that highlight his “strong commitment to securing the nation’s borders and keeping communities safe.”
Trump, himself, celebrated his 100 days at a rally in Michigan where banners proclaimed a new “golden age” for America.
Not surprisingly, Maryland Democrats were seeing red, not gold.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), in a 42-minute speech on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon, said Trump’s first 100 days had brought “chaos and destruction.” He said Americans are giving Trump “a big fat ‘F’ for the first 100 days. Total, miserable, failure.”
“This is all a Trump-afflicted wound on America and American families,” Van Hollen said. “Donald Trump has embarked on a law-breaking spree that has torn up our Construction, torn up apart our government and torn down our economy.”
Van Hollen joined other Maryland lawmakers who blamed Trump and billionaire and DOGE director Elon Musk for creating job losses and negatively affecting programs like SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

“Trump has pushed for devastating cuts to federal workers’ benefits, Medicaid, Head Start and SNAP, all so his billionaire buddies get one more giant tax cut,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said in a statement Wednesday. “Across the country, the people are rising up and sending a clear message to Donald Trump: we need an economy that works for working families, not for autocrats and oligarchs.”
Sens. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) released a report claiming to show how the Trump administration has hurt senior citizens and people with disabilities. The report said a Trump administration plan to slash Medicaid funding would result in higher prescription drug costs.
“It is clear that those who have been leading our country these last 100 days and making decisions about our health care are not only wildly unqualified, they are dangerous. Our families deserve better, [and] we are sick of it,” said Alsobrooks, who took office in January.
Another Maryland freshman, Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd), said the administration’s mass firings of federal workers harmed Maryland institutions such as the Social Security Administration, National Security Agency and National Institutes of Health.
“I firmly believe that Congress should be a responsible check on every President’s power and must reassert itself as a co-equal branch of government, which is why I will continue to speak out against the President’s most harmful policies and use every tool at my disposal to protect our communities,” she said in a statement.
Rep. Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd), a one-time high school government teacher, stuck with the report card them others used for Trump’s first 100 days. On social media, Olszewski wrote and circled an “F” next to civics, economics, world history and health.
“As you can tell, not a great start. So President Trump, you might want to come see me after class,” he said, while holding a red marker.
Mfume pulls name from impeachment resolution
Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) was signed on as a co-sponsor Monday of a resolution calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump (R), but by Tuesday he had asked to have his name removed from the proposal.
Awkward? Not so, said an Mfume spokesperson.

“Congressman Mfume removed himself as a cosponsor from H. Res. 353 because he was made aware it was not cleared by Democratic leadership and not fully vetted legally — and he preferred to err on the side of caution,” according to a written statement from Mfume’s communication office Wednesday.ol
Mfume was one of three Democrats who pulled their names off the measure, along with Reps. Jerry Nadler of New York and Robin Kelly of Illinois. That left just the original sponsor, Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.), and co-sponsor Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) on the resolution.
The resolution cites seven articles of impeachment against Trump, who was twice impeached by the House in his first time in office, but never convicted by the Senate, allowing him to stay in office. Included in this latest impeachment effort is a charge of “obstruction of Justice, violation of due process, and a breach of the duty to faithfully execute laws,” citing the recent erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, among other issues.
“He has … acted in contempt of court for violating a court-sanctioned settlement agreement,” and “conducted enforced disappearances of persons without due process and without disclosing their fate and location to their families and legal counsel, in violation of the Constitution adfrt5nd the rulings of the Supreme Court, as well as the foundational principles of due process and the rule of law,” the resolution says.
The other articles of impeachment in Thanedar’s resolution include: Usurpation of the appropriations power, abuse of trade powers and international aggression, violation of First Amendment rights, creation of unlawful office, bribery and corruption, and tyranny.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2208184612-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-01 01:01:45.744204

It won’t be its mid-20th century norm of Whirlaway and Citation, British royals and Hollywood stars, movie newsreels and Time magazine covers, of course, or the half-life reburst of that era epitomized by Secretariat. Or the subsequent coasting on old glories and nostalgic Americana. 
Those times were based largely around a curated commonality — the sport of horse racing, real and imagined — and are ancient history. The current norm is a lot more corporate and complicated and revolves around an unsought intersectionality of the business and politics of horse racing, broadly defined. 
Start with Churchill Downs Inc., the track’s corporate parent. Formed in 1950, CDI was low-profile for decades but has morphed into a publicly-traded, nationally leading racing, online wagering and gaming company, with some 29 casinos and racing properties across 14 states.  It had record net revenue of $2.7 billion last year, up 11% from 2023. 
Numbers for the Derby last year showed a record $320.5 million wagered from all sources on Derby day and on the Derby race alone a record $210.7 million. Attendance of 156,710 was the highest since 2018 (the record of 170,513 was set in 2015). And the race attracted an average 16.7 million viewers on NBC and Peacock, the most since 1989. 
Over the past two-plus decades, CDI has spent more than $500 million on capital projects at Churchill, capped by a $200 million paddock redesign completed last year that CEO Bill Carstanjen said “drove the Derby experience and our financial results to a level we could not have imagined just a few years ago.”
In February, CDI announced plans for  $920 million in projects to expand and renovate its infield and grandstand and improve its infrastructure. The projects, slated to begin this year and be completed in 2028, were paused last week, CDI said, due to increasing uncertainty surrounding construction costs related to tariffs, trade disputes and current economic conditions. 
Its completed projects have turned Churchill, a National Historic Landmark site, into a modernized physical plant that dominates what remains of the working-class South Louisville neighborhood around it. (Over recent decades, CDI has acquired numerous properties in the neighborhood to construct  grand entrances and add landscaped and parking areas.) 
Inside its gates, there are a plethora of new and renovated hospitality spaces, suites and rooms at almost every turn, shaping an overall milieu Churchill terms an “experience.” The track has become an entertainment facility, with racing, including to an increasing extent the Derby, more plotline than raison d’etre. 
Except for the iconic 1895 twin spires, vestiges of its pre-renovation past — sprawling betting and concession spaces packed with motley crowds, hidden corridors, brick walkways, a crowded paddock, a wide-open and raucous infield, trough urinals in men’s rooms, beer on tap — disappear year by year and the environment becomes less soulful and more gentrified and risk-averse.   
For the Derby, the certainty of Churchill’s corporate march is being intersected more and more by the uncertain state of American racing. For decades, the sport has faced predictions of demise, given its aging fan base, marginal TV coverage and competition from lotteries, casinos and online sports betting. Its current troubles include shrinking field sizes, reduced purses and the closing of major tracks, including Hollywood Park in greater Los Angeles (where the first Breeders Cup was held and now the site of SoFi Stadium) and Arlington Park near Chicago.
The Derby’s attendance, financial and television numbers, which seem to break records each year, belie the demise. But then there are the numerous racing-related drug scandals and on-track horse deaths that have become recurring national news in the past decade. The drug scandals have involved prominent trainers and led to suspensions and federal indictments and convictions. The deaths have forced major tracks to close for investigations of surfaces and training practices. (Nationally, racehorse fatalities have been decreasing, with the rate last year falling to its lowest level in 16 years.)
Both drugs and deaths have directly impacted Churchill. In 2021, Medina Spirit, who finished first in the Derby, was disqualified for failing a post-race drug test. That led to a  protracted and very public legal battle involving the horse’s high-profile trainer, Bob Baffert, owner Amr Zedan and Churchill. The track prevailed and Baffert, whose horses have won a record-tying six Kentucky Derbies, was banned from Churchill for three years. He returns this year and has two horses running in the Derby. 
Churchill also became a focus of media and public attention when 12 horses died at the track during its 2023 spring meet. Two of the deaths occurred on Derby day. The track suspended racing to investigate the situation and moved the remainder of its meet to Ellis Park (also owned by CDI) in Western Kentucky. Last year, 13 horses died racing or training at Churchill. And just last week, a three-year-old horse was euthanized on the track after fracturing his front legs during a morning workout.

The politics of racing have catalyzed around drug and death issues and gained widespread traction. In 2020, after years of lobbying by groups from The Jockey Club to PETA, Congress authorized the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority (HISA) to develop and implement a national, uniform set of safety and anti-doping and medication rules. It’s now in effect at 47 tracks in 19 states. (PETA continues to push for stricter horse safety standards and investigate and highlight racing’s underside.) 
Racing’s most recent political issue is decoupling, which surfaced in Florida early this year when the owners of Gulfstream Park, a leading national track, proposed separating the facility’s racetrack from its casino, ending casino revenues supporting  racing and closing the track in a few years. Though strongly opposed by Florida horsemen, legislation allowing the decoupling passed the state House and a Senate committee. Gov. Ron DeSantis has indicated his opposition and its outcome is unclear.
Many in the industry believe that, if approved in Florida, decoupling would set a precedent and jeopardize racing across the country. Churchill wouldn’t be affected by such a scenario since casinos aren’t legal in Kentucky. But the track is closely coupled to historical horse racing (HHR), an electronic gambling product where players bet on replays of races on slot machine-like terminals. HHR, along with live racing, accounted for $1.3 billion of CDI’s $2.7 billion net revenue last year and it provides significant support for Churchill’s racing purses, including the Derby’s $5 million one.
Despite its success in Kentucky, HHR hasn’t become a panacea for American racing. Its legality as pari-mutuel wagering (as opposed to slot machine gambling) has frequently been challenged, and it’s allowed in only a handful of states. In March, it was struck down by the Louisiana Supreme Court for operating in the state without voter approval. That decision led CDI to announce a 25% cut in purses at Fair Grounds, the New Orleans racetrack it owns.
For CDI and the Derby, HHR and ongoing record profits, popularity and expansion is the bull-market side of its current norm. What to make of the bear-market side — drugs, deaths, track closings and the like —  is the question. Is it all much ado about nothing or a portent of the Colosseum and Rome before the fall? So far, the main response seems to be deferral or, every now and then, a muted “But not yet. … Not yet.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-01 04:01:13+00:00,CT Mirror,A ‘soft coup’ in progress,Walter Meltzer,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/01/a-soft-coup-in-progress/,We are in the first or second stage of a soft coup in the U.S. There is no need to wait and see if we’re in a constitutional crisis.,"We all know what a hard coup is. That is where a political leader with an autocratic craving uses the military to violently overthrow a population with brute force and subjugate them to the extreme views of the dictator. A soft coup is the preferred method of the leaders of Turkey, Hungary and others.
The method is well planned, detailed and strategic. Your main opponents are the legislature, judiciary and the press. If you’re a charismatic populist the legislature has already bowed to your will due to multiple fear factors – loss of job, personal safety and possible imprisonment.
We are in the first or second stage of a soft coup in the U.S. There is no need to wait and see if we’re in a constitutional crisis or if we’ve “crossed the Rubicon.” This happened the minute the election was over. This coup was in the planning stages for four years. They even published their battle plans.
The first step in fighting this is to acknowledge that we’re already in an existential crisis. You can’t adapt a strategy until you realize how desperate the situation already is. You also can’t just fight with anger, emotions and protest. You have to carefully analyze the situation, determine strengths and weaknesses, what boundaries contains the administration and how to maximize the defense of democracy and our constitution.
If you think capitulation to a despot is a workable response you could ask any of the oligarchs that have tried to appease Putin, if they weren’t dead or terrified. It is risky fighting at the current stage of a soft coup but nearly impossible once they consolidate power.
Donald Trump’s administration does have some weaknesses and constraints that will constrain their progress. There isn’t a uniformity of purpose, there are many conflicting goals in this gang. There is a time constraint bound by when the midterm congressional races start.
In his current self-destructive mode Trump is making most people very angry and all but his loyalist supporters are regretting their vote. Then there is his current mental state. He can be clinically described as a narcissist and is subject to the distortions that malady imposes.
He’s like that guy at a high school reunion who has waited half his life to get even with everyone who ever slighted him. He is wasting precious time doing just that rather than sticking to a carefully orchestrated plan. He is also not thinking rationally, nor does he have any meaningful plan for improving any aspect of governance in our country. He is just ranting about his pet grievances and seems to have a short memory and attention span.
Financially he has retreated when advised that he could start another great depression and he does pay attention to poll numbers. The military is hopefully the strongest bulwark against a hard coup. Although individuals must have individual ideologies and opinions, the discipline of the military is an individual sacrifice for the greater good. Service members risk their lives to defend our democracy at home or at foreign nations they might not have even have heard of. It’s hard to imagine the US military participating in a coup and using brutal force against its own citizens.
Unfortunately, there are many strong points to this ongoing soft coup. Foremost is Trump’s skill in the media. People seemed swayed simply by his swagger and style and tend to ignore what he’s actually saying. Another is an extremely conservative Supreme Court who seems confused about what branch of government they occupy. Re-writing the Constitution, voiding hard-fought laws such as the Civil rights Act and Voting Rights Act because they deemed them no longer necessary and expanding executive power to a dangerous degree is not a mandate intended for the highest court in the land.
Trump has managed to bully the entire Republican Party into submission. There didn’t seem to be a lot of bravery or forethought to overcome to start with. Congress is the one group that actually can command executive authority and stop the slaughter of our institutions and freedom. You would think that there would be four senators and four members of Congress that would be outraged enough on their own to sacrifice their careers for the good of their country and switch parties without additional encouragement.
But apparently, they need to be confronted with the reality if the direction of the country continues into chaos that they will be voted out of office anyway. So, my suggestion is that everyone makes that abundantly clear in every town hall, every protest and every confrontation possible. You won’t get another chance. Ask the Russians how the resistance is going.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-01 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Pope Francis: A legacy of love,Michelle Loris,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/01/pope-francis-church-as-field-hospital/,"we are taking time to reflect on Pope Francis’ legacy of love that is visionary, groundbreaking, and transformative for the Catholic Church.","Here at Sacred Heart University, we mourn the loss of our Pope and Pastor. 
From the beginning of his papacy, we have felt a special bond with him.  We are the first university to name a building after him —Bergoglio Hall, which was dedicated by the pope’s friend from childhood, Rabbi Abraham Skora; and we also offer the Bergoglio Lecture series that has featured several Francis-appointed cardinals. In addition, we are a Laudato Si’ campus that recently completed a week-long recognition of Earth Week.
Francis worked to extend the work of the Vatican II Council, and Sacred Heart University was founded by and is shaped by Vatican II thought. Now we are taking time to reflect on Pope Francis’ legacy of love that is visionary, groundbreaking, and transformative for the Catholic Church. 
He brought a Vatican II vision that read the signs of the times through the lens of gospel love and mercy. His first encyclical, Laudato Si’, a landmark work, called the world to hear the cry of the earth and the poor. He insisted that we pay attention to the degradation we reaped upon our common home and to recognize the social and economic injustice that this degradation has brought to the poor and marginalized.
In what is a fearless Apostolic Exhortation, Amoris Laetitia, he wanted to extend the conversation and deepen the reflection on the complexities and concerns of the diverse structures of contemporary families. Despite the dubia leveled against this document, the work underscores that God’s love and grace are the foundation, and yes, the maverick Francis wanted to move the church to take a pastoral approach toward respecting and accompanying all families on their journey to God with compassion, mercy and understanding.
Perhaps his most daring and transformative work extending the vision of Vatican II will be the Synod on synodality. Francis’ aim was to change our way of being Church. He brought together clergy and laity, men and women and those with opposite positions, listening to each other and in conversation about what for some were the difficult topics of lifting up the role of women in the church, the LGBTQ community, married priests, divorced and remarried couples. And despite the unfinished work of the Synod, Francis wanted to widen the church’s tent and show that all the People of God are included in God’s loving embrace.
Fiducia Supplicans is a Pastoral declaration on blessings for couples in what the church refers to as irregular situations including same sex relationships. This document received some extremely negative responses, but Francis defended it as being  a way to show God’s love and mercy to those in different relationships. This document does nothing to change Church doctrine about the sacrament of marriage, but it expresses a gesture of love and compassion that Francis wanted the Church to bring to the people on the margins.
I recall introducing this document to my students in our Human Journey: Catholic Intellectual Tradition seminar class. We had been reading an excerpt from Fr. James Martin’s book Building a Bridge: How the Catholic Church and the LGBTQ Community Can Enter into a Relationship, Compassion, and Sensitivity and, while the students were pleased with the idea of Fr. Martin’s book, they still complained about the Church’s position on LGBTQ individuals and other forms of relationships. 
Every student in the class had a friend or family member who was LGBTQ, and a number of the students had parents who were divorced and remarried. Some of these students admitted being disaffiliated from the church because of its views on these forms of relationships. When I brought in Fiducia Supplicans and had the students read and discuss it, they responded positively to what they saw as the church being welcoming and inclusive. This response from my students was what Francis intended—a pastoral way for the church to express love and mercy as Jesus had done and to bring people closer to their faith.
Francis viewed the church as a ‘field hospital.’ He wanted the Church to go to the margins bringing love, mercy and care to the poor, the migrant, the dispossessed. He was the sole moral voice speaking about the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. He strongly criticized President Donald Trump’s policy on immigrants, and he urged Catholics to show compassion and care for the immigrant.  At Lampedusa he railed against our indifference to the suffering of others. His voice, filled with love and care, spoke loudly for those who had no voice.
His sacramental gestures symbolized the love and mercy he wanted the church to bring to the world. He was the first Pope to take the name of Francis, after Saint Francis of Assisi and, like his namesake, Francis chose simplicity and humility. When he was selected Pope and stepped onto the loggia, he asked the people to bless and pray for him. 
He chose to live in the Vatican’s guesthouse rather than its Apostolic Palace and, for his burial, he chose Santa Maria Maggiore rather than St. Peters with a simple stone reading Francis. He held, embraced and blessed the children wherever he travelled. When asked about a gay priests, his well-known response was “Who am I to judge?” He washed the feet of women and prisoners. He reached out and embraced a disfigured man in the crowds. 
While in the hospital with double pneumonia, he called the Parish in Gaza each night. Francis loved being with the people. Even though at Easter, he was not sure he should go into the crowds, he went anyway. How else to bring love into the world and “become the word in body as well as spirit.” And just before he died, he thanked his nurse for taking him to the people.
Dilexit Nos: On Human and Divine Love of the Heart of Jesus Christ was —very fittingly— was Francis’ last encyclical, and we at the university have been reflecting on this document to understand more deeply how our mission and culture are imbued with Francis’ vision and thought. In this last letter from Francis, we find a message for all of us. Francis wrote that the heart, rooted in the Sacred Heart of Jesus, is the core of our humanity and the source of our ability to love. 
As our Pope and Pastor, Francis lived, wrote about, modelled and exuded that love for us —for all of us. “Todos! Todos! Todos!”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-01 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Just Cause Eviction is an essential policy for the health and safety of CT residents,Patricia Lewis and Teresa Quintana,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/01/just-cause-eviction-is-an-essential-policy-for-the-health-and-safety-of-ct-residents/,"In Connecticut, the combination of high housing costs and low vacancy rates has created what some have deemed as the worst place in the country for renters.","Juana is a Hartford resident who immigrated to the United States over 10 years ago. In 2022, like many Connecticut renters, Juana faced a substantial and unaffordable rent increase. 
Terrified by the prospect of eviction, she sought help from Make the Road CT (MRCT) – a community-based organization focused on empowering immigrant and working-class communities. Neighbors from Juana’s building joined her at MRCT and they learned to collectively address the rent increase by organizing to demand better housing. 


Unfortunately, many residents received eviction notices soon thereafter and some of Juana’s neighbors fled in fear. This tragedy could have been prevented if Connecticut had a Just Cause eviction protection policy in place.
The experience of Juana and her neighbors is unfortunately not uncommon. Stable housing is not the reality for many renters in Connecticut where housing costs are unaffordable, and few policies exist to protect tenants from price hikes and retaliatory evictions. There is a long history in our country of treating renters as second-class citizens, and they currently face segregationist zoning policies, limited protections in economic crises, and exclusion from tax policies that benefit homeowners. In this restrictive environment, housing instability is commonplace, and many low-income renters shuffle from one bad apartment to another, often involuntarily.
For Juana, a single mother and survivor of domestic violence, fighting the unwarranted eviction was the only option to protect her family from homelessness. While all renters in Connecticut face highly inflated rent costs, many immigrants encounter additional challenges, such as language barriers and lack of credit history, which further complicate finding quality housing. Despite paying taxes, immigrants often lack access to subsidized housing due to not having a Social Security number. These factors place immigrant families like Juana’s at greater risk of experiencing housing cost burden and eviction.
In Connecticut, the combination of high housing costs and low vacancy rates has created what some have deemed as the worst place in the country for renters. High housing costs place renters at risk of eviction. In fact, Connecticut towns that have high rental costs compared to average incomes have greater eviction rates. Here, landlords are able to evict tenants in order to raise rent prices, even when tenants have been paying the rent on time. And this occurrence happens more often to Black and Latino/a renters, particularly female-headed households like Juana’s.
HB 6889, An Act Concerning Evictions for Cause could help address this injustice. This bill would build on protections already in place for elderly and disabled residents and expand protections to all renters in Connecticut. Specifically, HB 6889 would prohibit landlords from carrying out ‘no fault’ evictions of tenants occupying units in buildings with more than five units. This means that, if a tenant is paying their rent on time like Juana was, they cannot be unjustly evicted because the landlord wants to raise the rent.
Recent evidence indicates that, if passed, this policy would not stymie housing production, but it would serve to keep families like Juana’s stably housed. The prevention of eviction and homelessness can help build stronger and safer communities for renters and homeowners alike. This policy would put us in line with other progressive states like California, Colorado, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, and Washington, which already have just cause eviction laws.
Preventing no-fault evictions through the HB 6889 could  also have life-saving impacts. Research indicates that high rental burdens and subsequent evictions place renters at an increased risk of adverse health outcomes, including mental distress, reproductive health outcomes, and even premature death. Preventing no-fault evictions would also address retaliatory evictions that take place when tenants advocate for improved health and safety conditions in their unit. This would be especially important for families with children, who have a disproportionate risk for eviction and subsequent economic difficulties.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)For the third time in two years, the Alaska Legislature has approved a bill that seeks to increase long-term state funding for the state’s K-12 public schools.
On Wednesday, the state Senate voted 17-3 and the House voted 31-8 to approve House Bill 57, which would permanently increase the base student allocation, core of the state’s per-student funding formula, by $700 per student, or $183 million across the state per year.
The bill also makes some policy changes for charter schools, creates a grant program to encourage schools to improve students’ reading performance, and establishes an education task force to recommend further changes.
“I can’t express how much gratitude that I know all of Alaska is sending with the message that we’ve sent,” said Rep. Alyse Galvin, I-Anchorage, after the House passed the bill.
“Everybody wants something for children, and to see what we’ve seen, people working together … I think that was achieved and we found a little something for everyone.”
Wednesday’s votes send the bill to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who vetoed two previous bills that attempted to increase the BSA. 
The governor did not have an immediate comment on the Legislature’s action. Dunleavy, on a trip to Washington, D.C., was unavailable for questions by phone, a spokesperson said.
While the Legislature failed to override the governor’s two previous vetoes, the result of a third override could be different, legislators said.
“It’s one of the most sweeping sets of policy reforms for education, I think, in state history,” said Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage and the original author of HB 57. “And I think that’s why you see such unity between the chambers and from every caucus. And that kind of unity is unprecedented.”
Since the start of April, the governor has urged the Legislature to include policy changes for charter schools, an open enrollment policy between schools and districts, an extra funding boost for homeschooled students, and grants for school districts whose students meet reading standards. 
In talks over the weekend, the Republican minority caucuses in both House and Senate negotiated some of those provisions into HB 57. That was enough to sway some Republicans who voted against prior school funding measures, such as the recently vetoed House Bill 69.
“That’s the process; you do the best that you can, and this is a much better bill than HB 69,” said House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage. She voted against House Bill 69, but in favor of HB 57.
“Vetoing HB 69 set the stage for being listened to by the majority. When we stuck together on that veto, we were basically sending a message that there were other things that needed to happen,” Costello said.
“While nobody is perfectly fine with the outcome of this bill, it makes it a step in the right direction, and we couldn’t have gotten there if we hadn’t held firm on that.” 
In an unusual move, the governor’s education commissioner sent a letter to school district superintendents on Monday, asking them to lobby the Legislature in favor of the governor’s proposals. 
Within the letter, she said that if the Legislature failed to meet the governor’s demands, he could end up vetoing money used to pay for the updated formula. 
In the end, some of the governor’s requests were included, but others — including an extra funding boost for homeschooled students — were not. 
Last year, lawmakers approved $174 million in one-time bonus funding on top of the BSA, so the formula change would not significantly increase year-over-year funding. Instead, the change’s main advantage is that it allows school districts to plan ahead when budgeting, instead of waiting to see what the Legislature approves each year. 
“Having the stability of the funding in the formula is critically important,” Fields said. 
Without the change, school districts have to act as if there will be no funding bonus, a possibility until the state budget is finalized. That means warning teachers of possible layoffs, then rehiring them when money is approved.
“Having (the BSA increase) in policy avoids this destructive policy of pink slips and replacement,” Fields said.
At the start of the year, school districts said they needed a BSA increase of more than $1,800 to keep up with inflation since 2011. The final version of HB 57 is a little over a third of that figure, and some lawmakers called it a good first step.
“Fairbanks schools are suffering right now. Our schools have been starving for well over a decade. It’s absolutely critical that we invest right now. This funding is stabilizing our school district and districts across the state, and it was a no-brainer,” said Rep. Ashley Carrick, D-Fairbanks.
But not everyone was pleased with the final result — of the Legislature’s 60 members, 11 Republicans voted against the bill, and one, Rep. David Nelson, R-Anchorage, was excused absent.
Rep. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, said she was unhappy with the final versions of policy proposals inserted into the bill. The reading grants won’t become effective unless a bill updating corporate taxes becomes law. Open-enrollment provisions, which would allow students to transfer between schools and districts, were referred to a task force and not included in the bill.
“I just felt like the policy positions that were taken in the bill were not strong policy positions,” she said.
Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, also voted against the bill.
“I don’t think it’s enough. I think we need to focus on our kids,” he said.
Electoral factors may have been in play for Wednesday’s vote.
In a column published by the conservative website Must Read Alaska, Bob Griffin of the Alaska Policy Forum opined that if the legislative session were to end without an education bill, the “outcome wouldn’t just harm our kids, it would also complicate Republican messaging in the next election, particularly with swing voters drawn to simplistic narratives.”
Before Wednesday’s House vote, the Alaska Senate needed to fix errors revealed after it approved HB 57 on Monday.  
There were two errors, lawmakers said. One involved the use of “shall” instead of “may” in a funding clause, raising concerns that it could run afoul of the Alaska Constitution’s prohibition on budget accounts for particular programs. 
The second involved a mistake on the effective date of a program that distributes grants to schools whose students reach certain benchmarks for reading skills. Those grants would begin with the 2026-2027 school year, not in January, halfway through the 2025-2026 school year.
The Senate had voted 19-1 in favor of HB 57, but its vote on Wednesday was 17-3.

The change was largely due to the way the new reading grant program is linked to passage of Senate Bill 113, a bill that updates corporate tax law pertaining to internet sales.
That change is expected to raise as much as $65 million per year, and proceeds would be directed toward the reading grant program. 
If there’s more than enough money to fund that program, the extra cash would be available for career and technical education programs in high schools.
“That’s going to be huge, I think,” said Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka. 
Amid a state budget crunch, education “is the only area in the state where we’re increasing spending,” he said.
But some senators noted that if SB 113 doesn’t become law, the reading grants won’t just be defunded — they’ll be eliminated entirely.
“We are conditioning not only the funding of the reading grants … but the existence of the reading grants on another bill or policy,” said Sen. Robert Myers, R-North Pole.
For that reason, he said, he was unable to vote for the bill. 
“I do find it a little odd that we guarantee a ride to school, but we don’t have that guarantee that we’re going to incentivize the growth of reading,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, voted in favor of the bill on Monday but changed his vote on Wednesday, saying he wasn’t aware that the reading grants were contingent on the revenue bill.
“I’m kind of on a hope and a prayer that those things happen. … That makes it problematic for me,” he said.
Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, also voted in favor of the bill on Monday and against it on Wednesday for the same reason.
After Wednesday afternoon’s final vote, a House majority spokesperson said he expects HB 57 to be transmitted to Dunleavy on Thursday.
When the bill is sent, the governor will have until May 17 to sign the bill, veto it, or allow it to become law without his signature.
If he vetoes it, the Alaska Constitution calls for the Legislature to meet “immediately” for a vote to override or sustain the governor’s decision. Forty of 60 legislators, meeting in joint session, would have to vote for the bill in order to override a veto. 
Legislators have not overridden a veto since 2009.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Education Commissioner Deena Bishop sent a letter to superintendents statewide urging them to lobby legislators for the governor’s education policy items – or risk Dunleavy again vetoing an increase to school funding.
On Wednesday, some superintendents from districts across the state shared reactions to the commissioner’s veto threat, calling it “surprising,” “concerning” and “disappointing,” and called for state support for Alaska schools.
“We are at a make-or-break point,” said Roy Getchell, superintendent of the Haines School District in a phone interview, referring to many districts facing steep deficits, program cuts and school closures. “It’s not a game. It’s a reality. It’s something that all sides have worked hard and spent a lot of time on. It’s a nonpartisan issue.”
Bishop’s letter sent on Monday, as first reported by the Anchorage Daily News, came ahead of an Alaska Legislature vote on House Bill 57, which would permanently increase the base student allocation, core of the state’s per-student funding formula, by $183 million per year. The bill also added policy changes that many lawmakers saw as a compromise with Dunleavy after he vetoed a larger education boost on Apr 17 citing a lack of policy changes. On Wednesday, the Senate voted 17-3 and the House voted 31-8 in favor of the bill, sending it to Dunleavy. 
In the letter, Bishop listed Dunleavy’s policy priorities she said superintendents should speak for, including grants for districts showing student reading improvements, open enrollment for students across districts, and increased funding for homeschool programs. 
“​​If these critical reforms are not included, we risk repeating the challenges of previous years when the education bill — and its funding components — were vetoed. We also face the possibility that the funding element of the bill could be reduced or vetoed, as it was for FY24,” Bishop said, referring to Dunleavy cutting $87 million, half of on-time funding, approved by the Legislature in 2023. 
“Please prioritize reaching out to your House and Senate members as soon as possible,” she wrote. “A personal call or email stressing the importance of these reforms and their direct impact on your district will be highly effective.” 
Madeline Aguillard, superintendent of the Kuspuk School District in the middle Kuskokwim River region, expressed her concern in an email on Wednesday. 
“For a sitting commissioner to send a politically charged message that appears to threaten a gubernatorial veto, particularly one directed at local education leaders working tirelessly on behalf of their communities, was surprising and concerning to receive,” she said. 
She said Dunleavy’s policies are focused on urban and Railbelt districts, while rural districts like Kuspuk are in desperate need of a basic funding increase. “In Kuspuk, there are no charter or private schools—and there is no community interest in creating them. Our families want safe, fully staffed brick-and-mortar public schools. They deserve that,” she said. 
“Kuspuk families experience some of the highest poverty rates in the state. Our buildings are crumbling, our curriculum is over a decade old, and we are struggling to retain staff due to uncompetitive wages. Yet we continue to be an afterthought in these policy discussions,” she said. “Where do districts like ours fit into the state’s long-term vision for education?” 
Aguillard emphasized that while districts support the current legislation and funding increase, the proposal is still insufficient for schools grappling with almost a decade of flat funding, rising costs, inflation and deferred maintenance accumulating at schools. 
“This feels like the futures of our students are being used as bargaining chips in a game that overlooks the vast and varied realities of education across Alaska,” she said.
Shannon Harvilla, superintendent of the Bristol Bay Borough School District, also urged bipartisan support for the education funding bill.
“While I was surprised by Commissioner Bishop’s letter—particularly its tone and timing—I remain focused on what matters most: stability and opportunity for Alaska’s students,” Harvilla said in an email. “I’ve witnessed firsthand how a decade without meaningful BSA increases has strained our ability to recruit staff, balance budgets, and meet the needs of students. A bipartisan solution has been passed, and I believe now is the time for support—not political pressure.”
Harvilla also noted the advocacy efforts of the Alaska Superintendents’ Association, which “actively engaged in good-faith dialogue with both the Governor’s Office and the Legislature throughout this session,” he said. “Their goal, which I support, has been to advocate for a responsible compromise that reflects the realities we face at the local level.” 
Getchell, with the Haines Borough School District, expressed frustration with the ongoing political debate, and state leaders leaving schools without financial certainty almost at the end of the school year. “I don’t know on May 1 what my budget is going to be,” he said. “This isn’t about emails, it’s not about superintendents or governors or commissioners. It’s about 5 year olds and their futures. And I think they deserve better than this.”
Dunleavy’s office declined to comment on the letter or effort to pressure lawmakers. 
After legislators passed the funding bill, several members of the multipartisan House majority caucus expressed their concern at the letter.
Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, told reporters after the Legislature’s vote on Wednesday that she had a call from one superintendent that spoke in support of Dunleavy’s policy items, but declined to say who. 
House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, also commented on Bishop’s message.
“I don’t think her letter had any material effect,” he said. “I don’t remember, at least as a legislator, ever seeing an agency head or a department official attempting to get outside entities, such as school districts in this case, to actively work to persuade the Legislature to take the position. I don’t remember that happening.”
He added: “It surprised me to see that.”
The education funding measure, House Bill 57, is expected to be transmitted to Dunleavy on Thursday. He has until May 17 to sign the bill, veto it or allow it to become law without his signature.
If Dunleavy again vetoes the legislation, this time legislators said they may have the 40 votes to override it.  
It’s less clear whether the Alaska Legislature could override the threat in Bishop’s letter. If Dunleavy were to veto money needed to fully fund the new BSA, overriding that veto would require 45 votes, just three votes fewer than the combined number of House members and senators who voted for HB 57. 
In addition, lawmakers would have to call themselves into a special session or wait until the Legislature reconvenes in January. A special session wouldn’t be an easy ask, Edgmon said.

Current Nebraska law offers a narrow exception to the ban for people with one or two drug possession or drug use felony convictions. They can access Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, formerly known as food stamps, if they have completed a licensed and accredited treatment program.
Rountree’s bill would open the door for other felony drug offenders who currently can’t access SNAP benefits, as long as they’ve completed their sentence or are on parole or under post-release supervision.
An amendment that passed Wednesday, on a 32-14 vote, added a requirement that those with three or more felony drug convictions undergo a substance abuse treatment program to be eligible, unless a licensed health care provider determines that treatment is not necessary.
  State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sens. Mike Jacobson of North Platte and Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln worked with Rountree on the amendment. Bosn said she did not think that food should be withheld as a form of punishment.
Jacobson said he felt strongly that a treatment component be included. He believes addiction is not a choice and is a disease that requires a constant and lifelong commitment to stay clean. 
“If we want to try to keep them from reoffending, we need to give them every opportunity to try to be gainfully employed. And that starts with putting food on the table,” Jacobson said. 
He said 152,000 Nebraskans currently receive SNAP benefits and the proposed legislation, if enacted, could add about 1,000 more. SNAP benefits are fully paid with federal funds, though administrative costs are split between the state and federal government.

A fiscal analysis said the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services could absorb the additional workload of administering the expansion without additional cost unless demand proved larger than anticipated.
State Sens. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha and Bob Andersen of Sarpy County were among those voicing continued opposition. On first reading April 10, the measure moved forward on a 32-5 vote. Kauth said a concern was taxpayers “being on the hook” for chronic offenders.
“At some point we have to put a barrier up that says, ‘If you continue to make these choices to engage in criminal activity, the taxpayers deserve to say no more,’” she said.
Andersen said the state pays for prosecution and incarceration. He added, ”At what point do we stop feeding the beast … At what point do we quit being enablers?”
  State Sen. Robert Dover of Norfolk. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)
State Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk characterized himself as a conservative who does not promote rewarding people for bad behavior. He said, however, he believes punishment should not be prolonged after a person has paid their debt.
“If you think someone should suffer longer, increase the sentence then,” he said. “It should not just go on and on and on.”

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The Montana Senate started and ended the 69th session with moves that stripped power away from Republican leadership.
This session, a working majority of all Democrats and nine Republicans drove an agenda in the Senate.
Although that coalition didn’t always hold together, its members worked together this week in committee to push a change to the way the Senate appoints select committees. 
Previously, the president of the Senate had the power to appoint select committees during the interim, such as the previous, controversial Select Committee on Judicial Oversight and Reform.
However, Sen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, part of the working majority, proposed a change this week so that select committees be only formed with a majority vote of the Senate.
Republican leadership resisted the change in the Rules Committee on Tuesday — and with help from one Democrat — modified it so that those committees require three-fifths of the members in support instead of a simple majority.
That’s the change the full Senate approved 47-3 on Wednesday, but in committee, the proposal brought up ongoing political tensions in the Senate and the potential it could take several sessions to restore relationships.
“We are really going down a road of distrust in the Senate chambers,” said Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson. “We’re further perpetuating more distrust with something like this.”
In the Senate, Republicans have a 32-18 majority, but nine of them, “The Nine,” joined all Democrats off and on as a working majority through the session.
Responding to McKamey’s proposal in committee, Sen. Ellie Boldman, D-Missoula, repeatedly urged members of the committee to stick with the change McKamey presented, as members of the Republican majority made other proposals.
At one point, Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, floated the idea to not have any select committees at all to alleviate suspicions from both sides.
“I think it gets everybody out of the ‘Where’s the boogeyman’ idea,” said Glimm, part of the Republican majority.
The committee turned that down.
However, Hertz, also part of the Republican majority, proposed the idea that finally won out, to require approval from three-fifths of the Senate to create and appoint a select committee.
Sen. Derek Harvey, D-Butte, bucked his party in committee and supported the change. Even after Boldman called for a reconsideration, he held his position.
After the committee meeting, Harvey said he was convinced it was a good idea to have a higher threshold to encourage the factions in the Senate to work together.
“I felt that’s a fair way to do it,” Harvey said.
It means 10 Senators can call for the full body to be polled about forming a select committee, and 30 are required to agree to it.
“I think that’s the spirit of working together and moving forward and getting past this session,” Harvey said.
On the floor Wednesday, Majority Leader Tom McGillvray of Billings presented the proposal out of the Rules Committee as bipartisan and fair, a way to avoid “frivolous” committees and push for agreement.
“It would have to have buy-in from all parties, and we just thought it was a good solution to the question that we had about select committees,” McGillvray said.
On the floor, though, McKamey again tried to push her original proposal, although it didn’t pass. She earlier said she thought the three-fifths bar was too high to create a select committee.
Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, told the Daily Montanan he had’t planned the rule change, and he didn’t have any select committees in mind that he would want to call into action.
However, Flowers said he didn’t want to see a repeat of the most recent interim, with the judicial committee working on outcomes his caucus believed were predetermined and costly, and in which they did not participate.
“I do see the value of not giving the president the opportunity to kind of unilaterally create these select committees based on what we saw in the last session,” Flowers said.
Flowers previously worked with The Nine to gain additional power under the Senate’s permanent rules, by requiring the Senate president to receive approval from the minority leader on the composition of conference committees,

(Photo by Apu Gomes/Getty Images)In recent weeks, billionaire Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, has found itself at the center of a mounting storm in Memphis. With plans to build and expand a massive data center in the heart of South Memphis — powered by methane gas turbines — this project has become a flashpoint in an ongoing struggle between corporate expansion and community protection.
I acknowledge the goodwill and benevolence of Mayor Paul Young. His intentions for Memphis are rooted in growth and opportunity. But good intentions are not enough when people’s health, lives and futures are on the line. I long for a level of political courage and ideological innovation in his administration’s business and public safety strategies. So far, we’ve seen too much political caution and not enough prophetic vision.
According to a report, xAI has already begun operations in the area, installing at least 35 methane gas turbines while only getting permits for 15. 
The Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) has raised concerns about this saying that the scale of emissions from these turbines necessitates a “major source permit” due to the significant output of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and formaldehyde, both harmful pollutants.

These turbines are pumping pollution into the air of predominantly Black neighborhoods.  Communities like Boxtown and Coro Lake in Memphis’s 38109 ZIP code have long endured environmental racism, facing health risks from industrial pollution. Facilities such as Velsicol Chemical and Sterilization Services of Tennessee have been sources of contamination, affecting air and water quality in these predominantly Black neighborhoods. While the proposed Byhalia Pipeline was halted due to community activism, the lingering effects of these environmental injustices continue to impact residents’ well-being. 
And who’s holding the line for these communities?
Michelle Taylor, Director of the Shelby County Health Department, took the rare and courageous step of publicly challenging the mayor and the city to reconsider the public health implications of this project. She announced plans for a community meeting to address growing concerns, something she should be commended for in an era when transparency and integrity often come last.
Meanwhile, grassroots leaders like KeShaun Pearson and state Rep. Justin J. Pearson, co-founders of Memphis Community Against Pollution (MCAP), are mobilizing daily to resist this project and protect our people. Their warning is clear: this isn’t innovation—it’s environmental racism. Their organizing reminds us that community protection is a spiritual mandate, not just a political strategy.
On the other side of the argument, voices like Ted Townsend of the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce and Mayor Young tout the promise of jobs and increased tax revenue. These are the same arguments we’ve heard for decades — used to justify everything from highways that decimated Black neighborhoods to industries that poisoned our air and water. But no promise of economic gain can justify the human cost of unchecked corporate expansion.

This is not just about Musk. It’s about what — and who — our leaders are willing to sacrifice in the name of “progress.” Musk’s record of exploitation, labor abuse, and reckless innovation is well-documented. Beyond Memphis, Elon Musk’s ventures have raised environmental justice concerns in other communities. For instance, in South Texas, SpaceX’s operations have faced criticism for environmental impacts on local populations. Additionally, in Bastrop, Texas, The Boring Company — another Musk company —  has been cited for environmental violations related to its tunneling projects. These instances highlight a pattern where Musk’s companies have been scrutinized for their environmental practices in various regions. 
Memphis should not be the next experiment.
As recently reported, there is still time to reassess the viability and values of this project. We need the Shelby County Health Department, Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, and/or the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a full environmental review. We need real community input — not just performative listening sessions. And we need city leadership that is willing to say no when the stakes are too high.
This isn’t just about the next election cycle. This is about the long-term well-being of our people—our elders, our children, our neighbors. We need leadership that does not put Black lives on the altar of economic speculation, or worse, on the chopping block of billionaire experimentation.
Memphis doesn’t need another corporate footprint.
Memphis needs visionaries.
Memphis needs defenders.
Memphis needs leaders who love our people more than they fear political fallout.
To the administration, the Chamber, and everyone watching: We’re not opposed to progress. We’re just not willing to pay for it with the health and safety of our people.

John Esp said he heard about a good trick to stop from getting emotional, as some senators and representatives delivered goodbye speeches on the final day of the 2025 Montana Legislature.
“If you clench your butt cheeks together, they will help with that problem,” said Esp, a Republican from Big Timber.
In the House, Rep. Mary Caferro shared in feeling emotional, saying she was grateful to the people who sent her to the Capitol, as she ran 13 times, and in four primaries.
“I’ve been offered hot tea on cold days and cold beer on warm days,” Caffero said. “People say, ‘What are you most proud of?’ and I say, ‘The people I represent.”
Wednesday, Esp, the “Dean of the Senate,” and Caferro, vice chairperson of the House Appropriations Committee, joined other termed-out legislators to give goodbye speeches on the Senate and House floors.
They thanked spouses, children, other family members, friends, constituents, and their colleagues at the Capitol. Esp did so as he learned the clenching trick “ain’t working,” but after 16 years of service, he had learned what was important.
“I’m convinced it’s the relationships we take home with us when we leave here,” Esp said.
At least in the Senate, the comments infused a warm tone in the chamber that was sometimes rare, and where divisive sentiments returned soon after, when a couple of Republicans characterized the session as a “failure.”
The work is by nature political, but Esp’s parting advice to legislators who would continue the job in the future, the “young guns,” as Sen. Susan Webber described, was to support each other.
“Give each other grace. Hold each other up,” Esp said.
In the House, several legislators also said their goodbyes, and it included some singing. Rep. Neil Duram, R-Eureka, sang during his final speech on the House floor, a song from Jack Gladstone, a noted Montanan musician.
He said the song was better shared around a campfire or bedtime for his children, but he sang, and he sang beautifully.
“Maybe I didn’t show it,” Duram said. “But I’ve always been overwhelmed with the talent in this room.”
Leadership in the House thanked their long-time members, bringing several representatives to tears.
In the Senate, Sen. Shane Morigeau, D-Missoula, asked that the “dean” torch, an honorary title given to the longest serving member, be passed to Sen. Jonathan Windy Boy, D-Box Elder, a lawmaker of 13 sessions, and President Matt Regier greeted him as such.
“Welcome, Dean Windy Boy,” said Regier, R-Kalispell.
Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, the highest-ranking elected Democrat in Montana, said he brought values to the work that he had learned from his parents and applied the ones he learned in Ovando as a young man working outside many years ago.
He said Montanans care about land, water and critters, and they care about each other.
“They care about their friends and neighbors and communities, and they’re always there for them,” said Flowers, D-Bozeman. “In simple terms, what that taught me is that Montanans take care of each other.”
In a gesture he returned, Flowers gave a tie to Republican Sen. Russ Tempel, of Chester, another outgoing senator, a tie Flowers said he had bought for his wife’s memorial.
Flowers said once he had complimented Tempel’s tie, and Tempel had loosened it and handed it over to him. Flowers wore that tie Wednesday.
Webber, a Democrat from Browning, said her service had been “exhilarating” and “exasperating,” and always a mystery that turned out well in the end.
On the final day, Webber extended an invitation to every senator with whom she’d served in the session to her lake cabin, and she warned everyone who might visit about Native American hospitality, or “protocol.”
“As an Indian person, be prepared to be fed,” Webber said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4068-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-30 21:01:26.107517

“One of the lessons that I take from civil unions (is) that there are still people of tremendous, personal moral courage, personal moral courage and political courage,” Lippert said.

Listen below and subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get podcasts.This week marks the 25th anniversary of the historic passage of the civil unions law in Vermont. On April 25, 2000, after a remarkable four-month marathon of public hearings, legislative maneuvering, protests, counter-demonstrations and statewide soul-searching, the Vermont House of Representatives voted 79-68 to pass the civil unions bill, the most sweeping grant of rights to gay couples in the nation.The law allowed same-sex couples to form civil unions, the legal equivalent of heterosexual marriage. Gov. Howard Dean signed it into law the next day.Rep. Bill Lippert was the lone openly gay Vermont legislator in 2000 and led the fight for passage of civil unions and later same-sex marriage. I was a reporter covering these historic events for Mother Jones. Lippert invited me onto the House floor moments after civil unions passed in 2000 to interview him and other supporters of the bill. I described how Lippert made a beeline across the House floor to thank Rep. Bill Fyfe, an 84-year-old former jail warden and Republican state representative from Newport City. His wife was in the hospital, and Fyfe was due to have surgery the following day. But he made sure to be in the Statehouse to cast his vote for civil unions.I asked Fyfe why he had voted for the bill. He looked at me through his thick glasses and his eyes began to water. “Because he’s one of my better friends here,” he said, motioning to Lippert. “And there were two ladies who were my next-door neighbors for many years …” He broke into a soft sob. “They were treated terrible. I’m just glad I could do something to help.”Lippert squeezed Fyfe’s shoulder to comfort him, “People can be cruel, Bill,” Lippert said.Vermont’s civil unions law passed four months after the Vermont Supreme Court ruled in Baker v. Vermont that gay and lesbian couples were entitled to the same legal rights and benefits of marriage as heterosexual couples. The court ordered the Vermont legislature to craft a law that would satisfy the ruling, either by legalizing same-sex marriage or by creating an equivalent partnership structure. The decision, wrote Chief Justice Jeffrey Amestoy, “is simply a recognition of our common humanity.”Vermont’s civil unions law was a tipping point for the national movement for LGBTQ+ rights. In 2009, Vermont became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage through an act of the legislature, overriding a gubernatorial veto to do so.In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4, in the landmark case Obergefell v. Hodges, that same-sex couples could wed throughout the country. Today, LGBTQ+ rights are under attack. President Donald Trump has targeted transgender people with a slew of executive orders. Hundreds of bills aimed at restricting LGBTQ+ rights have been introduced in state legislatures and in Congress. Many people fear that a conservative U.S. Supreme Court could roll back LGBTQ+ rights, including the right to marry.Bill Lippert was living in Philadelphia when he first visited Vermont in 1972 to hike the Long Trail. He had just come out and recalled that he had trouble finding even one other gay man in the state. Lippert became active in Vermont’s small gay rights movement and went on to serve 28 years in the Vermont House of Representatives from 1994 to 2022 as the representative from Hinesburg. He served as chair of the House Judiciary Committee for a decade and then chaired the House Health Care Committee.Lippert, 75, is now retired and working on preserving Vermont LGBTQ+ history, including recounting his own experiences as a gay activist and gay legislator in Vermont.Lippert acknowledged that winning civil unions was viewed by some gay rights advocates — including lead attorney (now federal judge) Beth Robinson — as a defeat.Lippert said that he knew that “this fight for marriage equality in Vermont was going to be the biggest gay rights fight perhaps of our lifetime.” But he said that as a legislator for six years, “I could tell what was achievable and what wasn’t. It was clear (that) full marriage equality in the year 2000 was not feasible. It was not going to happen.”Lippert insisted that civil unions “was an important step that brought us ultimately to full marriage equality.” And he was determined to build that bridge.“When civil unions passed, I made a personal commitment to myself that if I could continue to be re-elected, I would stay in the Legislature until we achieved full marriage equality, and that happened in 2009,” he said.Lippert says that today’s political attacks on trans people has a familiar ring. “Trans people are being used as a target because it’s the ‘unknown,’” he said. “Gay and lesbian people used to be the scary unknown, but that doesn’t work anymore in the same way.”I asked Lippert what concerns him most today. “The taking away of our basic democratic rights,” he said. “The shocking willingness to detain and deport people who have every right to be here because they’ve been granted that right.”“I am an optimist by nature, but this is a frightening time, and I’ve participated in more protests and demonstrations in the last month than I had in the last 10 years,” he said. “And I think it’s important that we do that. We deserve to have the country that some of us have fought for … by fighting for civil rights, for LGBTQ+ rights, rights for women, rights for religious freedom.”The passage of civil unions came at a price. Seventeen legislators who supported civil unions in 2000 were defeated in elections the following November as part of the “Take Back Vermont” movement. Lippert takes inspiration from those elected officials.“One of the lessons that I take from civil unions is that there are still people of tremendous personal moral courage and political courage,” Lippert said. He mentioned defeated Republican legislators John Edwards, Marion Milne, Diane Carmolli and Bill Fyfe.“When you’re not part of the same ‘despised minority’ but you say it’s wrong to have discrimination against them, it’s wrong to be prejudiced against them — you get attacked as well. And they did so,” he said.“They did the right thing. They chose to stand up,” Lippert said. “That girds my hopefulness.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Conversation: Bill Lippert on the 25th anniversary of Vermont’s landmark civil unions law and the backlash against LGBTQ+ people.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lippert-cropped-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C698&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 21:01:26.107517

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderDozens of Vietnamese Americans gathered at a senior center in Norcross Wednesday to mark the 50th anniversary of what Von Tran called a dark day in history.
“It’s a day of suffering, of separations of family, of death, of thousands and hundreds of thousands killed and forced into reeducation camps and imprisoned, Holocaust-style, if you can imagine that,” said Tran, CEO of First Senior Center of Georgia, which hosted the event. “Some were imprisoned for five years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, trying to brainwash them into communist ideology.”
In Vietnam, April 30, 1975, is celebrated as Reunification Day, when North Vietnamese troops captured Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, uniting the nation under socialist rule. But to members of the Vietnamese diaspora who fled South Vietnam after its fall, April 30 is marked as the Fall of Saigon, a day to lament the end of South Vietnam and to remember the people who died fighting for the nation.

Tran is part of that diaspora. She left Vietnam in 1983 at 9 years old, packed on a fishing boat with more than 60 others, including her parents and five siblings.
Tran said her family often relied on charity to make sure everyone was fed during her early days in the U.S.
“I went to the food pantry at the church every Sunday, six of us, to get six chickens so my mother would be able to cook for us, because my father in 1985 was only making $3.54 an hour,” she said. “He couldn’t feed seven mouths. I jokingly say all the time, that I’ve been converted so many times at church pantries, from Catholic to Lutheran to Methodist to, you name it, just for a chicken.”
Thanks to those charity chickens and a lot of hard work, Tran found success in the business world and now runs her own food pantry out of the senior center, delivering literal tons of food to thousands of households every week, with a special focus on seniors.
In addition to the food bank and recreational facilities, the center has areas for arts and crafts as well as medical services, including acupuncture. While the ceremony honoring the fall of Saigon took place, a few old timers sat in the back and played board games like xiangqi, or Chinese chess.
Many of the people who fled Vietnam around the fall of Saigon are getting older, and the center helps with tasks like translation, transportation and signing up for government assistance programs.

“A lot of them are low-income, so we cater to those who don’t have the means to – whether because of a language barrier or transportation limitations – take them to doctor appointments, schedule a doctor appointment for them, apply for all the different social services, food stamps, Medicaid, Medicare, and translation, interpretation. We also give them coffins. We bury them, give them a cemetery plot. We cremate them. These are all free services.”
Many of the people who came out Wednesday were members of South Vietnam’s military, including some who wore their old uniforms. They saluted the flag of South Vietnam and delivered speeches and sang songs in Vietnamese. Members carrying battery-powered candles walked to the front of the center’s common area and placed them on a large map of Vietnam.
Tom Nguyen, a retired mechanical engineer, served six years in the South Vietnamese Navy, but he came to the ceremony in a suit and tie instead of his fatigues.
“I’m glad the war is over,” he said. “I’m glad that the future is growing better over there and over here, because I was there to see many people killed. There’s no reason for that. I hate war. I hate war. It just destroys things and communities and the economy.”
Nguyen has lived in the U.S. since 1975 and Georgia since 1978. Every now and then when he speaks, a little bit of a southern drawl rises up from beneath his Vietnamese accent. If you ask him about it, he’ll smile and pull down the collar of his shirt.
“Can’t you see my neck is red?” he says with a laugh.
Nguyen may not be American by birth, but he’s a red-blooded patriot. He said he wants the next generation of Vietnamese Georgians to honor their roots but also appreciate their new country.
“We’re trying to tell them today is a better life for you, especially you here in America, you have a better future, you have a long life, and you have education, you can perform, and you can achieve as you wish, because here is opportunity for everybody, America is number one, I put it that way,” he said.
Hanh Kim Dang, a realtor and past president of Vietnamese Community of Georgia, said she’s also thinking about the next generation. She got out of Vietnam April 26, 1975, just days before the fall of Saigon.
She says she counts herself lucky that she and her sister were able to fly out of Vietnam because her aunt worked for the U.S. government. Many others made a perilous trip by boat or on foot.
Dang, who was 20, had studied some English in school, but she was far from fluent.
“It was very rough,” she said. “I was in the third year of law school, then I went back here and started all over again. I tried to go to high school because that’s where I thought I could learn English and use it more to get better. But they said, no, your age, you have to go to community college.”
Dang turned that community college education into a degree in information and computer science from Georgia Tech. After a 19-year career, she entered the business world and now owns several nail salons and food courts.
Dang’s three children are all in their thirties now. They’re all conversational in Vietnamese, if not fluent.
“When they were growing up, I hired nannies who were Vietnamese, and I told them, please use Vietnamese language at home, so they pick it up, so they can save it, but it’s more like daily conversation, not writing, not literature,” she said.
“They have some understanding of why we’re here, but understanding deeply the reason why we sacrificed, we left everything behind, it’s hard for them because they’re born here,” she added. “They adopted the culture, language, everything here, but they do understand, they see what the people have been through through photos, videos, movies.”

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee narrowly approved a bill on Wednesday that changes some of the rules pertaining to the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles amid some final minute dramatics that required one lawmaker to return to the meeting to cast his vote.
The House Judiciary Committee approved SB 324, sponsored by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, by a vote of 8-7. Initially, the measure would have failed because of a tied vote, but Rep. Jim Hill, R-Odenville, the committee chair, requested that someone reach out to Rep. Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, to return to the committee after leaving to cast the tie-breaking vote that ultimately led to bill getting approved by the committee.
“I got some work to do,” Chambliss said in an interview after the vote. “I will work with all the interested parties. You know, I have seen bills that are further apart than this one. We sit down and talk through it all and see what everyone can live with.”

The vote came a day after the Senate voted to cut funding for the board in the final version of the General Fund budget and made its remaining funding contingent on updating the parole guidelines which are used to determine whether an applicant should be granted parole.
SB 324 increases the number of people who can serve on the parole board from three to five; moves the power to appoint the chair from the governor to the board itself and establishes guidelines for the board when they set the next parole hearing for applicants who are denied.
The original version of the bill Chambliss filed remained largely intact when it was approved by the Senate last week except for a single amendment proposed by Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, pertaining to the timeline for nominating a candidate to the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.
The board members, regardless of whether their terms have expired or not, will be appointed by the Governor’s Office based on a list of names from a nominating committee comprising the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House and President Pro Tempore of the Senate.
SB 324 also lays out timelines for parole hearings. For those serving up to 20 years in prison, the parole board may set the next hearing no more than two years from the time that the person’s parole application was denied.
Those serving a life sentence after committing one or more violent Class A felonies are permitted another hearing within 10 years of being denied. People who are considered for parole for medical reasons may receive another parole hearing within 180 days after the parole board rejects their application.
Others are eligible for another parole hearing with five years of getting rejected for parole by the Board.
Chambliss introduced SB 324 Wednesday by referring to a meeting of the Joint Prison Oversight Committee in October 2023 in which Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles Chair Leigh Gwathney answered lawmakers’ questions in ways they considered meandering or unresponsive.
Chambliss characterized the meeting as a “little bit of a fiasco.”
“The law says that those guidelines are to be updated periodically,” Chambliss said to the committee during the meeting Wednesday. “And the law says that they have to do that. Well, they have not done that. As a matter of fact, they only adhere to the guidelines 20% of the time.”
According to data obtained from the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles, the conformance rate, the percentage that the parole board’s decisions match with Bureau’s recommendations based on the guidelines, is between 22%-27%.
The Alabama Attorney General’s Office publicly stated that it opposed the legislation.
“Needless to say, the makeup of the parole board is a very delicate thing,” said Katherine Robertson, chief counsel for the Alabama Attorney General’s Office. “As we know from recent history, it has a very direct implications on public safety.”
She also referred to the General Fund budget.
“There was an amendment added to the General Fund budget that would address the guidelines issue that was added by the Senate that says the Board doesn’t get their money until they do what he (Chambliss) is talking about on the guidelines,” Robertson said. “I am sure they have gotten the message when it comes to that.”
Former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Sue Cobb supported the legislation.
“We want the state to stop wasting money holding individuals who have proven they are no longer the same person when they were convicted,” she said. “And have either through their health, or their prison record, demonstrated they would be almost impossible to reoffend.”
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, a longtime critic of the board, was among the strongest supporters of the legislation.
“This is about the ability to have oversight over the system that could potentially go out of control either way,” he said in an interview following the meeting. “Set aside how you feel about releases, and who is getting out and who is not, just look at how broken the process is.”
Other committee members voted against the bill in the hopes that others would have more time to provide feedback.
“I do think this is the makings of a good bill,” said Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne. “I do think this is something I am very eager to hopefully get together to get more people on and have a conversation. I do think we have to bring more people to the table, specifically VOCAL (Victims of Crime and Leniency).”
VOCAL opposed the legislation.

Curtis Trent, a Republican from Springfield, introduces a bill on the Senate floor during the 2024 legislative session. This year, he is carrying a bill from the House that would allow students to enroll in neighboring districts (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The split among Senate Republicans over a bill allowing Missouri students to enroll in neighboring school districts widened to a chasm they could not bridge Wednesday after the legislation was tied to an obligation to fully fund public education.
The state Senate debated the legislation, dubbed “open enrollment,” for five hours, finally setting it aside when no agreement could be reached.
When the bill passed the Missouri House in March for the fifth consecutive year, 22 of the chamber’s 110 Republicans voted against it. A similar split in the Senate, combined with Democratic opposition, led to Wednesday’s impasse.
The debate marked the first time it reached full Senate.
The bill’s House sponsor, state Rep. Brad Pollitt, a Republican from Sedalia, has fine-tuned the bill over the years to settle concerns and win over GOP skeptics.
At its core, the legislation would allow school districts to enroll students outside of its boundaries to fill open seats and collect the state funding for those students. Provisions like the maximum number of students that could leave their home district each year have changed over time, with the House passing a 3% cap on departing students and a Senate committee giving the cap room to expand to 5% in some situations.
Any changes made in the Senate will need to win approval in the House, where the margin is very slim. And the bill brought to up for debate Wednesday by state Sen. Curtis Trent, a Springfield Republican, is loaded with changes reaching into other K-12 education matters.
Pollitt told The Independent that he was part of discussions in both the Senate committee substitute and the floor substitute, confident the changes wouldn’t kill the legislation if it returns to the House.
Behind closed doors, the 22-page bill approved by the House ballooned into a 107-page education package negotiated without input from Senate Democrats.
Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, said he received a copy of the bill shortly before the Senate convened.
“This large piece of policy is coming before the body, and we haven’t even had a chance to have input on it, which we’ve done in the past on numerous big bills around here that you know about,” Beck said. “We are basically shut out of this process.”
Trent said school districts and other stakeholders were consulted, adding that Beck could offer amendments on the floor.
Beck challenged Trent’s confidence in the negotiations.
“I don’t think there’s consensus in your own caucus on this bill,” he said, saying Senate Republicans had asked him if he was going to “kill this thing.”
The division emerged when state Sen. Lincoln Hough, the chamber’s other Springfield Republican, added provisions that would pause open enrollment in years that the state does not fully fund the formula that determines state aid for public schools. The pause, under Hough’s additions, would also occur if teacher salary grants or district transportation costs were not fully funded.
“This body has a tendency to pass laws and then not necessarily… financially support the legislation that we adopt,” he said.
Hough, the appropriations committee chairman, is the Senate’s top voice on spending. His amendment, he said, would ensure that future state lawmakers adequately support funding that is key to public education and the operation of an open-enrollment system.
Trent called the amendment a “special carve out” that could hinder future senators.
“I don’t think that we should second guess the judgment of future general assemblies, nor should we hold a good idea hostage to arbitrary standards such as this,” he said.
The narrow votes on Hough’s proposals showed the depth of the split. The transportation funding requirement was added on a 15-13 vote, then it and the other two requirements were approved 14-13.
The standing division vote did not record individual members’ positions, but objections were raised when state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold, refused to take sides. Coleman raised a “point of order,” and Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin of Shelbina ruled that Coleman was within the rules.
Pollitt did not comment on Hough’s amendments, saying only that he feels confident in the financial considerations because districts have to opt in to participate.
“If they take kids one year and finance has changed drastically, then come around November 1 the next year, they can say, ‘You know what, we’re not going to opt in again,’” Pollitt said. “But those kids (already enrolled) get to stay.”
Before the bill was laid over, Democratic Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern of Kansas City offered an amendment that would exclude charter schools from open enrollment. The inclusion of charters was not part of the version approved by the House and was added in the Senate Education Committee.
Pollitt said he wasn’t opposed to including charter schools in the legislation, since lawmakers added provisions that would protect local tax dollars from going to students outside the district who enroll in a charter school.
Nurrenbern’s amendment did not come to a vote.

(File photo)The North Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would allow employees and volunteers of K-12 private schools to carry concealed firearms on school property Tuesday afternoon.
Senate Bill 280 would allow employees and volunteers at these schools to possess handguns and stun guns with the consent of school administrators and written notice to parents. They must hold a concealed carry permit and complete additional training before becoming eligible to possess firearms on school property.
The proposal is part of a larger trend in the North Carolina legislature in which Republican lawmakers have sought to respond to the rise in school shootings by equipping adults with firearms and defensive implements. A bill with a similar approach passed the House Judiciary 2 Committee a day prior allowing schools to store tasers, pepper spray, and other “less-than-lethal” weapons in biometric safes.
A separate provision in SB 280 allows for firearms to be carried by attendees of worship services, funerals, weddings, and other religious events held at places of worship located on the grounds of private schools at the discretion of school administrators.
Sen. Steve Jarvis (R-Davidson) said the bill “balances safety with individual rights” through stringent criteria for training, permitting, and school oversight.
“This bill simply strengthens the safety in North Carolina’s private schools while respecting the unique needs of our communities,” Jarvis said. “It allows private school employees or volunteers with concealed carry permits to carry firearms on school grounds, but only with the explicit authorization of the school board and/or the administration director.”
Sen. Sydney Batch (D-Wake) proposed adding a requirement that private school employees and volunteers affected by the bill be vetted against the state’s Responsible Individuals List, which tracks adults implicated in the abuse and serious neglect of children. Jarvis said he would follow up with her suggestion at some point in the future.
Democratic lawmakers raised concerns about the implications that other bills around concealed carry would have on these new exceptions. Sen. Terence Everitt (D-Wake) noted that the Senate passed a bill allowing permitless concealed carry in March, warning that this would undermine SB 280’s reliance on permit training and safety requirements.
Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) expressed concerns about the lack of an age requirement, noting that the permitless carry bill would allow 18-year-olds to carry concealed firearms — and by extension, SB 280 could allow them to bring them into schools.
Robert Ryan, an attorney with the General Assembly’s Legislative Affairs Division, said that even with the existence of permitless concealed carry, this bill would still require a permit for individuals to carry weapons onto school grounds — leaving intact the training and age requirements. North Carolina would continue issuing concealed carry permits even under the March bill to maintain reciprocity with states that do not have permitless carry.
Among the speakers during the public comment part of the meeting were leaders at religious private schools who urged lawmakers to pass the bill so they and their students could feel safe.
“We do everything that we can within the law to protect these precious children from danger,” said Matthew Floyd, a faculty member at Greenville Christian Academy. “We love these children as our own and many are willing and able to be trained, you know, with rigorous training to be able to be an immediate line of defense against the horrible thought of a gunman entering the property.”
Ron Baity, a pastor who founded a Wilkes County Christian private school in the 1970s, said “every day we are horrified” at the prospect that a shooter could attack their school.
“I hear it said that innocent people could be killed if a shooter comes on the property and our staff is armed,” Baity said. “The truth of the matter is, if we have no resistance against the individual who’s armed, he can kill all of our staff, he can kill all of our students, and we have no way to protect anyone.”
Amanda Lierman, a substitute teacher in Wake County with Moms Demand Action, said bringing guns into schools would only place an “undue burden” on school staff. She was the only member of the public to speak against the bill.
“My friend and her sons experienced a shooting at their elementary school last year, when a staff administrator was shot and killed by their ex-husband,” Lierman said. “My friend described the running students and the chaos that ensued — having more guns among that chaos would have increased the risk of more casualties.”
After passing the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday, SB 280 will next be heard by the Senate Rules Committee, where it can then be scheduled for a vote by the full Senate.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/return-to-school.jpg,,,2025-04-30 21:01:26.107517

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)The 69th Montana Legislature adjourned the 2025 session on Wednesday – the 85th day of the session – after finishing up work on a property tax relief package and a litany of speeches by outgoing lawmakers.
The final day was relatively subdued, as both chambers took final votes and waited for the pomp and circumstance that accompanies sine die — the motion to adjourn — which included a chamber-wide rendition of “God Bless America” on the Senate side led by Sen. Denley Loge, a St. Regis Republican.
Legislators offered advice for those who will take the torch in the future, along with pleas for the current Montana Legislature continue, because it had come up short on the budget and property taxes, according to some frustrated Republicans.
Sen. Butch Gillespie, R-Ethridge, said the diversity of views in the Senate is positive, and he encouraged the body to work together in the future.
“For sure, we don’t accomplish much by constant turf wars,” Gillespie said. “Think about that one a second.”
However, when the motion to end was made in the upper chamber, the Senate voted it down not once, but twice, before eventually gaveling out — one final display of the tensions that defined the session in the upper chamber.

Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, stood to oppose adjournment, calling the session, and the largest bills passed by the Legislature, failures.
“Five days early? We’re going to quit because we’re done? I don’t think we’ve even showed up,” Zolnikov said. 
More conservative Republicans in the chamber were frustrated to see their majority split and felt cut out of the conversation around major legislative initiatives, including the budget which many decried as bloated. 
“This is supposed to be a decentralized process. Fifty people from 50 different areas, each representing 20,000 people each, so everyone in this state has a voice, through us,” Zolnikov continued. “And we gave that away.” 
 
The 2025 session saw 1,759 bills, resolutions and other measures introduced and debated by lawmakers — a record number. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Legislature had sent 484 to the desk of Gov. Greg Gianforte, with another 322 on their way.
The laws would be celebrated, derided, and some will likely be fought in court in the future, and in the Senate, Sen. John Esp, R-Big Timber, offered a nod to the ups and downs.
“There are days in this building that you’re going to want to cry,” Esp said. “And there’s days in this building that you’ll be moved to laughter. Sometimes you get to do a little of each on the same day.”
Among the major pieces of legislation that passed the Legislature was Medicaid expansion, the largest income tax cut in state history, historic investments in education, and a property tax relief package. 
There were also several bills that affect transgender individuals, characterized as erasing and harming them by opponents, including one that has already landed in court. Other lawmakers lauded the same legislation as protecting children and women. Legislators also passed a series of bills changing the Montana Environmental Policy Act in response to the Held v. Montana suit, a historic lawsuit concerning the effects of climate change. 
But one of the defining features of the 2025 session was a rift in the Republican Caucus in the Senate that appeared 85 days ago when nine moderate Republicans joined Democrats to change the rules of the Senate to give their coalition more power. 
For the rest of the session, the Senate was effectively run by a working majority coalition that pushed through priority bills for Democrats and the Governor’s office, to the frustration of more conservative GOP members. Numerous times throughout the session, the Senate chamber erupted with accusations of betrayal between Republican camps and “baked in” votes that routinely passed 27-23 along the coalition line. 
Another defining moment was the censure of a sitting Senator, former Senate President Jason Ellsworth, R-Hamilton, who was kicked out of the chamber halfway through the session. The punishment, described as “everything but expulsion,” was a response to ethical violations Ellsworth committed by not disclosing a friendship he had when he signed a $170,100 state contract with a longtime business associate.

Despite the roller coaster of events throughout the session, Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, said in a press conference following adjournment that he was still satisfied with the work his caucus accomplished.
“There are many reasons for Senate Republicans to hold their heads high,” Regier said. “And we will look forward to continuing our efforts in the interim, and also in the next session.”
The GOP senators touted many of their wins from the session, including delivering a large income tax cut, bolstering election integrity, and leading the nation with new data privacy legislation.
“We’re not just protecting Montanas amid technological advancements, but also making sure that our state is open to cutting-edge innovations,” Senate Pro Tempore Ken Bogner, R-Miles City said. 
One area the Senate GOP said they fell short on was judicial reform — a key priority for the caucus at the start of the session. 
More than two dozen bills were introduced aimed at changing the judicial branch, but only a handful made it through the Legislature. Among those that failed were numerous attempts to make judicial elections partisan. 
“What we do have is a great foundation for the reform. I think that judicial reform is critical, continuously,” said Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, adding that efforts would continue in the next session. “We’re undaunted.”
Despite a long list of bills he considered wins, Regier stood with less than two dozen members of his caucus and called out the missing members of his party.
“I do believe the voters sent the Republican Party here to be in control, and from day one, it was not, and I don’t see that as sustainable. I think that in the future, the voters are going to speak their mind,” Regier said. “… I don’t believe the people will stand up for another session where the Democrat minority leader and his caucus controls the Senate.”
Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, said the session was one of the hardest he’s been a part of, but also one of the most effective — with Democrats pushing through substantially more legislation than anticipated. 
In a joint press conference with House Minority Leader Rep. Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, Flowers touted legislation protecting renters, and said every Democrat vote for Medicaid expansion was “critical,” painting it as a major win for the party.
“We didn’t just protect the program,” Flowers said. “We secured it permanently.”
Sullivan added that while the session wasn’t perfect, Montanans came out in a better place than they were before the session.
“This session, Montana Democrats stood firm in defending our fundamental freedoms under the Montana constitution and our Montana way of life,” Sullivan said. “When Republicans spent dozens and dozens of hours pushing bills to legislate every aspect of our lives, Democrats fought back.”

The Democrat leaders also highlighted legislation addressing the state’s affordable housing crisis that saw bipartisan support.
“It’s not fixed,” Flowers said. “But for the first time in a long time, we’re moving in the right direction for practical solutions and real funding.”
While bills pushed by the minority party could be at a higher risk of receiving a veto from the Republican governor, Flowers said he was confident many showcase shared priorities. 
“I think, frankly, many of our bills are consistent with the values that he described in his State of the State address, where he focused on child care and education,” Flowers said. “And I think he should appreciate what we’re bringing to his desk.”
Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle mentioned the possibility of the Legislature returning for a special session, most likely related to potential cuts from the federal government that could affect the state’s budget.
 
The Legislature’s lower chamber was comparatively calm, a testament to the steady, if unassuming, leadership of House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage. 
“When I gave my welcome speech, I said, I hope this body would rise above, would keep everything civil and that we would treat each other with respect, and the Montana way of hard work, honesty and neighborliness would guide our deliberations,” Ler told his colleagues on the House floor. “I believe we lived up to that.” 
 While some hardline Republicans felt cut out of the legislative process — and in the House, Speaker Ler said his door was open — he said the reality is bills need majorities in the chambers to pass, and then support from the governor.

Speaker Pro Tempore Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings, said it’s a delicate balance to work on legislation that can, realistically, get across the finish line, and also ensure input.
Property tax relief was one measure that passed with substantial bipartisan support in the House, but some legislators expressed their displeasure about it, including that it could land in court.
Critics of the property tax reform said the content didn’t match the title of the bill, which could be unconstitutional, but supporters dismissed the accusation.
At least in the House, Majority Leader Steve Fitzpatrick said he would anticipate legal action following the session, given it hasn’t been unusual for bills to be challenged.
“I would assume there will be a lawsuit, since it’s lawsuit season now,” Fitzpatrick said.
However, he said legislators worked hard on property taxes from the start, through the very end of the session, and the package that passed reflects the areas of agreement.
“It was difficult. I think the product we finally got is just a reflection of the realities that compromise around here requires,” Fitzpatrick said.
The final hours on the House floor were joyous, and legislators animately said their goodbyes, took photos together and laughed as they cleared out their desks. They were slow to leave the chamber, and some representatives took in the moment.
“I’ll carry this experience with me forever, every debate, every challenge and every late night and every handshake across the aisle,” Ler said shortly before the session ended. “Thank you for trusting me. Thank you for believing in this institution. Thank you for meeting and for loving Montana enough to serve her.”

In the Senate, a flurry of votes in the final minutes offered a final glimpse of division in the chamber. 
Twice, Flowers sought to reconsider one last bill — an increased fee on luxury vehicles registered in the state — which one Senator said he had voted against at least a half dozen times already. 
Substitute motions to adjourn failed, the motion to reconsider the bill failed twice, but eventually the chamber reached consensus before boiling over. 
Before leaving the chamber, 23 Republican senators — minus “the nine” — gathered around the rostrum for a group photo.

And it may have been done to avoid putting Gov. Ron DeSantis in an awkward spot.
By a one-vote margin, the Senate on Wednesday shot down a move by organized medicine and business interests to place a $1 million cap on noneconomic damages in wrongful death cases involving medical malpractice.
After dispatching the amendment to HB 6017, (which was supported by Senate President Ben Albritton) the Senate agreed to roll the bill to third reading, a procedural move prepping it for final passage.  
But sponsor Sen. Clay Yarborough moved to temporarily pass the bill — pausing debate — “so we can continue to work on details related to the bill.”
The move, coming with just days left in session, suggests the legislation may be dead for the year.
The measure, one of several bills caught up in a tense behind-the-scenes fight involving trial attorneys, has drawn 80 lobbyist registrations, House records show.
  Speaker Daniel Perez via Florida House
A top priority for House Speaker Daniel Perez, HB 6017 eliminates a longstanding ban blocking  parents of single, childless, adult children from suing for noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering arising from alleged medical malpractice. 
Florida also bans adults (defined as 25 and older) from pursuing wrongful death claims for single parents who die from medical malpractice, and the bill would remove that ban, too. The Legislature adopted the ban during the 1990s as the state wrestled with rising malpractice premiums.
There has been a concerted effort in recent years, though, to eliminate the ban. And that push has coincided with recent efforts by organized medicine, business, and insurance lobbyists to reinstate caps on pain and suffering in all medical malpractice lawsuits. 
Florida had previously passed caps but the Florida Supreme Court in 2017 ruled them unconstitutional. The makeup of the high court has changed since then, with the majority of the justices now appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The medical community is eager to put the rejuggled court to the test.
DeSantis has been harshly critical of the trial bar but vetoing the bill would disappoint grieving family members.

Throughout the 2025 session, Yarborough has steadfastly opposed linking damages caps in exchange for eliminating the ban on some medical malpractice cases.
So it was quite the surprise when Yarborough sponsored the caps.

“I think you’re being held hostage in negotiating with terrorists right now, “ Sen. Jason Pizzo said, explaining that the quid pro quo “does not bode well for the policy at large.”
After the Senate narrowly voted down the caps, Pizzo pointed into the chamber gallery to those who had been pushing to change the law limiting medical malpractice lawsuits.
He said that legislators should send DeSantis a “clean” bill and force him to explain to family members backing the bill why he was opposed to it.
One of those supporters is Cindy Jenkins from Jacksonville, who said the amendment to limit noneconomic caps on all medical malpractice cases should have been its own separate bill.
“To smack an amendment on today and kill our good bill that was literally on track to pass and go to the governor’s desk is wrong,” said Jenkins, whose 25-year-old daughter died from alleged malpractice. 
“There’s three branches of government for a reason. If they’re concerned that the governor would veto it when it hits his desk, let it get there and let him veto it. We will handle that separately.”
Tallahassee resident Beth Young said her mother died at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital in 2023  after falling into a coma. She blamed the death on negligence and understaffing but she was banned from filing a lawsuit because of the law. 
HB 6017 wouldn’t help Young but she said it’s not about her or her family.
“I just want all people to be able to get justice. It’s about accountability, it’s not even about the money.”

CHATHAM — As a central Illinois community mourns the deaths of three children and a teen counselor killed Monday when a vehicle crashed into the building that housed their after-school program, it has rallied around survivors.

Ainsley Johnson, 8; Kathryn Corley, 7; Alma Buhnerkempe, 7, all of Chatham, and counselor Rylee Britton, 18, of Springfield, died from blunt force trauma in the accident.

“As we mourn this unimaginable loss, we recognize the pain and grief that many are experiencing,” Becca Lamon, superintendent for the Ball Chatham School District wrote on the district’s webpage. “We are all hurting. We understand that yesterday’s tragedy was difficult to comprehend and process. In times like these it is important that we lean on one another for strength and support.”

Police said a black Jeep driven by Marianne Akers, of Chatham, left the road for unknown reason and traveled through a field, crossed a street and a parking lot then hit the east side of a building that housed YNOT Outdoors, which stands for Youth Needing Other Things, an after-school camp in Chatham.

The car drove through the building, striking several children and workers, before it exited the other side, went across a basketball court and hit a pole near the town’s water tower. Children were in a gym area when the Jeep went through the building.

Illinois State Police continue to investigate the cause of the crash but said it was not a targeted attack. ISP confirmed Wednesday that there is surveillance video of the crash.

Akers was not injured but was taken to a local hospital for evaluation on Monday afternoon. No charges have been filed as of Wednesday.

Six children were hospitalized after the crash. Two have been released, according to Illinois State Police, while four remain hospitalized. A GoFundMe account was established for 7-year-old Ella Orsi, who was injured in the crash, to help with medical costs.

Ella sustained facial fractures, a broken jaw, damaged teeth, brain swelling and brain bleeding and is in the pediatric intensive care unit, according to Casey Sitko, who posted on the fundraising site.

“At this time, plastic surgery/surgeries will be required, but it appears as though any brain surgery will be avoided. She is intubated and medicated so she can rest and recover,” Sitko wrote.

Ella has been responsive and communicating by squeezing her parents’ hands, according to the latest update by Sitko.

The Glenwood High School Student Council raised more than $150,000 to help with funeral costs, according to the fundraising site.

Chatham has a population of around 15,000 people and is 12 miles from the Capitol in Springfield. Due to the village’s proximity to Springfield, a large number of state employees live in Chatham, located south on Interstate 55.

Akers, of Chatham, is herself a state employee. She is an office associate in the Illinois Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Business Services. She formerly served as an office associate at the Illinois State Police but resigned in 2018 after a 12-year tenure.

Under Illinois law, a driver has a duty to report a medical condition that could cause loss of consciousness or any other loss of ability to safely operate a motor vehicle within 10 days of the driver becoming aware of the condition.

The Illinois Secretary of State stated it could not comment on whether Akers has previously filed a medical report as that is confidential information.

Chatham Schools canceled school through Friday.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, the village rallied to show support for the families that were affected. The mayor of Chatham ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff. Residents made T-shirts displaying the slogan “We Are Chatham Strong” and gave the proceeds to the families.

Red, the school color, was seen throughout the village. Ribbons adorned trees and light poles. Red signs were planted in front lawns. Locals wore red shirts throughout the day and at the vigils.

Chatham Police Department posted a video of a candlelight vigil held for the victims on Tuesday, and another vigil was scheduled for Wednesday night.

Community members shared several Facebook posts  urging residents to donate blood. By Tuesday morning, all of the time slots were booked until Friday.

Counselors provided free therapy and counseling for children and parents. A local nursery provided free childcare for parents needing “time for self-care.” Families organized to make or provide meals for families of children who attended the after-school program.

Some local bars and restaurants donated a portion of their sales to families impacted by the crash. Others offered free meals to first responders, impacted families, and locals who donated blood.

During lunchtime on Wednesday, a real estate firm rented a local trampoline park for four hours, allowing children from the Chatham School District to play during that time for free.

A Chatham ice cream shop hosted an event for children with a school counselor and therapy dog. The children were encouraged to write messages on the sidewalk outside in chalk to those who were killed and injured.

On Tuesday, a neighboring intermediate school observed a moment of silence for Chatham School District’s loss, as their students wore red to show their support.

Glenwood athletes planned to meet at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Community Park to play games with younger children from the village.

A Linktree page was made for locals to house all additional links for other information, fundraisers, events, and community resources for Chatham residents.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Celebrating his 100th day in office Tuesday, President Donald Trump invoked a recent brutal kidnapping case in western Washington to justify his rush to deport Venezuelan immigrants.
The day after Trump’s inauguration in January, three men abducted a 58-year-old woman outside her Burien apartment, robbing and shooting her before leaving her for dead along Interstate 90 in Kittitas County, prosecutors allege. Authorities say the men drilled into the woman’s hand with a power drill to get her to reveal her bank card PIN and phone passcode.
King County prosecutors have charged two of the suspects, as of Wednesday.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the two men so far charged in the case, who are both Venezuelan citizens, have “alleged ties to the notorious Tren de Aragua gang.” ICE has lodged immigration detainers on them so federal immigration agents can take custody if King County releases them, a spokesperson confirmed. 
But under state law and county code, the jail can’t release inmates to federal immigration authorities without a warrant.
This case, along with another in Chicago, provided Trump’s rationale Tuesday for using a 1798 law to deport non-citizens without due process. 
“That’s why we’ve invoked the Alien Enemies Act to expel every foreign terrorist from our soil as quickly as possible,” Trump said to cheers at his Michigan rally. 
“We’re just not taking this crap anymore. We can’t,” he continued.
Last month, Trump formally invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used law that allows the president to bypass immigration courts to deport people from a “hostile nation or government.” The president can use the statute in times of war or an “invasion” of the United States.
In his March 15 executive order, Trump argued Tren de Aragua members “unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.”
The American Civil Liberties Union quickly challenged the order. In response, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., barred deportation of Venezuelans on Alien Enemies Act grounds. The judge also ordered the Trump administration to turn around planes already en route to a prison in El Salvador. The White House didn’t follow that order.
The U.S. Supreme Court also got involved earlier this month, pausing the Trump administration’s planned deportation of immigrants subject to the Alien Enemies Act.
The ACLU is now asking a judge to force the administration to return more than 130 people still held in El Salvador after deportation.
On Tuesday, the president didn’t stop at immigrants from Venezuela: “They come in from Africa. The Congo, they’ve emptied out their prisons into our country. But they come from Africa, Asia, South America. They come from all over bad parts of Europe.”
The two men charged in the Burien case remained in King County custody Wednesday with bail set at $1 million, as they await trial on attempted murder, kidnapping and robbery charges.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The House Government Oversight Committee questioned Auditor Rob Sand Wednesday about his office’s work on the misallocation of $27.5 million in court debt funds caused by coding errors.
The committee had brought Iowa Judicial Branch and State Court Administration officials in a meeting earlier in April to learn more about the programming issue that caused seven state funds to be underfunded between fiscal years 2021 and 2024. During that period, money that should have gone to those funds was erroneously sent to the state’s general fund and two other funds, but remained with the state government.
The errors were introduced when legislation passed in 2020 and 2021 made changes to the state’s court debt collection and distribution systems. The state auditor’s office was first alerted of financial irregularities by the Iowa Department of Transportation in 2022, but did not release an audit on the subject until December 2024.
House Speaker Pat Grassley and Iowa Department of Management Director Kraig Paulsen have criticized Sand for not taking action sooner — and for the issue not being mentioned in audits of the judicial branch for fiscal years 2021 and 2022. But Sand, the sole Democrat to hold statewide elected office in Iowa, told the committee Tuesday that an audit did not take place on a quicker timeframe because the issue was identified as a coding error, which is not a subject his office has employees to address.
“I don’t think that it was inappropriate for the Reynolds administration and the judicial branch — both of which knew about this issue before the auditor’s office — I don’t think it was inappropriate that they took steps to address the issue together before informing the auditor’s office,” Sand said. “That’s because, fundamentally, this was not an audit issue.”
After the coding error was identified, the judicial branch contracted with the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) to review and make recommendations on how to address the misallocations and legal issues caused by the programming error. In a December 2024 statement, State Court Administrator Robert Gast said the judicial branch corrected the coding errors in the case management system as of Nov. 22.
Some GOP lawmakers on the committee criticized the auditor’s office not being more involved in the process of correcting and identifying the misallocated court debts. Rep. Judd Lawler, R-Oxford, said “the auditor’s office allowed the problem that has presented itself in 2022 to be farmed out to a third party that has no responsibility to Iowa taxpayers,” referencing the judicial branch’s work with NCSC.
Sand disputed this characterization, saying the auditor’s office has “no capacity to tell the judicial branch that they cannot hire an outside expert,” but that lawmakers have the ability to limit that ability or to appropriate funds for the auditor’s office to hire a coding expert if they believe these are the correct steps to prevent similar, future problems from arising.
The auditor also said the way the judicial branch approached the issue was not necessarily a sign of wrongdoing or abuse.
“Let me put it this way: it’s not uncommon for entities to dig in an issue and answer some questions first before they notify us,” Sand said. “Now do I wish that everybody told us right away on day one? That would be great. Immediate notification be great. The trick of that would then become, how many times do we get notified about something and then it turns out to be an issue that actually has a very similar answer, that we don’t need to be dialed in on?”
However, some legislators argued the state auditor’s office should have been more involved — and aware of the issue earlier — because it involved the misallocation of state funding. According to the auditor’s report, the error caused an under-allocation of $10.4 million for the Road Use Tax Fund and $7.2 million for the Victim Compensation Fund.
While there were audits of these funds that could have spotted the discrepancies, Sand said the amount of money misallocated was a small proportion of overall funding — in the case of the Road Use Tax Fund, a 0.13% variance from typical spending. He also said that because this money, though sent to the wrong accounts, stayed within the state, it was not identified in “high-risk areas” for consideration during audits.
He compared the misallocation to a situation where a bank incorrectly puts a person’s money in their checking account instead of their savings account, emphasizing the money still remains with the person — or in this case, with the state.
“Your high-risk areas aren’t going to be your internal transfers, because if you mess it up — again, it’s your money in your savings account versus your money in your checking account — you still have the money,” Sand said. “You’re also going to look at places you’re going to flag, large transactions or new areas of review, are typically something that you want to add scrutiny to. But when you’re talking about 0.13% variance in internal transfer, even if you realize that you had an issue there, you probably have bigger fish to fry.”
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, released a statement after the committee meeting criticizing Sand’s comments, saying the auditor “continued to downplay the significance” of the court debt misallocations.
“This misallocation has had significant consequences,” Thomson said in a statement. “Victims of crime have been denied timely compensation owed to them, infrastructure projects such as bridge repairs and road improvements have been delayed, and community safety programs have been underfunded.”
Criticisms by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird in October 2024 tied the auditor’s office not catching the coding issue to crime victims not being able to access services and support through the Victim Compensation Fund.
“No domestic violence victim should have to stay with their abuser because they cannot afford to leave,” Bird said in the statement. “The State’s self-proclaimed ‘taxpayer watchdog’ failed at the most basic job of being an auditor: conducting an audit. Crime victims should not have to worry about whether victim services will be there when they need them.”
Sand had argued in the meeting that he was not mischaracterizing the importance of the issue, but stating that the funding did not result in the impacted government accounts like the Victim Compensation Fund running out of money — or denying Iowans services because of the underfunding. The auditor’s report found this fund’s lowest balance from FY 2021 to 2024 was just under $2.7 million, and that the other impacted funds also did not run out of funds during this period.
“There wasn’t anybody at this table, but there are people in the state of Iowa who have asserted that because of the misallocation of judicial branch services weren’t provided,” Sand said. “This statement shows that that’s not true.”
Several Republicans on the committee also asked for “verifiable” and “traceable” information, which Sand said was information provided in the audit, but added lawmakers can make further formal requests for information on transactions.
The focus on Sand in the government oversight committee meeting comes as the auditor is expected to run as a Democratic candidate for governor in the 2026 general election. Some of the Republicans who have made statements criticizing Sand over the court debt misallocation issue, like Bird and Speaker Grassley, have also indicated they are considering a gubernatorial run after Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she will not seek reelection in 2026.

The Department launched its new personal financial disclosure system on March 14, 2025, and has faced strong criticism since its launch from reporters, campaigns and transparency advocates. 
Neil Thanedar, executive director of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, criticized the system in a social media post earlier this month saying the new portal provides less information to the public than the previous portal, making it harder for the nonprofit’s investigators to do their jobs monitoring political spending in the state.
An investigation from Bridge Michigan in March found that the upgraded system — produced through a $9.3 million contract with Texas-based Tyler Technologies — provides less information to the public than the previous system. The investigation noted lobbyist registrations no longer listed clients, and expenses could not be easily viewed, while access to the state’s prior system was locked behind a login screen. 
Hall criticized Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who is running for governor as a Democrat, saying she should “get off the campaign trail and fix her website.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He also called the system “a $9 million boondoggle,” telling reporters his House Oversight Committee should investigate what happened with that funding. 
“I mean, you spent $9 million and it’s worse,” he said.
The House Oversight Committee has authorized a subpoena against the Department of State following five months of requests from Election Integrity Committee Chair Rachelle Smit (R-Martin) for materials used to train election workers. Smit maintains the materials she requested are basic materials provided to election clerks, while members of the Department of State have warned that disclosing these materials unredacted could carry consequences for the state’s election security. 
“The House Oversight Committee, after rejecting the department’s multiple attempts to provide the requested materials in a way that protects the security of our election system, instead voted to issue an unnecessary subpoena for this sensitive information,” Angela Benander, Benson’s chief communications officer said in a statement.

“This includes materials that show active screens of the Qualified Voter File; specific information that could be used to compromise the technology used by local election officials; specific procedures for securing voting equipment, ballots, and other election-related materials; information that could be used to gain improper access to secure communication channels used to report security risks; specific locations of election administrator training and templates for official election notices,” Benander said.
Hall compared the Department’s response to the Department of Technology, Management and Budget’s decision to deny a public records request from the Detroit News on the occupancy levels in state office buildings.
“This is the same thing that they said about the election manuals. So Benson, ‘I can’t give you the election manuals because of security reasons.’ Now, Whitmer administration, ‘The state workers, where are they working? We can’t give that to you for security reasons,’” Hall said. 
“Are they coming in the office or not? We’re going to find out, and we are going to bring the government workers back to the office. We’re just going to do it. We’re going to force them to do it in the state budget. And we’re going to get the information, even if we had to subpoena them,” Hall said. 
Benander told the Michigan Advance in an email that the state’s contract with its previous system, MERTS, expires this year, meaning the department needed to create a new system and migrate and convert massive amounts of old data, putting the department behind schedule.
Those delays dramatically impacted the department’s ability to conduct pre-launch data testing, Benander said, noting that they’d been finding errors and problems with the system’s performance as a result.
“We understand this is a problem. We are working to fix it as quickly as possible but have had to prioritize the parts of the system that allow filers to meet their legal requirements by the filing deadline. Once the project is complete, this system will be much more transparent and accessible than the old system and the temporary issues we’re experiencing now will be fully resolved,” Benander said.
“Our priority right now is to fix the problems and get the new MiTN system fully up and running over the next several weeks,” She said. 
Debates over road funding continue as Senate Dems offer education proposal
Alongside his criticisms of Benson, Hall took shots at Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), who has said she has been working to meet with Hall, without success. 
“That’s just false. They’re not making any effort to have meetings with me,” Hall said.
However, emails reviewed by the Michigan Advance show Brinks’ staff made multiple attempts to schedule a weekly meeting with Hall, without success.

Hall further argued Democrats had created a false narrative of funding roads versus funding education, with House Republicans passing their road funding plan in March and Senate Democrats putting forth their School Aid Budget proposal on Tuesday.
House Republicans’ plan removes the state’s 6% sales tax on gasoline and instead increases the motor fuel tax by 20 cents, designating that funding for road upkeep. However, the gas tax contributes more than $700 million a year to the state’s School Aid Fund, which Hall has suggested could be replaced with money from the state’s general fund, which House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri said was “robbing Peter to pay Paul.”
Hall emphasized that education was among House Republicans’ funding priorities, alongside roads and public safety, challenging Brinks to put forth her own road funding plan.
“The people of Michigan don’t care if Winnie Brinks and I like each other. If she has solutions on roads, put them up for a vote, and then we’ll negotiate. Simple as that. Governor Whitmer is trying to do that, and if she can’t do it, then at least empower Governor Whitmer, because what Governor Whitmer is doing is much more effective than what Winnie Brinks is doing,” Hall said. 
Brinks spokesperson Rosie Jones directed the Michigan Advance to the majority leader’s comments in a Wednesday report from Crain’s Detroit Business, where she questioned if Hall was serious about coming to an agreement on roads and said Hall should stop insulting Senate Democrats.
While Senate Democrats are considering ideas from both Hall’s proposal — which largely consists of funding from eliminating or halting economic development spending — and Whitmer’s proposal — which would draw more than half of its funding from a tax on large corporations and big tech companies — Brinks told Crain’s she did not intend to pass a deal without making a deal first, emphasizing that any road funding plan should move alongside the state budget.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1221-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 20:04:12.706267

The House Education Appropriations Subcommittee met Wednesday to discuss House Study Bill 337, which would allocate more than $1 billion in state dollars to the Iowa Department of Education, Iowa Board of Regents and its universities, community colleges, departments for the blind and deaf and more.
Rep. Austin Harris, R-Moulton, chaired the subcommittee meeting and said lawmakers will continue to work on the budget, but he is pleased with its current form.
“I’m very proud of the budget that the House Republicans have put forward,” Harris said. “I think it’s in line with our principles of being fiscally responsible and restrained and making sure that we have good budget practices, also while we’re making investments across the entire state.”

Each of Iowa’s public universities would see less general university funding from the state than what they requested, according to the bill, and less than what is proposed in the Iowa Senate’s version of education appropriation legislation.
The University of Iowa would receive more than $222.6 million in general university funding, according to the legislation, with Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa set to receive almost $177.7 million and just over $101.4 million, respectively. Both the UI and ISU requested flat funding for fiscal year 2026, and UNI asked for an increase of $2.5 million.
Rep. Monica Kurth, D-Davenport, said it’s “very concerning” to see general funding for universities decrease when costs have kept rising. Both the UI and ISU would see a decrease of $800,000 under the bill, she said, and UNI would receive nearly $500,000 less in general funding.
“Those are our higher education institutions and to not increase their funding, to at least take into account cost of living adjustment, I think is very concerning,” Kurth said.
State universities saved more than $2 million by eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs and positions across their campuses, Harris said, and when looking at specific university programs funded in the bill, total appropriations have actually increased.
Included in the House bill is a section funding the proposed UI center for intellectual freedom with a $1.5 million appropriation, pending Gov. Kim Reynolds’s signature on legislation establishing the center. Other university funding Harris noted included $4 million to the UI for rural maternal and mental health professional programs, $1 million for UI cancer research, a combined $4 million for ISU extension offices, agricultural and veterinary programs and $3 million to UNI for an in-state tuition program for students from bordering states.
Both ISU and UNI would see more than $3 million in total state allocations under the bill, Harris said, and the UI would receive an increase of around $5.6 million.
Other departments and organizations seeing funding increases include the Department for the Blind, Iowa School for the Deaf, Iowa PBS and loan and incentive programs.
Community colleges would receive almost $243.9 million under the House legislation, about $8 million more than the Senate bill proposes. Lawmakers voiced their support for this change, but Rep. Elinor Levin, D-Iowa City, said she was concerned with the many “status quo line items,” or budget items that have remained unchanged from last year, in the bill.
Despite all of the talk about the importance of early literacy, Levin said there is no increased funding for initiatives to help with this problem in the bill, nor are there increases for postsecondary summer classes for high school students or statewide student assessments.
The bill will move to the House Appropriations Committee after a 5-2 vote.
“We obviously know how the process here works, and moving forward, we’re going to continue to work on the budget to hopefully get us out of here at a decent time,” Harris said.

A 24-year-old University of Delaware graduate student was killed and another seriously injured after a stolen U-Haul van driven by a man crashed on East Main Street Tuesday afternoon.
Police announced Wednesday afternoon that Gordon Turner, 22, of New Castle, was arrested following the incident, which began shortly before 4:30 p.m. on April 29.
Officers had been searching for a U-Haul van reported as an unauthorized vehicle that was due back in March.
RELATED: 1 dead, several injured after U-Haul crashes into pedestrians in Newark
The van was found unoccupied in a shopping center on the 200 block of East Main Street.
When Turner and a passenger returned to the vehicle, police moved in.
Turner reportedly fled by driving over a curb, striking a police cruiser, and speeding onto East Main Street. Officers did not pursue the van.
Moments later, Turner lost control of the vehicle near Haines Street, striking two pedestrians on the sidewalk. One of the victims was pronounced dead at the scene.
The second victim, also a 24-year-old graduate student, was hospitalized in serious condition but is now stable.
The crash triggered a chain reaction involving several parked vehicles and additional injuries.
A third pedestrian was hurt when a parked vehicle, struck during the crash, was pushed into them.
Turner was taken to a hospital, then released into police custody.
A passenger in the van was also detained but has not been charged. A search of the van revealed a handgun and marijuana exceeding the legal possession limit.
Turner faces multiple charges, including two counts of second-degree murder, first-degree assault, and fleeing police.
He is also wanted by authorities in Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. After arraignment, he was held at Howard R. Young Correctional Institution on $305,500 cash bond.
East Main Street remained closed for about five hours as investigators examined the scene with assistance from multiple agencies.
Police are asking anyone with video footage of the crash or additional information to contact Cpl. Jon Lee at (302) 366-7100 ext. 3462 or jlee@newark.de.us. Anonymous tips can be submitted through the department’s tip line.
Statement from University of Delaware leadership on U-Haul death
“Dear UD Community,
Since last evening’s crash on Main Street that took the life of a University of Delaware graduate student (whose identity is being withheld at this time) and injured several others, we have been struggling to cope with the pain of this senseless tragedy. Throughout the UD community, we are all feeling the deep ache of loss, and we will continue to work through our grief together.
Today, Newark Police announced an arrest in connection with the crash, reiterating that there is no ongoing threat to the community.
Main Street is where we eat, shop and share our lives with our friends, families and classmates. Because it is part of the state’s roadway systems, we have been working with local and state officials this year, including our partners at Delaware Department of Transportation, to address traffic safety on and around Main Street. In the wake of this tragedy, we will reinforce and accelerate those efforts. We recognize there isn’t a simple solution, particularly when these tragedies involve actions taken by individuals that may not be stopped by changes to roadways or infrastructure. However, this incident underscores that our collective efforts must take on renewed urgency.
University leaders joined Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings and Newark Mayor Travis McDermott today for a press conference, at which we expressed our shared commitment to enhanced safety along Main Street. The University has pledged to continue these discussions through meetings with the offices of AG Jennings and Mayor McDermott, in addition to DelDOT, in the near future. The University remains committed to advancing meaningful solutions, while the University’s Division of Student Life and Graduate College are connecting with students about effective advocacy, civic engagement and partnerships in order to support these efforts.
We are also aware that members of the UD community may have witnessed the crash and its aftermath or have close relationships with the victims. We encourage everyone to become familiar with and use, as needed, the available University counseling and support resources that were shared in Tuesday evening’s message to the UD community. Counseling services are available at Warner Hall and through TimelyCare anytime, 24/7. Students with physical injuries or medical concerns relating to the incident can contact Student Health Services at 302-831-2226, Option 0, or visit Laurel Hall to meet with triage nurses available until 5 p.m. After hours, students can contact the Highmark Nurse line at 888-258-3428 or visit local urgent care centers (Newark Urgent Care at 324 E. Main Street, or ChristianaCare GoHealth at 550 S. College Avenue, Suite 115).
During this difficult time in our community, we all need to continue supporting and standing by one another as we move forward together.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)A political fund associated with SpaceX — the company founded by world’s richest man Elon Musk — has donated thousands of dollars to Democratic U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, who announced her campaign for U.S. Senate this week.
The Space Exploration Technologies Corps. PAC is a corporate political action committee that has donated generously to Republican and Democratic members of Congress across the country, including U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum and Minnesota Republicans, in addition to Craig.
The SpaceX PAC hasn’t received donations from Elon Musk, though he is the company CEO. The SpaceX PAC’s treasurer is the treasury director for SpaceX, and the PAC email address is that of a company lobbyist.
In 2024, Craig’s campaign for U.S. House received $10,000 from the SpaceX PAC, while Craig’s leadership PAC received a $2,500 donation.
Craig has been a sharp critic of Musk.
“Trump and Musk are burning our government down,” Craig said in announcing her Senate run.
In a statement to the Reformer, Craig’s Senate campaign said she has donated the SpaceX donations to Every Third Saturday, a veterans organization.
“This donation will help support those on the frontlines of Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s reckless cuts to the VA, part of the dangerous Trump-Musk agenda that Rep. Craig has been fighting tooth and nail since day one of this administration,” a campaign spokesperson said.
Musk, who’s also a close advisor to Trump, has used DOGE to drastically cut and reshape the federal government and the services it provides.
Craig has criticized Musk’s access to Americans’ confidential information, and at a Lakeville town hall earlier this month, Craig said Musk is cutting crucial services for Minnesotans.
“With the help of unelected billionaire Elon Musk, they’ve taken a sledgehammer to our federal agencies, laying off veterans, public health employees, FSA loan officers — jeopardizing the critical services Minnesotans rely on,” Craig said.
Craig, who has represented the 2nd Congressional District since 2019, will battle Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and former Senate Minority Leader Melisa López Franzen in what is expected to be a grueling Democratic primary.
Among Minnesota’s congressional delegation, McCollum has received the most campaign donations from the SpaceX PAC — over $30,000 since 2018.

When Democrats controlled Congress, McCollum held an influential position as chair of the defense subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, giving her a major hand in hundreds of billions of dollars in Pentagon spending. SpaceX, a major defense contractor, received $3.8 billion in federal contracts in 2024, according to The New York Times.
In a statement to the Reformer, McCollum’s campaign said the SpaceX PAC money was used to help elected Democrats.
“In the 2022 and 2024 congressional election cycles, Congresswoman McCollum’s leadership PAC and re-election campaign contributed over $1 million to Democratic candidates for Congress and Democratic Party organizations. Every dollar donated by SpaceX employees was deployed to help elect Democrats in Minnesota and across the country.”
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar in 2017 and 2018 received $2,000 from the SpaceX PAC.
Since 2018, Democrats in Minnesota’s congressional delegation have received more support from the SpaceX PAC compared to Republicans.
Republican Rep. Brad Finstad received $5,000 in 2024, while GOP Reps. Pete Stauber and Tom Emmer each received a $2,500 donation.
Overall, however, Musk-related entities have turned sharply right, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaigns for Trump and other Republicans. Most recently, Musk dumped about $22 million for a Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, though his preferred candidate lost handily.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Craig.jpeg,,,2025-04-30 20:04:12.706267

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s proposed budget is expected to eliminate Head Start, the federal program that provides free or low-cost child care to low-income families.
Head Start serves 12,000 children in Minnesota, mostly in rural areas, said Kraig Gratke, executive director of the Minnesota Head Start Association. Republicans and Democrats alike have supported Head Start. In 2024, Minnesota U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber and dozens of his Republican colleagues wrote a letter to congressional budget leaders urging them to prioritize funding for Head Start. 
Head Start is funded through Sept. 30, but would expire Oct. 1 if Trump’s proposed budget is passed. 
“It’s unconscionable to me to think about taking away critical supports that help families raise their children,” said U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison, D-Minn., at a press conference denouncing the proposed cuts.
Minnesota is facing a crisis of child care availability and affordability; the state has some of the highest child care costs in the nation. 
Gratke said Minnesota Head Start is already feeling the impact of cuts. The Department of Health and Human Services closed six regional offices, including one in Chicago, which was Minnesota’s point of contact for Head Start and other federal programs. In early April, many Head Start staffers were laid off. 
Families that qualify for Head Start also qualify for the similar state Child Care Assistance Program, or CCAP — so Head Start saves the state around $65 million per year by using federal resources to serve families who would otherwise rely on state assistance, Gratke said. 
Head Start employs 3,200 people in Minnesota. Eight tribal nations have Head Start centers. 
“These are very hard pills to swallow when we’re already dealing with a lot of economic issues and folks are struggling,” Gratke said. Trump is expected to release his full budget proposal as soon as next week.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2198395626-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 19:05:35.885634

In the position, he has overseen the management of 17.5 million surface acres of public lands and more than 40 million acres of federal sub-surface mineral lands. He directed an office with more than 600 permanent staff and 150 seasonal employees who help manage everything from energy development and livestock grazing to campgrounds, multi-use trails, outdoor recreation spots and wild horses.

He occupied the spot during a time of tumult and national attention. The 2023 release of the draft Rock Spring Field Office Resource Management Plan sparked furor and heated debate over how to manage some 3.6 million acres of public lands in southwestern Wyoming. The plan spurred state intervention, drew thousands of comments and triggered fierce criticism of the federal government by elected officials and others.
Gifts, travel, rental cars
The Office of Inspector General investigated allegations that Archuleta may have violated the ethical conduct standards when he “accepted a gift of dinner and drinks at a Cheyenne, Wyoming, steakhouse from the owner of a commercial sign manufacturing company,” according to the investigation summary. 
Investigators found that he was in violation in that matter, according to the summary. They also determined Archuleta misused his subordinate’s time when he asked his assistant to make air travel arrangements on the clock for his girlfriend to accompany him on official travel, the summary states. 
“In addition, we determined that Archuleta misused a Government rental vehicle in violation of DOI policy when he allowed his girlfriend to drive the rental vehicle and that he violated the Federal Travel Regulation when he used the Government rental car for personal purposes,” the summary continues.

Finally, investigators found Archuleta violated policy when he drove his girlfriend to and from Buffalo in a government vehicle “because she was neither a Federal employee nor conducting official Government business there.” 
Background 
Archuleta’s career in federal service stretches back three decades, according to a BLM press release that announced his 2022 selection. His former assignments include BLM Colorado’s Northwest District manager and district manager for BLM’s California Desert District. He has also worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service.
“His understanding of rural communities and the challenges they face coupled with the expertise he has developed will continue to benefit the BLM and the Wyoming communities and constituencies we serve,” former BLM Director Tracy Stone-Manning said in the 2022 announcement.
Archuleta, a Colorado native, earned both a bachelor’s degree in wildlife biology and a master’s degree in wildlife toxicology from Colorado State University. He is an avid outdoorsman, according to the BLM. 
Purdy could not comment on further action or future steps regarding Archuleta’s position. 
WyoFile was unable to contact Archuleta on Wednesday for comment.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee Wednesday unanimously approved legislation that would require students to take a conflict resolution course in middle school.
SB 34, sponsored by Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, requires the State Department of Education to develop the program. 
“We’re trying to get these kids to where they understand how you deal with conflicts and situations and not resort to … fighting, knives, guns, et cetera,” Smitherman said.

The House Education Policy Committee adopted an amendment that would require the program to be taught in middle school, instead of high school. Smitherman said the State Superintendent Eric Mackey suggested the change. 
“Dr. Mackey came over and talked to me. He said we need to start this in middle school,” Smitherman said. 
A message seeking comment from Mackey was sent Wednesday afternoon.
Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, supported the legislation and highlighted the importance of conflict resolution.
“I think problem solving is important, and I agree with Dr. Mackey on the timing in middle school,” she said.
The course must include lessons on: “responsible decision-making; the causes and effects of school violence and harassment, cultural diversity, and nonviolent methods for resolving conflict, including peer mediation; the consequences of violent behavior; the causes of violent reactions to conflict; nonviolent conflict resolution techniques; the relationship between drugs, alcohol, and violence; the implementation of voluntary peer mediation programs and the integration of conflict resolution models in classrooms.”
Rep. Alan Baker, R-Brewton, also supported the legislation but was worried about the additional stress a new class would put on teachers.
“We do pile too much on the teachers, continuing things that we try to do in the total development of the child, not just academics,” Baker said. 
Smitherman said it is up to the state Board of Education to decide how often, when and how the course will be taught.
The bill moves to the full House for consideration. There are four days left in the 2025 legislative session.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A measure that would prevent development in state parks was passed unanimously in the Florida Senate on Wednesday, 37-0. However, the measure now must go back to the House for one more vote before it can arrive on Gov. DeSantis’ desk to be signed into law.
The State Park Preservation Act (HB 209) was filed last year by Southeast Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell following a statewide public backlash to the Department of Environmental Protection’s “Great Outdoor Initiative.”
That plan called for building lodges, golf courses, pickleball courts, and disc golf courses in nine state parks.
“This is democracy at work,” Harrell said before the Senate passed the measure.
“This was really a grassroots endeavor that came up and the participation of so many people across the aisle, every socioeconomic group, every group that you could talk to, this was the issue of the summer. I can tell you that all the demonstrations out in the hot August sun in Florida to get out there and do that to let people know that our parks are the core of who we are.”
The Florida House unanimously passed its version of the bill last week, but its Senate companion (SB 80) had not been scheduled for a vote until Wednesday, drawing concern from environmentalists that the measure wouldn’t be addressed before the legislative session was scheduled to end later this week.
(The session is expected to go beyond this week, however, with the two chambers at odds over the state budget).
Those concerns increased earlier this week when Miami-Dade Republican Sen. Alexis Calatayud added an amendment that the Sierra Club claimed in a press release was “an obvious attempt to run out the clock.”
However, Harrell gladly accepted Calatayud’s amendment on Wednesday, which included language prohibiting construction of specified sporting facilities and public lodging in state parks — listing  golf courses, tennis courts, pickleball courts, ball fields, or other sporting facilities that “may not be constructed within the boundaries of state parks.”
But her amendment also says that the state can continue to maintain or repair of “any such sporting facilities, or other facilities, existing with a state park.”
The bill requires the DEP to  report to the governor and Legislature regarding the status and operation of state parks. Additionally, the bill revises notice requirements for public meetings.
It requires individual land management plans with parcels within a state park to be developed with the input of an advisory committee. It also says that the Division of State Lands shall make available to the public an electronic copy of each land management plan at least 30 days before the public hearing required for parcels that exceed 160 acres in size and for parcels located within a state park.
Panhandle Republican Sen. Don Gaetz asked Harrell whether she could assure him that there is no “weasel word” in the bill that would “allow any kind of commercialization of our state parks now or in the future, or in any land that would be required contiguous to our state parks?”
“There’s no wiggle room for golf courses or things of that sort for that to be built within our existing state parks,” Harrell replied.

Glenn Youngkin's Spirit of Virginia PAC. Last week, he urged Youngkin to ask John Reid, the GOP's nominee for lieutenant governor, to drop out. (Creative Direct company photo)Matt Moran, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s top political strategist and head of the Spirit of Virginia PAC, broke his silence Wednesday evening, rejecting accusations that he tried to pressure GOP lieutenant governor nominee John Reid out of the race and declaring that “facts matter.”
Youngkin’s political adviser under fire as extortion allegations rock Virginia GOP

Less than two hours before Reid was set to appear solo at a GOP rally in Henrico County after Youngkin canceled the event originally scheduled for the entire statewide Republican slate, Moran took to social media to push back on what he called “unfounded” claims and released a sworn affidavit along with a pointed legal letter from his attorney.
“I’ve known John Reid for years and consider him a friend,” Moran wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Over the last nine days, I was actively supporting and assisting John as the Lt. Governor nominee of the Republican Party. Let me be clear, facts matter, and they will demonstrate the accusations against me are unfounded.”
Moran also posted a letter from his attorney, George Terwilliger III, addressed to Reid’s campaign. In it, Terwilliger disputed Reid’s version of events, suggesting Reid had been misled. 
“From that sequence, I am going to assume, until it is demonstrated otherwise, that you were not provided sufficiently reliable information,” Terwilliger wrote, adding that “erroneous conclusions… manifested as the unsupported accusations against Mr. Moran.”
The lawyer said Moran took “the extraordinary step” of signing an affidavit to affirm “accurate fundamental facts” and show that the allegations “are unfounded.” Terrwilliger urged Reid to retract his claims and warned of potential legal consequences if the “unfounded and untoward accusations” continue, saying “such demands were made of Mr. Moran,” and all related materials should be preserved.
“To be clear, Mr. Moran strongly denies that he has defamed Mr. Reid in any manner whatsoever,” Terrwilliger wrote. “The facts, evidence, and witnesses would demonstrate that Mr. Moran never attempted to extort, coerce, or pressure Mr. Reid… but rather as a seasoned professional endeavored to provide sound advice regarding the viability of Mr. Reid’s candidacy to someone he counted as a friend.”
Still, Terwilliger signaled a willingness to cool tensions, asking the Reid campaign if they were open to “scheduling a call where we might further discuss the matter.”
The public response marks a new phase in a feud that has roiled Virginia Republicans since last week — pitting the governor’s inner circle against the party’s first openly gay statewide nominee in a clash that’s turned deeply personal and politically damaging.
In deepening Va. GOP crisis, Reid accuses Youngkin PAC of extortion. Is a legal battle ahead?

Reid, a conservative radio host and longtime personality on WRVA, escalated the firestorm Sunday, which began two days earlier when The Richmonder reported that Youngkin had called the radio host and asked him to end his campaign. 
In a video posted on X, Reid alleged that “representatives of my campaign have been told by the leader of Governor Youngkin’s political organization that the attacks on me will continue unless I drop out.” 
He didn’t name Moran in the video, but on Monday his campaign sent a cease-and-desist letter directly accusing Moran of defamation and “actual malice.”
The letter claims Moran told news outlets Reid was behind a sexually explicit Tumblr account — a charge Reid’s team denies. “While this account shared a common username with our client’s Instagram, he is not and never has been associated with the account,” the letter stated. It also accuses Moran of telling Reid that “him getting out of the race is the only way it stops.”
Moran, 36, heads the governor’s Spirit of Virginia PAC and serves as Youngkin’s unpaid policy director. His central role in the campaign operation has drawn backlash from Republicans  across the state, with some urging Youngkin to cut ties amid the controversy.
“Firing Matt really is the only appropriate thing for Governor Youngkin to do,” Casey Flores, founder of the Richmond chapter of Log Cabin Republicans, a national LGBTQ+ GOP group, told The Mercury on Tuesday.
Even some party stalwarts have raised alarms about how the allegations have been handled. 
John Reid imbroglio tests gender, sexuality and privacy standards in Virginia politics

Former Republican Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling said the core question — whether Reid had any real connection to the Tumblr account — “remains unresolved.” 
And Rick Buchanan, chair of the 5th District GOP committee, said Youngkin made a mistake by listening to Moran “without knowing the facts.”
Others have raised concerns about Moran’s dual roles. Loudoun County GOP Chair Scott Pio called his arrangement — being on leave from two consulting firms while advising Youngkin — a conflict of interest. 
“Since Matt doesn’t have a statewide client, he decides to throw this bomb,” Pio said. “Youngkin being a businessman, he should know when to hire and fire quickly.”
Calls are also growing for internal accountability. In a letter to GOP Chairman Mark Peake, Buchanan and 6th District Chair John Massoud urged the party’s executive committee to privately review any images Moran may have shown the governor. They said the accusations were serious, but “the evidence behind the allegations … have not been forthcoming.”
Wednesday’s previously scheduled GOP “unity” rally was abruptly canceled in the wake of the controversy. Reid has vowed to continue campaigning and appeared at the Henrico event without other party leaders. 
The rally instead became a backdrop to Moran’s digital counterattack — one that may escalate the conflict even further, despite his lawyer’s call to “de-escalate.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The carton of milk you purchase from the local grocery store may soon be made in Little Rock. 
That’s because Elopak, a Norwegian packaging company that specializes in producing cartons for milk, juice, and other liquid food products, had the grand opening for its first carton production plant in the United States on Wednesday. The celebration included remarks by Elopak’s CEO, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. and a pre-recorded video of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Elopak executives emphasized the company’s commitment to sustainability, noting that one of their key strategic goals is to take advantage of a global souring on plastic to grow the business.
“This plant — and this is why this is such a momentous, historic event for us — is a key milestone in our strategy,” Elopak CEO Thomas Körmendi said. “It gives us the possibility to offer more customers, more consumers, sustainable packaging solutions with the latest development in mind for many, many years to come.”
The new facility, which was built in less than 12 months on swampland near the Port of Little Rock, will employ around 100 people, company officials said.
Körmendi gave remarks to a standing-room-only crowd — some from as far as Japan — at the facility’s grand opening. Körmendi touted the business he leads as the largest liquid carton company in the world while stating that Little Rock “fits perfectly” into Elopak’s larger global strategy.
Scott said that it was not lost on him that a large global company was coming into one of the smallest U.S. states, crediting the work of the Little Rock Port Authority and the Little Rock Board of Directors for their recruitment efforts.
“We all are working every day with a lot of grit and grind to make sure that we can land a company like you, and so as you’re having this repackaging tomorrow across this world, we’re privileged, we’re grateful that you’ve decided to come to Little Rock,” Scott said.
Meanwhile, Sanders, in pre-recorded remarks, held up signature policy moves by her administration as the reason for job creation and growth in the state.
“Arkansas beat out several other states for this project, showing that cutting taxes, investing in education and building up our workforce is the key to bringing new companies to our state,” Sanders said. “Thank you to all Elopak’s leadership for your investment, in not only the United States, but in the Natural State.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Clint O’Neal, executive director of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission, emphasized tax cuts as well, saying that even more could be on the horizon.
“We’ve had many great successes over this past legislative session,” O’Neal said. “I would call it the best economic development session in the last couple of decades.” 
“We’re committed to making this place a great business environment,” he added. “We don’t want companies to worry about, ‘Is this a state that’s getting ready to increase my taxes?’ You can be confident in Arkansas that we have reduced taxes, and if anything, this is a state that’s going to continue to reduce taxes to continue to create an environment that you can find success in.”
Körmendi said in an interview that Little Rock had been “very attractive” to the company because it checked off many of the boxes Elopak had when evaluating where they would put the U.S. plant. 
“Our customers will source their packaging material from plants that are close by, which is really also why we need one in the U.S.,” he said.
Körmendi declined to provide estimates for how much Elopak would produce at the Little Rock facility in the coming months, but Elopak Americas President Lionel Ettedgui said in an interview that the capacity of the new Little Rock facility’s first production line sold out quickly. The company plans to open a second line within the coming year.
“We have also initiated and will be inaugurating the next line next year, the first half of next year,” Körmendi said. “We are absolutely committed to filling up the factory.”
Elopak exists in a low-competition industry, Ettedgui added, making the investment in U.S. operations low-risk with high return.
“It’s a very specific market,” Ettedgui said. “When joining Elopak, I did my research and I found that sustainability, innovation were part of their DNA, in an industry where you don’t see that many innovations…The company walks the talk.” 
Körmendi did not appear concerned about the uncertain tariff situation the U.S. finds itself in when asked about whether the moves by President Donald Trump could affect production at the facility. Their facilities in Canada and Mexico are covered under free trade agreements, giving them more flexibility, he said.
“We have more than 90% of the material we use — 93%, I think, actually, comes from the U.S.,” Körmendi said.
“Low levels” of production have already started at the plant, Körmendi said.

“This moment is especially thrilling because it represents not just a lineup of remarkable performers but the beginning of something truly transformative for our city, a cultural legacy in the making,” said Jackson’s first lady Ebony Lumumba, chair of the executive committee for the National Folk Festival Jackson.
“For the next three years, Jackson will be home to one of the oldest and most celebrated cultural festivals in the nation, and that means that we are planting artistic and economic seeds that will blossom into something extraordinary for our residents, our artists, our young people and visitors from all over the world,” she said.
The National Folk Festival was created in 1934 and has traveled nationwide. With an anticipated 60,000 to 80,000 visitors in its first year, the event is expected to grow to welcome more than 150,000 people to the Capital City. The festival will stimulate economic growth in Jackson, with other host cities seeing $15 million to $30 million dollars of long-term annual impact by the end of its third year, said Blaine Waide, executive director of the National Council for the Traditional Arts. 
On Wednesday, Waide and other key partners in the festival announced the first performers added to the lineup. Artists include sacred steel guitar band The Campbell Brothers, go-go group E.U. featuring Sugar Bear, and Mississippi-born, Chicago-based John Primer & The Real Deal Blues Band. Bluegrass singer Dale Ann Bradley, Irish artist Eileen Ivers, flamenco couple LOS RICOS featuring Sonia and Ismael, bomba band Plena Libre and the South Asian ensemble Riyaaz Qawwali will also perform.
Over the next coming months, more will be announced, including dancers, craftspeople and storytellers, leading to approximately 300 artists tapped to participate. Applications are open for food and market place vendors. The deadline to apply is May 19.
Thabi Moyo, local festival organizer, said that it’s not just a big weekend, but a promising opportunity for Jackson and Mississippi. Jackson was selected out of 42 cities that applied to host the festival.
“Mississippi has been at the National Folk Festival, but this is the first time that it’s come to the Deep South, but Mississippi has always been represented,” Moyo said. “That right there to me speaks to the influence of the type of music and culture, arts and culture and impact that we’ve had because it’s already out in the world and people love it.”

In addition to the National Folk Festival, Moyo has been hosting Folk After 5 at Hal and Mal’s restaurant, which will be held every first Thursday leading up the the festival. Visitors can enjoy folk music played by a live DJ, and meet with organizers and learn more about the festival. 
“I wanted to create a space that’s low stakes, that’s easy, where you can come engage with folks who are involved with making the festival happen,” Moyo said.
Waide said that Mississippi is the perfect place to host the National Folk Festival due to its cultural influence and legacy of creating history-making entertainers. 
“It’s the home of Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, Pops Staples. You’ve got country music, blues music, gospel music,” Waide said. “… American musical history would not be what it is without the state of Mississippi, so it’s an appropriate place to have this festival.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/04190212/National-Folk-Festival-Kickoff-10-1.jpg,,,2025-04-30 19:05:35.885634

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Lawmakers in both chambers of the Florida Legislature voted unanimously Wednesday to pass a bill addressing rising fees for condominium owners, which is one of the items that has sprouted criticism from Gov. Ron DeSantis.
With the scheduled end of the session looming mere days away, the Legislature approved a bill, HB 913, that allows condominium associations to secure credit lines and invest funds to pay for building repairs instead of immediately raising large amounts of cash from owners.
But lawmakers sponsoring the legislation acknowledged that they will likely have to continue making changes in the future in light of escalating fees following last year’s deadline for condominiums to complete studies detailing how much each needs to save to pay for roof and structural maintenance.

“This incredible bill addressing the condominium crisis we have all heard about for the last year gives a lot of financial relief,” Miami Republican Rep. Vicki Lopez said. She’s the bill’s main sponsor in the House. Fleming Island Republican Sen. Jennifer Bradley filed the Senate’s proposal.
Lawmakers passed legislation requiring those studies and milestone inspections 30 years after a building’s construction, following the 2021 collapse in Surfside of a 12-story condo that killed 98 people.
The passage comes amid DeSantis’ continued bashing of the Legislature, with emphasis on the House, over their inaction on condos. He called lawmakers to Tallahassee at the beginning of the year for a special session on immigration, condos, hurricane relief, and citizen-led constitutional amendments. The Legislature ended up only addressing immigration ahead of their scheduled session opening in March.
“We have this condo issue, that legislation that caused these crushing assessments,” DeSantis said during a Wednesday press conference about Hope Florida in Fruitland Park. “We know people need relief from that. We’ve gotta do it. The Senate’s got a great product that can do it.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
What changed and what remained?
Senators waited a week to take up the House’s proposal, with changes requiring both chambers to make concessions. For example, Bradley’s idea to allow condo associations to invest money meant for repairs is still in the bill, but the compromise limits those investments to certificates of deposit. The House’s push to allow associations to pay for repairs with credits will also require support from the majority of owners of condo units.
The legislation provides some flexibility for associations, carving out condos with only three residential stories from the building inspection requirements and letting associations pause contributions to reserve funds for repairs for up to two years after a milestone inspection, required 30 years after the buildings’ construction.
With the bill headed to the governor’s desk, DeSantis could still harbor objections to it, particularly regarding electronic voting. A quarter of condo owners could petition their association to hold an electronic vote under the bill, which DeSantis has said would incite fraud.
Still, one provision that intensified disagreement between the sponsors early made its way to the Senate floor’s discussion despite the House abandoning the idea earlier in the process. Lopez originally wanted to prohibit Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state’s property insurer of last resort, from issuing or renewing policies for condominium buildings that haven’t completed their building inspections.
“Obviously, ensuring compliance is important, but such a provision would devastate owners in an already weak condo market,” Bradley said, adding that she brought up the removed provision because other senators still raised concerns about it.
Both Lopez and Bradley received compliments from their colleagues. Senators made multiple references to constituents yelling at them over the heightened fees.
“Condo meetings are not where you wanna go with a thin skin. I assure you of that,” Bradley said.

In the motion, attorneys for the nonprofit argue that NMED’s permitting policies unequally enforce limitations in liquid waste laws between smaller and larger permits (more than 5,000 gallons of liquid waste per day), which they say amounts to a constitutional violation because it ignores state environmental laws.
Tom Hnasko, the attorney representing Protect Tesuque, said the court could have denied the petition without further argument.
“They obviously want to see what the Environment Department and Bishop’s Lodge have to say about the matter,” he said.
Attorneys for both Bishop’s Lodge and the New Mexico Environment Department requested the state’s justices deny the petition, and filed documents last week saying they intended to file further arguments.
“The New Mexico Environment Department remains confident in its legal position that Bishop’s Lodge’s wastewater treatment system is subject to state ground and surface water quality regulations. NMED has consistently found that the facility meets or exceeds all applicable state water quality standards. Due to ongoing litigation, we are unable to comment further at this time,” said Drew Goretzka, a spokesperson at the New Mexico Environment Department in a written statement Wednesday.
Representatives for Bishop’s Lodge or its parent company, Juniper Capital, did not respond to emailed requests for comment Wednesday afternoon. The hotel and its parent company maintain that the proposal to treat sewage is safe, noting that it installed a new wastewater treatment plant in 2024 “designed to meet or exceed all local and national water quality standards.”
The draft permit is scheduled for a May 19 hearing before the New Mexico Environment for additional testimony, which at this time, remains in place.

Starting as soon as July, cannabis retailers with a new medical-use endorsement will be able to sell medical-grade pot products to select patients enrolled in the state’s medical program.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerSince Vermont’s first recreational cannabis dispensaries opened their doors in 2022, the state’s medical marijuana program has hit the skids.As of November 2024, just over 2,700 patients were enrolled in the program, down from a high of almost 5,500 medical-card holders in 2017, according to data from Vermont’s Cannabis Control Board. And as patients have opted to simply buy cannabis products at the now-ubiquitous recreational retailers, all but two of the state’s standalone medical dispensaries have shuttered their doors.“The business model just doesn’t work anymore,” James Pepper, chair of Vermont’s Cannabis Control Board, told members of the House Committee on Human Services Wednesday. To bolster the declining program, Vermont lawmakers have moved to integrate medical and recreational cannabis sales. Last year, the legislature passed Act 166, a law that, among other measures, introduced a new medical-use endorsement for cannabis retailers. The Cannabis Control Board could begin issuing it to select dispensaries as soon as this July. Cannabis retailers with the endorsement will be able to essentially operate as medical dispensaries. That means they can sell medical-grade weed products to select patients enrolled in the state’s medical program tax-free, provide curbside pickup and increase quantity limits for sales to patients, among other things.But regulators are still ironing out the details on how to roll out the new endorsement. A large and lingering question is how to properly train and educate budtenders — the cannabis salespeople at dispensaries — to make sure that patients who often suffer from severe health conditions are finding products that are right for them. To that end, regulators are considering introducing an app called Cannify to mediate interactions between medical patients and budtenders. Using a comprehensive questionnaire, the program would help steer patients toward proper treatment options. “We feel like this might be a useful tool in the tool box to make sure that our budtenders, who are economically motivated, are not kind of making recommendations about products to people who have very serious health conditions,” Pepper told lawmakers Wednesday.  Regulators are also recommending that lawmakers move to modify the process for evaluating and approving medical conditions that would qualify patients for medical marijuana usage to help expand access to the program. Currently, the legislature has sole authority to dictate what diagnoses would qualify patients, a process the Cannabis Control Board has recommended shifting to an independent regulatory authority of some kind.   “At what point are we going to turn that over to a regulatory process?” Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, said Wednesday. “Are we at that point with cannabis for medical relief? I think it’s a question that we should be talking about.” — Habib SabetIn the knowA federal judge in Burlington on Wednesday released Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Vermonter detained earlier this month by federal immigration authorities.Mahdawi, a student organizer at Columbia University and a lawful U.S. resident for a decade, was arrested by federal agents in Colchester during an interview as part of his U.S. citizenship naturalization process. Mahdawi’s is one of several high-profile cases involving the detention of noncitizen university students ostensibly for their campus activism in support of Palestinian human rights. At Wednesday’s hearing, U.S. District Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford ruled from the bench, allowing Mahdawi to walk free on his own recognizance after more than two weeks in a Vermont prison while his deportation case continues in immigration court.Read more about the court ruling here. — Ethan WeinsteinLast week, AmeriCorps began terminating nearly $400 million in grants across the country that funded thousands of jobs, including about $2.4 million in funding for service positions in Vermont. An April 25 grant termination letter said the state’s grant “no longer effectuates agency priorities” and demanded that recipients “immediately cease all award activities.” Several days after that notice arrived, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined a multi-state lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s termination of AmeriCorps grants and positions. The terminations impact about 200 positions, said Philip Kolling, the executive director of SerVermont which oversees the bulk of the state’s AmeriCorps members. About 70 are currently filled, with many slated to begin this spring and summer, he said. Some are government positions and many others are at nonprofits. The funding cuts constitute about 40% of the roughly $6 million Vermont receives annually for AmeriCorps programs, Kolling said. Positions that focus on anti-poverty initiatives and programming for seniors are not impacted by the terminations, he added.A separate AmeriCorps program, focused on affordable housing and disaster recovery, dismissed its members earlier this month, ending their service terms early and sending them home. The corps members under the SerVermont umbrella have not been officially let go. Read more about the impacts of the cuts on the AmeriCorps programs here. — Carly BerlinOn the HillU.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., brought up the recent detention of eight workers on a large dairy farm in Franklin County by federal immigration authorities during the Wednesday confirmation hearing for Rodney Scott, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Welch’s office created a video clip showing the roughly five-minute exchange. “We’ve got to milk our cows. We’ve got to have access to labor. None of these folks have any criminal record, and, really, this is a question about priorities,” Welch said. Scott answered, in part, that he doesn’t support “asking law enforcement officers not to enforce the law that’s in front of them.”Welch also got to ask about the changes required at the Haskell Free Library in Derby Line, which straddles an international border and serves both Canadian and U.S. patrons: “I get that you’ve got to ‘enforce the law,’ but is it a real issue about Canadians coming into the Canadian side of a Vermont library to get a book?” Since the U.S. border agency began requiring visitors from Canada to show ID at the door — with further restrictions on entry to come this fall — the library has opened up a back door into the building directly from Stanstead, Quebec.  Scott said he would commit to talking through any concerns about the arrangement and “we’re not going to make decisions in a vacuum.”— Kristen FountainRead the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Regulators prepare to roll out medical cannabis sales at Vermont’s recreational dispensaries.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/first-day-cannabis-3-20220923.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 19:05:35.885634

Throughout the legislative session, Ferguson indicated he would support legislation to cap rent increases, but he never voiced public support for the bill. (Photo courtesy of Legislative Support Services)State Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, one of the chief architects of legislation to cap rent hikes across Washington, says Gov. Bob Ferguson’s team has made clear to lawmakers since the second week of the legislative session, back in January, that he supports the measure.
But even with the bill approved by the Legislature and awaiting his signature, Ferguson repeatedly declined to take a public stance on it. He finally did so Wednesday when pressed about Trudeau’s comments.
The situation has stoked frustration for Trudeau, who would like to see the legislation swiftly enacted. It also underscores Ferguson’s reluctance to weigh in publicly on many of the biggest policy debates that unfolded over the past four months, ahead of the session wrapping up Sunday.
“I don’t want to assign any nefarious motives,” Trudeau, D-Tacoma, said in an interview Wednesday. “I honestly feel confused.”

There’ve been other frictions between Democratic lawmakers and the first-term Democratic governor during his opening months in office, including over Ferguson’s opposition to their wealth tax and other revenue proposals amid a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall. 
“This confusion, this last-minute position or non-position, that feels pretty on-par for what it’s felt like,” Trudeau said.
Talking to reporters Friday about the rent legislation, House Bill 1217, and another controversial bill to give unemployment benefits to workers on strike, the governor said “there’s different perspectives on those bills within the Democratic caucus, and I respect that.”
At the time, lawmakers were on the cusp of passing both bills after extensive debate. 
“We’re having conversations, and want to be helpful, and I’m confident they’ll get to a resolution on both those bills and get those to my desk, but we’re letting that process play out,” continued Ferguson.
‘I want to be proud of him’
On Wednesday, the governor’s communications director, Brionna Aho, said in a statement that the governor’s office has a process to “thoroughly review” bills after they pass. “The governor has rarely offered public comment on bills prior to the completion of that process,” Aho said.
“The governor is supportive of the policy, but we need to complete our process before he offers further comment,” she said of the rent bill.
Aho pointed out that there have been multiple versions of the legislation and that changes were still being made to it in the final two days of the session. 
But the main goal of the proposal — to cap rent increases across the state — has remained the same for months. 
The bill would limit annual rent increases to 7% plus inflation, or 10%, whichever is lower, for the next 15 years. It would also allow for only 5% rent hikes for manufactured homes in perpetuity. Landlords also wouldn’t be able to raise rents in the first 12 months of a tenancy. New construction would be exempt for its first 12 years. 
As lawmakers hammered out these details throughout the session, Ferguson’s staff told them the governor would sign whatever final compromise they reached, said Rep. Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds, the chair of the House Housing Committee.
Trudeau is pleading with Ferguson to sign the bill as soon as possible. The restrictions on rent hikes would go into effect immediately upon his signature. She worries landlords are speeding up rent increases, knowing they’ll be restricted once Ferguson OKs it. 
Before joining the state Senate, Trudeau worked with Ferguson for years in the attorney general’s office, including as his legislative director. In her experience, when he supports legislation, he makes that clear. 
In this case, his staff even worked with sponsors to figure out what changes could be made to the contentious rent legislation to curry votes from on-the-fence Democrats, she said.
It’s not the first time Trudeau has directed critical feedback toward her former boss. She was also the most vocal lawmaker last month about hostile workplace concerns in Ferguson’s office, caused by former top adviser Mike Webb, who resigned. 
Trudeau said she was proud of many of Ferguson’s actions while he was attorney general.
“I want to be proud of him as governor,” Trudeau said. “When the pressure is high is exactly when we need to show up for our people.”
‘Long road ahead’
Landlords and developers ardently opposed the rent legislation, arguing it would force them to leave the state. Well-funded housing industry groups targeted moderate Democratic senators to get them to vote against House Bill 1217.
On Wednesday, the Housing Solutions Coalition urged Ferguson to veto the proposed law, arguing it “will further hurt renters by driving down housing stock.” The coalition is led by Marcia Fudge, the former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Biden Administration, and Steve Stivers, a Republican former congressman from Ohio.
The policy’s supporters say it’ll give predictability to renters, and highlight other bills passed this year to boost housing supply, along with $605 million in new funding for affordable housing in the state’s Housing Trust Fund.
As part of Ferguson’s transition to the governor’s mansion, Lt. Gov. Denny Heck presented a plan of attack to deal with the state’s housing crisis. One of the report’s premises was to figure out a way to prevent price-gouging, and the rent legislation does that, Heck recently told reporters.
“The question is, are the rules too constrictive for them to make the investment?” asked Heck, also a Democrat. “And that’s what I don’t know the answer to. I don’t think any of us does.”
Trudeau recognizes it’s normal for new officials, especially governors, to feel things out in their first legislative session. She just wants Ferguson to quickly stand up for working people and renters. 
“We’ve got a long road ahead of us and we hope he can figure it out,” Trudeau said.

,DC,2025-04-30 22:32:48+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House GOP advances Trump mass deportations plan with huge funding boosts,"Ariana Figueroa, Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-advances-trump-mass-deportations-plan-huge-funding-boosts,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Judiciary Republicans Wednesday worked in committee on a portion of a major legislative package that would help fund President Donald Trump’s plans to conduct mass deportations of people living in the United States without permanent legal status.The Judiciary panel's $81 billion share of the “one, big beautiful” bill the president has requested of Congress would provide $45 billion for immigration detention centers, $8 billion to hire thousands of immigration enforcement officers and more than $14 billion for deportations, among other things.The border security and immigration funds are part of a massive package that wraps together White House priorities including tax cuts and defense spending boosts. Republicans are pushing the deal through using a special procedure known as reconciliation that will allow the Senate GOP to skirt its usual 60-vote threshold when that chamber acts.House Republicans returning from a two-week recess kicked off their work on reconciliation Tuesday, approving three of 11 bills out of committees on Armed Services, Education and Workforce and Homeland Security.On Wednesday, lawmakers continued work on the various sections of the reconciliation bill with markups — which means a bill is debated and potentially amended or rewritten — in the Financial Services, Judiciary, Transportation and Infrastructure and Oversight and Government Reform committees.House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana said Republicans will spend the rest of this week and next debating the 11 separate bills in committees. Committees when they finish their measures will send them to the House Budget Committee, which is expected to bundle them together prior to a floor vote.The Judiciary panel’s 116-page bill vastly overhauls U.S. asylum laws. It would, for example, create a fee structure for asylum seekers that would set a minimum cost for an application at no less than $1,000. Applications now are free.“These and other resources and fees in this reconciliation bill will ensure the Trump administration has the adequate resources to enforce the immigration laws in a fiscally responsible way,” GOP Chair Jim Jordan of Ohio said.The bill would establish a $1,000 fee for immigrants granted temporary protected status, which would mean they would have work authorizations and deportation protections.It would also require sponsors to pay $3,500 to take in an unaccompanied minor who crosses the border without a legal status. Typically, unaccompanied minors are released to sponsors who are family members living in the United States.The bill would also require immigrants without permanent legal status to pay a $550 fee for work permits every six months.The top Democrat on the panel, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, slammed the bill as targeting immigrants.“Every day, this administration uses immigration enforcement as a template to erode constitutional rights and liberties,” he said.A final committee vote was expected Wednesday night.‘A giveaway to ICE’The Judiciary bill directs half of the fees collected from asylum seekers to go toward the agency that handles U.S. immigration courts, but Democrats criticized the provisions as creating a barrier for asylum seekers.“The so-called immigration fees that are in this bill are really fines and nothing but a cruel attempt to make immigrating to this country impossible,” Washington Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal said.Democratic Rep. Chuy Garcia of Illinois, said the bill would not only “gut asylum” but would significantly increase funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention.Funding for ICE detention this fiscal year is roughly $3.4 billion, but the Judiciary bill would sharply increase that to $45 billion.Garcia called the increase a “a giveaway to ICE, a rogue agency that's terrorizing communities and clamping (down) on civil liberties and the Constitution itself, because they've been directed to do so by this president.”House Republicans have also included language that would move the Federal Trade Commission into the Department of Justice’s antitrust division, a move Democrats argued would kneecap the FTC’s regulatory authority.“You're trying to shutter the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, making it harder for us to enforce our antitrust laws,” Democratic Rep. Becca Balint of Vermont said.Consumer protections to take a hitLawmakers on the House Committee on Financial Services met in a lengthy, and at times tense, session to finalize legislation to cut “no less than” $1 billion from government programs and services under the panel’s jurisdiction, according to the budget resolution Congress approved in April.Funds in the crosshairs include those previously authorized for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and grants provided under the Biden administration-era Inflation Reduction Act for homeowners to improve energy efficiency.Chair French Hill said the committee “will do its part to reduce the deficit and decrease direct spending, so that Congress can enact pro-growth tax policies.”""And remember, today, we are here with one purpose, to do our part to put our nation back on a responsible fiscal trajectory,"" the Arkansas Republican said.Democrats introduced dozens of amendments during the hourslong session to block cuts to community block grants and programs protecting consumers, including veterans, from illegal credit and lending practices.Ranking member Maxine Waters said committee Republicans’ plans to cut the CFPB by 70% “is ridiculous.”“The bureau has saved American consumers $21 billion by returning to them funds that big banks and predatory lenders swindled out of them,” said Waters, a California Democrat.Congress created the CFPB in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when subprime mortgage lending cascaded into bank failures and home and job losses.Republicans opposed amendment after amendment.Rep. María Salazar of Florida tossed a copy of one of Waters’ lengthy amendments straight into a trash can after a staffer handed it to her. Michigan’s Rep. Bill Huizenga held up proceedings for several minutes when he accused Waters of breaking the rules by not distributing enough paper copies of her amendment.“We cannot allow our government to continue spending money like there are no consequences,” GOP Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska said in response to several Democratic amendments.A final committee vote was expected Wednesday night.Transportation section adds fees on electric vehiclesThe House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee also approved, by a party line 36-30 vote, reconciliation instructions that would cut $10 billion from the federal deficit while boosting spending for the U.S. Coast Guard and the air traffic control system.Like other portions of the larger reconciliation package, the transportation committee’s instructions would add funding for national security and border enforcement, through the Coast Guard funding, while cutting money from programs favored by Democrats, including climate programs and any spending that could be construed as race-conscious.The bill would provide $21.2 billion for the Coast Guard and $12.5 billion for air traffic control systems. It would raise money through a $250 annual fee on electric vehicles and a $100 annual fee on hybrids, while also cutting $4.6 billion from climate programs created in Democrats’ 2022 reconciliation package.Chairman Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican, said the measure included priorities for members of both parties, as well as business and labor interests.“We all want to invest in our Coast Guard,” he said. “We all want to rebuild our air traffic control system and finally address the broken Highway Trust Fund. We have held countless hearings on all of these topics, both recently and, frankly, for years. And now members have the opportunity to actually act.”Democrats on the panel complained that the reconciliation package was a partisan exercise and a departure from the panel’s normally congenial approach to business. They introduced dozens of amendments over the daylong committee meeting seeking to add funding for various programs. None were adopted.“The larger Republican reconciliation package will add more than $15 trillion in new debt, gives away $7 trillion in deficit-financed tax cuts to the wealthy and slashes access to health care and food assistance for families,” ranking Democrat Rick Larsen of Washington said. “Given that, I think we're going to have to vote no on the bill before us.”The vehicle fees, which would be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund that sends highway and transit money to states, created a partisan divide Wednesday.Federal gas taxes provide the lion’s share of deposits to the fund and Republicans argued that, because drivers of electric vehicles pay no gas taxes and hybrid drivers pay less than those who drive gas-powered cars, the provision would make the contributions fairer.Republicans scrapped a proposed $20 annual fee on gas-powered cars, which Graves said was meant to “start a conversation” on the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund. But the provision “became a political distraction that no longer centered around seriously addressing the problem,” he said.Pennsylvania Democrat Chris Deluzio criticized the vehicle fees, noting Republicans were pursuing additional revenue opportunities to offset losses from tax cuts.“I don't know when you guys became the tax-and-spend liberals,” Deluzio told his Republican colleagues. “But I guess the taxing of car owners so you can pay for tax giveaways to billionaires is your new strategy. Good luck with that.”Federal employee benefits targetedThe House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform voted nearly along party lines, 22-21, to send its portion of the reconciliation package to the Budget Committee, with Ohio Republican Rep. Mike Turner joining Democrats in opposition.Turner was the first GOP lawmaker to cast a committee vote against reconciliation instructions this year.The legislation hits at federal employee benefits and comes as the Trump administration continues to overhaul the federal workforce.Part of the bill would raise federal employees’ required retirement contribution to a rate of 4.4% of their salary and eliminate an additional retirement annuity payment for federal employees who retire before the age of 62, while cutting more than $50 billion from the federal deficit.At his committee’s markup, Chairman James Comer said the legislation “advances important budgetary reforms that will save taxpayers money.”The Kentucky Republican acknowledged that the chief investigative committee in the U.S. House has “very limited jurisdiction to help reduce the federal budget deficit,” noting that the panel is “empowered to pursue civil service reforms, including federal employee benefits and reining in the influence of partisan and unaccountable government employee unions.”But Democrats on the panel blasted the committee’s portion of the reconciliation package, saying the bill chips away at federal employees’ protections.Rep. Stephen Lynch, the top Democrat on the panel, said congressional Republicans instructed the panel to target the federal workforce with roughly $50 billion in funding cuts “regardless of the impact on hard-working, loyal federal employees and their critical services that they provide to the American people.”The Massachusetts Democrat said the bill “threatens to further undermine the federal workforce by reducing the take-home pay, the benefits and workforce protections of 2.4 million federal employees, most of whom are middle-class Americans and a third of whom are military veterans.”Ohio’s Turner, who voted against the legislation because of the provision reducing pension benefits, said he supported the overall reconciliation package and hoped the pension measure would be stripped before a floor vote.Turner said “making changes to pension retirement benefits in the middle of someone’s employment is wrong.”",,,,2025-04-30 19:05:35.885634

(Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana lawmakers advanced sweeping nutrition legislation that would regulate purchases of sugary beverages with federal food assistance and limit what ingredients can be served in public school school lunches. 
Senate Bill 14 by Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, cleared the Louisiana Senate Committee of Health and Welfare on a party-line 4-3 vote, with Republicans prevailing.
McMath’s bill is part of a nationwide backlash against “ultra-processed foods,” food dyes, seed oils and certain chemicals in foods that U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has targeted for elimination. 
Kennedy is the central figure of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement. McMath said he is working with Kennedy on his bill. 
“I think, for the first time in a very long time, and perhaps maybe ever, Americans, Louisianians, are paying close attention to what our individual health outcomes are and our individual health outcomes for our children and our grandchildren,” McMath said. 
Democrats on the committee raised concerns that the legislature is not taking a holistic look at the factors causing poor health outcomes in Louisiana. 
“Louisiana has a lot of chemical industry in our state. Those plants produce a lot of carcinogens that’s in the air we breathe, and we tend to turn our backs sometimes and let those things go,” Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, said. “So we need to be more mindful and consider all of those things.” 
In an interview after the hearing, McMath said his bill is a starting point toward addressing larger issues in Louisiana. 
“The types of environments that we’re surrounded by can be pretty toxic,” McMath said. “And while I would love to wave a magic wand and clean up air and water and other things, I think the lowest hanging fruit … is we can start with the food that we’re that we’re putting in our body.” 
The original version of his legislation banned the purchase of soft drinks with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits but was amended to prohibit buying beverages with more than five grams of added sugar or any artificial sweetener. Drinks that include milk or milk substitutes would be exempt from this prohibition. 
Democrats also objected to this provision of the bill, saying it would further marginalize poor children who could be ostracized for not being able to afford lunchbox items their peers can. 
McMath’s SNAP restrictions are actually more limited than those in previous legislative proposals, which have included bans on chips and candy. McMath said he was aware many Louisianians live in food deserts, and he did not want to prevent people who might only be able to shop at convenience stores from eating. 
If McMath’s bill passes, the state would still have to receive permission from the federal government to limit SNAP benefits. 
Further amendments on the bill removed references to “ultra-processed” foods and instead listed ingredients prohibited in school lunches. They include food dyes that are common allergens and zero-calorie sweeteners such as sucralose, more commonly known as Splenda. 
The committee adopted amendments to allow food items with prohibited ingredients to be sold in vending machines and from concession stands at school events. 
The bill also requires food packages to include a warning that the contents “may be harmful to your health” if it includes certain ingredients. That list includes aspartame, a common zero-calorie sweetener. 
McMath’s legislation would also require restaurants to post notices when they use oils derived from the seeds of plants. 
Certain medical professionals would be required to take nutrition courses as part of their continuing education under the bill that heads next to the Senate floor.

Beth Bernstein, D-Columbia, talks about a bill that would double state employees' paid parental leave Wednesday, April 30, 2025. (Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — State employees in South Carolina who newly become parents could get twice as much paid leave under a bill the House passed this week.
The bipartisan bill sent to the Senate on Wednesday by a vote of 86-18 would give employees of K-12 schools, state agencies, and public colleges 12 weeks of paid leave after giving birth instead of six. Non-birthing parents, including fathers and adoptive parents, would qualify for four weeks instead of two.
With four working days left in the 2025 session and no movement on an identical bill in the Senate, passage this year is highly unlikely. But the bill remains alive for 2026. It does not need to be reintroduced.
The House passed an identical bill three years ago. But only half the time made it into law due to senators’ concerns about cost. Sponsors in both chambers celebrated passage while vowing to try again.
Six weeks is not enough, said Rep. Beth Bernstein, again the bill’s primary House sponsor.
Not only are the first weeks of a child’s life vital for parents to bond with their new child, but increasing the state’s leave to 12 weeks could make it more competitive in the job market, Bernstein said.
“Whether I’m the birthing parent or not, the bond you have with your child, particularly at birth, is something that is special and something that should be preserved,” the Columbia Democrat said.
Cost remained a concern for the bill’s opponents.
The cost for state agencies and school districts is unclear, since it will depend on how many employees use the leave and what job they’re performing. Some departments might need to offer incentives to other workers to take over for that worker while they’re gone or hire temporary workers, according to a financial analysis of the bill.
One particular point of contention was the cost to school districts, which would have to offer the same benefit to teachers and other full-time employees. That cost would also vary, since the cost of hiring a substitute teacher fluctuates based on their experience and location, according to the analysis.
Still, some legislators, especially in the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, questioned whether the bill could cause school districts to raise property taxes in an effort to recoup the costs of paying for the extra six weeks of leave.
“You’re voting to take more money away from people who don’t have benefits and give it to people who do have benefits,” said Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a Campobello Republican and vice-chairman of the Freedom Caucus.
Rep. Neal Collins pointed to his own school district as evidence more money’s not necessary.
Pickens County adopted a policy earlier this week providing 12 weeks of paid parental leave. The district estimates the cost at $115,000 per year, an amount that won’t require a tax increase, the Easley Republican said.
Magnuson, a father of two young children, also characterized the bill as government overreach in telling parents how long they could stay home. And he criticized the bill’s wording for referring to eligible employees as those who “give birth” versus a “co-parent” instead of mother and father.
“I don’t know about you, but I think that our government should acknowledge mothers and should acknowledge fathers,” said Magnuson, who’s also a charter member of the Family Caucus.
Bernstein called Magnuson’s arguments disingenuous, particularly considering he voted in favor of the House’s previous attempt to approve 12 weeks of paid leave.
Most legislators who voted against the bill are in the Freedom Caucus, which has some overlap with the Family Caucus.
They promote themselves as advocates for families yet voted against a bill that would keep families together longer, she said.
“For those of you in this chamber who talk about family and family preservation and the family bonding and vote against this bill, that does not make sense,” Bernstein said.
Those first weeks were vital for Rep. Travis Moore’s wife when she gave birth to the couple’s first child 15 years ago, the Roebuck Republican said.
“I think there are so many things that happen developmentally and relationally in those first few weeks and months,” Moore said.
To allow his wife to stay home longer, coworkers in the solicitor’s office where she worked donated some of their time off so she could spend more weeks at home with her baby, he said.
She wanted to stay home for 12 weeks, but the couple couldn’t afford that, Moore said.
“She really wanted to be home longer, but we weren’t in a position for her not to go to work,” Moore said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-30-at-5.04.38-PM-1024x519.png,,,2025-04-30 19:05:35.885634

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton has one priority if she is elected to the U.S. Senate in 2026: fighting back against President Donald Trump’s policies.
“What I'm just seeing is that the old playbook in Washington, D.C., isn't working,” Stratton said Wednesday in an interview with Capitol News Illinois. ""People aren't –[...]","Capitol News Illinois
SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton has one priority if she is elected to the U.S. Senate in 2026: fighting back against President Donald Trump’s policies.

“What I'm just seeing is that the old playbook in Washington, D.C., isn't working,” Stratton said Wednesday in an interview with Capitol News Illinois. ""People aren't – as I talk to working families across Illinois – they're not looking for people to just talk. They want to see real action, and that's exactly what we've done in our administration.”

Stratton, a Chicago Democrat, entered politics in 2016, inspired by being her mother’s primary caregiver as she battled Alzheimer’s disease. She defeated an incumbent Democratic state representative that year and was elected lieutenant governor two years later after Gov. JB Pritzker chose her as his running mate.

She quickly set her sights on Washington, D.C., when U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, a Springfield Democrat, announced April 24, that he won’t seek reelection in 2026.

“My struggle is the struggle of so many Illinoisans who may not be able to pay attention to every policy paper or every piece of legislation that is being pushed forward, but they just need to know that somebody is out there fighting,” Stratton said.

Over the last six years, Pritzker has sung his governing partner’s praises, crediting Stratton with being a leading voice on the administration’s top priorities. Pritzker typically gets the headlines, but Stratton said playing second in command still gives her a hefty record to present to voters when they ask what she has done to stand up to Trump.

“I will be able to turn and say Gov. Pritzker and I, working as a team, were able to lower the cost of groceries, we protected health care, we expanded your rights, and we made sure that we stood up for working families of Illinois,” Stratton said.

Raising Illinois’ minimum wage to $15 an hour was one of the first legislative accomplishments of Pritzker’s administration in 2019. But the federal minimum wage hasn’t increased beyond $7.25 since 2009.

“We raised the minimum wage,” Stratton said. “That has not happened on the federal level yet, and yet, people know that raising the minimum wage helps lift people up out of poverty.”

“Kitchen table issues” are voters’ top concern, Stratton said, citing economic uncertainty surrounding tariffs and potential cuts to social services.

While she’s made her name in state policymaking, a congressional run necessitates that Stratton weigh in on broader issues, such as foreign policy.

Stratton declined to discuss her position on Israel’s war with Hamas, and whether Israel should agree to a ceasefire with hostages still being held in Gaza.

“What people want, and need, is a stable leader in D.C.,” Stratton said. “Right now, with Donald Trump, we don't have that. We don't have someone who is focused on global issues overall and the impact.”

Blocking Trump’s agenda must be the first priority, Stratton said, to allow congressional Democrats to move forward on proposals that address voters’ concerns. She said she didn’t know yet what her first bill would be should she win the seat.

“I don't think anything's more important than making sure that government works for the people and that we are creating opportunity,” she said. “But how are we going to do any of those things if we don't stand up against somebody who's trying to strip away rights, fundamental freedoms, overlook the rule of law.”

Stratton remains the only high-profile candidate in either party as of Thursday that’s announced a run for Durbin’s seat. She has already secured endorsements from Pritzker and U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth before any other Democrats announce their candidacy.

Durbin acknowledged in a prior news conference that Stratton reached out to him before he announced his retirement to say she was interested in running for his seat.

“The conversations that we had, while I won't go into specifics, was just making sure that he understood what my plans were and how much I respect his leadership,” Stratton said.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)About 30 union leaders, workers, and advocates gathered on the State House steps Tuesday afternoon to hold a moment of silence to honor those who lost their lives on the job for Workers Memorial Day.
But before that moment of silence, labor leaders used a megaphone to speak out against workplace hazards, which Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley said, claim an average of 385 U.S. workers every day.


Rhode Island AFL-CIO priorities

Extreme temperature worker protections (S586 | H5305)
Ban on captive audience meetings (S126 | H5506)



“It’s not really great to have to think about how dangerous it is to work in America,” Crowley told the crowd. 
Union leaders want state leaders to strike now on a trio of bills they say will ensure more workers can be protected from physical dangers as well as anti-union messaging. Among those priorities: ending the exemption from the state’s indoor smoking ban at Rhode Island’s two casinos.
“We’ve known for decades that smoking kills,” Crowley said. “That’s why it’s important that we pass legislation to ban smoking in these casinos.”
Matt Dunham, president of Table Game Dealers Laborers Local 711, said the local’s 600 workers have to endure second-hand smoke every time they enter Bally’s Lincoln and Tiverton facilities.
“They’re tired of going to work each day wondering if they’re putting their future health on the line to put food on the table tonight,” Dunham said.
Workers have made the push to end Bally’s exemption for years, only to be stalled at the committee level. But that changed after House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi allowed a symbolic committee vote to advance the proposal at the end of the 2024 legislative session. 
Shekarchi is now one of the 10 cosponsors listed on the latest edition of the bill to end the exemption the casinos have from the state’s indoor smoking ban. The bill is sponsored by Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat and has the backing of 55 of the chamber’s 75 members. The House Committee on Finance held an initial hearing on Tanzi’s bill on April 10, when it was held for further study — as is standard practice for a first look by a legislative panel.
In the Senate, however, passage of a smoking ban has faced repeated roadlocks.
The late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio had been a staunch opponent of such legislation, citing concerns it could decrease revenue. The chamber’s new majority leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, has expressed the same concern.
But newly-elected Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, said she personally supports the measure, chamber spokesperson Greg Paré confirmed in an email Wednesday.
“But it is also her understanding that the parties are working together towards a resolution that would not require legislation,” Paré said in an email. “At the same time, the legislation will undergo the normal, public committee review process.”
Legislation introduced Feb. 7 by Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski, a South Kingstown Democrat, has yet to be scheduled for a hearing before the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming.

Can’t stand the heat? Fix the kitchens
Union leaders believe the state also needs to act on companion bills that would establish standards for working in extreme heat and cold.
Katarina Ezikovich, an organizer with SEIU 1199NE, knows firsthand the dangers workers face during extreme heat. A lab technician at Women & Infants Hospital, she recalled how the hospital’s HVAC system failed over the winter.
The kitchen staff felt the impact first.
“People were as red as the potatoes they roasted. They sweated more than the onions. Haute cuisine had nothing on the flambé that our employees were becoming,” Ezikovich said. “The puns here might be funny, but what wasn’t funny was our employer’s response.”
Ezikovich claimed hospital administrators advised workers to drink Gatorade and take extra breaks. Care New England spokesperson Raina Smith said the hospital network is aware of the concerns raised by union workers and that a temporary HVAC solution has been in place since mid-February. 
“We remain committed to transparency and to upholding the highest standards of safety, quality, and respect for every member of our hospital community,” she said in an emailed statement.
But Ezikovich said the hospital has not fixed the problem and that their bosses’ solutions have been nothing more than “a Band-Aid on a gaping, gushing wound.”
“You can only take so many breaks before returning to a hellfire work site,” she said.
Union leaders believe such issues can be mitigated under companion bills by Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat, and Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat. Their legislation would require employers to provide workers with adequate heating and cooling equipment, access to paid rest breaks, along with training to recognize and mitigate heat and cold-related risks.
Morales’ bill received its initial committee hearing Feb. 12, while DiPalma’s bill had its first review by a Senate panel on March 12. Both bills were held for further study.

No more mandatory meetings
Rhode Island labor leaders are also targeting an end to so-called “captive audience meetings” — mandatory employer gatherings where workers are required to hear company views on religion, politics, or unions.
Such meetings are allegedly used by employers to convince their workers that they’d be better off without a union, said Teamsters Local 251 organizer Patrick Leonard.
“They’ll pull workers on the shop floor into a conference room, close the door behind them, outnumber them with management and tell them this is a voluntary meeting.” he told the crowd.
A growing number of states have begun to ban such meetings, including Connecticut in 2022. Captive audience meetings were deemed unlawful by the National Labor Relations Board in November 2024.
Rhode Island’s Senate has already passed such legislation earlier in April. The bill sponsored by Sen. Matthew LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat, would prohibit employers from punishing or firing workers who choose not to attend meetings or read messages where the company shares its views on religion or politics.
Workers who believe they were unfairly disciplined or fired would be allowed to sue their employer to get their job back, receive financial compensation, and have their legal fees covered.
Leonard said codifying such protections would give workers reassurance that they can hold onto their own beliefs without risk of being fired.
LaMountain’s bill is before the House where companion legislation by Rep. Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, was held for further study by the chamber’s Committee on Labor on April 2.

(Sophie Nieto-Muñoz | New Jersey Monitor)











With a potential rail workers strike threatening to shut down train service to New York City in mid-May, NJ Transit officials are urging tens of thousands of workers to consider working from home.
Kris Kolluri, the transit agency’s new CEO and president, said Wednesday that if the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, the union that represents rail engineers, opts to strike and halt service, “the responsibility and the blame will be squarely on them.”
The agency presented a contingency plan that would begin May 19 to help people who can’t work from home get to their jobs by bus from four key regional park-and-ride lots. But the bus plan will only accommodate about a fifth of the commuters who use trains daily, Kolluri said.
“I’ve said this very clearly. Each train carries a thousand people on average. Each bus can carry a hundred people if it’s an articulated bus,” he said. “That’s why I want to be crystal clear here. This is not a replacement of our rail system. This is a plan to mitigate so essential workers can get to work in New York and other places in a safe and efficient manner.”
The contingency plan will cost $4 million daily, he added.
“We are in a very, very challenging time. We may be facing a recession in the not-too-distant future. Tariffs are going to have an impact on what we’re doing when we purchase buses, our ability to run trains,” he said. “This is not the time to take an agency which is finally standing up on its feet and take a two-by-four to it.”















				Expanded outbound and inbound Park & Ride Service if rail service halts (weekdays only)

Secaucus Junction to Port Authority Bus Terminal, New York
PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel to Port Authority Bus Terminal, New York
Hamilton Rail Station to Newark Penn Station PATH
Woodbridge Center Mall to Harrison PATH Station




The warning to commuters comes after tense negotiations. In March, it seemed like the two parties reached a deal before it fell apart. Two weeks ago, train engineers overwhelmingly rejected the last contract offer from NJ Transit, beginning a 30-day countdown to a strike. Kolluri said the agency and the union resumed negotiations Wednesday morning but remain at odds over the proposed salary increase. 
Under the union’s proposed contract, fares would rise 17%, and the corporate transit fee — which helps fund NJ Transit’s budget — would climb 27%, Kolluri said. He estimated it would cost $1.4 billion. 
An engineer, on average, earns about $135,000 annually, including overtime, and the agency offered a new contract with an average salary of $172,000, he said.
But not all engineers make overtime, workers are leaving in droves to make more on other commuter rail lines, and the price tag Kolluri cited is “drastically” overstated, said Tom Haas, general chairman of the 430-member union. 
“Engineers are leaving NJT, stepping across the platform to positions at other railroads with wages 20% or more higher, doing the same work in the same place. BLET engineers want to keep providing the professionalism and service they’re known for,” Haas said. “They’re counting on NJT to recognize the economic reality their engineers face and bring a fair deal to the table with equal pay for equal work.”
Kolluri didn’t sound hopeful about averting a strike, adding it’s something the union is “seemingly hell-bent on seeing through. It doesn’t have to be this way.”
He urged commuters to keep up to date on strike news, as they decide whether to buy daily tickets or monthly passes, which will be cross-honored at park-and-rides. Commuters can find signs, at stations across the state, with QR codes that lead to information on the strike and expanded bus service.

Darryl Rouson . (Screenshot/Florida Channel)A Florida House amendment that killed plans for a substance abuse and mental health research center at the University of South Florida to be named after Tampa Bay Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson infuriated both Democratic and Republican senators Wednesday.
Even Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier used the episode to launch another attack on the House.
The legislation (SB 1620), which has passed both chambers in some form now, would make a raft of changes to Florida’s Mental Health Act. The original bill included a Center for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Research at USF’s Louis de la Parte Florida Mental Health Institute.
The center would have conducted statewide behavioral health research, promote evidence-based practices, and improved workforce development. An amendment added by Pinellas County Republican Ed Hooper would have named the facility the “Rouson Center,” after Rouson, who has battled drug and alcohol addiction in his past and had sponsored the measure in the Senate.
However, an amendment sponsored by Broward County Democrat Christine Hunschofsky and passed by the House on Tuesday deleted the facility — Rouson’s name and all.
So when the bill came back to the Senate on Wednesday, Rouson told his colleagues that while he was disappointed about that development, they should still go ahead and pass the measure.
‘The establishment of this center means a great deal to those who believe in advancing mental health care with evidence-based compassion,” Rouson told his colleagues. “Unfortunately, the House didn’t see it our way, and for me, it is more important that the work continue, that the work of the commission be honored.”
He referred to the Florida Commission on Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder.
Some senators said that out of respect to Rouson they would still vote for the bill. But others insisted they would not.
“It’s not right, it’s not fair, it’s not appropriate, and it really isn’t acceptable,” Tampa Bay-area Republican Jim Boyd said. “I promise you we will make this right.”
“I’m just glad that in a year-and-a-half we’ll have another speaker who will hopefully support the naming of the program after you,” Naples GOP Sen. Kathleen Passidomo said, referring to House Speaker Daniel Perez.
GOP Sens. Jay Collins and Blaise Ingoglia both called the House move “a travesty.”
“I am angry beyond words,” said Ingoglia.
“It hurts. It hurts because I’m somebody in recovery,” said Democratic Sen. Rosalind Osgood, who said she would oppose the measure.
Countdown
The dispute took place just two days before the 60-day legislative session was scheduled to end, but, with the sides still divided on a budget and tax reductions, the session will have to be extended or the Legislature come back before the budget would take effect on July 1
Shortly after the vote, Gov. DeSantis, who has been battling the House for the past month on various issues, including taxes, weighed in, responding on X, “The Florida House of Pettiness in all its glory…”
“Senator @darrylrouson is a class act,” added Attorney General James Uthmeier on X.
The budget fight involves Perez’s insistence on lowering the sales tax to the tune of around $5 billion. Senate President Ben Albritton is worried about what happens if a recession hits.
According to the original legislation, the purpose of the center was to conduct “rigorous and relevant research intended to develop knowledge and practice in prevention and intervention for substance abuse and mental health issues, to serve the people and economy in this state in reducing the gap between population needs and the availability of effective treatments and other interventions to improve the capacity of the state to have healthy, resilient communities prevailing over substance abuse, addiction, and mental health challenges.”
The Senate opted to temporarily postpone action on the legislation. They have just two days to decide on whether they want to approve it.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana cabinet members, lawmakers, lobbyists and more gathered Wednesday to celebrate Gov. Mike Braun’s first 100 days in office — but the man of the hour had tough words for his second-in-command, critics of his marquee legislative accomplishments and the health care industry.
Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith enraged civil rights activists and historians alike last Thursday when he dubbed the U.S. Constitution’s Three-Fifths Compromise “a great move” toward ending slavery.

Braun didn’t publicly weigh in for a nearly a week.
“I definitely wouldn’t have used that characterization, and I don’t like it,” he told reporters Wednesday.
“I’m a believer that you better start thinking about what you’re saying before it comes out,” he continued. “… And I think that you don’t want to make headlines the wrong way, because it takes away from the substance of what you’re trying to do.”
Braun also defended the local property and income tax plan that lawmakers pushed past the finish line this month amid outcry from hard-hit units of local government and dissatisfied homeowners.
“By far the biggest thing I heard about: we went from one version to a different version, and then the meat grinder of legislation took over,” he told attendees. “And look at the product that we turned out. … You’re pissing off people on each end of the spectrum and most in between say that it was a solid package.”
In comments to reporters, Braun envisioned further cuts to homestead property tax bills, done gradually “to where other sources of income can be used.” But he warned school districts and local governments that he wouldn’t allow their revenues to grow faster than the economy.
Former President Joe Biden got a knock as Braun said a grim revenue forecast forced lawmakers to cut $2 billion in spending out of the state’s next two-year, now-$44 billion budget in the space of a week.
“When it comes to what we really cut, nothing got hammered, and the most important stuff stayed intact,” he declared.
Most state agencies, along with public colleges and universities, were dealt 5% funding cuts. Lawmakers also squeezed eligibility requirements for the state’s pre-kindergarten program and subsidized child care.

But a two-year-old program to supplement local public health departments took a 60% cut, with funding falling from $100 million each year to $40 million. Legislative leaders argued that nearly half the funds disbursed last year hadn’t yet been spent.
“Don’t ever mistake that you got to have more money to do things better with. That’s called anti-productivity,” Braun replied, when asked about the public health funding cut. “When you come up with better ideas, you may need more money to invest, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but in most cases, when it comes to government, you’ve got plenty of money. You’ve just got to learn how to spend it better.”
But he didn’t rule out funding boosts in the future.
“Don’t mistake the short-run — where you get whipsawed — with what you want to do in the mid-term and the long-term,” Braun said. “So that means we may be pouring more resources into it, if we can get a good (return on investment).”
He had big hopes for the interim and legislative sessions to come, repeatedly noting how taking office days after the session’s start hampered his efforts to shape proposals. His first 100 days overlapped entirely with the breakneck budget-writing session, ending just over a day before both chambers of the Indiana General Assembly adjourned sine die.
Braun reiterated his desire to tackle high health care costs as his top priority now that session is over. In both his speech and comments to reporters, he asked players in the health care industry for solutions while threatening punishment for stasis.
“That and more will be brought to bear if, in fact, they’re not lowering their prices and giving us better outcomes,” Braun said.

Patrick Morrisey on Wednesday signed into law a bill that, if things go the way he and other legislators hope, is meant to encourage data centers to locate in West Virginia and generate their own power sources through microgrids.
House Bill 2014 — dubbed the Power Generation and Consumption Act — was one of the more complicated bills to make it through the 2025 regular session. It was a late edition to Morrisey’s legislative agenda, being introduced on March 18 — more than halfway through the 60-day session.
The bill was subject to dozens of amendments as it made its way through both the House and Senate, including changes to how taxes collected on data centers would be distributed, policies regarding how microgrids would operate and requirements for those microgrids, as well as other utilities. The bill initially passed the House on April 1. After more changes in the Senate, lawmakers there approved their own version on April 11.
On the final night of session, the two chambers did find compromise on an even different version of the bill, with the House passing the amended version 82-16 with two members absent and not voting. The Senate concurred with the House’s changes to the legislation and voted yet again to pass the legislation, sending it to Morrisey’s desk for signage.
Those who voted against HB 2014 in both chambers shared concerns over the potential for electric rate increases if the bill were to pass. They also voiced discontent with measures that removed local control and enforcement of certain regulations for counties and municipalities where data centers could be built.
The version of the bill that now stands as law is aimed at recruiting the establishment of data centers in West Virginia. It allows any data centers that do locate here to curtail local zoning ordinances and other regulatory processes and establishes a certified microgrid program, which means data centers can produce and use their own power without attaching to already existing utilities.
The law also creates a specialized tax structure for data centers and microgrids, which must be placed in designated districts. Local governments have little say or control over those districts, which are established at the state level.
Taxes collected on any data centers and microgrids operating in West Virginia would be split as so: 50% will go to the personal income tax reduction fund, 30% will go to the county where the data center is located, 10% will go to the remaining 54 counties split on a per capita basis using the most recent U.S. Census, 5% will be placed in the Economic Enhancement Grant Fund administered by the Water Development Authority and the final 5% will be put in the newly created Electric Grid Stabilization and Security Fund.
That fund is meant to help existing utilities develop and maintain infrastructure for continued generation and transmission of coal-fired and natural gas-fueled power.
Morrisey signed the bill in Point Pleasant on Wednesday, right outside the future site of the Fidelis Monarch AI Data Center Campus.
“In order for West Virginia to reach its potential, we must continue to focus on economic development and utilizing our many natural resources,” Morrisey said. “The Power Generation and Consumption Act will make West Virginia the most attractive state in the country for data centers and help America better compete with China in the technology arms race of the future.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Patrick-Morrisey-20250430-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 18:08:27.318360

He owns the nursing home with Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, among others. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)One of Louisiana’s most powerful legislators and his colleague are co-owners of a nursing home that faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of a former resident.
The case against their facility is playing out as both lawmakers and the rest of the Louisiana Legislature consider controversial legislation to undercut similar legal challenges. 
Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, and Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, are part of a 10-person ownership group for the Acadia St. Landry Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Church Point. Hensgens is also the administrator of the nursing home. Two other members of his family are also part of the ownership group, according to state business records. 
The children of Cynthia Stewart filed a lawsuit and medical malpractice claim against Hensgens and Henry’s nursing home in April 2024, less than two months after Stewart died at age 74. She had spent almost 15 months as a resident at Acadia St. Landry when she developed a severe bed sore at the base of her spine in November 2023, according to the lawsuit her family filed in Louisiana’s 8th Judicial District Court in Winn Parish.
The amount of damages the Stewart family is seeking is not listed in court documents. 
Senate Bill 134 by Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, seeks to reduce the liability from wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits for dozens of Louisiana nursing homes – from potentially millions of dollars per institution to just $100,000. 
Henry and Hensgens say the legislation wouldn’t affect Acadia St. Landry because it has a different organizational structure than the facilities the bill is meant to shield. 

“We don’t have a management company, and that bill is exclusive for management companies,” Hensgens said  Tuesday in an interview. 

“There is no management company associated with Acadia St. Landry,” Henry said Tuesday in response to a question about the legislation. “The bill deals with management companies.” 

While Hensgens and Henry say the legislation won’t protect their business, nursing home lobbyists suggested in public testimony last week that the attorneys who filed the lawsuit against Acadia St. Landry are targets of the bill.

Garcia & Artigliere, which describes itself as a “nursing home neglect and abuse” law firm with offices in California, Arizona, Kentucky and Louisiana. It has 66 lawsuits pending against facilities in Louisiana, including Acadia St. Landry. 

The Louisiana Nursing Home Association claims the litigation threatens to put their industry out of business. 

“We’re going to have those health care facilities turning in their keys because they can’t do business in this state anymore” if these lawsuits continue, Wes Hattaway, policy director for the nursing home association, said at a legislative hearing last week. 
Also pushing the bill to protect nursing homes is Teddy Ray Price, part of the Acadia St. Landry ownership group with Henry and Hensgens. 

Price, who is also president of the Louisiana Nursing Home Association, and his family own two dozen nursing homes in Louisiana and a nursing home management company. Garcia & Artigliere has sued five of his facilities and Central Management Co., the nursing home management business he owns. 
Price could not be reached at his office or on his personal cellphone this week.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

‘You got to turn your mother’

According to the lawsuit, Stewart’s wound was only discovered when she was transferred from Acadia St. Landry to Maison de Lafayette Nursing Home. But by that time, it had grown so severe that her bone was exposed and she had contracted sepsis. She then had to be immediately moved to a hospital for treatment, according to the lawsuit. 

The family alleges the wound developed because Acadia St. Landry failed to provide proper medical supervision to Stewart while she was a resident. Her survivors claim Central Management Co. intentionally understaffed the nursing home to turn a higher profit. 

Acadia St. Landry ranks poorly, with only one out of five stars, on the widely accepted rating scale the federal Medicare program uses. A one-star rating describes a “much below average” facility, according to the Medicare website. The ratings are calculated based on the results of health inspections, staffing and other quality control measures government inspectors conduct. 

Registered nurses at Acadia St. Landry spent an average of nine minutes with each patient per day, compared with the national average of 40 minutes and a Louisiana average of 18 minutes, according to the federal data. 

The facility’s patient time with licensed professional nurses and licensed vocational nurses – who require less training and are paid far less than registered nurses – was higher than the national and state averages.

Geoffrey Stewart, Cynthia Stewart’s son, expanded on accusations in the lawsuit at a legislative committee hearing last week, though he didn’t identify the nursing home by name. He also didn’t mention that lawmakers own the facility. 
“The question that I have for you is: How difficult is it to turn a patient every two hours? Apparently, it’s really hard,” Stewart told legislators. “So hard that whenever I visited, I had to go search for employees to come and turn my mother. I had to bring cash with me every time I went to give money to [staff members to] come and turn my mother.”
“I was there. I went to that place. I visited her, knowing the fear that she was in. I went,” Stewart said. “But the message here tonight is, you can’t just go. You got to pull back sheets. You got to turn your mother.”
Henry declined to respond to the specifics of the Stewart case because of the pending litigation but said Acadia St. Landry meets state and federal staffing requirements. 
Lawsuit and legislation limits
Henry and Hensgens also insist that even though Price’s Central Management Co. is named in the Stewart lawsuit, it is not working with or for Acadia St. Landry.

The distinction over whether Central Management Co. or another management company has a hand in operations in Acadia St. Landry could be essential to the outcome of the lawsuit they face. 

Nursing homes are, in general, protected from large jury awards by Louisiana’s medical malpractice act, which caps damages against health care providers for unintentional injury at $500,000. 

Of that $500,000, a nursing home found to be negligent pays no more than $100,000. The rest of the money comes from a state pool fund that several types of health care providers contribute to for covering such claims.

Over the past year, Garcia & Artigliere has circumvented that cap by arguing that nursing home management companies like Central Management aren’t health care providers and shouldn’t be subjected to the medical malpractice law. Instead, they should be considered administrators that can be held responsible for larger jury awards.

Garcia & Artigliere have been successful in two such cases against Louisiana nursing homes so far. Its clients have received a $3.5 million verdict against Chateau St. James Rehab and Retirement in Lutcher and $2.1 million from Heritage Manor West in Shreveport. 
The purpose of Senate Bill 134 is to shut down this legal route to larger awards. Hattaway, with Louisiana Nursing Home Association, and others argue the state’s medical malpractice act was always meant to cover these types of negligence cases. The legislation would bring management companies for health care providers, including nursing homes and hospitals, under that legal cap. 
But if Acadia St. Landry is not using a management company, Hensgens said the medical malpractice law applies to their lawsuit whether the Pressly bill passes or not.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 

Big politics

Louisiana nursing home owners, some of the largest donor to candidates for the legislature and governor every election cycle, is the main supporter of the legislation. Price, as president of that powerful organization, attended last week’s hearing on Pressly’s bill in person but didn’t speak publicly. 
One of the few people who did testify in favor of the proposal was Troy Broussard, an attorney representing Hensgens, Henry, Price and other owners of Acadia St. Landry. 
Matt Coman, a New Orleans-based attorney with Garcia & Artigliere who represents the Stewart family, provided testimony in opposition to the legislation. 
AARP Louisiana, the state’s largest advocacy organization for seniors, also opposes the bill, saying it would put more elderly people at risk for abuse. 
“We’ve always maintained that our legislators should put their constituents ahead of any financial interests related to the outcome of the bill,” Andrew Muhl, AARP’s state director of advocacy, said in a statement this week. 

“If the supporters of this bill are successful, it means there will be a complete lack of due process for abuse and neglect due to perpetually poor and unsafe levels of basic care for our most vulnerable seniors,” Muhl said.

The committee sided overwhelmingly with the nursing home industry. Hensgens, as a committee member, voted with the 6-1 majority to move the legislation to the Senate floor. 

Neither Hensgens nor Henry had been part of a nursing home ownership group until 2022, when they bought Acadia St. Landry with Price and others. At the time, Henry was not in legislative leadership. Hensgens, who has worked in the nursing home industry for three decades, said he and his brother were responsible for putting together the buyers’ group. 

“My younger brother ran it for about 15 years for previous owners, and the gentleman got to be 85 years old. No one in the family wanted it, so he came to us and said, ‘Would you like to buy it?’” Hensgens said. “And we put together the investment group so we could afford it.” 
Nursing homes in Louisiana aren’t sold frequently, and there is state prohibition on any new homes opening.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Legislature-open-1772-1024x954.jpg,,,2025-04-30 18:08:27.318360

The legislation approved on a 4-2 party line vote would repeal the reproductive rights amendment known as Amendment 3 but allow exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation. 
If approved in the Senate, the proposal would be on a statewide ballot in November 2026. It could also be placed before voters earlier by Gov. Mike Kehoe.
With time growing short in this year’s session — lawmakers will have two weeks to complete their work after they adjourn Thursday — the Senate Families, Seniors and Health Committee held a public hearing and voted on the bill on the same day.
About 150 people packed the committee room to show support and opposition to the proposal sponsored by state Rep. Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican. 
For the most ardent abortion opponents, the measure is a test of Republican fidelity to their cause.
“There is confidence, with a supermajority of Republicans at the helm, that those people who are pro-life at home know the representatives and senators in this building are going to do the right thing and bring this back to the vote of the people,” said Susan Klein, executive director of Missouri Right to Life.
Opponents again said the proposal seeks to overturn the will of Missouri voters.
“Stripping away people’s rights to their own god-given conscience in the face of some of the most intimate and tender decisions of their lives is an affront to our humanity and to god,” the Rev. Molly Housh Gordon of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Columbia said.
House Republicans spent the first three months of the session groping for a proposal that represented a consensus in their ranks. The proposal heard Wednesday passed out of the House earlier this month with only one Republican — House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit — in opposition. 
The measure would reinstate the almost total ban on abortions that was in place in Missouri from June 2022 until the passage of Amendment 3.
Patterson at a press conference following the mid-April vote said he had concerns with the limited exceptions allowed in the proposal..
“A debate that we should have — and I hope happens in the Senate — is 12 weeks long enough,” Patterson, a physician, said during the press conference. “ … If you’re going to say it’s OK to (have an abortion) after you’ve been raped, now we’re talking time limits.” 
But no changes were made to the proposal on Wednesday. 
Nonprofit sues to overturn Missouri’s parental consent laws for minors seeking abortions

State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Democrat from Kansas City, asked Seitz why he picked 12 weeks, noting that sexual violence is among the most under-reported crimes. 
Seitz said 12 weeks was chosen because it marks the end of the first trimester. 
In 2020, more than 93% of all abortions in the United States were performed prior to 13 weeks gestation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Crime data shows that  two out of every three sexual assaults are not reported to police, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In a research letter published in JAMA Internal Medicine, one group of researchers estimated that since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, more than 65,500 women and girls in the 14 states with abortion bans in place became pregnant after being raped.
Seitz has not made clear if or how survivors would have to prove the crime occurred in order to obtain an abortion. 
On Wednesday he said a reporting requirement was not necessary because state law already requires sexual crimes to be reported by physicians, for example. Under Missouri statute, some professions including health care workers are required to report suspicion of rape or incest to police, but only if the victim is under 18 years old. Physicians are not required to report sexual violence against adults.
“It’s also giving an incentive for those who know that a woman or girl has been sexually assaulted to get her to a rape crisis center, to get her to a counselor, to get her to a physician or nurse early enough in pregnancy so that she can make the decision that she needs to make,” longtime anti-abortion advocate and lobbyist Sam Lee said, testifying in support of the legislation.
The ballot language that would appear before voters does not explicitly say the amendment would ban abortions.
Instead, Missourians would be asked if they want to amend the Missouri constitution to: 

“Guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages; 
Ensure women’s safety during abortions; 
Ensure parental consent for minors; 
Allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest; 
Require physicians to provide medically accurate information; and 
Protect children from gender transition?”

 Health care workers weigh in

Much of Wednesday’s opposition testimony Wednesday delved into details of health issues that women face during a difficult pregnancy.
Dr. Christine Jackson, an OBGYN in St. Louis, testified in opposition to the legislation, detailing the experience of one of her patients who learned she was pregnant after she was admitted to the ICU with diabetes complications. 
“When I met her, she was grappling not only with her acute illness, but hundreds of questions,” Jackson said. 
The issues the woman faced ranged from child care to her son at home to managing her diabetes while pregnant and the potential for serious complications. 
Jackson said the patient was too sick to go to an outpatient procedure facility for the abortion, and that she also didn’t meet the criteria for a medical emergency under Missouri’s abortion ban at the time. Jackson said the patient was also too sick to go to an outpatient procedure facility for the abortion. 
The woman ultimately traveled to a Chicago hospital to obtain an abortion. 
“She traveled five hours away from her child, away from her partner, away from her home to receive care that we could have safely provided down the hall but was illegal at the time,” Jackson said.
Anti-abortion lawmakers and advocates have for several months argued Amendment 3 eliminated women’s ability to sue providers if something went wrong during an abortion. Attorneys behind the abortion-rights amendment have said this is false. 
Asked about this, Jackson said under Amendment 3, providers must still meet professional licensing requirements through the Missouri Board of Healing Arts. She is also still required to carry medical malpractice insurance.
After Amendment 3 passed, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state, challenging several of Missouri’s laws focused on abortion facilities and providers. The proposed ban, if passed, would reinstate several of these targeted regulations on abortion providers, or TRAP laws, that were recently struck down as unconstitutional by a Missouri judge.
Amy DeClue, a surgical nurse from Franklin County, testified in support of the legislation, recounting stories of a few women she cared for in the hospital after they underwent abortions. 
“One in particular I’ll never forget because when she showed up, you could tell she was just mentally drained. She was alone, she was afraid, and she was just very sad,” DeClue said. “She couldn’t quit bleeding and they had left products of conception in her.” 
 ‘A culture of life’

Among those testifying against the legislation were women who sought out abortions decades ago in Missouri, when the procedure remained much more accessible, and pastors who said they speak often with congregants about the intersection of faith and health care. 
The Rev. Teresa Danieley, a priest in the Episcopal Church, said she disagreed with Seitz’s assertions that Missouri has a culture of life, noting the lack of mandatory paid parental leave, the state’s ongoing child care crisis and the current attempt by lawmakers to overturn the state’s voter-approved paid sick leave law. 
Danieley, who wore a button that read “Jesus never shamed a woman,” said she has helped counsel many religious women about their abortions. 
“Over and over again I hear these deeply religious women ask, ‘can God forgive me? Am I going to hell?’” she said. “I try to ground them in that they made the best decision they could given that there is no culture of life in this state or in this country.” 

The committee adjourned less than two hours into testimony. Of the people crowded into the hearing room and hallway, only six were there to speak in support of the legislation. State Sen. Patty, a Kansas City Democrat, noted that after her GOP colleagues again said that Missourians only approved Amendment 3 because they didn’t understand what they were voting on. 
“Missouri Right to Life represents hundreds of thousands of people across Missouri,” Klein said.  
“Where are they?” Lewis asked.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.

In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
‘It’s the system that needs fixing’
Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version focused on the science of reading passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed a similar bill into law Monday to outlaw three-cueing.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”

Sen. Kemp’s bill requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
Opposition to ‘science of reading’
Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.



A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute


In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

A federal judge in San Francisco and another in Massachusetts have since ruled that those already in the U.S. could keep their protections for now. Alerts this month on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website state that Homeland Security “has every intention of ending Venezuela (temporary protected status) as soon as it obtains relief from the court order” and “No new requests for (Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela) parole will be processed.”A hundred days into the Trump administration, the efforts amplify the president’s first-day promise to crack down on an “invasion” of migrants, based allegedly on the high numbers of asylum seekers arriving at the border. A previous order froze federal funding for refugee support affecting local relocation agency efforts.“These actions by the Trump administration signal to Vermonters and Americans that this country is no longer a nation of immigrants,” said Molly Gray, executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, a Burlington-based nonprofit that supports Afghans who are resettling in the state.In Vermont, the orders affect dozens of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans and more than 100 Ukrainians who are “very concerned that they could lose parole, be denied the opportunity to renew parole, or have their (temporary protected status) reversed,” said Matt Thompson, a program manager for refugee services with the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants in Vermont, a nongovernmental, not-for-profit international organization that helps resettle refugees and advocates for their rights.While Thompson does not know of any Afghan residents affected by the latest order, the committee and its legal services partners have been working to ensure that Afghans in Vermont pursue other options for remaining in the U.S., he said, such as the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa or asylum.The effort to revoke protections launched by former President Joe Biden is problematic not just from a humanitarian standpoint but from an economic one, said refugee relocation workers.“These individuals have worked here, attend church — which for some is so important — and learn English. They want to work hard, do a good job and continue to contribute to the community,” said Yvonne Lodico, executive director of the Grace Initiative Global, a nonprofit based in Manchester that provides services to several refugee groups including Haitians and Afghans living in Vermont.The organization often fields calls from employers looking to hire newcomers, “and we have to decline,” she said. “Vermont companies, especially those in service industries, need these individuals.”The federal orders have caused anxiety and bewilderment among the refugee communities, Lodico said, particularly because they arrived through legal mechanisms after intense vetting.“They anticipated that through application for legal documentation they would be able to live and work here,” she said.Dolan said refugees have long contributed to the state economy. “I can’t speak for every person but in general all these populations are working,” she said.Ending temporary protected status for Afghans is particularly crushing for Afghan allies who have sought protection in the U.S. while the security situation continues to deteriorate in their home country under the Taliban, said Gray, from the Afghan Alliance.“They were made refugees because of their association with the United States government and support for U.S. military and diplomatic missions. It is these circumstances that make the revocation of (temporary protected status) that much more shameful, horrific and unconscionable,” she said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘Shameful, horrific and unconscionable’: Federal efforts to revoke legal refugee status could affect hundreds in Vermont, advocates say.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/afghans-2-20240812.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 18:08:27.318360

There’s a lot of concern from different advocacy and service groups at the moment as Republicans in Congress have floated proposals for cutting hundreds of billions of dollars to Medicaid which funds services and care for individuals who have low incomes or disabilities.
Medicaid is not a line item easily crossed out without grave repercussions, Smith said. Medicaid often means the difference between a mother going to a postpartum check-up appointment to determine if she needs medical attention, or not going to that check-up appointment, Smith said, adding that those appointments provide access to prenatal vitamins, lactation support and birth in a hospital.
“For Black and brown moms who are already navigating higher risk and barriers, Medicaid often makes the difference between life and death, and that’s not hyperbole. That’s reality,” Smith said.

National data reflects that Black women are more than twice as likely to die from pregancy-related causes than their white counterparts and Michigan state data reflects the same reality where Black mothers were nearly three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as white mothers.
In order to comply with the spending plans and priorities of President Donald Trump’s administration, the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, which regulates Medicaid amongst other governernment programs, is currently looking at how to save $880 billion, with Medicaid on the chopping block.
For the last decade, typically more than 40% of births in Michigan have been funded, at least in-part, through Medicaid programs, according to reporting from the Michigan League for Public Policy.
Medicaid provides care to those most vulnerable in Michigan, who might not have access to quality housing, nutrition or prenatal or postnatal educational resources, Smith said.

“So when that funding is cut, we’re not pulling access, we’re pulling care from the very families that need it most. We’re making it harder to close the gap and easier for preventable tragedies to continue,” Smith said. “I’m asking you to stay loud, call your lawmakers, share your stories and fight for your families, because every parent deserves to be helped. Every child deserves to be born into a system that’s ready to care for them, not cut them loose.”

As the approximately 100 attendees headed off to seek out state lawmakers to urge preservation of Medicaid-funded services, Aisha Wells, deputy director of organizing for Mothering Justice, which sponsored the rally, told the Michigan Advance that she hopes state lawmakers in the predominately white Legislature remember their districts all have moms and people of color and residents who rely on Medicaid.
As the mother of a teenage son and baby boy, Wells said she remembers not being listened to as a Black woman during her first pregnancy, dealing with doctors who shut down her concerns, but later determined her oldest son had obstructive congenital hydrocephalus which impacts the brain.
And though mothers of color in the Michigan state Legislature like Sen. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor) and Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) are leading the charge in combating adverse health outcomes for moms of color, Wells said, all lawmakers should be fighting to preserve health care for families in their district.
“Everybody in your community is important. They matter. If one of us is being harmed, we’re all being harmed,” Wells said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-30 21:40:37+00:00,CT Mirror,CT headed for second-largest surplus in state history,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/30/ct-surplus-windfall/,"CT is headed for its second-largest surplus ever, but it's unclear if officials will tap the $2.3 billion windfall to cover federal aid cuts.","Surging income and business tax receipts will leave Connecticut with its second-largest surplus in state history, analysts reported Wednesday, even as officials remained divided whether to use any of the $2.3 billion windfall to mitigate big cuts in federal aid.
And while the consensus revenue report from Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration and the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis showed a modest softening of revenues in the future, analysts still anticipate Connecticut will save an average of almost $1.3 billion in each of the next two fiscal years.
“Connecticut’s current fiscal year outlook remains positive,” Lamont said Wednesday, before quickly adding, “there are troubling signs” for the near future.
Despite the latest surge, the sales tax — Connecticut’s second-largest revenue engine after the income tax — is beginning to sputter. Analysts had expected the sales tax, which will produce $5.1 billion this fiscal year, to generate $127 million more in 2025-26, and $256 million more by 2026-27. Now they say there will be no growth next fiscal year, and only $127 million more two years from now.
Similarly, the corporation tax was expected to generate $1.56 billion this fiscal year for the state and then climb to almost $1.6 billion by 2026-27. Now analysts have downgraded expectations for this fiscal year’s receipts by $85 million, and that level largely will remain flat for the next two years.
“The economic policies coming out of Washington are directly impacting our state’s economic future, as evidenced by leading indicators such as consumer confidence,” the governor added. “Over the coming weeks, I will be working with legislative leaders to pass an honestly balanced budget that protects Connecticut’s core values, provides flexibility for inevitable federal cuts, and adheres to our statutory and constitutional budget obligations.”
Will Lamont spare some of CT’s windfall to offset cuts in federal aid?
A controversial budget cap that bars legislators from spending a portion of income and business tax receipts will capture $1.9 billion this fiscal year, according to analysts who had been projecting $1.4 billion in savings before the report was issued. 
That $1.9 billion, combined with the $384 million operating surplus the administration projected this week, would leave Connecticut with an unspent cushion equal to 10% of the General Fund. The projected $2.3 billion combined surplus is topped only by 2021-22, when Connecticut finished $4.3 billion in the black, an outlier driven by the arrival of billions in new federal pandemic aid. 
Critics of the budget caps say the system is far too aggressive and that much of the reported “surplus” is revenue badly needed for education, human services, municipal aid and other core programs.
And with three-quarters of the General Fund tied to fixed or largely fixed costs, including contractually pledged wages, Medicaid, debt service and payments toward pensions and other retirement benefits, removing 10% from the remaining quarter budget has a big impact.
Majority Democrats in the House and Senate have pushed for the past two years to scale back these savings efforts. Lamont, a fiscal moderate, largely has resisted. But he conceded in February that some change should be made and proposed reducing mandatory savings modestly by about $300 million per year starting July 1.
But the governor and his fellow Democrats are farther apart on how to use this fiscal year’s windfall when it comes to the threat of impending cuts in federal aid.
With Congress aiming to reduce Medicaid and other programs by as much as $880 billion over the next decade, Lamont has said some models show Connecticut losing as much as $880 million in annual Medicaid assistance alone. Federal officials also are eyeing cutbacks in assistance for K-12 education, public colleges and universities, and other health care programs that could cost the state and its municipalities hundreds of millions in additional yearly assistance.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, and Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, both appealed to Lamont recently to carve out a portion of this fiscal year’s surplus to mitigate likely losses from Washington. The state has a $4.1 billion rainy day fund equal to 18% of the General Fund, but Democratic leaders say much of that could be spent in the next two years if the national slips into a severe recession.
“Four billion dollars,” Ritter said earlier this month, “could go so quickly that people’s heads will explode.”
And Looney has noted that, traditionally, Washington responds to an economic downturn by increasing aid to states. If there is a slump and a contraction in federal aid, the double-whammy would be unprecedented.
The Democratic-controlled Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee last week approved a measure that would set $700 million of the surplus aside to mitigate cuts in federal aid.
Progressive groups also are urging the governor to ease Connecticut’s savings efforts to preserve programs here.
“We would join the Governor in celebrating a 10% budget surplus if our schools were fully funded, housing and healthcare were affordable, and our public services were fully staffed,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic organizations. “Instead, we are facing unprecedented federal funding threats while working families continue to pay more for less.”
Lamont has been reluctant to commit anything more than the rainy day fund to solve all challenges facing Connecticut’s finances. He prefers to use the projected surplus to continue whittling down the state’s considerable pension debt, which topped $35 billion entering this fiscal year. Pension burdens, created by inadequate funding between 1939 and 2010, are projected to continue to strain state finances well into the 2040s.
“Our fiscal house has been rebuilt to weather an economic downturn,” said Jeffrey Beckham, the governor’s budget director. “Now is not the time to tear it down.”
Lamont also has support from minority Republicans in the House and Senate, who oppose any reduction in savings efforts.
“The [state budget] caps that we have in place have well positioned us for what may or may not happen at the federal level,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who added that excessive spending ordered by the Democratic state legislators are behind weakening consumer and business confidence in Connecticut. 
“These numbers should have the Democrats looking in the mirror,” he added.
“What this report shows is that, without question, the fiscal guardrails that Republicans fought to implement and preserve are working,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield and Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, ranking GOP senator on the finance committee, wrote in a joint statement Wednesday. “They are saving taxpayers billions and protecting against economic fluctuations. They have helped to control state government spending. They are paying down on the state’s debt.”
But Ritter and Looney both were hopeful Wednesday a compromise could be reached, at least between majority Democrats and Lamont.
The surplus is large enough, Democratic leaders said, to set aside funds to offset federal aid cuts; make a large payment to shrink pension debt; and adopt Lamont’s February plan to take $300 million from this year’s windfall to expand child care services. 
“We’re fortunate to be in a position to do that,” Looney said.
“I do think [the rising surplus] makes budget negotiations even easier,” Ritter added.

Sharice Davids of Kansas says GOP budget bill is ""not just reckless, it is cruel"" because it harms the working class for benefit of billionaires.","U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, characterized a House transportation committee budget bill as both cruel and reckless. She urged colleagues to work on bipartisan legislation that tackled wasteful spending without placing tax breaks for billionaires ahead of children, seniors and veterans. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. House YouTube channel)TOPEKA — Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas denounced Wednesday as reckless the budget proposal offered by Republicans on the House transportation and infrastructure committee.
Davids, who serves on the committee along with GOP U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann of Kansas, said the blueprint went beyond the goal of identifying wasteful government spending and amounted to a “direct attack on the people that we are here to serve.”
“I have always said I will work with anyone — Republican or Democrat — when it’s good for Kansans,” Davids said. “And, while it might seem difficult right now, I know and I believe that there is still room for common ground. But this partisan budget plan that we’re talking about today? It’s not just reckless. It is cruel.”
“We can improve government efficiency. We can reduce waste, fraud and abuse. But what we shouldn’t do is rush through chaotic policies that will raise costs for hard-working Kansans,” she said.
Davids, the lone Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation, said President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress were “pushing massive tax giveaways for billionaires instead of offering real help to the folks who need it most.”
The president seeks extension of 2017 federal tax cuts that would increase federal deficits by approximately $4 trillion during the coming decade.
“In recent months,” Davids said, “we have all seen the chaos, and simply put, we’re exhausted. This is not how the federal government should work. The dysfunction isn’t just noise — it’s hitting people where it hurts. What we’ve seen from the administration and in this budget is not strategic. It’s reckless.”
In a statement, Mann said the objective of the transportation and infrastructure committee was to add detail to a House budget package that bolstered Trump’s border and national security agenda, shelved energy policies advanced by President Joe Biden and addressed wasteful spending. This slice of the budget should also allow for investment in modernizing the nation’s air traffic control system, he said.
“Later this week, the House will vote to repeal more Biden-era rules and regulations that harm American consumers,” Mann said. “America needs an all-of-the-above energy strategy — not a one-size-fits-California mandate.”
During the House committee’s deliberations Wednesday, GOP leadership’s recommendation to set a federal vehicle registration tax was amended in wake of bipartisan opposition. Originally, the legislation required U.S. owners of an electric vehicle to pay $200 annually, owners of a hybrid vehicle to pay $100 annually and owners of other vehicles to pay $20 annually to support federal highway programs.
It was amended by the committee to set the tax on electric vehicles at $250 per year, leave the hybrid vehicle assessment at $100 annually and eliminate the proposed fee on other vehicles.
The federal gasoline tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has generated insufficient revenue for the highway trust fund as engines became more efficient and battery-powered vehicle sales escalated. The federal gas tax hasn’t been adjusted for inflation since the mid-1990s.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sharice-Davids-budget.png,,,2025-04-30 18:08:27.318360

Tylene Schultz is suing the Fonda Specialty Care nursing home, its parent company, Care Initiatives, and licensed practical nurse Becky Manning in Pocahontas County District Court.
In her lawsuit, Schultz claims that in the summer of 2022, she was hired at Fonda Specialty Care by its then-administrator, Jennifer Blair, to work in the home as a certified nursing assistant.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
On Feb. 18, 2023, the home allegedly scheduled a temp-agency nurse, Manning, to work the overnight shift due to a shortage of staff nurses. During the shift, a resident with a tracheostomy passed away about 2:25 a.m., the lawsuit claims.
State records indicate the resident who died was 87-year-old Marvin “Pete” Jacobs, who had undergone a tracheostomy and needed regular suctioning of his airway. The lawsuit claims Jacobs died because throughout the shift, Manning refused to numerous requests to suction Jacobs’ airway.
“Despite multiple requests by Schultz to suction the resident — over 10 times, from 6 p.m. on Feb.18, 2023, to 2:25 a.m., Feb.19, 2023 — Manning would not suction the resident, nor did she attempt to use the suction machine,” the lawsuit claims.
Schultz alleges she tried to call “supervisory level staff” who worked for the home, but none of the individuals answered the calls. She also alleges she asked that someone call 911, but Manning told her no physician was available at that hour to provide an order for a hospital evaluation.
An ‘agonizing and painful’ death alleged 
In her lawsuit, Schultz alleges she and another CNA remained with Jacobs as he “pointed to his neck, coughed, gagged, struggled to breathe, and turned colors from the lack of oxygen, until he finally passed away. From Schultz’s direct observation of the resident, his death was agonizing and painful.”
Schultz alleges she and a fellow CNA were so traumatized by the death they had to excuse themselves from the facility and were standing outside the building in an “emotionally hysterical” state. The other CNA was “physically ill, to the point of vomiting,” when an ambulance crew arrived to confirm Jacobs’ death.
According to the lawsuit, after Schultz left the home at the end of her shift, she received multiple text messages from Blair that said, “Keep your mouth shut and keep your opinions to yourself,” along with instructions that she should not communicate with Jacobs’ family.
Later that day, Schultz was summoned to a meeting with Blair at Fonda Specialty Care. During the meeting, the lawsuit claims, Blair — who was allegedly was aware Schultz planned to call state regulators and report her concerns with Jacobs’ care — informed Schultz she was being fired due to “resident complaints.”
The lawsuit claims Blair also stated that Schultz had violated patient privacy provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act by calling a co-worker at home and asking for their assistance with Jacobs’ situation.
Schultz alleges she reported her concerns with Manning’s “actions and inactions” to both the Iowa Long-Term Care Ombudsman’s Office and the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing.
DIAL subsequently cited Fonda Specialty Care for “failing to ensure that a resident who needs respiratory care, including tracheostomy care and tracheal suctioning, is provided such care,” and fined the home $10,000. The penalty was then reduced 35%, to $6,500, due to the lack of an appeal in the case.
Manning was criminally charged with felony wanton neglect of a resident of a health care facility and later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor wanton neglect. Last year, Manning entered into an agreement with the Iowa Board of Nursing in which she agreed to indefinitely suspend her practice of nursing.
In her lawsuit, Schultz alleges she was “fired for making a complaint to the ombudsman and the Iowa Department of Inspection of Appeals due to the suspected abuse and/or neglect of the resident … and not based on any resident complaints.”
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for wrongful termination. Care Initiatives has denied any wrongdoing and alleges that Schultz’s dismissal was based on legitimate, non-discriminatory, and non-retaliatory business reasons.
Inspectors detail events surrounding death
Some of the allegations in the lawsuit parallel the findings of state inspectors whose public reports describe the events leading up to Jacobs’ death.
According to the inspectors, an aide reported that Jacobs was sitting in his recliner when another worker noticed he appeared to be “in trouble” and instructed her to get a nurse right away. Jacobs was pointing at his neck, gasping for air, and mouthing that he could not breathe, the aide told inspectors.
The aide said she left the room to get the nurse and was absent for a few minutes. The worker who remained in the room later told inspectors Jacobs grew “really pale” and was gasping, so she, too, left the room and approached a nurse and said, “Would you please suction him? He needs to be suctioned.”
When the nurse entered the room, Jacobs was pale, but soon turned purple and then blue, the aide later reported. The nurse took his vital signs and told the aide Jacobs was having a heart attack. The aide explained to the nurse that Jacobs had been signaling he couldn’t breathe, at which point the nurse said, “Just a minute,” and left the room. The suctioning machine used to clear Jacobs’ airway sat idle on a nearby dresser, inspectors reported.
The nurse, later identified as Manning, told inspectors the “staff wanted me to suction him (and) I told the staff no. I was told that I would not have to do anything with the tracheostomy.” Manning allegedly told inspectors she first left the room to get supplies so she could check Jacobs’ blood pressure, pulse and oxygen levels and that when she returned, he was clammy and had an irregular pulse.
“I told the staff that I needed to go back to the nurses’ station and find out if the resident was a full code or DNR,” Manning reportedly told inspectors, referring to do-not-resuscitate orders that some residents have in place.
The inspectors allege that Manning told them that while she was checking on DNR order,  one of the aides approached her and said she was needed right away in Jacobs’ room. “I went back into his room and he had no blood pressure, no pulse, and no respirations. I pronounced him deceased,” she allegedly told inspectors.
She reportedly acknowledged her fellow workers had each told her Jacobs needed his airway suctioned and that he had been pointing to his neck and mouthing that he couldn’t breathe. According to the inspectors, Manning said that despite her colleagues’ comments, it never occurred to her to suction Jacobs’ airway.
Arbitration agreement blocks family’s lawsuit
Jacobs’ death is the focus of a separate lawsuit filed by his family against Fonda Specialty Care, Care Initiatives, Manning and the nursing home’s then-assistant director of nursing, Amanda Meyer.
According to the family’s lawsuit, when Manning arrived for work at the home on the afternoon of Feb. 18, 2023, she became aware Jacobs had a tracheostomy that would require suctioning at some point during the night and allegedly told Meyer and others she was unwilling or incapable of performing the work. Meyer allegedly told Manning to “watch a video and figure it out” and left the facility for the day, the lawsuit claims.
After the death, the family’s lawsuit claims, Manning falsely informed Jacobs’ son, Scott, that his father “went quickly and peacefully.” Scott Jacobs only learned of what actually transpired after being contacted by an Iowa Capital Dispatch reporter, the lawsuit claims.
The lawsuit alleges that after speaking to the reporter, Scott Jacobs called Jennifer Blair of Care Initiatives “to confront her about the (state’s) investigation and true facts of Pete Jacobs’ death.” According to the lawsuit, Blair “admitted to withholding information” from the family and not informing them of the state’s investigation and its findings.
Technically, the family’s lawsuit remains active, but all activity in the case has been stayed due to a judge’s finding that when Marvin Jacobs was admitted to the home, his son reviewed for 34 seconds an agreement that requires disputes over resident care to be settled through arbitration rather than the courts and then signed the document.
“The admittedly brief time he spent going over and eventually signing the arbitration agreement does not affect its validity or enforceability,” District Court Judge Michael D. Huppert ruled. Last week, the Iowa Supreme Court declined to review Huppert’s ruling.

House Bill 121, sponsored by Rep. Roy Daryl Adams, D-Jackson, would limit both trades from  saying they provide insurance claim services. The legislation also prohibits public adjusters from performing construction work in connection with the claims they handle. 
Adams’ bill cleared the House in a 96-0 vote Tuesday without debate. His proposal is one of dozens filed, with the backing of insurance companies, that seek to lower homeowner’s policy premiums in the state.
The measure, as amended on the House floor, would prohibit residential construction contractors from advertising or soliciting work as “insurance claims specialists,” a term that sometimes appears in their advertisements. 
In an April 23 hearing of the House Committee on Insurance, Adams said he hopes his measure will stop contractors from going door-to-door after storms to talk homeowners into filing insurance claims for roof work.
The original version of the bill would have prohibited roofing contractors from assisting customers with their homeowner insurance claims. It also would have ended the use of contingency contracts, in which roofers agree to perform work only if the homeowner’s insurance company approves their claim. 
Roofers could be banned from helping customers with insurance claims

However, several roofers who testified against that iteration of the bill raised concerns that it could make it illegal to provide many of their routine services, such as communicating with insurance companies. Some customers want help dealing with their insurance companies and look to contractors to provide second opinions on an insurance company’s damage assessments, Josh Lovell with Gator Roofing in Baton Rouge told lawmakers. 
Lovell told the committee he would be afraid to even say the word “insurance” in the presence of a customer if Adams’ bill became law. 
Some lawmakers have argued the proposal is necessary to prevent contractors from doing the work of public adjusters, who are independent claims assessors policyholders can hire for a fee to represent their interests. They are distinct from adjusters who work on behalf of insurance companies. 
After hearing roofers’ concerns, Adams amended his bill to remove many of its restrictions and applied the prohibitions specifically to advertising and soliciting. At the same time, the amendment expanded the measure to apply to all residential contractors — not just roofers. 
When asked about the proposal Tuesday, Louisiana Home Builders Association lobbyist Michelle Shirley said her organization has taken a neutral position on Adams’ bill.
The other goal of the legislation is to prevent conflicts of interest for public adjusters who are also residential contractors. It would prohibit them from doing any kind work related to the insurance claims they handle.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers advanced an amended proposal Wednesday to slow annual increases to Nebraska’s minimum wage down to a fixed rate, rather than using the inflationary bumps that voters approved in 2022.
Legislative Bill 258, from State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, advanced 33-16 with a “compromise” from State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney setting annual increases to the state minimum wage at 1.75%. Voters in 2022 approved permanent cost-of-living increases each Jan. 1, starting in 2027, based on a calculation of inflation for the Midwest region from the prior August.

Nebraska’s minimum wage will rise to $15 on Jan. 1 regardless of LB 258.
LB 258 would increase the state’s training wage for teen workers and limit it to workers aged 16 to 19 at 75% of the state minimum wage this September, rather than 75% of the federal wage (which is $7.25 and hasn’t changed since 2009). That wage can be paid for up to the first 90 days of employment.
As a result, workers aged 14 or 15 would get a new youth minimum wage beginning at $13.50 next January and increasing every five years by 1.5%. The training wage would rise by 1.5% each year. 
Under LB 258, the new youth wage would not get above $15 until 2065, according to a Nebraska Examiner analysis.



LB 258 heads to a third and final round of debate. It advanced again with Raybould, a Democrat, joining 32 of 33 Republicans to advance the bill. State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, a Republican, again opposed the measure.
‘Certainty’ is amendment’s goal
Raybould said her bill provides predictability and that Clouse’s suggestion was a “reasonable compromise.”
Average inflation for the past five years, as provided under the voter-approved language, was 4.18%, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Midwest. Over the past 10 years, it was 2.63%. And over the past 25 years, it was 2.39%. 
Of those 25 years, inflation was less than 1.75% a total of 11 times. The Midwest region faced deflation twice, in 2009 and 2015.
Clouse said the amended LB 258 would give wage earners and businesses “certainty,” rather than “rolling the dice” on whether there would be a wage adjustment.

State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln again led opposition to the measure she said would “undercut the will of the people” and prevent hard working Nebraskans, particularly those who would be subject to the new “youth minimum wage,” from fully realizing the “intent” of voters just a few years ago.
Conrad said the “heart” of the debate is economic justice and that senators needed to “see the poor” who help keep the economy abuzz and “not look down our nose at them.”
“This isn’t a few kids working for bubble gum,” Conrad said. “These are our neighbors who deserve us to hear them and see them, to provide them with an opportunity to keep their head above water.”
‘Improve your outlook’
State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney, who supported Raybould’s measure, said lawmakers and workers faced a “never-ending chase” between mandated cost increases on businesses and increased prices on consumers. He predicted more lost jobs and automation.

Strommen also is lead sponsor of a bill amended into LB 415, from State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, to weaken paid sick leave protections that voters approved just last fall.
“We’re never going to be satisfied,” Strommen said of the minimum wage cycle. “We have to come up with a better way to handle this.”
State Sens. Mike Moser of Columbus and Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area said that if workers wanted a higher wage, they needed to work for it.
Moser said the debate surrounded “class warfare” when he said the minimum wage was not a “living” wage. Kauth said it was a “safeguard against people being abused too much.”
“If you’re struggling in your family, do your best to get a different job, get an education,” Moser said. “See what you can do to improve your outlook.”
Kauth agreed, adding: “Change yourself rather than asking the government to do it for you.”
A ‘setback,’ not a ‘stepping stone’
State Sens. Dan Quick of Grand Island and Ashlei Spivey of Omaha said that inflation affected all Nebraskans and that the best way to support youths is to invest in them and their families.

State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha said Raybould’s bill was a “setback,” not a “stepping stone” to getting more young workers hired, as Raybould has suggested.
Fredrickson said young people aren’t working just for a “slush fund” or “extra cash” but instead work to help with household expenses, college savings, gas, food and to “make ends meet.”
“We cannot tell them that their efforts are less valuable or that fairness and equality of wages can wait another year until they’re a year older,” said Fredrickson, asking if industry-specific wages were next.
State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue said that when he was young, and before he went into the U.S. Air Force, he saved wages he earned as a teen to help his mother, including from a low-wage construction job.
“I put a lot of money up in the left back corner of my top drawer in the dresser,” Rountree said, telling his mom that if she ever needed it, it was there.


Minimum wage types

Federal minimum wage: Created in 1938, now $7.25.
Nebraska minimum wage: Created in 1967, now $13.50.
Nebraska tipped employees minimum wage: Created in 1970, now $2.13. Wages plus gratuities must equal or exceed the Nebraska minimum wage under state law.
Nebraska training wage: Created in 1991, now $5.44 (75% of the federal minimum wage) for up to the first 90 days of employment for a worker younger than 20 years old.
Nebraska student-learners minimum wage: Created in 1987, now $11.25 (75% of the Nebraska minimum wage) for workers who are part of a vocational training program.
Nebraska youth minimum wage: Does not currently exist.



‘Will of the voters’
Much of the debate surrounded the “will of the voters” that opponents said Raybould and supporters of the changes were undercutting.
“If we pass this bill, we are telling Nebraskans that their vote only counts when it’s convenient for us,” said State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha. “That’s not a democracy. It’s not a public service, and it’s not the role of a citizen’s Legislature.”
State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse said that was flat wrong and that supporters were “free and well within our authority” to amend the language, so long as they had at least 33 votes under the Nebraska Constitution.
“I guess if you say things long enough, you might begin to believe it yourself,” Hallstrom said. “Maybe some other people will believe you, but that doesn’t make it any more true.”
This round of debate was less personal than the first for Raybould, a longtime grocery store executive whose family owns and operates Super Saver and Russ’s Market. Raybould continues to serve as vice chair of the company’s board. She filed a conflict of interest statement on LB 258.
The change came in part because Raybould urged lawmakers Wednesday to move away from “personal attacks.”
“Even when it’s couched with words like ‘my dear friend,’ it gives permission for others to direct their anger and their hatred toward that person, and that can have very unfortunate consequences,” Raybould said, citing recent political violence in Pennsylvania.
A call back to 2007
During the debate, Raybould and Hallstrom walked through LB 31 of 2007, from Conrad during her first year as a lawmaker. As introduced, Conrad’s bill, her first in 11 years of legislative service so far, would have increased the minimum wage over time for all workers 17 years old or older, while younger workers would have been subject to the federal minimum wage.
Hallstrom, as a paid lobbyist 18 years ago, opposed LB 31.
Raybould asked Hallstrom if the Conrad of 2025 would have supported LB 31 of 2007, which Raybould and Hallstrom said seemed an odd position.
“I don’t think I’m qualified to speculate or define as to what now Senator Conrad, formerly Senator Nantkes, might have done differently,” Hallstrom said. “What I do know is that I do not criticize her for having a change of heart or a change of mind on the issue.”
A version of Conrad’s bill passed later in 2007, in line with federal minimum wage bumps. Conrad helped lead the successful 2014 ballot initiative that raised the state wage.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha called out the “tone deafness” of LB 258’s debate, such as the exchange on the floor of the Legislature between Raybould and Hallstrom, a former paid lobbyist, being used as justification for the measure’s necessity.
Conrad said the heart of her work has always been to put more money in people’s pockets.
“If you’d like to ask me about my intentions,” Conrad responded, “I’m happy to yield for questions so that other senators don’t have to guess as to my intentions from 15 years ago.”



Eligibility for the Nebraska, federal minimum wage
The federal minimum wage did not apply to most workers until 1978:

In October 1938, the wage went into effect for employees engaged in interstate commerce or in producing goods for interstate commerce.
Beginning September 1961, at a slightly lower rate than interstate commerce employees, the wage extended to workers of large retail or service enterprises, as well as those in local transit, construction or gas stations.
By February 1967, state or local government employees in hospitals, nursing homes and schools, as well as workers in laundries, dry cleaners and large hotels, motels, restaurants or farms were covered. Between 1970 and 1978, farm workers were paid at a lower rate.
Beginning January 1978, the federal minimum wage extended to most nonexempt workers at one minimum wage, $2.65 at the time.

Nebraska created a state minimum wage in 1967, applying in that case to workers not covered by the federal minimum wage until 1978. The Nebraska minimum wage has now surpassed the federal minimum wage and must be paid to all workers in businesses employing four or more employees. For smaller businesses, the federal minimum wage must be paid.

That’s despite the state Senate voting last week to remove state Treasurer Curtis Loftis from office for his role in a $1.8 billion accounting blunder. The error involved almost no actual money but went unreported for nearly a decade.
House Democrat calls for SC treasurer’s impeachment over $1.8B accounting debacle

But as the clock runs out on the 2025 legislative session, House GOP leaders said their chamber won’t take the matter up this year.
“We’re going to concentrate on passing legislation now, and then we’ll make a decision after session concludes on the path forward with the treasurer,” House Speaker Murrell Smith told South Carolina Public Radio in an interview that aired Wednesday.
In the House on Wednesday, Republicans shut down a last-ditch effort by a House Democrat to initiate impeachment proceedings on the state’s banker.
Rep. Heather Bauer, D-Columbia, rose from her seat to ask her colleagues to take up the bill she introduced in January and start the process. The request required unanimous approval by the chamber.
But Rep. Bill Taylor, R-Aiken, quickly objected, halting the attempt without further explanation.
Just four days remain in the 2025 legislative calendar. By state law, the regular session must end at 5 p.m. May 8.
In the Public Radio interview, Smith said the House has not totally ruled out taking action, but work remains on what that process might look like.
“This is the busiest time of the legislative session and so we’re going to have to get through our legislative business,” the Sumter Republican said.
Meanwhile, Loftis has said he plans to run in 2026 for a fifth term in office.
“I am ready to turn my focus back to doing the people’s work — to stabilize our state’s financial system and put this unfortunate chapter of fighting baseless claims by a few politically-motivated senators behind us,” the Republican treasurer wrote in a late Tuesday statement.
SC Senate votes to remove state treasurer over $1.8B accounting error

Loftis stands accused of “willful neglect” of his duties after he and other financial officials failed to alert the General Assembly of the accounting issues in the state’s books. The Senate voted 33 to 8 for his removal.
The error in question stemmed from the changeover from the state’s legacy accounting system to a new one.
During that process, a series of electronic ledger entries made it appear the state had $1.8 billion sitting untouched in a fund with no record of where it was supposed to go.
A forensic accounting firm hired by the state ultimately found the entries were made in error, and all but $200 million of the money was never real. Their work cost taxpayers $3 million.
Loftis has continuously said he did nothing wrong, as no money went missing, and has instead laid the blame for the problem outside his office.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Curtis-Loftis-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 18:08:27.318360

Two consecutive committee chairs getting overruled by their committee members signifies a growing rift among California Democrats about how to address the housing crisis.


One of the most controversial housing bills of the year has lived to be voted upon another day, but only by surviving the Legislative equivalent of two back-to-back prison breaks. 
Last week, Senate Bill 79, a bill by San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener to boost apartment and commercial construction around major public transportation hubs, passed the Senate Housing Committee over the strenuous objections of its chair, Sen. Aisha Wahab, a fellow Democrat from Fremont.
That was a notable development in its own right. Chairs tend to get their way on the bills that pass through their committees. When a majority of a committee’s members decide to buck legislative decorum and tradition and steamroll that committee’s chair, it’s often taken as a sign that California’s dominant Democrats are unusually divided over an issue; that the issue at hand is especially contentious; that the legislators either aren’t receiving clear guidance from legislative leadership or are willing to ignore that advice; or some combination of all of the above.
Fast forward to this week and it happened again. 
In the Senate Local Government Committee, Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Los Angeles Democrat, urged a no vote on Wiener’s bill. 
She didn’t get her way. The bill passed with the backing of all the other Democrats on the committee. Durazo voted “no” with the two Republicans.
A chair getting “rolled” is an unusual spectacle in Sacramento. In the typically arcane and perfunctory proceedings of the Legislature, this bit of human drama pops up once or twice a year. For it to happen twice in a row for the same bill is without any obvious precedent. 
“Extra unique” is how Chris Micheli, a longtime California lobbyist and public commentator on the Legislative process, described the situation. “Beyond the particular bill at hand, it could give an indication that there is a philosophical split in the caucus.”
So far Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, a Santa Rosa Democrat, has refused to comment publicly on where he stands on the divide within his caucus, whether the two chairs speak for him and whether he plans to intervene to smooth things over.
For some advocates, like Jim Wunderman, president of the Bay Area Council, which co-sponsored SB 79, the silence from McGuire has been deafening. 
“Close watchers of the legislative process have taken note of the differences between the two houses’ treatment of the housing topic this week…The Assembly seems to recognize the urgency of this moment,” Wunderman wrote to McGuire late last week, referencing another major housing bill that easily passed an Assembly committee last week.  “As ‘one of our own,’ a member of the Bay Area Caucus, and President Pro Tem of the Senate we feel compelled to write to you to share our deepening concern that the progress that we need on housing may ultimately stall in the Senate.”
McGuire’s office did not respond to a request for interview before this story was published.
After the caucus, Wiener downplayed the idea that there are irreparable divisions within the party.
“You have two chairs who have just a different perspective and that’s normal and, you know, I appreciate that we’ve been able to go through this process very respectfully,” he said. “We’re all grown ups.”
As for McGuire: “He’ll weigh in when he needs to weigh in,” said Wiener. 
McGuire is termed out of the Legislature next year, an expiration date which may limit his influence.
The increasingly public philosophical split within the Democratic caucus was apparent in both committee hearings. Wiener is a prolific housing legislator whose views align with the broader “Yes In My Backyard” movement that sees California’s housing affordability crisis as the product of an overall housing shortage. For that group, which includes Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Assembly Appropriations Committee Chair Buffy Wicks, making it easier to build more homes more cheaply, quickly and densely is the policy north star. Wicks said as much at a recent legislative hearing. 
“’I’m like a one-trick pony,” she said during a debate over a statewide rent control bill. “We’ve got to make it easier to build more housing in California and that has been really my sole focus since I’ve been here.”
Wahab and Durazo represent a different faction of the Democratic Party. Both have stressed that they aren’t opposed to new housing construction and that they share the view that the state faces a severe housing shortage. But they are more skeptical of the private development that tends to be a byproduct of the YIMBY movement’s proposed legislation, and believe state law that encourages it should come with terms and conditions. 
Wiener’s bill would allow housing developers to build apartment, condo and mixed-use towers on or near train, subway and light rail stations, ferry terminals and at the intersection of heavily used bus lines, regardless of what local zoning or building design rules specify. It would also remove barriers to transit agencies that want to do the same on their own land. 
“If we leave decisions about what to build up to market-rate developers who do not have the broader public interest in their minds, it’s the wrong way to go,” Durazo said. “While I want to help members move their legislation forward, sometimes bills go against our core values and amendments won’t address that.”
“We are aligned on the vast majority of issues,” Wiener said in response. “In this one, unfortunately, we are deeply not aligned and I do not believe that building more housing near public transportation, housing of every variety, goes against our core values.”

The bill doesn’t require private developers to set aside a share of units for low-income residents. Last week, Wahab called the lack of an explicit affordable housing requirement a “sweetheart deal” for the housing industry. Some affordable housing and anti-gentrification activists have turned out to oppose the bill, arguing that expanding opportunities for private development would come at the expense of affordable housing opportunity and turbocharge displacement.
The bulk of studies that have looked into the question have found that new market-rate housing reduces neighborhood rents and tends to ease displacement pressures.
Wiener has stressed that apartments and condos are inherently more affordable than single family housing and that the bill would not preclude other state and local affordability requirements that developers might be subject to from applying. In the committee hearing today, Wiener said that he is “exploring the possibility” of including a minimum affordability requirement.
The bill is also opposed by many local governments and neighborhood groups that resent the state’s usurpation of their land use authority and opponents of dense development. Ditto the State Building and Construction Trades Council, an umbrella group representing many unionized construction workers, who regularly oppose housing bills that lack stringent labor standards, and some environmental justice advocates.
Another Wiener bill, Senate Bill 607, which would make it easier for urban multifamily housing projects to avoid environmental review — a priority of many Assembly Democrats — also survived, despite Durazo’s “no” vote.
Both bills are now scheduled to go to the Senate Appropriations Committee.
This latest legislative kerfuffle could be a sign of things to come. This year, Assembly Democrats have put forward a vast package of housing bills aimed at speeding up development. Though some are eye-glazingly technical, others may incite the same Dem-on-Dem infighting that broke out over Wiener’s bill.
“(SB 79) could foreshadow tough sledding for some of the Assembly bills,” said Micheli.

(Alander Rocha/ Alabama Reflector)A bill seeking to make Alabama’s public schools teach “sexual risk avoidance” and abstinence likely won’t become law this year.
A Democratic filibuster over the General Fund budget Tuesday pushed debate over SB 277, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, to the last couple of minutes before midnight, when the legislative day ends. The late debate meant senators could not vote on the measure. 
Shelnutt made his unhappiness at the prospect clear.
“We’ve only got 10 more minutes. Y’all wasted the whole day. So, let’s just waste the last 10 minutes. I know you want to waste the last 10 minutes,” Shelnutt said at around 11:50 p.m. when Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, asked if he would be willing to delay the bill until next year to allow them to work on something together.
There are four days left in the 2025 session of the Alabama Legislature. Starting on Thursday, bills originating in the Senate that have not yet passed that chamber need unanimous consent to be sent to the House. A single senator’s objection can kill a bill.

“Senator?” Figures asked after a few seconds, following a question about whether he had been in contact with the Department of Education to learn about the current sex education curriculum.
“You’ve read the bill. You know what the bill does. There’s no sense wasting my time answering your questions. Y’all want to stop it, so just you got the mic. Go,” Shelnutt responded defensively.
“Senator, I am sincerely asking you questions about this bill,” Figures responded.
Shelnutt remained defensive during the debate, maintaining that “this is a good bill” and that he didn’t want “teachers, left-wing, crazy people, teaching my kids about stuff that I don’t ever want them to hear about.”
“If you got a problem with it, you got a problem with it,” Shelnutt said to Democratic senators.
The bill would change sex education programs to include information about the “financial cost of pregnancy and child care, abortion, and adoption,” as well as “instruction about parenting responsibilities.”  It explicitly prohibited “providing a referral to or information about how to acquire an abortion,” “misrepresenting the efficacy of or demonstrating the use of contraceptives,” and “using images that are sexually explicit.”
“I don’t want my kids taught that crap. I mean, it’s crap,” Shelnutt said on the floor.
The bill also tried to prevent local boards of education from using services from any individual or organization “that does not endorse sexual risk avoidance or that advocates for or performs abortions.”  It also mandated that parents or guardians be given a 14-day notice before any sex education instruction and granted them the right to opt their children out of such programs.   
Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, spoke briefly after Figures and pushed back on the claim that Tuesday was a “wasted day.” Instead, he said, it was an opportunity to compromise.
“It’s only a waste when you don’t care about things that we’re trying to address for the people that we represent. So, if I’m categorized as trying to represent the people that I represent, and someone wants to call it a waste, then so be it,” Smitherman said.

Ramirez defeated Republican Bernie Hayes on Tuesday for the seat representing parts of Cedar Rapids with 79% of the vote, according to results from the Iowa Secretary of State’s website.
Speaking with the Iowa Capital Dispatch Wednesday, Ramirez said the significant margin of victory in the special election is because Iowans do not appreciate actions taken by both the Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress, as well as Iowa’s GOP trifecta at the state Capitol.
“I believe that through the election, it’s been clear that our communities believe that progress isn’t partisan, and that they believe in a mission to stand up and deliver for Iowans,” Ramirez said. “And given the context of this federal administration and what this state administration has been doing, I think the fact that our community showed up for this campaign is even more of a stance — that they do not want to put up with what’s been going on on a state and federal level, that they harshly disagree with it, and they are ready for something new.”
Ramirez is a community organizer who serves as the co-founder and executive director of Our Future, a nonprofit fellowship program focused on youth leadership and climate activism. Ramirez also works as a Youth Peace Project Facilitator for Kids First Law Center, an organization providing free or low-cost legal representation for children in custody and divorce proceedings. She is the first Latina elected to the Iowa Legislature. The first Latino elected was Rep. Mark Cisneros, R-Muscatine, in 2020.
While the nearly 80% win for Ramirez represents a strong showing for Democrats in the state, it is not a flipped seat victory like Sen. Mike Zimmer’s win in January in a special election to replace Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer in the Senate. The House District 78 seat was formerly held by Scheetz, a Democrat, who resigned April 1 to serve on the Linn County Board of Supervisors. In the 2024 general election, Scheetz won reelection in an uncontested race.
There has been one other Iowa special election in 2025 — Republican Blaine Watkins won a tight victory against Democrat Nannette Griffin in a March 11 race to fill the House District 100 seat after Rep. Martin Graber, R-Fort Madison, passed away in January because of a sudden heart attack.
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart released a statement celebrating Ramirez’s win, saying the victory still shows the strength of Iowa Democrats heading into 2026 and future elections.
“I’d like to thank Ramirez for her readiness to represent her constituents, and to stand up for the rights and prosperity of all Iowans,” Hart said. “The scale of our victory tonight shows that as long as Democrats run candidates who understand and fight for their communities, we can win elections across the state. There’s more work to be done, but tonight we can rest assured that things are looking a little brighter. We won this election in good shape. Tomorrow we get ready for the next.”
Republicans have maintained their trifecta of control after the special elections, holding 67-33 in the House and 34-16 in the Senate.
When she gets to Des Moines, Ramirez said she plans to advocate for protecting low-income and other marginalized communities, funding public education, while pushing back on state GOP policies that she said are “giving tax cuts to corporations and big ag.” Ramirez also attributed her election success in part to Iowans’ frustrations with Republicans, who she said are focusing on divisive cultural issues instead of the financial and community struggles many people currently face.
“People are tired of the anger and the division and sort of the performative outreach that dominates our state administration right now, with the Republican-led Legislature and governor,” Ramirez said. “So our community believes that we can do better, and that’s been clear throughout different special elections, but especially this last one with me as the candidate.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Facetune_04-09-2022-00-56-03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 18:08:27.318360

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) The North Dakota University System says it is reviewing records for violations of policy or law related to sex crimes committed by former state lawmaker Ray Holmberg. 
State Board of Higher Education Chair Tim Mihalick read a statement at the start of Wednesday’s board meeting that said members learned at the same time as the public “that individuals previously affiliated with our institutions or board, may have had a connection to the criminal investigation of former Sen. Holmberg.”
A review began immediately, he said.

The board also has urged anyone with information about a university system employee or board member who failed to report misconduct to file a report to the institution’s Title IX office or the university system’s Office of Compliance and Ethics.
Holmberg represented Grand Forks, home to the University of North Dakota, in the Legislature for 45 years before resigning his seat as an investigation was underway. Holmberg, 81, was sentenced in March to 10 years in prison for traveling to Europe with the intent to pay for sex with underage boys. 
Holmberg served on the Legislature’s interim Higher Education Committee for several years, including as past chair. As chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Holmberg held a key position to make funding decisions that affect state universities. He also served on the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education. 
A former University of North Dakota graduate student who became a cooperating witness in the case against Holmberg spoke at the sentencing hearing about Holmberg’s abuse of power.
UND President Andrew Armacost on Tuesday sent a letter to the UND community addressing recent media reports about Holmberg and investigative documents released Friday.
“What I read sickened me, both in the criminal actions of Holmberg and in the inaction of those who had direct information about his misdeeds,” Armacost wrote.
Armacost acknowledged the documents mention several former UND employees connected to Holmberg.

“While they have not been accused of criminal action, we will ensure that they have no connection to our university community,” Armacost wrote. “Furthermore, we have shared our concerns with external organizations that interface with UND to make certain these people no longer represent these organizations.”
Investigation documents released Friday showed Holmberg sent emails about his visits to Prague in the Czech Republic to Bruce Gjovig, CEO of the University of North Dakota’s Center of Innovation in Grand Forks. 
“What think of my twink?” Holmberg asked Gjovig in one 2011 email, using a slang term that refers to young, slim men.
“Too young for me, but thanks,” Gjovig replied.
“No one is ever to young… remember Prague,” Holmberg wrote back.
Gjovig’s lawyer, Cash Aaland, said in a statement that Gjovig was not aware of Holmberg’s crimes and believed his comments to be exaggerated “locker room talk.” Gjovig retired from UND in 2017 and no longer has an official role with the university, said university spokesperson David Dodds.
Holmberg in 2016 emailed a former state senator, Nick Hacker, about a sexual encounter he had with someone in Taiwan. At the time the email was sent, Hacker was a member of the State Board of Higher Education. Hacker said the email was unsolicited and that he did not reply. Hacker said he provided the message to the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation in 2022.
Jim Poolman, a former legislator from Grand Forks and state insurance commissioner, this week issued a public statement after social media posts linked him to Holmberg.
“Holmberg’s behavior is indefensible, awful, and beyond comprehension. I never received any communications, electronic or otherwise, that would indicate that he was conducting himself in such a manner. He did not talk about his horrible crimes to me,” Poolman wrote.
Poolman said that about 19 months ago, he was interviewed by Homeland Security about Holmberg. He said he fully cooperated with investigators and answered all their questions.
“Since then, I have heard nothing from federal law enforcement because I was not involved, knew nothing of his heinous activities and have done nothing illegal,” Poolman wrote.
North Dakota Dems push for new mandatory reporting laws in response to Holmberg emails

Poolman announced Tuesday that he was resigning as chair of the UND Alumni Association and Foundation board of directors and from the Forever UND fundraising campaign committee. 
His written statement said the resignation “is in the best interest” of UND. 
“There are so many great things going on at UND and the last thing there needs to be is a distraction. I do not want to be that distraction,” Poolman wrote.
On Wednesday, Poolman declined to comment beyond his statements.
Armacost started as president at UND in June 2020, about two years before Holmberg resigned from office. 
Armacost in his letter to campus also provided a list of resources to those who have been impacted by Holmberg or have experienced trauma unrelated to this case
“If you witness such behaviors, please report them, and we will respond quickly to any allegations of abuse or mistreatment,” Armacost wrote. 
When asked earlier this week if UND planned to investigate whether employees knew about criminal activity, a UND spokesperson said, “If a report is filed with the university, it would be investigated.”
In his message to campus, Armacost said, “The university will take action based upon facts from authoritative sources.”

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)WASHINGTON, D.C. — A seemingly divided U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday over the nation’s first religious charter school that aims to open in Oklahoma, putting the constitutionality of a state-funded Catholic education to the test.
An Oklahoma state board approved St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to operate as a publicly funded charter school in 2023. The Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the school from opening in a June ruling, finding the concept of a religious charter school a violation of the Constitution’s prohibition against government-established religion.
The nation’s highest Court, with its conservative majority, agreed to hear an appeal of the ruling. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Catholic with ties to two legal groups behind St. Isidore, has recused.
Five of the eight remaining justices who heard the case also are Catholic — John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan is Jewish, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is a nondenominational Protestant.
A decision from the Court is expected by the end of June.
The Court’s liberal justices — Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson — appeared doubtful that previous rulings support the idea that a charter school could constitutionally adopt a religion. Kagan also wondered about the nationwide implications of permitting publicly funded religious schools.
Kavanaugh, part of the Court’s conservative majority, said disapproving a charter school solely on religious grounds “seems like rank discrimination against religion.” Opening charter school funding to faith-based institutions would “be expanding the options, not contracting the options” of school choice in public education, he said.
“All the religious school is saying is, ‘Don’t exclude us based on religion,’” Kavanaugh said.
Jackson and Kagan, though, pointed to ways St. Isidore’s founding contract differs from that of other charter schools. The school pledged to comply with state regulations and non-discrimination laws only to the extent that Catholic doctrine allows.
The Court made prior decisions that religious schools can’t be excluded from government grants and state-funded tuition assistance programs. In those cases, Jackson said, a religious school wasn’t changing the terms of a government program.
“It seems to me you are not seeking the same public benefit as everyone else,” Jackson said.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa applied to open St. Isidore, named after the patron saint of the internet, to offer an online Catholic education to students in all parts of the state, particularly in rural areas with no brick-and-mortar Catholic school.
St. Isidore would be Catholic in all ways but open to students of all belief systems, archdiocese officials have said. Students would have to learn Catholic doctrine and obey school rules inspired by church beliefs.

“We are grateful that the U.S. Supreme Court heard our case and now entrust it to their wisdom,” Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley and Tulsa Bishop David A. Konderla said in a statement Wednesday. “Of course, we pray and hope for a decision that stands with religious liberty and the rights of Oklahoma families to make their own decisions in selecting the best educational options for their children.”
Both the school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which approved St. Isidore’s founding contract, appealed the state Supreme Court ruling. Oklahoma’s attorney general has led the legal battle against the school.
Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel of the national conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, presented the statewide board’s oral arguments Wednesday. Michael H. McGinley of Deckert LLP represented St. Isidore.
Both contended charter schools aren’t an arm of the government like traditional public schools. Rather, they are private entities who contract with the state to provide a public service, like a private hospital, and therefore should be free to adopt a religion.

After leaving the courtroom, Campbell said he found the justices “very receptive to the arguments we were making.”
“The law is on our side,” Campbell said. “The First Amendment says when you create a program and invite everyone in but tell only religious groups that they can’t come, that violates the Constitution.”
Former U.S. Solicitor General Gregory Garre, now of Latham & Watkins LLP, gave oral arguments on behalf of the Oklahoma attorney general, who said the concept of a publicly funded religious school is unconstitutional.
Charter schools bear all necessary resemblance to traditional school districts to be considered public, Garre said. The state can open and close a charter school, unlike a fully private institution. They are subject to the equal academic standards as Oklahoma public schools and most of the same regulations, though they have more flexibility over teaching methods and employee hiring.
They are governed by independent boards, though they must contract with a traditional school district, college or university, Native American tribe or a state board that oversees them as a charter authorizer.
Laws in 47 states, including Oklahoma, and federal law all define charter schools as public schools and forbid them from religious affiliation.
Like all public schools, Garre said, charter schools must comply with church-state separation.
Kagan seemed to agree.
“When I look at Oklahoma and its charter schools program, they look like regular public schools,” she said. “These charter schools, except for some things on the margin, are equivalent to public schools. So why shouldn’t we take the state at its word (that they are public)?”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent, despite it having support from fellow Republican leaders in the state.
Drummond contended St. Isidore would create a “slippery slope” leading to charter schools teaching faith systems that most Oklahomans would disagree with — a position Alito said “seems to be based on hostility to certain religions.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt has been a vocal advocate of opening St. Isidore. Standing outside the U.S. Supreme Court building on Wednesday, Stitt said the school “expands choice and freedom,”  and the government shouldn’t stand in the way.
“I think the Supreme Court is going to rule with us because it’s just common sense,” he said.

Charter school advocates feared a ruling in St. Isidore’s favor could cause a widespread closure of charter programs in states that won’t abide taxpayer-funded religious education.
All of a sudden, “we won’t know what the rules are for charter schools anymore in 47 states and the federal level,” said Starlee Coleman, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.
“This is going to shut down the charter school program in many states where there is simply no appetite by state lawmakers to fund religious schools,” Coleman said after oral arguments. “States like California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois where there are millions of children attending charter schools today.”

(Courtesy of Smith Entertainment Group)The Utah Hockey Club wrapped its first season in a temporarily modified Delta Center this year. Now, Smith Entertainment Group, which owns the state’s NHL franchise, unveiled how it would remodel the arena to permanently accommodate hockey and basketball.
One of the main events in the transformation is the implementation of a retractable seating system in the arena’s lower bowl “that accommodates a nearly 12-foot variance in elevation between rink and court endlines to offer optimal sightlines for both the NBA and NHL,” according to a news release. It’s a first of its kind in a dual-use arena, Smith Entertainment Group said of the feature. 
With the hockey configuration, there will also be added capacity behind the goals and above and around the event tunnels on the north and south side of the lower bowl. For basketball, the riser system will have 29 rows of retractable seats that are able to extend over 28 feet.

Ryan and Ashley Smith, co-founders of Smith Entertainment group, said in a statement that while adding an ice rink inside an arena designed to host basketball is challenging — since the rink must be nearly double the size of a basketball court — they are excited to get started on the challenge. 
“This transformation will create the most compelling, welcoming, and exciting experience for hockey fans, while also allowing us to maintain the steep vertical seating for basketball that has made Delta Center such a dynamic venue with its loud atmosphere that energizes our players night after night,” the Smiths said. 

With these renovations, the Delta Center is expected to increase its seating capacity from 11,131 to about 17,000 for hockey, and from 18,206 seats to nearly 19,000 for the Utah Jazz. 
This is a major part of what SB272, a 2024 bill that created a sports and entertainment district in Salt Lake City’s downtown, intended. The legislation allowed the city to start collecting a 0.5% sales tax increase for 30 years to raise about $900 million for the arena’s renovations as well as redevelopment for three blocks of the neighborhood. 
SLC Council approves sales tax increase proposal for sports and entertainment district

Smith Entertainment Group estimates that $525 million will be used on the remodel of the Delta Center and $375 million will go to cover costs to develop the district. While the deal with the state and the city includes a participation agreement in which the company committed to fund programs and spaces for the public, Salt Lakers remained divided on whether taxpayer dollars should be used for this endeavor. 
Ultimately, the city signed onto the agreement. And, after the 2025 legislative session, the state created more tools to fund renovations to the Salt Palace Convention Center, also a landmark of the downtown district. 
On Tuesday, the Salt Lake County Council voted unanimously to approve selling 6.5 acres of county-owned property — between South Temple and 100 South, and 200 and 300 West — to Smith Entertainment Group.

The area hosts an exhibit hall space at the convention center and it’s surrounded by the Delta Center, Japantown, Abravanell Hall, the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art and City Creek Center, according to a release.
“This is more than a land transaction — it’s a catalyst for long-term growth, a stronger downtown, and significant benefits to residents across Salt Lake County,” Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson said in a statement. “The redevelopment of this property will generate millions in tax revenue, attract major national and international events, and ensure Salt Lake City remains a premier destination for sports, entertainment, cultural events and tourism.”
Construction starts this summer for the Delta Center remodel, but it will take multiple years to complete, with work being done during the summer when the teams are off-season. The plans also include an east-side entrance to connect with the downtown district, and a new parking garage at the back of the arena.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota ranks 46th in the nation for average teacher salaries — its highest standing since the National Education Association started ranking states in 1943, according to the South Dakota Education Association.
The state previously reached 47th in the 2019 report for the 2017-18 school year, after South Dakota lawmakers approved a half-cent sales tax increase in 2016. The effort poured millions of dollars into school districts with the intent of raising average teacher salaries.
The state fell to 50th by the 2021 report and ranked 49th in last year’s report.
South Dakota saw one of the greatest jumps in standing this year compared to other states, due to a 6% increase in salaries. During the 2022-23 school year, South Dakota’s average teacher salary stood at $53,153. In the 2023-24 school year, the average teacher made $56,328.


South Dakota Education Association President Loren Paul attributes that to increases in state aid to public education from state lawmakers. Legislators approved a 6% increase in 2022, 7% in 2023 and 4% in 2024. Those infusions were largely due to an influx of federal COVID-19 relief funds into the state budget.
Lawmakers also established a minimum teacher salary for districts and tied teacher compensation requirements to state aid increases during the 2024 legislative session. Both were “strong accountability measures” resulting in “meaningful gains,” Paul said in a news release.
Lawmakers approved a 1.25% increase in education funding this legislative session. The slight increase was approved due to lower-than-anticipated revenue and because COVID funding has run out.
Paul warns the slight increase could cause teacher pay to fall further behind inflation. Adjusted for inflation, South Dakota teachers make less than they did a decade ago.
“While we see moving up in rank as good news, we are concerned that lawmakers will take their feet off the gas and salary increases will stall, forcing many teachers to leave the profession because they can’t pay their bills,” Paul said.
Compared to neighboring states, South Dakota’s average teacher pay of $56,328 remains the lowest this year:

North Dakota: $58,581.
Minnesota: $72,430.
Iowa: $62,399.
Nebraska: $60,239.
Wyoming: $63,669.
Montana: $57,556.

States that rank lower than South Dakota are Louisiana, West Virginia, Missouri, Florida and Mississippi (there are 51 spots in the rankings, due to the inclusion of Washington, D.C.). Mississippi’s average teacher salary of $53,704 is the nation’s lowest, according to the report, just a 0.7% increase compared to the previous year’s salary.
California reports the highest average salary at $101,084 — a 6.2% increase from last year. Oklahoma saw the largest percent change in its salaries at 10.5%, increasing to 35th ($61,330) from 43rd in the rankings.
South Dakota’s ranking for average starting salary improved to 25th in the nation, at $45,530, which is up from 27th in last year’s report.

(Courtesy image)Two candidates have filed to be considered for New Mexico’s next lieutenant governor in the 2026 elections.
Current Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard — who is term-limited in that position — is running as a Democrat while Manuel Lardizabal, a former candidate for the New Mexico Senate, will seek the Republican nomination, according to state candidate filings.
In the November general elections, the governor and lieutenant governor run on the same ticket, but each office has separate party primaries in June. The lieutenant governor has both executive and legislative roles. Lieutenant governors are second-in-command and stand in for  governors during their absences. The lieutenant governor also serves as president of the New Mexico State Senate, overseeing the body’s business during the legislative session and determining issues of decorum or rules.
The lieutenant governor holds a tie-breaker vote, according to the state Constitution, but only in the Senate.
Garcia Richard announced her bid in March. She told Source NM this week that the pending federal cuts to New Mexico spurred her to run, noting the high percentage of New Mexicans on Medicaid, along with the state’s reliance on federal funds for special education. She said she hopes to enhance the office’s ombudsman role.
“We need to be leaning on statewide leaders to be showing the way for New Mexico in this time, pushing back on the federal government when it’s required, making sure New Mexicans are protected from federal threats,” she said.
Garcia Richard said she was inspired by former Democratic Lt. Gov. Diane Denish’s role on the children’s cabinet and the way current Democratic Lt. Gov. Howie Morales managed unemployment requests during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The office really can be a powerhouse for constituent services,” she said. “I’m really running to make the office more responsive and as an agent for positive social change for New Mexicans.”
Two Democratic candidates have announced gubernatorial runs in 2026: Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman and former Congresswoman and U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland.
Garcia Richard, who served for three terms in the New Mexico House of Representatives, said she is on good terms with both of the announced candidates.
“I have great relationships with them,” she said. “I feel like my skill sets could really complement theirs, and I understand that success is relationship-dependent.”
According to the latest campaign filings, Garcia Richard has a $32,528 cash balance on hand, a combination she said of a transfer from her campaign for land commissioner and recent donations.
Only one candidate, Democrat Juan Sanchez, has jumped into the race for Garcia Richard’s land commission seat. Statewide candidates have until Feb. 2, 2026 to file.
Garcia Richard also noted that a $600 fine assessed for a late filing from the New Mexico Secretary of State’s office was due to a clerical error.
“I filed under my previous office,” she said, and then transferred the account.
When reached by phone, Lardizabal told Source NM he’s only submitted the initial filing paperwork and would announce his campaign launch and website soon. Lardizabal reported no expenditures or contributions so far.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-30 20:55:57+00:00,CT Mirror,CT bill that would clear path for lawsuits against gun industry passes House,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/30/ct-gun-civil-liability-bill/,The gun industry could face civil damages for the misuse of firearms in limited circumstances in Connecticut under the bill.,"The gun industry could face civil damages for the misuse of firearms in limited  circumstances in Connecticut under product liability legislation passed by the House and sent to the Senate on Wednesday.
Passage of House Bill 7042 came on a largely party-line vote of 100 to 46 in the House, where Democrats have a 102-49 majority. Five Democrats were opposed and five Republicans in favor.
Republican opponents decried the bill as unfairly holding gun makers and sellers responsible for the actions of purchasers, while the Democratic sponsor described it as a reasonable effort to make an industry be more attentive to public safety.
The state legislation follows a narrow path left open by a federal law that generally protects the gun industry from damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearms or ammunition.
Exceptions to the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act include cases where harms occurred after a manufacturer or seller knowingly violated a law applicable to the sale or marketing of guns.
Nine states have passed similar laws, said Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, the lead sponsor of the bill. 
 He said the same exception was used by families of nine Sandy Hook Elementary School families to sue Remington over its marketing of the AR-15 style rifle used to kill 20 students and six educators in 2012. They agreed to a $73 million settlement in 2022.
The U.S. Supreme Court had refused to hear an appeal of a Connecticut’s court decision that allowed the families to pursue the case.
The families sued under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. A key element of the lawsuit was a claim that Remington knowingly marketed the rifle to young, at-risk males in advertising and product placement. One the ads featured the rifle and the phrase: “Consider Your Man Card Reissued.”
The measure requires the firearms industry to establish and enforce “reasonable controls” preventing persons ineligible to purchase a gun from obtaining one through a straw purchase or other means.
“What this bill would do is provide a civil remedy or a civil cause of action for victims of violence, victims of gun crimes, victims of those who are harmed by irresponsible actions by gun manufacturers, gun dealers and gun sellers,” Stafstrom said. 
Stafstrom is a trial lawyer, co-chair of the legislature’s Judiciary Committee and a long-time ally of a gun safety movement influential in Connecticut since the Sandy Hook school shooting.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, dismissed the bill as a windfall for the personal-injury bar.
“This is probably a trial lawyer’s dream. I don’t think it does anything to make Connecticut residents safer from gun violence,” Candelora said. “It certainly will make lawyers a lot richer.”
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said, “We are saying to the firearm industry, ‘You’re going to be held to a different standard.’”
Gun dealers complained at a public hearing that the measure would threaten their businesses. 
Edward Rando, the owner of Ron’s Guns in East Lyme, said he feared the bill would make insurance unavailable or prohibitively expensive. In the last 40 years, he said, the annual cost of insurance quadrupled from $5,000 to $20,000.
The measure also would prohibit persons convicted of violent misdemeanors outside the state from obtaining a carry permit necessary to purchase firearms and ammunition in Connecticut. Current law only makes those misdemeanors disqualifying if they occurred in the state.
The five Democrats opposing the bill were Jill Barry of Glastonbury, Pat Boyd of Pomfret, Michael DiGiovancarlo of Waterbury, Chris Poulos of Southington, and Kerry Wood of Rocky Hill.
The five Republicans in favor were Chris Aniskovich of Clinton, Devin Carney of Old Saybrook, Tina Courpas of Greenwich, Tom Delnicki of South Windsor and Tracy Marra of Darien.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7389-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-30 17:10:27.495238

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Donald van der Vaart—the state’s former environment secretary and a climate skeptic who was shortlisted for EPA administrator during the first Trump administration—has been appointed to the North Carolina Utilities Commission by Republican Treasurer Brad Briner.
Van der Vaart started his career in state government as a 20-year employee in the Division of Air Quality and was promoted to secretary of the Department of Environmental Quality by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory in 2015. He was a proponent of offshore drilling and fracking.
The Utilities Commission regulates the rates and services of utilities like Duke Energy and companies that provide gas, electricity and drinking water. In that role, the commission oversees the state’s transition to renewable energy and is also responsible for ensuring the safety of natural gas pipelines.

“North Carolinians need a strong voice on the North Carolina Utilities Commission,” Briner said in a press release. “Don provides that voice, and his expertise and leadership will ensure that the citizens of North Carolina have access to low-cost, reliable energy.”
The appointment still must be approved by the state House and Senate.
Many environmental advocates oppose the appointment. Dan Crawford, director of government relations for the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, called van der Vaart’s appointment “short sighted and a violation of the public trust. This appointment flies in the face of science and clean energy progress. It’s like letting an arsonist guard the fire station.”


Van der Vaart would earn roughly $150,000 as a utilities commissioner.
“I am deeply honored by Treasurer Briner’s confidence in me,” van der Vaart said in the press release. “I look forward to working to ensure that North Carolina’s energy future remains reliable, affordable, and ever cleaner—safeguarding both our prosperity and our environment.”
The treasurer did not have appointment power to the Utilities Commission until December, when the state legislature passed Senate Bill 382. The measure was ostensibly a disaster relief bill for communities devastated by Hurricane Helene, but also contained unrelated provisions that conservative lawmakers favored.
Then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, vetoed the bill, but the Republican-controlled legislature overrode it.
Before SB 382, the governor appointed the majority of the Utilities Commission—three seats. After the bill became law, one of those appointments went to the state treasurer. The bill also shrunk the membership from seven to five, starting in July: two appointments by the governor, one by the state treasurer and one each to the House and Senate leadership. The treasurer and legislative leaders are all Republicans, meaning the GOP will have control of the new five-member commission.
Earlier this month Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat elected in November, petitioned a Wake County court for a temporary restraining order to thwart the treasurer’s appointment power, arguing it violates the state Constitution. The filing names House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate President Pro Temp Phil Berger as defendants.
A spokesperson for the governor’s office told Inside Climate News that “the parties are currently trying to work out a briefing schedule to get this dispute resolved as expeditiously as possible so that the Governor can continue the work that voters elected him to do.”
When Cooper was elected governor in 2016, van der Vaart could have lost his job as a political appointee. Instead, van der Vaart used his statutory authority to demote himself to a middle management position in the Division of Air Quality.
He held that post for a year until he co-authored a lengthy opinion piece in a national environmental law journal calling for the elimination of a key air quality rule, an opinion that contradicted the stance of the agency.
Shortly after then-DEQ Secretary Michael Regan placed van der Vaart on administrative leave, he resigned.
When Donald Trump won election in 2016, van der Vaart wrote him a congratulatory letter that earned him consideration for EPA administrator. In part, the letter read: “We must put an end to the idea that more regulation is always good, and instead allow state and local experts to improve the environment.”
The top EPA post went instead to Scott Pruitt, who named van der Vaart to the EPA’s Science Advisory Board.
In a 2018 opinion piece for The Hill, van der Vaart wrote that some environmental groups were “serving as proxies for the Russians,” and to protect the environment Trump should investigate those allegations.
Van der Vaart returned to state government in 2019 when Berger, the State Senate leader, appointed him to the Environmental Management Commission. The EMC makes environmental rules that DEQ must follow.
His ascent continued when the chief justice of the state Supreme Court named him the chief administrative law judge for the Office of Administrative Hearings. The quasi-judicial agency presides over contested cases of administrative law. He has commonly assigned himself cases involving DEQ and has often ruled against the agency. If van der Vaart joins the Utilities Commission, he would resign his judgeship.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Power-poles-NC-Utilities-Comm.jpg,,,2025-04-30 17:10:27.495238

Kevin Stitt speaks outside the U.S. Supreme Court building Wednesday after the Court heard oral arguments April 30, 2025 over the constitutionality of a religious charter school seeking to open in Oklahoma. (Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)WASHINGTON, D.C. — A seemingly divided U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday over the nation’s first religious charter school that aims to open in Oklahoma, putting the constitutionality of a state-funded Catholic education to the test.
An Oklahoma state board approved St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to operate as a publicly funded charter school in 2023. The Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the school from opening in a June ruling, finding the concept of a religious charter school a violation of the Constitution’s prohibition against government-established religion.
The nation’s highest Court, with its conservative majority, agreed to hear an appeal of the ruling. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Catholic with ties to two legal groups behind St. Isidore, has recused.
Five of the eight remaining justices who heard the case also are Catholic — John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan is Jewish, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is a nondenominational Protestant.
A decision from the Court is expected by the end of June.
The Court’s liberal justices — Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson — appeared doubtful that previous rulings support the idea that a charter school could constitutionally adopt a religion. Kagan also wondered about the nationwide implications of permitting publicly funded religious schools.
Kavanaugh, part of the Court’s conservative majority, said disapproving a charter school solely on religious grounds “seems like rank discrimination against religion.” Opening charter school funding to faith-based institutions would “be expanding the options, not contracting the options” of school choice in public education, he said.
“All the religious school is saying is, ‘Don’t exclude us based on religion,’” Kavanaugh said.
Jackson and Kagan, though, pointed to ways St. Isidore’s founding contract differs from that of other charter schools. The school pledged to comply with state regulations and non-discrimination laws only to the extent that Catholic doctrine allows.
The Court made prior decisions that religious schools can’t be excluded from government grants and state-funded tuition assistance programs. In those cases, Jackson said, a religious school wasn’t changing the terms of a government program.
“It seems to me you are not seeking the same public benefit as everyone else,” Jackson said.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa applied to open St. Isidore, named after the patron saint of the internet, to offer an online Catholic education to students in all parts of the state, particularly in rural areas with no brick-and-mortar Catholic school.
St. Isidore would be Catholic in all ways but open to students of all belief systems, archdiocese officials have said. Students would have to learn Catholic doctrine and obey school rules inspired by church beliefs.

“We are grateful that the U.S. Supreme Court heard our case and now entrust it to their wisdom,” Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley and Tulsa Bishop David A. Konderla said in a statement Wednesday. “Of course, we pray and hope for a decision that stands with religious liberty and the rights of Oklahoma families to make their own decisions in selecting the best educational options for their children.”
Both the school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which approved St. Isidore’s founding contract, appealed the state Supreme Court ruling. Oklahoma’s attorney general has led the legal battle against the school.
Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel of the national conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, presented the statewide board’s oral arguments Wednesday. Michael H. McGinley of Deckert LLP represented St. Isidore.
Both contended charter schools aren’t an arm of the government like traditional public schools. Rather, they are private entities who contract with the state to provide a public service, like a private hospital, and therefore should be free to adopt a religion.

After leaving the courtroom, Campbell said he found the justices “very receptive to the arguments we were making.”
“The law is on our side,” Campbell said. “The First Amendment says when you create a program and invite everyone in but tell only religious groups that they can’t come, that violates the Constitution.”
Former U.S. Solicitor General Gregory Garre, now of Latham & Watkins LLP, gave oral arguments on behalf of the Oklahoma attorney general, who said the concept of a publicly funded religious school is unconstitutional.
Charter schools bear all necessary resemblance to traditional school districts to be considered public, Garre said. The state can open and close a charter school, unlike a fully private institution. They are subject to the equal academic standards as Oklahoma public schools and most of the same regulations, though they have more flexibility over teaching methods and employee hiring.
They are governed by independent boards, though they must contract with a traditional school district, college or university, Native American tribe or a state board that oversees them as a charter authorizer.
Laws in 47 states, including Oklahoma, and federal law all define charter schools as public schools and forbid them from religious affiliation.
Like all public schools, Garre said, charter schools must comply with church-state separation.
Kagan seemed to agree.
“When I look at Oklahoma and its charter schools program, they look like regular public schools,” she said. “These charter schools, except for some things on the margin, are equivalent to public schools. So why shouldn’t we take the state at its word (that they are public)?”

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent, despite it having support from fellow Republican leaders in the state.
Drummond contended St. Isidore would create a “slippery slope” leading to charter schools teaching faith systems that most Oklahomans would disagree with — a position Alito said “seems to be based on hostility to certain religions.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt has been a vocal advocate of opening St. Isidore. Standing outside the U.S. Supreme Court building on Wednesday, Stitt said the school “expands choice and freedom,”  and the government shouldn’t stand in the way.
“I think the Supreme Court is going to rule with us because it’s just common sense,” he said.
Charter school advocates feared a ruling in St. Isidore’s favor could cause a widespread closure of charter programs in states that won’t abide taxpayer-funded religious education.
All of a sudden, “we won’t know what the rules are for charter schools anymore in 47 states and the federal level,” said Starlee Coleman, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.
“This is going to shut down the charter school program in many states where there is simply no appetite by state lawmakers to fund religious schools,” Coleman said after oral arguments. “States like California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois where there are millions of children attending charter schools today.”

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)New reports highlighted by the Kentucky Education Association show that pay for public school teachers in the state fell in national rankings again this year. 
The annual reports from the National Education Association, the national teachers union, examine teacher pay nationwide. This year, Kentucky ranks 42nd in the nation for average public school teacher pay at $58,325 despite a 3.6% increase from the previous year. Last year, the NEA ranked Kentucky as 41st in average teacher pay. 
The national average teacher salary is $72,030, according to the 2025 data. 
In a press release, KEA President Eddie Campbell said the organization “is deeply concerned about the General Assembly’s lack of investment in Kentucky educators’ pay.” 
“Every school district across the commonwealth faces shortages of teachers, substitutes, bus drivers, custodians and office staff nearly every day of the school year,” Campbell said. “Properly investing in our teachers’ pay could help remedy this critical shortage and make Kentucky a competitive destination for educators working in our neighboring states. Until then, Kentucky will continue to struggle with staffing our public schools.”
The NEA data also put Kentucky at 48th in the nation for average beginning teacher pay. According to the report, average starting teacher pay is $40,161 after a 2.4% increase over last year’s average. Kentucky ranked 45th in average beginning teacher pay in 2024. Additionally, Kentucky classified workers — such as bus drivers, janitorial workers, administrative staff and cafeteria employees — were found to make an average salary of $28,088 per year, ranking 49th in the  country even though the average salary increased 3.7% over last year. 
Salaries for public school employees has long been a political football in Kentucky. Throughout both of his terms, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has called for the Republican-controlled General Assembly to approve raises for public school employees, most recently during his State of the Commonwealth address in January. 
At the time, Beshear said that Kentucky voters’ rejection of a constitutional amendment to allow the state legislature to fund nonpublic schools last fall was “a mandate to prioritize public education.” 
However, days later at the annual Kentucky Chamber Day Dinner, Republican House Speaker David Osborne, of Prospect, said the state legislature had provided a historic level of K-12 education funding.
“These are the same people that have not provided one single, substantive, creative, thoughtful, intentional policy change to improve education,” Osborne said. “Because let’s be clear, asking for more money is not big. Asking for more money is not bold. Asking for more money is just an ask — and it’s not working.”During the 2023 gubernatorial election, then Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron released an education plan that called for raising the base rate pay of new Kentucky teachers to an annual salary of $41,500.

(Mia Maldonado / Idaho Capital Sun)A federal judge has blocked parts of a new Idaho immigration enforcement law while she evaluates a lawsuit challenging the law.
The Idaho Legislature created the new law through House Bill 83, which was modeled after a controversial 2023 Texas law.
Idaho’s law creates the new immigration crimes of “illegal entry” and “illegal reentry,” targeting individuals who do not have proper immigration authorization and those who have already been deported from coming to Idaho. Law enforcement would only be able to convict someone of those crimes if they are suspected for a different crime.
The law took effect immediately after Gov. Brad Little signed the bill into law on March 27. But hours later, the judge blocked Idaho from enforcing the law through a temporary restraining order that she later extended in response to a lawsuit by ACLU of Idaho.
Federal judge Amanda Brailsford on Tuesday issued a longer lasting preliminary injunction, blocking Idaho from enforcing two new crimes created through the bill: illegal entry and illegal reentry. 
In her ruling, the judge wrote the ACLU of Idaho showed it was likely to succeed on the merits of several of its claims, including arguments that the new crimes created through the bill violate the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution, that the new crimes are preempted by federal law, and that the groups and five anonymous people ACLU represents in the lawsuit “are likely to suffer irreparable injury” under Idaho’s new law. 
“We are pleased the court recognized that enforcement of this law is harmful and unconstitutional,” ACLU of Idaho Staff Attorney Emily Croston said in a written statement. “We are confident this lawsuit will succeed on its merits, and we hope it sends a message to Idaho’s lawmakers that passing anti-immigrant, unconstitutional legislation is not what Idaho needs.”
Hours after the governor signed the bill, ACLU of Idaho sued Idaho officials over the new law, including Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador and county prosecuting attorneys. 
“The Attorney General’s Office is reviewing the decision to determine next steps. We will continue to defend House Bill 83 in full,” Idaho Office of the Attorney General spokesperson Damon Sidur told the Sun in a statement.
Idaho’s new law also creates the crime of “trafficking a dangerous illegal alien,” or knowingly transporting an unauthorized immigrant who has previously been convicted of a crime in the U.S. or another country. The law grants immunity to law enforcement officers, meaning they are protected from lawsuits that could arise from the damages and liability they cause while enforcing the law.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)On July 25, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a radio address to 125 million Americans in which he coined the term “first 100 days.” Today the 100th day of a presidency is considered as a benchmark to measure the early success or failure of a president.
Mr. Trump’s 100th day of office lands on April 30 where the world has witnessed his 139 executive orders, 39 proclamations, 36 memoranda, a few Cabinet meetings and numerous press briefings. In summary, Trump’s cabinet appointments, tariff-related flip-flopping and arbitrary, capricious and erratic actions have created 1929-like turmoil in the stock market, utter confusion among our 184 international trade partners and confounded unrest with consumers, workers, small business owners and corporate CEOs. Interestingly, an UMass/YouGov poll found that 26% of the people who voted for Trump have lost their confidence and appeal for our 47th president (April 17).
It appears The New York Times was the first media agency to report on just the 18th day of Trump’s 2.0 presidency that he was creating a constitutional crisis. That claim has been reported by multiple major news agencies, spoken in town-hall meetings and observed in thousands of public protests with demonstrators from all political persuasions requesting Congress and the Supreme Court to stop our democracy turning into an authoritarian dictatorship.
On March 25, I sent an e-mail to authoritarian scholar Barbara McQuade (Professor – Univ. Michigan Law School; U.S. Attorney Eastern Michigan – 2010-2017; author: “Attack from within: How disinformation is sabotaging America) seeking her expert opinion on what citizens would most likely witness when a constitutional crisis has occurred and recommended action citizens should take.
Two days later, McQuade replied to my inquiry: “1) If a president were to deliberately violate a court order, I think we could consider that a constitutional crisis. 2) Citizens can do many things to push back against abuse of power, such as vote, write to their member of Congress or participate in a protest, but I think the most effective thing a citizen can do is to talk to their friends and neighbors to explain their concerns and rally support.”
Peter Wehner, Republican, who served as the speechwriter for three GOP administrations (i.e., Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush) and senior fellow at Trinity Forum — an American faith-based nonprofit Christian organization — feels Trump has created not one, not two, but three crisis situations. Wehner stated in an April 19-20 Wall Street Journal article “It seems as if we are moving at a rapid speed toward a genuine constitutional crisis, a genuine separation-of-powers crisis and a genuine checks-and-balances crisis.”
All citizens of Utah — regardless of their political preference — can decide if any of the following actions and published repercussions put Utah and her fellow Americans in a precarious dilemma:

Trump has openly defied federal court directives, refusing to halt deportation flights to El Salvador and return an illegally deported Maryland man.
Trump has eliminated and/or dismantled federal agencies — like USAID — by executive order, bypassing Congressional authority.
Trump has claimed the right to withhold or redirect federal funds appropriated by law, undermining Congress’s constitutional power of the purse.
Trump has fired civil service-protected employees, a violation of federal law.
Trump is attempting to end birthright citizenship by executive action, a constitutional right under the 14th Amendment.
Trump has withheld funds from universities without legal justification.
Trump has revoked visas solely because of the holders’ expressed viewpoints, violating First Amendment protections.
Trump has attacked federal judges, questioning their legitimacy and authority, which erodes the independence of the judiciary.
Trump has created DOGE without Congressional approval, challenging the separation of powers.
Trump has set tariffs on our trading partners as opposed to Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution that grants Congress the explicit power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises” and to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.”

Polling by the revered and non-political Reuters/Ispos found 83% of Americans feel “Trump must obey federal court rulings even if he doesn’t want to” (April 20). Wall Street Journal polling has shown, “voters want to keep constitutional guardrails in place that constrain a president’s power” (April 4).
Keep in mind, as of April 26 there have been 211 legal challenges to Trump administration actions (Just Security – New York Univ. School of Law).

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — House lawmakers on Wednesday fought over whether educators should be able to physically discipline disabled students before ultimately voting to send a bill prohibiting the practice to the governor.
Senate Bill 364 prohibits school personnel from “hitting, paddling, spanking, slapping” or using any other physical force on a student with a federally recognized and protected disability. Existing state law only prohibits schools from administering corporal punishments on students with the “most significant cognitive disabilities.”
“It’s really sad, the broad links people will go to to try to twist and turn words to continue to allow people to slap, choke, pull hair, cause bruises, push, shove, and anything else that they can do to a kid with special needs,” said Rep. Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, the bill’s author .
He said only a small percentage of Oklahoma districts — around 60 that he knows of — still allow corporal punishment. But Moore quickly ticked off a list of disabled children who have been choked or paddled by school personnel without parental permission. Moore said he was not going to publicly name the districts.
Nothing in the measure prohibits parents from administering corporal punishment on their disabled children, but schools could not, he said.
“I don’t think a kid with Down syndrome should be spanked,” Moore said. “I don’t think a kid with epilepsy should be beaten. I don’t think a kid with autism should be choked.”
Moore said he’s a devout Christian, a deacon in his church, and administers corporal punishment on his own children. But he said it is appalling that people cite the Bible to justify choking a child with special needs.
“It makes me ashamed to be someone that might be categorized with that person,” he said
House lawmakers have previously garnered national attention for refusing to put such a ban into state law. Administering corporal punishment on disabled children has been banned by the State Department of Education since 2020. Federal records show hundreds of Oklahoma children with disabilities were physically disciplined during the 2020-21 school year. 
Rep. Jim Olsen, R-Roland, said the language of the bill passed Wednesday is nearly identical to the previous measure that failed to advance out of the same chamber about two years ago. 
Olsen said the prior one didn’t advance because of concerns that the number of protected students was too broad and because it stripped away parental power and local control.
Those concerns remain, he said.
There are certainly children who should never have corporal punishment used on them, but Senate Bill 364’s prohibition is too broad because in addition to protecting the profoundly disabled, it also includes students who suffer from hearing, speech and visibility impairments and serious emotional disturbances, Olsen said.
“If you had a 10-year-old boy that was physically healthy, intellectually normal, and he couldn’t say his R’s correctly, under the provisions of this bill, he would be prohibited, even if the parents wanted it, he would be prohibited from having corporal punishment used on him,” he said. “No exceptions.” 
He said the Bible references that the “rod and reproof gives wisdom, but a child left to himself brings his mother to shame.”
“I have observed over the years that when we get to thinking that we’re smarter than the Bible that doesn’t turn out very well,” he said.
Rep. Cynthia Roe, R-Lindsay, said it’s appalling that lawmakers are having to have a conversation about “inflicting suffering on a child that has no idea what is happening.”
She said multiple studies show that students with disabilities have corporal punishment applied at disproportionately higher rates than their non-disabled peers. Multiple child psychology organizations oppose “beating a kid in school,” and most experts recommend non-violent methods to address inappropriate behavior in school, Roe said.
Roe, who is also a child abuse examiner, said corporal punishment signals to a child that the way to settle conflict is by inflicting physical force and pain and that it’s OK to “just slug somebody in the face because you don’t agree with what they’re saying.”
She said lawmakers talk about protecting their children from predators, but are not protecting vulnerable children from punishments they can’t understand.
“They don’t realize that the behavior they’re exhibiting is not appropriate, and they’re not understanding that getting their butt beat is because of the behavior they just exhibited,” Roe said.
But Rep. Kevin West, R-Moore, said lawmakers are stripping parents of the ability to permit the use of an effective discipline method that they know will “get my child’s attention.”
The bill also does nothing to change the fact that children who aren’t diagnosed with a disability can still be subjected to physical discipline in school, he said.
West said lawmakers should be looking at school corporal punishment usage in totality, not just one part. 
The bill leaves the door open for a broad interpretation, and West said he fears that if a school district does allow corporal punishment, there’s a “very, very strong chance that a parent could sue, even if they had given permission.”
The bill, which awaits a decision from Gov. Kevin Stitt, passed 61-23.

The protest was one of over 1,000 planned across the country. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Lawyers for the federal government rejected immigration activist Jeanette Vizguerra’s claim that she is being detained and targeted for deportation because of her political speech, and once again asserted that the case is moving through the incorrect jurisdiction.
The government “had an objectively reasonable justification to arrest (Vizguerra) and detain her — namely, she is not lawfully present in the United States and is subject to a reinstated removal order,” an April 29 filing reads. “The presence of such valid reasons for the arrest and subsequent detention means that her First Amendment retaliation challenge fails.”
The new filing came in response to an amended petition from Vizguerra’s lawyers, which alleged that her March 17 detainment was retaliation for her criticism of the Trump administration and national prominence as an activist, and therefore violated her protected First Amendment rights. The judge in the case, U.S. District Court Judge Nina Wang, issued a temporary block on any deportation efforts for Vizguerra before the court could consider the legality of her detainment.
The case centers on a reinstated removal order from 2013 that Vizguerra’s lawyers say is invalid.
But the federal government argued in its filing that legal precedent shows that noncitizens cannot bring challenges to their removal based on claims of selective enforcement. Lawyers pointed to a 1999 case where eight members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed they were being unconstitutionally targeted for their political beliefs. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately decided that immigrants without legal status do not have the defense of selective prosecution, because that argument only delays deportation proceedings in response to the violation of immigration law.
“The Court reached this decision even after the government admitted ‘that the alleged First Amendment activity was the basis for selecting the individuals for adverse action,’” lawyers wrote. “Here, (Vizguerra) brings a similar challenge to that brought by the noncitizens in (the 1999 case). She argues that (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)’s actions in arresting, detaining, and executing a reinstatement of a removal order against her were improperly based on retaliation for her activism. But she acknowledges that she has no lawful status in the United States.”
The new filing also questions the evidence Vizguerra’s lawyers used to argue that her detainment is retaliatory. Those include various social media posts celebrating her arrest from ICE, a public affairs official for the Department of Homeland Security and former ICE official John Fabbricatore. The posts are distinct in tone from other arrest announcements from the agency on social media because they specifically allude to her activist background and outspoken criticism of the immigration system.
“But she has not presented evidence that either the individuals controlling ICE’s X account or the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs were involved in the decision to detain Petitioner. Accordingly, these posts do not show retaliatory motive,” the filing reads.
The government also asserted that the correct venue for the case would be in the Court of Appeals. A similar case was filed in the 10th Circuit, but has not seen movement.
In a different filing Tuesday, Vizguerra’s lawyers asked the court to clarify that the restraining order against her deportation also includes the so-called reasonable fear interview process. That is a part of removal proceedings where federal officials determine if deporting someone to their country of origin would put them at a serious risk of harm.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began that interview process shortly after Vizguerra’s detainment and have “repeatedly failed to notify counsel in advance of interview scheduling, have repeatedly attempted to proceed with the interview without counsel present, and in at least one instance falsely advised Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez that her attorney had consented to and insisted that the interview move forward without counsel,” lawyer Laura Lichter wrote.
On April 14, USCIS made a negative reasonable fear determination after nearly a month of interview attempts that Lichter said violated due process.
“It is clear that Respondents DHS and ICE are directing USCIS as their agent or otherwise working in active concert or participation with the agency in forcing the conclusion of the reasonable fear process to facilitate, enable, and advance a removal that is temporarily enjoined,” Lichter wrote.
A hearing for the case has not been scheduled.
Vizguerra has lived in the United States since 1997. She was arrested in 2009 for having a fake ID and driving without insurance and was placed in removal proceedings. An immigration judge offered her the option of voluntary departure in 2011, which Vizguerra appealed. She then left the country in 2012 to see her dying mother in Mexico and reentered the United States without authorization in 2013. She was ultimately sentenced to ICE supervision and has been granted multiple stays of removal since then, the last of which expired last year. She gained national attention when she sought sanctuary in Denver churches to avoid deportation during the first Trump administration and was recognized as one of the 100 most influential people by Time Magazine in 2017.

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)
An outside investigation found that last year’s leak of the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s order accepting a case challenging the state’s 1849 abortion law was “likely deliberate,” but was unable to determine its source. 
Last June, Wisconsin Watch published a story detailing the contents of the Court’s draft order agreeing to hear Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin v. Urmanski, the lawsuit challenging the validity of the abortion law. After the leak, all seven members of the Court condemned the order’s release, and the investigation began in August. 
According to a report released Wednesday, investigators interviewed 62 people and reviewed computer records in an effort to find the leak’s source. Despite the inconclusive findings, the report includes a number of recommendations for improving the Supreme Court’s security. 
The draft order was written on June 13 and Wisconsin Watch published its report on June 26. Investigators interviewed the 28 people who had “immediate access” to the draft. They included the seven justices, judicial assistants, law clerks and Supreme Court commissioners, as well as 18 people whose key card data shows they entered the justices’ chambers during that time period, interns and other office staff. 
Investigators requested computer usage data to determine what websites office staff visited during that time frame. The report states, however, that computer usage data from June 13 to 25 is missing. 
“The lack of complete website visitation logs for the period between June 13, 2024 and June 26, 2024 significantly hampered the ability to thoroughly examine the circumstances surrounding the leak,” the report states. “The issue underscores the importance of proper data management, retention, and verification procedures especially when such information is crucial for ongoing investigations.”
No evidence was found during the investigation that would show the leak was caused by an external breach of the Court’s network, according to the report. 
But the report also states that justices and Court staff often send confidential information to the justices’ personal email accounts and leave confidential documents unattended in printer trays. Unauthorized individuals have at times been able to access restricted floors in the Court’s Madison offices, the investigators also found. 
To improve the Supreme Court’s security, the report recommends a number of policy changes. Those include establishing better protocols for the handling of paper copies of confidential documents; stopping the justices’ use of personal email accounts; improving retention of computer history data; and using digital watermarks on confidential documents to ensure “the document remains traceable throughout its lifecycle.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Senate on Wednesday sent Gov. Kevin Stitt a measure that would allow teachers to use unused sick days to extend their existing six-week maternity leave.
House Bill 1601 would allow educators to use up to six weeks of banked sick leave hours to extend their leave.
“Sick leave must be used for recovery from childbirth, bonding with a newborn, or caring for a newborn,” according to the measure.
It would not require approval from the school board or employer, according to the measure.
Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, is the senate author.
He said it wouldn’t cost the state anything.
Mann, a former member of the Oklahoma City Public Schools Board of Education, said he would like teachers to have up to 12 weeks of paid maternity leave.
“But with the budget outlook we have right now, that is not possible,” Mann said.
Some private companies have significantly more paid maternity leave days, he said.
“So, we’ve got to do something because these young mothers, when they have a baby, they want to spend more than six weeks,” Mann said. “And quite frankly, brain research shows us that they need to spend more than six weeks with that newborn.”
Mann said the measure will help recruit and retain teachers.
Six weeks isn’t a lot of time, but it is better than what the state had been doing, which was requiring new mothers to take unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, Mann said.
“I would like to see male staff have at least a month off when they have a newborn,” Mann said. “There are some other things we can do that are pro-family, pro-baby, but I think this is a good, good step in the right direction.”
Senate Education Committee Chairman Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, said he supported the measure, but said lawmakers were making some decisions for schools in terms of staffing.
“I’ve heard many times that we’ll just trust school boards and superintendents to do the right thing,” Pugh said. “But I think if you’ve heard from your teachers on this issue, that is not happening uniformly across every district in the state of Oklahoma.”
The measure passed the Senate by a vote of 39-5.

A five-member board of appointees would manage the state’s $127 billion in investments under House Bill 506. And House Bill 92 would give that board the power to invest up to 5% of the state’s portfolio in cryptocurrency.
The measures represent a concentrated effort to shift the state’s approach to investing. North Carolina’s pension system has a $16 billion deficit, and the fund’s investments have yielded lower returns in comparison to other states’ portfolios in recent years.
State Treasurer Brad Briner, a Republican elected in November, has thrown his support behind both bills. He currently serves as the sole final authority over the state investments. His GOP predecessor, Dale Folwell, had practiced a more conservative approach to the pension fund.

‘Investment authority’ would be appointed, require experience
The five-member North Carolina Investment Authority would include the treasurer and four other members. The treasurer, Speaker of the House, Senate President Pro Tem and governor would be able to appoint one member each.
Appointees would be required to have “expert knowledge of investments” and more than 10 years of “successful management” of pensions, endowments or other investments.
The board would appoint a chief investment officer — someone with similar, if not more extensive, qualifications to board appointees. That CIO would negotiate and execute third-party contracts on behalf of the board.
HB 506 passed the House with little discussion Tuesday, 110-3.
Pension fund could include Bitcoin
The bill to allow investment in cryptocurrency is backed by House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell).
It limits the investments to the crypto equivalent of mutual funds, rather than direct investments in specific currencies.
And it lays the groundwork for the treasurer and law enforcement to examine both a “strategic reserve” of digital assets collected by the state, as well as allowing state employees to invest part of their portfolios in crypto.
The bill’s supporters view it as another plank of proactive and wise investing — arguing that the state should utilize a growing corner of the market.
“We need to spread the allocation around,” said Rep. Keith Kidwell (R-Beaufort). “Just like any good investment broker would do for you.”
But Democrats who opposed the measure warned of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ volatility — and cautioned against betting part of state workers’ pensions on them.
“I still have a lot of questions about this investment strategy and the level of commitment we’re making to it,” said Rep. Maria Cervania (D-Wake).
Opinions on the bill outside of the General Assembly have split. Gov. Josh Stein has said he supports the measure and allowing Briner to have more control over state investments. Representatives of the State Employees Association of North Carolina have expressed opposition.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — A seemingly divided U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday over the nation’s first religious charter school that aims to open in Oklahoma, putting the constitutionality of a state-funded Catholic education to the test.
An Oklahoma state board approved St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to operate as a publicly funded charter school in 2023. The Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the school from opening in a June ruling, finding the concept of a religious charter school a violation of the Constitution’s prohibition against government-established religion.
The nation’s highest Court, with its conservative majority, agreed to hear an appeal of the ruling. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Catholic with ties to two legal groups behind St. Isidore, has recused.

Five of the eight remaining justices who heard the case also are Catholic — John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan is Jewish, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is a nondenominational Protestant.
A decision from the Court is expected by the end of June.
The Court’s liberal justices — Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson — appeared doubtful that previous rulings support the idea that a charter school could constitutionally adopt a religion. Kagan also wondered about the nationwide implications of permitting publicly funded religious schools.
Kavanaugh, part of the Court’s conservative majority, said disapproving a charter school solely on religious grounds “seems like rank discrimination against religion.” Opening charter school funding to faith-based institutions would “be expanding the options, not contracting the options” of school choice in public education, he said.
“All the religious school is saying is, ‘Don’t exclude us based on religion,’” Kavanaugh said.
Jackson and Kagan, though, pointed to ways St. Isidore’s founding contract differs from that of other charter schools. The school pledged to comply with state regulations and non-discrimination laws only to the extent that Catholic doctrine allows.
The Court made prior decisions that religious schools can’t be excluded from government grants and state-funded tuition assistance programs. In those cases, Jackson said, a religious school wasn’t changing the terms of a government program.
“It seems to me you are not seeking the same public benefit as everyone else,” Jackson said.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa applied to open St. Isidore, named after the patron saint of the internet, to offer an online Catholic education to students in all parts of the state, particularly in rural areas with no brick-and-mortar Catholic school.
St. Isidore would be Catholic in all ways but open to students of all belief systems, archdiocese officials have said. Students would have to learn Catholic doctrine and obey school rules inspired by church beliefs.
“We are grateful that the U.S. Supreme Court heard our case and now entrust it to their wisdom,” Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley and Tulsa Bishop David A. Konderla said in a statement Wednesday. “Of course, we pray and hope for a decision that stands with religious liberty and the rights of Oklahoma families to make their own decisions in selecting the best educational options for their children.”
Both the school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which approved St. Isidore’s founding contract, appealed the state Supreme Court ruling. Oklahoma’s attorney general has led the legal battle against the school.

(Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel of the national conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, presented the statewide board’s oral arguments Wednesday. Michael H. McGinley of Deckert LLP represented St. Isidore.
Both contended charter schools aren’t an arm of the government like traditional public schools. Rather, they are private entities who contract with the state to provide a public service, like a private hospital, and therefore should be free to adopt a religion.
After leaving the courtroom, Campbell said he found the justices “very receptive to the arguments we were making.”
“The law is on our side,” Campbell said. “The First Amendment says when you create a program and invite everyone in but tell only religious groups that they can’t come, that violates the Constitution.”
Former U.S. Solicitor General Gregory Garre, now of Latham & Watkins LLP, gave oral arguments on behalf of the Oklahoma attorney general, who said the concept of a publicly funded religious school is unconstitutional.
Charter schools bear all necessary resemblance to traditional school districts to be considered public, Garre said. The state can open and close a charter school, unlike a fully private institution. They are subject to the equal academic standards as Oklahoma public schools and most of the same regulations, though they have more flexibility over teaching methods and employee hiring.
They are governed by independent boards, though they must contract with a traditional school district, college or university, Native American tribe or a state board that oversees them as a charter authorizer.
Laws in 47 states, including Oklahoma, and federal law all define charter schools as public schools and forbid them from religious affiliation.
Like all public schools, Garre said, charter schools must comply with church-state separation.
Kagan seemed to agree.
“When I look at Oklahoma and its charter schools program, they look like regular public schools,” she said. “These charter schools, except for some things on the margin, are equivalent to public schools. So why shouldn’t we take the state at its word (that they are public)?”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent, despite it having support from fellow Republican leaders in the state.
Drummond contended St. Isidore would create a “slippery slope” leading to charter schools teaching faith systems that most Oklahomans would disagree with — a position Alito said “seems to be based on hostility to certain religions.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt has been a vocal advocate of opening St. Isidore. Standing outside the U.S. Supreme Court building on Wednesday, Stitt said the school “expands choice and freedom,”  and the government shouldn’t stand in the way.
“I think the Supreme Court is going to rule with us because it’s just common sense,” he said.
Charter school advocates feared a ruling in St. Isidore’s favor could cause a widespread closure of charter programs in states that won’t abide taxpayer-funded religious education.
All of a sudden, “we won’t know what the rules are for charter schools anymore in 47 states and the federal level,” said Starlee Coleman, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.
“This is going to shut down the charter school program in many states where there is simply no appetite by state lawmakers to fund religious schools,” Coleman said after oral arguments. “States like California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois where there are millions of children attending charter schools today.”

The township paid for the concert with national opioid settlement funds. (Photo courtesy of Irvington Township)Irvington officials have sued the New Jersey Office of the State Comptroller for defamation, asking a judge to block the fraud watchdog from releasing a forthcoming report they said wrongly slams the township for paying for an “opioid awareness concert” last year with national opioid settlement funds.
Mayor Anthony Vauss and other officials accuse the comptroller’s investigators of an abuse of power, harassment, racial discrimination, and “targeted character assassination” for a draft report the office shared with the township earlier this month for feedback.
While the report has yet to be released, township attorney Ramon E. Rivera teased its contents over 158 pages of briefs and other documents filed Tuesday in state Superior Court in Essex County.
The comptroller’s draft report raises allegations of fraud, contract improprieties, misuse of money, ethical violations and more related to the June 8 concert that drew over 3,000 spectators and featured R&B performers including Musiq Soulchild, Donell Jones, and Q Parker, Rivera wrote.
Investigators claim the township flouted public bidding requirements to give Taj Entertainment a $200,000 contract to run the concert, according to Rivera. He denied that claim, saying retaining high-caliber musical artists is a permissible exception to public-bidding requirements because it’s a service that’s “inherently qualitative and not amenable to traditional competitive bidding.”
Rivera said investigators contend — incorrectly — that the concert was not an “evidence-based” use of opioid settlement funds as required by the settlement agreements, the attorney general, and state law. The funds are part of more than $1.1 billion New Jersey and its local governments expect to receive through 2038 under agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors, and retailers for their roles in the deadly opioid epidemic.
The opioid awareness concerts, where township staff distributed the overdose-reversing drug Narcan and information about opioid addiction and treatment, are a proven community engagement model that other municipalities around the country have used to combat opioid addiction, Rivera wrote. They’re also particularly effective in Black communities, he added. Almost 80% of Irvington’s 61,000 residents are Black, census figures show.
“In its ongoing and increasingly personal crusade against the Township of Irvington, the OSC has not merely made recommendations or raised concerns — it has orchestrated a narrative designed to humiliate, mislead, and destroy public trust in a majority-Black community with an understanding of the needs of its residents,” Rivera wrote. “This is not negligence. It is not misunderstanding. It is not good-faith oversight. It is a pattern of reckless disregard for the truth, weaponized insinuation, and culturally incompetent analysis cloaked in bureaucratic language.”
A separate but related court fight now under way shines more light on the Irvington business dealings state investigators are probing.
The township hosted a similar opioid awareness concert in June 2023 and paid $168,500 to a business called Taj Lounge 973 to run it, without putting that contract out for public bid either, according to a complaint state prosecutors filed in March in Mercer County.
Taj Entertainment and Taj Lounge 973 both are owned by family members of Antoine Richardson, an employee of the township since 2014, the complaint says. Prosecutors said Richardson, who emceed the 2024 concert as “DJ Qua,” his son Tajsh Richardson, and another relative, Trennetha Green-Richardson, have not complied since last summer with subpoenas the comptroller’s office issued in its concert investigation, and they asked a judge to compel compliance. A hearing is set for May 7.
But Rivera, in Tuesday’s lawsuit, said those familial connections were long disclosed and investigators have not proven any “unlawful dual compensation or improper procurement.”
He also defended “the Township’s reliance on a non-traditional timekeeping system for remote employees — including Richardson,” saying no regulations required detailed timesheets for “public DJs.”
He complained that the office circulated its draft report to several state agencies for review.
“It has already weakened the Township’s credibility and has not even been released to the population at large,” he wrote.
Pamela Kruger, a spokeswoman for the comptroller’s office, said investigators are confident in their findings and aim to release the report “very soon.”
“As part of OSC’s standard due process procedures, we sent a copy of our draft report to Irvington and the involved parties to invite comment and correct any factual inaccuracies in the draft prior to publication,” Kruger said. “Irvington went to court in an attempt to further delay our investigation and reporting.”
Besides Vauss and Richardson, the plaintiffs listed in Irvington’s lawsuit are Musa Malik, its business administrator; Faheem Ra’oof, its chief financial officer; and Althea Headley, its director of purchasing.
They want a judge to bar the report’s release and declare that the comptroller’s office exceeded its authority and that their use of opioid settlement funds was lawful. They’re also seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.
The lawsuit is just the latest backlash against the comptroller’s office, which uncovers public fraud, waste, and abuse and recommends policy reforms. Lawmakers still have not confirmed acting state Comptroller Kevin D. Walsh, more than five years since Gov. Phil Murphy put him in the job. Senate President Nick Scutari suggested in January that the state should consolidate its watchdogs, even as public corruption continues to dominate the headlines.
The comptroller’s office has issued critical reports of Irvington’s fiscal management before, urging state leaders last year to appoint an independent monitor to safeguard public funds after township officials failed to remedy financial problems state investigators first uncovered in 2009 and 2011.
Irvington, in turn, has vigorously fought scrutiny of its operations. In 2022, Irvington sued an 82-year-old retired schoolteacher for her “voluminous” public records requests, and the following year, fought an attorney’s records requests and accused him of perjury.
Elouise McDaniel, now 85, beat Irvington’s case against her when the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey and CJ Griffin, an attorney who specializes in public records access, intervened pro bono on her behalf. Wednesday, she urged the comptroller’s office to continue its probe and not be cowed by Irvington’s lawsuit.
“They file a complaint against anyone who is concerned about the misuse of public funds,” McDaniel said. “It’s ridiculous. It’s about time that the mayor stopped this.”

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)WASHINGTON, D.C. — A seemingly divided U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday over the nation’s first religious charter school that aims to open in Oklahoma, putting the constitutionality of a state-funded Catholic education to the test.
An Oklahoma state board approved St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to operate as a publicly funded charter school in 2023. The Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the school from opening in a June ruling, finding the concept of a religious charter school a violation of the Constitution’s prohibition against government-established religion.
The nation’s highest Court, with its conservative majority, agreed to hear an appeal of the ruling. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Catholic with ties to two legal groups behind St. Isidore, has recused.
Five of the eight remaining justices who heard the case also are Catholic — John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan is Jewish, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is a nondenominational Protestant.
A decision from the Court is expected by the end of June.
The Court’s liberal justices — Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson — appeared doubtful that previous rulings support the idea that a charter school could constitutionally adopt a religion. Kagan also wondered about the nationwide implications of permitting publicly funded religious schools.
Kavanaugh, part of the Court’s conservative majority, said disapproving a charter school solely on religious grounds “seems like rank discrimination against religion.” Opening charter school funding to faith-based institutions would “be expanding the options, not contracting the options” of school choice in public education, he said.
“All the religious school is saying is, ‘Don’t exclude us based on religion,’” Kavanaugh said.
Jackson and Kagan, though, pointed to ways St. Isidore’s founding contract differs from that of other charter schools. The school pledged to comply with state regulations and non-discrimination laws only to the extent that Catholic doctrine allows.
The Court made prior decisions that religious schools can’t be excluded from government grants and state-funded tuition assistance programs. In those cases, Jackson said, a religious school wasn’t changing the terms of a government program.
“It seems to me you are not seeking the same public benefit as everyone else,” Jackson said.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa applied to open St. Isidore, named after the patron saint of the internet, to offer an online Catholic education to students in all parts of the state, particularly in rural areas with no brick-and-mortar Catholic school.
St. Isidore would be Catholic in all ways but open to students of all belief systems, archdiocese officials have said. Students would have to learn Catholic doctrine and obey school rules inspired by church beliefs.

“We are grateful that the U.S. Supreme Court heard our case and now entrust it to their wisdom,” Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley and Tulsa Bishop David A. Konderla said in a statement Wednesday. “Of course, we pray and hope for a decision that stands with religious liberty and the rights of Oklahoma families to make their own decisions in selecting the best educational options for their children.”
Both the school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which approved St. Isidore’s founding contract, appealed the state Supreme Court ruling. Oklahoma’s attorney general has led the legal battle against the school.
Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel of the national conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, presented the statewide board’s oral arguments Wednesday. Michael H. McGinley of Deckert LLP represented St. Isidore.
Both contended charter schools aren’t an arm of the government like traditional public schools. Rather, they are private entities who contract with the state to provide a public service, like a private hospital, and therefore should be free to adopt a religion.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
After leaving the courtroom, Campbell said he found the justices “very receptive to the arguments we were making.”
“The law is on our side,” Campbell said. “The First Amendment says when you create a program and invite everyone in but tell only religious groups that they can’t come, that violates the Constitution.”
Former U.S. Solicitor General Gregory Garre, now of Latham & Watkins LLP, gave oral arguments on behalf of the Oklahoma attorney general, who said the concept of a publicly funded religious school is unconstitutional.
Charter schools bear all necessary resemblance to traditional school districts to be considered public, Garre said. The state can open and close a charter school, unlike a fully private institution. They are subject to the equal academic standards as Oklahoma public schools and most of the same regulations, though they have more flexibility over teaching methods and employee hiring.
They are governed by independent boards, though they must contract with a traditional school district, college or university, Native American tribe or a state board that oversees them as a charter authorizer.
Laws in 47 states, including Oklahoma, and federal law all define charter schools as public schools and forbid them from religious affiliation.
Like all public schools, Garre said, charter schools must comply with church-state separation.
Kagan seemed to agree.
“When I look at Oklahoma and its charter schools program, they look like regular public schools,” she said. “These charter schools, except for some things on the margin, are equivalent to public schools. So why shouldn’t we take the state at its word (that they are public)?”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent, despite it having support from fellow Republican leaders in the state.
Drummond contended St. Isidore would create a “slippery slope” leading to charter schools teaching faith systems that most Oklahomans would disagree with — a position Alito said “seems to be based on hostility to certain religions.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt has been a vocal advocate of opening St. Isidore. Standing outside the U.S. Supreme Court building on Wednesday, Stitt said the school “expands choice and freedom,”  and the government shouldn’t stand in the way.
“I think the Supreme Court is going to rule with us because it’s just common sense,” he said.

Charter school advocates feared a ruling in St. Isidore’s favor could cause a widespread closure of charter programs in states that won’t abide taxpayer-funded religious education.
All of a sudden, “we won’t know what the rules are for charter schools anymore in 47 states and the federal level,” said Starlee Coleman, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.
“This is going to shut down the charter school program in many states where there is simply no appetite by state lawmakers to fund religious schools,” Coleman said after oral arguments. “States like California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois where there are millions of children attending charter schools today.”

Lawmakers apparently are close to a deal to resolve one of Springfield’s most hotly contested issues this session: transit reform.

Public transit agencies in Chicagoland — a region with roughly two-thirds of Illinois’ population — face a collective $770 million budget gap in the upcoming fiscal year. Heads of the agencies have turned to the state to fill that gap, but lawmakers have consistently said that reform of the agencies’ government and better oversight are required before addressing funding.

If lawmakers don’t reach a deal to reform the northeastern Illinois transit system and introduce new funding before their May 31 adjournment, transit officials say it will result in significant cuts, which would result in a “nightmare scenario,” according to Regional Transportation Authority spokesperson Tina Fassett Smith.

Sen. Don DeWitte, R-St. Charles, told reporters this week that lawmakers in the Senate “are very close to agreed language on governance,” meaning a deal is close.

DeWitte, a longtime former mayor of suburban St. Charles and ranking Republican on the Senate’s Transportation committee, said the deal would leave in place the three “service boards” that operate transit in Chicago and the suburbs: the Chicago Transit Authority, Metra commuter rail service and Pace Suburban Bus.

The agreement, according to DeWitte, would provide new oversight powers to a “newly empowered” RTA, the agency that currently handles some financial oversight for the region’s transit agencies.

DeWitte was on the 16-member board of directors for the RTA for five years before joining the Illinois Senate.

Several proposals for reform have been pitched in recent months, with the plan outlined by DeWitte being similar to what he called the “labor bill” — a plan initially put forward by a coalition of organized labor groups and unions.

But the brief description has superficial similarities to a plan proposed by RTA chairman and former Republican state senator Kirk Dillard. That plan also would empower the RTA

A more aggressive reform plan, which would have dissolved the three service boards and consolidated them into one agency, was proposed by transit activists and environmentalists. That consolidation plan was formalized into bills presented by Chicago Democrats Sen. Ram Villivalam and Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado.

While DeWitte is familiar with the negotiations, others involved differ on how close lawmakers are to a deal.

Villivalam, who chairs the Senate Transportation Committee, said he and his colleagues are “continuing discussions” about the bill.

“As we head into the remaining weeks of our spring legislative session, I look forward to working toward a solution that provides safe, reliable, accessible, and integrated public transit to the northeastern Illinois region,” Villivalam said in a statement.

The House of Representatives might bring other hurdles to a transit reform deal as lawmakers barrel toward their expected adjournment.

Rep. Marty Moylan, D-Des Plaines, who chairs a House committee that would likely hear a transit reform bill, has said repeatedly that no bill will be called in his committee that doesn’t meet his standards, including addressing concerns about safety on trains and buses.

But he echoed DeWitte’s read on the situation that a proposal similar to organized labor’s pitch will win out.

“That seems to be the consensus of the General Assembly: Leave the boards in, have them do some reforms, and let’s move forward,” Moylan told Capitol News Illinois. “We’re making progress with some of the transit agencies. The RTA still doesn’t get it, but they will by the end.”

‘Irresponsible’ PR campaign

The RTA, to raise awareness and potentially influence negotiations in Springfield, launched the “Save Transit Now” ad campaign earlier this month. That campaign features television and radio ads in English and Spanish as well as ads on billboards, digital signs, newspapers and social media.

The campaign encourages RTA riders to write emails to their lawmakers with the subject line “Save Transit Now: Support $1.5 billion and an empowered RTA” and a prewritten message.

This frustrated several lawmakers involved in transit negotiations.

“To cry broke with one hand and drop three-quarters of a million dollars on a PR campaign with the other is wrong, and frankly, it’s irresponsible,” Rep. Kam Buckner, D-Chicago, wrote in the Chicago Tribune on Tuesday.

Buckner chairs the informal “working group” responsible for negotiating transit issues in the House.

Moylan, meanwhile, said the agency was “wasting all kinds of money” on the campaign, which isn’t going to make the General Assembly change its policies.

“It’s not how it works,” Moylan said. “It may have worked years ago, but not now.”

Fassett Smith, the director of communications at the RTA, said the $750,000 price tag was an upper estimate of the cost and said it is the agencies’ “obligation” to make sure transit riders were aware of the RTA's dire financial straits.

Another potential wrinkle as lawmakers wrap up negotiations comes from Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who is in Springfield this week to meet with lawmakers about the city’s legislative priorities. Among them: transit funding.

“The city of Chicago deserves its fair share, and we're going to continue to advocate for that, as I've already done,” Johnson said at a Tuesday news conference.

Johnson has a strained relationship with lawmakers in Springfield after several perceived missteps since he took office, including dragging his feet in funding migrant aid last year, arriving late in legislative sessions to discuss budget matters, and publicly clashing with Gov. JB Pritzker and other lawmakers over hemp regulation earlier this year.

Johnson has repeatedly in recent months pointed out that Chicagoans make up the majority of ridership among the three transit agencies that make up the RTA. When asked Tuesday whether that means Chicagoans should also be funding a majority of public transportation in the region, Johnson didn’t rule it out.

“That’s a conclusion that one could draw,” Johnson said.

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A tax restructuring plan that would increase income taxes for about a quarter of South Carolina filers and cut them for more than 40% advanced Wednesday in the House.
While the plan is expected to clear the House in the session’s waning days, the Senate’s highly unlikely to take it up. That means the only change in the tax code this year will be a state budget that shaves $290 million in revenue — fulfilling the final cut of a 2022 law.


Tax change impacts
In the first year of the proposed change, the shift in liability would cause:

42% of tax filers to pay, on average, $488 less
24% of filers to pay, on average, $266 more
33% of filers to see no change

Source: S.C. Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office


House Republicans hope sending the tax restructuring plan over to the Senate next week will enable it to reach Gov. Henry McMaster’s desk early in 2026 — in time to be included in the next budget process.
Republicans have long wanted to reduce the state’s top marginal rate to make South Carolina appear more competitive. With the soon-to-be 6% rate still the Southeast’s highest — even though the effective rate is about half that — Republicans contend the state needs to bring it down to keep attracting companies and their executives.
The House’s chief budget writer said it’s about removing the “sticker shock” for businesses.
“We looked out of line with the way we treat our actual tax base,” said Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister.
But Democrats question the need altogether, noting the existing tax structure hasn’t hindered South Carolina from being one of the nation’s fastest-growing states.
“If we are competing for people, we are certainly winning,” said House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, D-Columbia. “The question then lies, who is it that we are competing for that we’re not winning? And why is it that we’re not winning?”
The proposal approved Wednesday by the House Ways and Means Committee on a mostly party-line 17-6 vote is very different from what was initially announced a month ago by GOP lawmakers with much fanfare. After an analysis showed 60% of tax filers would pay more, the pushback prompted House Republicans to put their bill on hold and ask the state’s fiscal experts for a review of options.
“When you get resistance like that, you pack up and try a different path,” said Bannister, R-Greenville.
The new plan selected by his committee no longer moves immediately to a single, flat tax rate (which the bill did as introduced). Rather, it collapses the state’s three tax rates into two — eliminating the bottom rate, which resulted in zero taxes paid, and reducing the top two tiers.
Another reason Republicans give for restructuring the tax code is that it results in 44% of tax filers paying zero state income taxes. Meanwhile, 10% of filers pay for 65% of the state’s total income tax collections.
Republicans say that’s inherently unfair.
“Let’s have a larger percentage of people paying, and let’s lower the burden on everybody,” Bannister said.
Under the changes advanced Wednesday, more than one third of tax filers would still pay zero income taxes.
As the original bill did, the amended version would decouple South Carolina’s income tax code from the federal system.
By being one of just five states to tax “federal taxable income,” South Carolinians start their state tax forms with less income to tax, compared to what they’d file if they lived across the state border.
Taxing adjusted gross income as most states do would make South Carolina’s taxes truly comparable to its neighbors. Republicans contend it would also put South Carolina back in control of state tax collections, instead of being tied to the whims of Washington politics.
Under the proposed two-tier plan, taxpayers would pay 1.99% on the first $30,000 of their taxable income, after all applicable state exemptions and deductions are taken. Every dollar after that would be taxed at 5.39%.
The plan would reduce tax collections overall by $400 million in year one — almost double what the initial bill would have done.
Republicans said that will only reduce anticipated increases in revenues. They contend no cut in state services would be necessary.
The plan calls for eventually reaching a single tax rate of 1.99%. Potential annual cuts would depend on estimated income tax collections rising by at least 5%. Doing so slowly rather than all at once is expected to cause less of a tax shift.
It’s impossible to make structural changes to the tax code without creating winners and losers, said Frank Rainwater, director of the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, which makes the revenue projections legislators use in crafting a state budget.
“There’s a consequence for every action you make,” Rainwater told the committee.
The bill still calls to eventually eliminate income taxes at some point.
Members of the uber-conservative Freedom Caucus have called for immediately eliminating income taxes. But that would require slashing state spending by nearly half.
Last fiscal year, income tax collections totaled $6.1 billion, accounting for nearly 45% of the state’s general fund revenues, according to the state’s fiscal experts.
Rep. Brandon Newton, chairman of Ways and Means’ tax policy subcommittee, said phasing in cuts based on projected revenue increases will avoid cutting essential services.
“This is, in my mind, a responsible way to get rid of the income tax and, in reality, the only rational way to get rid of the income tax,” said the Lancaster Republican.
Of the seven Democrats who sit on the Ways and Means Committee, only one voted to advance the plan: Rep. Leon Stavrinakis of Charleston, who chairs the economic development subcommittee.
Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, the longest-serving legislator in the House, said if the state’s tax code is really making business executives hesitant about locating here, then the problem might be marketing, not the tax structure itself.
She cautioned against pushing through a major change that might result in unintended consequences.
“I just think there are a lot of implications that we may or may not be thinking about,” said the Orangeburg Democrat, who’s also first vice chair of Ways and Means.
She again pointed to the state’s last huge tax swap as a cautionary example.
The 2006 law known by its number, Act 388, increased the state sales tax by a penny on the dollar to reduce homeowners’ property taxes, creating a host of unintended consequences for real estate, business property taxes, and school district budgets that Cobb-Hunter said they’re still feeling two decades later.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/income-tax-newser-wideshot-1024x763.jpg,,,2025-04-30 17:10:27.495238

Patrick Morrisey has approved a Democrat-sponsored bill requiring utility companies to create plans to notify customers of outages and another bill establishing procedure for filling vacancies to state offices.

In November 2023, a gas outage affected about 1,000 residents on Charleston's West Side for weeks. (Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)Gov. Patrick Morrisey has approved a Democrat-sponsored bill requiring utility companies to create plans to notify customers of outages and another bill establishing procedure for filling vacancies to state offices.
House Bill 3263 was introduced in response to a November 2023 gas outage that left more than 1,000 residents of Charleston’s West Side without heat and the ability to cook for weeks. The outage was caused by a “significant sustained water leak” that infiltrated 46 miles of the company’s natural gas distribution system, according to Mountaineer Gas. 
The bill requires that such communication plans at least include a way of notifying customers in advance of planned service disruptions, methods of communication and include an estimate of the duration and end of the outage. The plans are to be filed with the West Virginia Public Service Commission. The bill is effective July 10.
“We would think that utilities would already be required to effectively communicate with their customers during these types of situations and during outages, whether they’re planned or unexpected,” said Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, a West Side resident and sponsor of the bill. “One would think that would already be the law. What we found out in late 2023, is that was not the case. 
“The rate payers, the customers over on the West Side, were not well informed,” he said. “We were getting our information from the media. We weren’t getting updates from the utility.”
Pushkin originally introduced the bill during the 2024 legislative session. It had unanimous support in the House, but stalled in the Senate, he said. 
The bill codifies a requirement the Public Service Commission already has for utility companies. In an October 2024 order, the PSC mandated that the utility companies and cable companies have text and email messaging in place to notify customers of outages.
The legislation is one of two with Democratic lead sponsors that Morrisey signed this year, Pushkin said. 
The governor also signed Senate Bill 586, which requires that when filling vacancies of state officials, justices, judges and magistrates, the appointment be made from the same party that originally held the seat at the time of election, not the party to which the official may have switched before he or she resigned. 
“This is a bill about fundamental fairness and ensuring the will of the voters, and not the party in power, is reflected in filling vacancies in the Legislature,” bill sponsor Joey Garcia, D-Marion, said in a news release.
The bill has been called the “de Soto bill,”  a reference to Joseph de Soto, whose seat in the House of Delegates was vacated after he was arrested on charges of threatening to harm and kill lawmakers. De Soto was elected in November as a Republican then switched to the Democratic party hours before he was arrested. Morrisey appointed a Republican to the seat. The Democrats filed a legal challenge, arguing that House Republicans didn’t follow the proper Constitutional procedure in vacating his seat and that there was legal precedent that the seat should go to Democrats due to de Soto’s party switch.
In 2014, former Sen. Daniel Hall switched parties from Democrat to Republican just days after the election, shifting the control of the body to the GOP. He resigned from the Senate in December 2015, leaving some questions as to which party should fill the seat. The next year, the state Supreme Court ruled that Republicans should replace Hall. 
“The Supreme Court got it wrong in 2016, when they ignored the will of the voters in their decision to allow Daniel Hall’s seat to go to a Republican, ignoring the fact that Hall was elected as a Democrat,” Pushkin said in a news release Wednesday. “The Republicans in the Legislature got it wrong in 2018 when they codified this bad decision into law because it benefited them politically to do so. We knew it was a bad law when earlier this year the Republicans twisted themselves into knots in order to ignore the law they passed in 2018 so they wouldn’t have to fill the vacancy they created in House District 91 with a Democrat.

“Ivy Tech is doing great things in Indiana,” he said in a statement. “I’m honored to be joining such a strong institution, and I’m ready to continue building more value for students and communities across the state.”
Pollio will serve as the 10th president of the institution, succeeding former Lt. Gov. Sue Ellspermann, who announced her retirement after nearly a decade in the role. Pollio starts on July 1.

The school’s board of trustees selected Pollio following a national search process conducted by Issacson Miller and overseen by a search committee. According to a release, Pollio “rose to the top for his passion for students and experience creating results around workforce readiness and academic excellence.”
“Marty Pollio is a results-driven, dynamic leader with immense heart and passion for students,” said Ivy Tech Board Chair Andrew Wilson, who also served as co-chair of the search committee. “We are confident he will build on the innovation and growth we’ve experienced in the last decade and bolster our ability to help more Hoosiers achieve their academic and career goals.”
Pollio spent 28 years with the Louisville school district as both an administrator and an educator, taking the role of superintendent in 2017. After receiving his undergraduate degree from Indiana University, Pollio went to Eastern Kentucky University to secure his master’s degree and obtained his doctorate from the University of Louisville.

(Photo courtesy of New Jersey Assembly)New Jersey’s Department of Labor is unlikely to see its federal funding cut through the end of the U.S. government’s October-to-September fiscal year, but officials remain concerned about the prospect of future cuts, state Labor Commissioner Rob Asaro-Angelo told Assembly lawmakers Wednesday.
“In my mind, we are status quo through the end of September. At that point, we’ll see what Congress does,” Asaro-Angelo told the panel. “It’s hard to predict what’s going to happen, clearly. I think most of the cuts being talked about are not in labor. Traditionally, workforce development has been more of a bipartisan issue.”
Federal dollars account for a significant portion of the department’s annual budget. In the coming July-to-June state fiscal year, the $603.2 million in federal monies the department expects to receive would account for 48.5% of its proposed operational budget.
The impact of federal funding on department staffing is greater. Such monies are set to fund roughly 72.6% of the department’s 3,184 positions in the coming 2026 fiscal year, including all positions administering unemployment insurance, according to budget materials and the commissioner’s testimony.
The department, along with all others receiving federal dollars, faced a federal funding freeze earlier this year under an executive order issued by President Donald Trump that called for the U.S. government to stop to all disbursements of federal financial assistance.
“Remember, the week after inauguration, basically our access and many departments’ access to federal funding ceased,” the commissioner said. “It was, no doubt about it, the craziest time in our department since COVID.”
That order has since been paused under a preliminary injunction issued by a Rhode Island District Court judge.
New Jersey’s unemployment fund is still recovering from record-high jobless claims seen during the pandemic. Asaro-Angelo said the state’s Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund had a balance of $1.6 billion, which he expected would rise to roughly $2 billion after unemployment taxes billed in the first quarter of 2025 were collected.
“We’re very healthy. I give major credit to the folks around me, but also to be clear: We’re healthy because we have ever-increasing employment in New Jersey,” the commissioner said. “These contributions come from workers who are working and employers who are employing people, and as I said in my remarks, we have more workers than ever before, more businesses than ever before.”
Still, the department, in separate responses to lawmakers, cautioned that employers’ unemployment tax rates would remain elevated through fiscal 2027.
It said rates would have been lower in both fiscal 2026 and 2027 were it not for a 2020 law that phased in employer unemployment tax increases in a bid to defray the tax impact of high joblessness.
The overall health of the unemployment trust fund determines the range of employer unemployment tax rates used in a given fiscal year, while an individual employer’s use of unemployment benefits determines their rate within that range. Rates for fiscal 2025 ranged from 0.6% to 6.4%.

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)WASHINGTON, D.C. — A seemingly divided U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday over the nation’s first religious charter school that aims to open in Oklahoma, putting the constitutionality of a state-funded Catholic education to the test.
An Oklahoma state board approved St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to operate as a publicly funded charter school in 2023. The Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the school from opening in a June ruling, finding the concept of a religious charter school a violation of the Constitution’s prohibition against government-established religion.

The nation’s highest court, with its conservative majority, agreed to hear an appeal of the ruling. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Catholic with ties to two legal groups behind St. Isidore, has recused.
Five of the eight remaining justices who heard the case also are Catholic — John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan is Jewish, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is a nondenominational Protestant.
A decision from the court is expected by the end of June.
 Publicly funding religious schools or expanding school choice?

The court’s liberal justices — Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson — appeared doubtful that previous rulings support the idea that a charter school could constitutionally adopt a religion. Kagan also wondered about the nationwide implications of permitting publicly funded religious schools.
Kavanaugh, part of the court’s conservative majority, said disapproving a charter school solely on religious grounds “seems like rank discrimination against religion.” Opening charter school funding to faith-based institutions would “be expanding the options, not contracting the options” of school choice in public education, he said.
“All the religious school is saying is, ‘Don’t exclude us based on religion,’” Kavanaugh said.
Jackson and Kagan, though, pointed to ways St. Isidore’s founding contract differs from that of other charter schools. The school pledged to comply with state regulations and non-discrimination laws only to the extent that Catholic doctrine allows.
The court made prior decisions that religious schools can’t be excluded from government grants and state-funded tuition assistance programs. In those cases, Jackson said, a religious school wasn’t changing the terms of a government program.
“It seems to me you are not seeking the same public benefit as everyone else,” Jackson said.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa applied to open St. Isidore, named after the patron saint of the internet, to offer an online Catholic education to students in all parts of the state, particularly in rural areas with no brick-and-mortar Catholic school.
St. Isidore would be Catholic in all ways but open to students of all belief systems, archdiocese officials have said. Students would have to learn Catholic doctrine and obey school rules inspired by church beliefs.

“We are grateful that the U.S. Supreme Court heard our case and now entrust it to their wisdom,” Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley and Tulsa Bishop David A. Konderla said in a statement Wednesday. “Of course, we pray and hope for a decision that stands with religious liberty and the rights of Oklahoma families to make their own decisions in selecting the best educational options for their children.”
The school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which approved St. Isidore’s founding contract, appealed the state Supreme Court ruling. Oklahoma’s attorney general has led the legal battle against the school.
Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel of the national conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, presented the statewide board’s oral arguments Wednesday. Michael H. McGinley of Deckert LLP represented St. Isidore.
Both contended charter schools aren’t an arm of the government like traditional public schools. Rather, they are private entities who contract with the state to provide a public service, like a private hospital, and therefore should be free to adopt a religion.
After leaving the courtroom, Campbell said he found the justices “very receptive to the arguments we were making.”

“The law is on our side,” Campbell said. “The First Amendment says when you create a program and invite everyone in but tell only religious groups that they can’t come, that violates the Constitution.”
Former U.S. Solicitor General Gregory Garre, now of Latham & Watkins LLP, gave oral arguments on behalf of the Oklahoma attorney general, who said the concept of a publicly funded religious school is unconstitutional.
Charter schools bear all necessary resemblance to traditional school districts to be considered public, Garre said. The state can open and close a charter school, unlike a fully private institution. They are subject to the equal academic standards as Oklahoma public schools and most of the same regulations, though they have more flexibility over teaching methods and employee hiring.
They are governed by independent boards, though they must contract with a traditional school district, college or university, Native American tribe or a state board that oversees them as a charter authorizer.
Laws in 47 states, including Oklahoma, and federal law all define charter schools as public schools and forbid them from religious affiliation.
Like all public schools, Garre said, charter schools must comply with church-state separation.
 Should religious charter schools receive taxpayer dollars?

Kagan seemed to agree.
“When I look at Oklahoma and its charter schools program, they look like regular public schools,” she said. “These charter schools, except for some things on the margin, are equivalent to public schools. So why shouldn’t we take the state at its word (that they are public)?”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent, despite it having support from fellow Republican leaders in the state.
Drummond contended St. Isidore would create a “slippery slope” leading to charter schools teaching faith systems that most Oklahomans would disagree with — a position Alito said “seems to be based on hostility to certain religions.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt has been a vocal advocate of opening St. Isidore. Standing outside the U.S. Supreme Court building on Wednesday, Stitt said the school “expands choice and freedom,”  and the government shouldn’t stand in the way.
“I think the Supreme Court is going to rule with us because it’s just common sense,” he said.

Charter school advocates feared a ruling in St. Isidore’s favor could cause a widespread closure of charter programs in states that won’t abide taxpayer-funded religious education.
All of a sudden, “we won’t know what the rules are for charter schools anymore in 47 states and the federal level,” said Starlee Coleman, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.
“This is going to shut down the charter school program in many states where there is simply no appetite by state lawmakers to fund religious schools,” Coleman said after oral arguments. “States like California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois where there are millions of children attending charter schools today.”

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)State tourism officials plan to spend nearly $1 million to promote Rhode Island on the HISTORY Channel through next July as the network commemorates the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States.
The Rhode Island Commerce Corporation has partnered with the HISTORY Channel to air commercials promoting the first state to declare independence from Great Britain as part of the networks’ “History Honors 250” campaign. The deal is the network’s first with any state, according to the corporation’s April 25 announcement.
“You can’t tell the story of America without telling the story of Rhode Island,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement. “Showcasing Rhode Island’s rich HISTORY through this partnership with the HISTORY Channel not only honors our state’s heritage — it drives tourism and strengthens our local economy.”
“History Honors 250” will share Rhode Island’s role in American HISTORY through specially produced segments to air on the cable network, along with ads during select prime-time shows.
But the Commerce Corporation is keeping hush on what historic moments will be featured in the $965,000 campaign. Spokesperson Matt Touchette said ads were still being developed by a third-party company as of Tuesday afternoon. He declined to name the third party company, saying the terms of the contract are confidential.
“When we’re ready to release more details, I’ll be sure to let you know,” Touchette said in an email.
Meanwhile, in response to an inquiry from Rhode Island Current, McKee’s office offered via email: “The Governor is excited to see the rich history of Rhode Island showcased nationally—including the legacy of Roger Williams and the Burning of the Gaspee.”  
Rhode Island’s partnership with the HISTORY Channel will include themed editorial articles and video content posted online, as well as social media engagement through branded posts and influencer collaborations, Touchette said.
The Rhode Island Commerce Corporation will hold a sweepstakes, which the HISTORY Channel will promote on social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook along with an interactive trivia unit to highlight the state’s historic milestones, cultural contributions, and notable figures.
The ad campaign is scheduled to kick off May 22 and run through July 5, 2026.
“Rhode Island holds a pivotal role in the rich tapestry of our nation’s HISTORY, and we are excited to craft engaging content that not only resonates with audiences today but also inspires future generations,” Niki Mandell, vice president of media solutions at A+E Global Media, HISTORY Channel’s parent company, said in a statement.

(Ethan DeWitt | New Hampshire Bulletin)A federal judge in New Hampshire ordered the Trump administration to restore the immigration record of a Dartmouth College student from China, weeks after it was deleted without warning.
In an order released Tuesday, Judge Samantha Elliott of the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), requiring that the student’s record be put back and stopping it from being eliminated again. The injunction will last for the duration of a lawsuit filed by the student, Xiaotian Liu.
Liu, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science, received an email from the college on April 4 informing him there was no longer a record of him in the federal Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), the DHS database that displays the immigration status for international students. Liu’s visa was not revoked and he did not face deportation, but the deletion of the record forced him to stop his doctoral research, and stop earning a salary from the college.
Initially, the department did not provide a reason. Liu later sued to restore the record with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire and Ron Abramson, an attorney for Shaheen & Gordon. He claimed the record deletion violated the Administrative Procedure Act, as well as his Fifth Amendment right to due process, as there was no warning and no way to contest the decision. 
DHS later suggested in an affidavit that the record was deleted in part due to an incident at the Detroit Airport in 2022 in which Liu encountered an administrative error with his study visa and was required to return to China temporarily. And lawyers for the government sought to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that DHS had authority over the database and that Liu had not proven that he was irreparably harmed, since he could still transfer to Ph.D. programs in other countries. 
But Elliott disagreed, writing that Liu’s inability to continue his research “has significant and irreparable consequences for his academic trajectory.” She noted that Dartmouth policy caps funding for doctoral research to five years, and said the record deletion could put Liu in a position where he could fail to finish his Ph.D. 
Elliott also noted that if he were blocked from his research for a substantial length of time, Liu could be found to be out of compliance with his student visa requirements, which could lead to his immigration status being terminated. That, in turn, could lead to deportation. 
“… The termination of Liu’s F-1 status and SEVIS record exposes him to the possibility of removal,” Elliott wrote. “The threat of removal constitutes irreparable harm in this case because of the interplay between Liu’s immigration status and his academic and professional development.”
The order came after the Trump administration announced Friday that it would restore the SEVIS status for thousands of students whose status had been effectively suspended when the records were deleted. But in Liu’s case, Elliott’s order guarantees that his status will remain unchanged and his SEVIS record intact for the duration of the trial.
The order does not end the legal fight; lawyers for both sides are now moving into the discovery phase of the lawsuit, and will eventually return to the district court for a trial.
“We are thrilled that this court ruling means Xiaotian can continue researching what he loves — computer science — right here in New Hampshire,” said Gilles Bissonnette, legal director of the ACLU of New Hampshire, in a statement. “The court made clear today that no administration can circumvent the law to unilaterally punish students who have followed all of the rules and strip them of their legal status, disrupt their studies, and put them at risk of deportation.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Xiaotian-Liu-press-conference-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-04-30 16:07:16.842236

(Photo: Aire images/ Getty)Forgoing a moratorium on new artificial turf fields, lawmakers are recommending the state still study the effects they could have on public health and the environment. 
The members of the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee who were present for a work session Wednesday afternoon unanimously endorsed an amended version of LD 1177. The bill will next go to the Maine House of Representatives and Senate for approval.
Originally, the bill sought to place a three-year moratorium on the installation and reinstallation of synthetic turf athletic fields while the Department of Environmental Protection conducted a study to determine how those materials interact with the health of local environments and the people who recreate on those fields. 
However, the amended bill backed by the committee nixed the moratorium and narrowed the study to look at how synthetic turf affects ambient air, groundwater and surrounding organisms, as well as disposal options once the fields reach the end of their life. The study would also evaluate any release of microplastics from the fields and the effect of that on the surrounding environment and human health. 
The department would need to submit a report to the Legislature with its findings in the study by January 2028.
Commissioner Melanie Loyzim said the department is comfortable with the amended proposal and feels it is within their expertise and jurisdiction. However, she said it will require additional resources so the bill will likely end up on what is called the “special study table,” where legislative leaders determine which studies will get funded. 
If the department used an environmental consulting firm to assist with the study, Loyzim said it could cost around $100,000 to $200,000, but the department would look to use students and research resources from the University of Maine, potentially, to bring those costs down. 
Sen. Denise Tepler (D-Sagadahoc), who co-chairs the committee, said it was interesting to hear conflicting science on the issue, so she thinks an analysis of existing literature and any new research would be helpful for future decision making. 
Her fellow co-chair, Rep. Vicki Doudera (D-Camden), echoed the sentiment, describing the turf issue as “tricky.” 
“I really am in support of studying this further and getting a handle on what’s going on,” Doudera said.

(Photo courtesy of Andy O'Brien/ Maine AFL-CIO)When Scott Surette left the U.S. Marine Corps after serving in the Gulf War, with tours in Iraq and Kuwait, he took a job at the U.S. Postal Service. 
Like millions of other veterans, he was drawn to the stability of federal employment and benefits, including the military buy back program that allows veteran workers to count military service as a credit towards their retirement. 
Now, he says, “the contract we make as a country with veterans is currently being broken.”
During a news conference in Augusta on Tuesday, Surette, who serves as president of Branch 122 of the National Postal Mailhandlers Union Local 301, spoke alongside state and national union leaders who highlighted the disproportionate impact that federal cuts will have on veterans. 
National AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said she’s travelled the country to hear from workers impacted by federal cuts. Asked about what she’s heard from union members who supported President Donald Trump, she said that his recent executive order that ended collective bargaining rights for federal unions was a wake up call for many. 
“And so whether you’re in the federal sector, public sector, the private sector, this injury to one is an injury to all is really starting to take hold within our labor movement,” Shuler said. “And I think working people broadly see what’s on the horizon.” 
Cynthia Phinney, president of the Maine AFL-CIO, pointed out that with an estimated 106,000 veterans, Maine has the highest concentration of any state in the nation. And nationally, roughly one in three federal workers is a veteran. 
She said widespread federal worker layoffs, including the Trump administration’s reduction in force plan to return staffing at the Department of Veterans Affairs to 2019 levels, which could cut more than 80,000 jobs, is a “betrayal of the promise we made to men and women in uniform.”
Pointing out those layoffs would amount to 15% of the total staff of the VA, Surette said, “We know what that will mean. It’ll mean delays in veterans seeking care. It will mean delays in receiving benefits. It’ll mean harm to veterans. It’ll mean a decline in the quality of care veterans receive. It will mean a promise broken. And as a veteran, that is just plain wrong.”
Liz Harkins, who works in the Veterans Benefits Administration and serves as tri-state president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 2604, representing more than 1,600 employees across New England, said VA employees are “essential workers” who deliver critical health care, essential benefits and other services to “ensure that every veteran receives what they have rightfully earned.”
She said since the 2022 signing of the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins (or PACT) Act, which expanded health care coverage and benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances like Agent Orange and open-air burn pits, the agency has seen an “unprecedented surge” in the number of veterans being served.
Noting that VA staff are “already operating under staffing constraints,” Harkins said the proposed layoffs “will have devastating consequences,” causing further delays in both health care and processing services. 
The event Wednesday came on the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. It also marked the conclusion of a two-week long listening session organized by the national AFL-CIO.

(Photo courtesy EVHS)A teacher at an Española high school recently sounded the alarm after a principal requested teachers fill out a database of student information, including citizenship status, as part of an abruptly announced standardized test. 
The 11th grade teacher called a representative with the National Education Association teachers’ union, which sent a cease-and-desist notice to the district superintendent and also told its members not to comply with the information collection, a union spokesperson told Source New Mexico. The spokesperson also said the school where this occurred is Española Valley High School. 
“It came to our attention that a request was made to our educators in Española to determine the immigration status of students in order to, supposedly, register them for a standardized test,” National Education of New Mexico President Mary Parr-Sanchez said in an email. “The request fell outside the scope of our Collective Bargaining Agreement, and our members were informed that they need not to comply.”
The teacher, who declined to comment to Source New Mexico, posted April 21 on an educators’ forum on Reddit that administrators were seeking student citizenship status as part of the rollout of WorkKeys, a job skills assessment run by the same company that does the annual ACT exam for high schoolers preparing for college.
“It is a test that no one at the school has ever administered before and from the way admin explained it, it sound[s] like our new superintendent kind of just sprung it on us out of the blue,” the teacher posted. “(It’s worth noting that we have only 5 weeks of school left, so to introduce an entirely new assessment so late in the year seems highly odd.)”
The request for citizenship status in the Española school occurs amid widespread fears among Hispanic and immigrant communities about federal raids and how citizenship status databases could be used to aid in mass deportation. The Legislature this session passed legislation, which the governor signed, aiming to prevent citizenship status data collected locally from being sent to federal immigration authorities. 
NM advocates call for statewide immigrant data protections amid fear of mass deportation

“Especially given the political climate, this seems like data that is highly improper to request from students,” the teacher wrote. 
Española Superintendent Eric Spencer told Source in an email Friday that he got an email from the NEA “regarding their concern related to testing.” He said his staff has made contact with union leadership and is working with them on the issue. 
“The district takes all matters of student confidentiality seriously,” he said. 
Spencer did not return emails and calls seeking further comment this week. Members of the Española School Board also did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
According to the union, the emailed letter from the union cited the 1982 Plyler v. Doe U.S. Supreme Court case that guarantees the right to a free, public education for all children, regardless of their immigration status. 
“Children, regardless of their immigration or citizenship status, should be free from worry that the educators and administrators tasked with their instruction, safety and well-being would ever seek to cause them harm,” Parr-Sanchez said in a statement to Source NM. 
NM immigration, civil rights groups back enhanced digital privacy protections

Following the back-and-forth with the union, the superintendent has “responded to our cease and desist letter and informed us that the behavior has stopped,” NEA-NM spokesperson Adell Medovoy told Source. The union declined to provide the letter, calling it “internal communications,” she said.
The union is unaware whether the request for citizenship status went to other schools in the district, “although we are on the alert,” Medovoy said. 
A lawyer for the union involved in the cease-and-desist actions, Todd Wertheim, told Source in a brief phone conversation Monday that it was possible a second letter would be necessary soon, though he did not elaborate and did not respond to follow-up phone calls.
Also unclear is why administrators would have tied the ACT’s WorkKeys standardized assessment to a request for student immigration status. The company describes the assessment as a way to determine job-readiness for certain industries, evaluating students’ on “a range of hard and soft skills relevant to any occupation, at any level, and across industries.”
Juan Elizondo, a spokesperson for the ACT, told Source in an email Tuesday that his company has no clue why anyone taking the exam would be asked for immigration status. 
“We cannot speak to why any examinee would be asked about immigration status in connection with an ACT exam,” he said. “This is not a requirement for taking our exams and is not information we collect or use in any way.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/evhsfront_1000.jpg,,,2025-04-30 16:07:16.842236

(Getty Images)A recent policy change by the largest private insurer in New Mexico could result in patients with severe asthma facing additional delays for care.
So says Dr. Michelle Harkins, a pulmonary critical care doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital, in response to a new policy rolled out earlier this month by Blue Cross Blue Shield that mandates asthma patients on a class of injectable drugs self-administer those drugs at home unless their doctors receive prior approval from the insurance company.
“Delaying care by constantly doing prior authorizations is always concerning, not just for asthma, but for the many other specialty medications,” Harkins said. “We want to be able to provide the appropriate care to the right patient in a timely fashion to improve their quality of life.”
The change — which was effective immediately — applied only to patients in New Mexico, Texas, Illinois, Oklahoma and Montana, where Health Care Service Corporation operates Blue Cross Blue Shield, and excludes patients on Medicare, the public health insurance for people 65 and older or Medicaid, which insures low-income people and families, the company said.
The company’s officials declined an interview with Source NM.
“Health Care Service Corporation is committed to expanding access to quality, cost-effective physical and behavioral health care. We updated medical policies for some medications that are FDA-approved for self-administration,” Business Manager Amanda Douglas said in a written statement. “Our policy revision was made with the interests of our members in mind — promoting access to treatment that is convenient and effective.”
Douglas further wrote that patients can contact the company with questions using the number on their member ID or log in to the website Blue Access.
The policy change applies to four medications all in a class of complex drugs called biologics that are expensive to produce and in high demand for treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and other inflammatory conditions. A year of treatment can cost tens of thousands of dollars for monthly or semi-monthly injections.

New Mexico’s asthma rates
Asthma, a chronic lung disease characterized by inflammation and hyper-reactive airways that can cause shortness of breath, coughs, wheezing and chest tightness, affects about 25 million adults and children nationwide.
New Mexico’s asthma rate is about equal to national levels, according to Deyonne Sandoval, a coordinator and evaluator for the state Department of Health’s Environmental Public Health Tracking program.
“Asthma is a complex, highly prevalent costly health condition that affects people in New Mexico statewide,” Sandoval told Source, noting that in 2023, 9.7% of New Mexico adults — about 162,000 people — reported having asthma, and an estimated 1 in 13 children is diagnosed with asthma in the state.
Numbers aren’t broken down by severity, Sandoval said.
A variety of factors can cause asthma, including: genetics, allergies and exposure to certain types of chemicals or other elements that can prompt asthma over time at home or in workplaces.
“In New Mexico, adults and children living in households making less than $25,000 tend to have a high prevalence and poorly controlled asthma,” Sandoval said. National health research attributes high prevalence of asthma to lower-quality housing, which can harbor more triggers, such as mold, poor ventilation and various allergens.
The New Mexico Department of Health recommends anyone diagnosed with asthma to immediately work with a doctor to explore medications, reduce potential triggers and create an asthma management plan.
Additional delays
The insurance changes target medications for patients with very severe asthma, Harkins said.
Patients manage asthma with a variety of medications, depending on the severity, with some medicine used as-needed, daily medication or other long-acting medications to open up airways. But even then, that may not be enough.
“Typically, when a patient is on full therapy and they’re still having problems — needing the rescue inhaler several times a day, or they’re waking up at night or their asthma is not well-controlled — then I may start to look at using a biologic,” Harkins said.
Harkins established UNMH’s severe adult asthma clinic; has assisted the state with its health study on the rate of disease in adults and children; and currently treats patients with asthma.

Has the recent Blue Cross Blue Shield change on biologics affected you? Email reporter Danielle Prokop, or call or text (505) 226-2663. 

She said these drugs can be “a game-changer” for people with severe asthma. Biologics already requires insurance companies permission to prescribe, so the new requirement adds additional red tape.
Harkins said she and her office staff have to spend a significant amount of time justifying the use of biologics in current patients: printing out notices, submitting for review, potentially appealing a denial.
“Sometimes it’ll take three or four times before the use of a drug is approved,” she said.
Biologics not only require permission for initial prescription, they require renewal every year.
Harkins said she understands these are expensive treatments, and that insurance companies want to ensure patients actually need them.
“But then to ask for yet another prior authorization on top of the prior authorization for medications is always a concern, because so much of our time in the clinic is spent justifying why this patient deserves this medication, why we think it’s the best,” Harkins said.
Side effects from biologics are often minor: rashes, dry eyes, joint pains or irritation at the injection site. But very rarely, this class of drugs can cause anaphylaxis, a life-threatening tightening of the airways that can lead to cardiovascular collapse.
This rare, severe reaction usually happens at the beginning of treatments, so Harkins said she always starts new biologics patients on injections in the office. Since the treatments can last years, some patients subsequently opt to take them at home.
“For those patients that take their biologics at home, I have prescribed them an EpiPen, something to treat anaphylaxis, in case anything happens, they can self-administer,” she said.
Harkins said the changes have not caused an impact for her yet, but she’s had several patients undergoing the prior authorization process just to access the medication. She worries they’ll face further delays in receiving care.
“These kinds of decisions take the decision-making between the doctor and the patient away,” she said.

The $2.4 million in terminated Vermont grants funded positions that focused on “everything from housing placement services, food security, to job training, to after school programming” and flood recovery, said Philip Kolling, who oversees AmeriCorps programs in the state.

Photo courtesy of Erin Riley, AmeriCorps program director at the Vermont Housing and Conservation BoardThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.Soon after floodwaters inundated Montpelier in July 2023, the city tasked its Parks and Trees Department with running a central hub for flood response. That meant Marek Zajac, an AmeriCorps member serving with the department, spent long hours under a tent in the capitol’s downtown. The now 32-year-old kept track of which neighbors needed their homes mucked and gutted — and dispatched available volunteers. With City Hall flooded, “there was nowhere to go to interact with the city — except for us,” Zajac said. “We became both an emotional support…and a way to find help.”Now, Zajac’s job — which involves managing street trees and a community farm when the city isn’t experiencing a disaster — is on pause. That’s due to the latest round of federal cuts to the independent government agency that funds the service position they have held for nearly three years.Last week, AmeriCorps began terminating nearly $400 million in grants across the country that funded thousands of jobs like Zajac’s, including about $2.4 million in funding for service positions in Vermont. An April 25 grant termination letter sent to Philip Kolling, the executive director of SerVermont — which oversees the bulk of the state’s AmeriCorps members — said the state’s grant “no longer effectuates agency priorities” and demanded that recipients “immediately cease all award activities.” The $2.4 million in terminated Vermont grants funded positions that focused on “everything from housing placement services, food security, to job training, to after school programming — and then, importantly, these days, flood recovery,” Kolling said. The grants flow through five state entities, including the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps, and the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation. The terminations impact about 200 AmeriCorps positions, Kolling said. About 70 are currently filled, with many slated to begin this spring and summer, he said. Some are government positions, like Zajac’s, and many others are at nonprofits. Several days after that notice arrived, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined a multi-state lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s termination of AmeriCorps grants and positions. The suit, filed on April 29, argues that the administration’s efforts to gut the congressionally-created agency violate the separation of powers enshrined by the U.S. Constitution. “I’m suing to stop the Trump Administration from dismantling AmeriCorps — which the executive branch lacks the authority to do — and prevent the further degradation of Vermont’s workforce and housing,” Clark said in a statement on Tuesday.The funding cuts constitute about 40% of the roughly $6 million Vermont receives annually for AmeriCorps programs, Kolling said. Positions that focus on anti-poverty initiatives and programming for seniors are not impacted by the terminations, he added.READ MORE





 


Vermont Habitat for Humanity programs lose AmeriCorps volunteers after federal cuts

A separate AmeriCorps program, focused on affordable housing and disaster recovery, dismissed its members earlier this month, ending their service terms early and sending them home. SerVermont does not oversee that program.The corps members under the SerVermont umbrella have not been officially let go. “None have been exited from service yet,” Kolling said. “We’re assessing the impacts, and in the meantime, they’re on pause.”AmeriCorps members receive a modest living stipend while they serve. Zajac relies on food stamps and a federally-funded phone program to get by, they said. While they wait to return to work, they’re worried about being able to make rent.“Already, housing can feel impossible to figure out, especially for someone without much means,” they said. “The commitments that I’m in in terms of a lease agreement…I don’t know how I’m going to be able to meet without being able to count on that regular living stipend.”For Jill DeVito, 51, who serves at the Bonnyvale Environmental Education Center in West Brattleboro, the main concern is maintaining health insurance if her teaching position disappears.“Each of us has our own personal lives upended in different ways,” she said.Erin Riley, the AmeriCorps program director for the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, said the pause in service will have an immediate impact on the daily operations of the organizations where members work. But the federal cuts are also emotionally devastating for the dozens of Vermont AmeriCorps members, many of whom have relocated here and have dedicated themselves to giving back to their host communities. “To have that ripped away, I think, is just heartbreaking and, honestly, infuriating,” Riley said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Feds cut more AmeriCorps programs, jeopardizing 200 positions in Vermont.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AmeriCorps_Riley-contributed_043025-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 16:07:16.842236

Data centers are driving near-term energy demand in the region, according to a new regional power forecast from the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. (Rian Dundon/Oregon Capital Chronicle)Demand for electricity in the Northwest could double by 2046, according to a new energy forecast from regional experts.
Over the next two decades, demand could increase by between 1.8% and 3.1% annually, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council heard Tuesday. The projected growth will come primarily from companies building more data centers in the region, more electric vehicles on roads, electrifying buildings, computer chip manufacturing and the production of “green hydrogen” created by running an electrical current through water to split the molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.
Idaho doesn’t produce energy like it used to. How drought, renewables are changing our landscape.

Council staff presented the 20-year forecast for electricity demand in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and western Montana on Tuesday to the council’s eight, governor-appointed members. Each state’s governor gets to appoint two representatives.
 Energy demand from PNW data centers, EVs expected to drive load growth

“The data centers, naturally in our forecasts, are the very early load growth driver here. They’re the big driver of near term demand,” Steven Simmons, senior energy forecasting analyst, told the council.
Energy demand from data centers and from all electric vehicles in the region are expected to be equal by 2046, and demand from EVs is likely to surpass data center demand after 2046, Simmons said.
Residential and commercial demand, which includes forecasted energy demand for electric vehicle charging at homes and buildings, but does not include data centers, is expected to grow more gradually. Demand for residential and commercial energy in Washington alone will equal the combined demand from those sectors in Oregon, Idaho and Montana during the next two decades.
The energy forecast, part of the council’s forthcoming Ninth Northwest Regional Power Plan to manage demand, does not yet include some possible variables that could reduce future demand, such as improved energy efficiency in cars, buildings and some industries as a response to demand, as well as growing adoption of rooftop solar on residential and commercial buildings.
But rapidly growing demand now means electricity grids in the Northwest and across the U.S. are encountering transmission constraints, and scaling infrastructure to meet demand has been slow due to supply chain delays and issues, staff said.
Council staff expect the biggest growth in data center and computer chip energy demand will occur in eastern Oregon, eastern Washington, and the Portland and Boise metro areas, based on historical trends and announced projects.
There are more than 100 data centers in Oregon, and there are eight in Iadho, according to the company Data Center Map. There are more than 5,000 data centers throughout the U.S. according to Statista — the most in any country.
Oregon’s data center market is the fifth largest in the nation, according to Chicago-based commercial real estate group Cushman & Wakefield. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and X, formerly named Twitter, have massive data centers in eastern Oregon as well as in The Dalles, Hillsboro and Prineville.
 What’s next? Windfarms, solar installations, battery storage and other forms of energy to play a role

To develop its next power plan, the council will evaluate supply side resources, including the potential for more regional windfarms, utility-scale and small-scale solar installations, better battery storage and more geothermal and fracked gas sources, among other options.
The council has published regional power plans about every five years since 1983, to lay out how the region will maintain an affordable and adequate power supply. A draft of the plan, an update from the last one that was published in 2021, is expected to be ready for public review and input by July 2026 and would be finalized by late 2026, according to council spokesperson Peter Jensen.
The Northwest Power and Conservation Council was formed in 1981 following passage of the federal Northwest Power Act. That act directed the four states to work collaboratively on regional energy planning and to stop the decline of native Columbia Basin fish species that have suffered massive population losses over the last century, primarily from the development of hydroelectric dams in the region.
The council members from Idaho are Jeffery Allen, who was appointed to the council by Gov. Brad Little in 2019 after directing its Idaho office for 10 years, and Ed Schriever, the former executive director and longtime employee of Idaho Fish and Game.
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek in February appointed two new Oregon representatives to the council: Margaret Hoffmann, of Bend, and Chuck Sams, of Pendleton. Hoffman is the former Oregon director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development program and energy adviser to former Oregon Govs. John Kitzhaber and Kate Brown.
Sams, former executive director of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, was most recently director of the National Park Service. Sams briefly served on the council in 2021 before he was appointed to run the Park Service.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The final priority for the 69th Montana Legislature — one many lawmakers campaigned on — passed both chambers on the final day of the session. 
Property tax relief for residential payers has been top of mind for legislators following historic increases in property values during the last few years, with more anticipated this year, according to Department of Revenue estimates. According to one representative, lawmakers debated at least 47 different bills related to property taxes this session. 
On Wednesday, the House took the final votes on a major property tax bills — House Bill 231 — passing it on a bipartisan basis with 69 representatives voting “aye.” 
The Senate on Tuesday passed HB 231, and a coordinated bill, Senate Bill 542, 28-22 and 29-21, respectively, with one Democrat opposing both bills and the GOP split. 
Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, sponsored HB 231 and was largely seen as the architect behind both bills’ final forms, as well as the state budget, working closely with the governor’s office and coalitions of lawmakers to push the massive pieces of legislation through.
“I came here to have residential, owner dwellings get a tax cut. This bill, in conjunction with 542, does that.” Llew on the floor, adding that he anticipated around 30,000 to 40,000 small businesses would also get a cut.

But many hard-line Republicans, especially in the Senate, decried the property tax bills as complicated and burdensome, and the Legislature still had time to come up with a better plan. 
“It’s unfair. It’s complicated. It’s expensive to implement,” said Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray of the two bills. 
“I’m all for providing property tax relief for residential taxpayers, but not with this bill. As I’ve said, this bill’s unconstitutional, it’s violated our rules,” Sen. Greg Hertz echoed. “There’s better ways to do this, and we can. I’m fine if you just kill this thing and Senate Bill 542, and come back in a special session. We need to get it right, and we’re not getting this right.”
A major sticking point for many detractors was that the bills don’t reduce overall property tax collection in the state, but merely shift the burden between different types of properties, an outcome supporters said is only realistic. 
The relief package contains a homestead exemption — championed by Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, that taxes second homes at a higher rate than owner-occupied homes. To prioritize residential homeowners, other shifts would result in higher taxes for some large businesses and utilities, and the bills were heavily opposed by the Montana Chamber of Commerce and energy and utility companies. 
But Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, said the outrage at the shift in taxes was hypocritical. He said that before the 2023 session, lawmakers received a memo from the Department of Revenue warning them that residential property taxes would increase if they didn’t take action. 
“We did nothing. There was a tax shift,” Flowers said. “In some cases — in my case — my taxes doubled in Gallatin County. Doubled. Where was the outrage on that shift? So there’s outrage now, because apparently the oil refinery is going to pay slightly higher taxes. But what about the shift that occurred in 2023 when our residents saw their taxes jack up? Where was the outrage?” 
“…(Our constituents) didn’t ask us to maintain exactly the same taxes on oil refineries.” 
In the House, Jones echoed the same sentiment, asking where the”scream of anguish” had been when taxes shifted towards residential payers. 
Jones said that when residential properties saw tax spikes upwards of 40%, centrally-assessed properties, like refineries and utilities, saw tens of millions of dollars of decrease.
Meanwhile, the average reduction for a median home value in Montana — $360,000 according to DOR revenue Jones cited — would see a $719 decrease in taxes from the previous year.
“I think that’s significant,” Jones said. 
After the new bills are implemented, those types of properties, and business properties, will still be lower than they were four years ago, Jones said. 
The two final property tax bills saw many changes during the last weeks of the session, including last-minute amendments made to HB 231 on Tuesday morning. 
Jones described the final changes as necessary to coordinate the two bills and ease implementation for the Department of Revenue, preventing delays in seeing results for homeowners. Another change also attempts to address an issue with city charters — namely in Sunburst and Billings — that have fixed mills and could potentially see large increases in property taxes.
The latter issue united many lawmakers from the Billings area — including one Democrat — against the bills, saying they’re “bad bills” for the Yellowstone County area.

But overwhelmingly in both chambers the consensus was that Montanans sent lawmakers to Helena to address high property taxes, with these bills as the best option. 
“It’s not a perfect product. I would posit there is no such thing as a perfect product, because the essence of the property tax relief is that somewhere, somehow, there are going to be tax shifts,” Rep. Dave Bedey, R-Hamilton, said in the House.
Bedey added that the disagreements and fingerpointing between various factions of lawmakers — including a Senate coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans who joined together on major pieces of legislation — prevented the Legislature from delivering property tax bills earlier on in the session, as requested by the governor. 
“Yeah, the cake might have been baked. It should have been baked. We should have had it out the oven earlier,” Bedey said. “And now we’re doing the best we can.”
In the upper chamber, Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena, said legislators could go home and be proud of the work they accomplished on property taxes this session. 
An estimated 230,000 to 240,000 homeowners will be impacted by the tax cuts, according to Jones.
“(Those) homeowners will be helped, their rates will go down, their taxes will go down,” Dunwell said. “And you can tell your constituents that will happen.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Capitol_Night-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 16:07:16.842236

State Rep. Liz May, R-Kyle, was not in D.C., but was given a shoutout by the ranch couple for her advocacy on their behalf. May isn’t ready to cheer yet.
“We still don’t know if they can even use the land,” May said. “Is the case truly over?”

In June, a federal grand jury in South Dakota indicted Charles and Heather Maude, of rural Caputa in the western part of the state. The charge was theft of government property. The couple faced possible prison time and fines.
The indictment said the Maudes “did knowingly steal, purloin, and convert to their own use” national grasslands managed by the U.S. Forest Service, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The land in question, according to the indictment, consisted of 25 acres for cultivation and 25 acres for grazing cattle. 
The Maudes have said the prosecution was an overreaction to a property line dispute on land that their family has used for decades.
A federal prosecutor filed for a dismissal of the charges Monday without explanation, and a judge granted the dismissal, following pleas from Republican politicians and officeholders to President Trump’s administration. 
Some of those officeholders gathered with the Maudes on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., for a press conference. Speakers included former South Dakota Governor and current U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and several South Dakota politicians: U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and Gov. Larry Rhoden. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyoming, also spoke.



South Dakota Searchlight reached out to the South Dakota lawmakers’ offices afterward. They did not know the future status of the federal land in question, or the status of the Maudes’ right to use it.
Some of the speakers alleged that the prosecution of the Maudes was politically motivated. The U.S. Department of Agriculture made that claim in a news release Monday, calling the case “a senseless politically motivated prosecution waged by the Biden administration.”
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for South Dakota, which brought the charges, did not respond when asked by South Dakota Searchlight. The U.S. attorney for South Dakota, Alison Ramsdell, was appointed during the Biden administration.
Rollins announced Wednesday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture launched a new complaint portal for farmers and ranchers “who have fallen victim to unfair and politically motivated lawfare originating under the Biden administration” to request an investigation.
Rounds highlighted a bill he’s working on that would establish a mediation process for land boundary disputes between private landowners and the U.S. Forest Service.

(Photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)Utah families struggling with their grocery bill will have a little extra relief this summer, with the “SUN Bucks” program looking to fill the void left by free school meals.  
Once the school year ends, families will be able to get an extra $120 per eligible school-age child to buy groceries. Sometimes called Summer EBT, the program is available for families that already receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits. Families on Medicaid or whose children already qualify for free or reduced school meals are also eligible. 
“SUN Bucks is a federal program to help combat childhood hunger,” said Muris Prses, director of eligibility at the state’s Department of Workforce Services, in a statement. “This is a great way for families to stretch their grocery budget during the summer.”
According to the Utah Food Bank, at least 1 in 8 Utahns, and 1 in 6 children, are food insecure, meaning they lack consistent access to enough food to live a safe and active life. 
That adds up to about 415,000 people in Utah who aren’t sure where their next meal will come from.
Despite opt-outs by GOP states, debut of kids’ summer food program seen as a success

Utah was among 13 states with Republican governors that opted out of the federal program last summer, opposing what they called “welfare” and signaling unwillingness to cover administrative costs. Even with some states choosing not to participate, the program was hailed as a success despite some challenges in its first year.
The Utah Legislature this year passed HB100 requiring that the state join Summer EBT, while also granting free school lunch to any students who qualify for reduced-price meals.
Summer EBT is expected to support an estimated 260,000 Utah children. 
According to data from Feeding America, San Juan County has some of the highest rates among young people, with about 26% of children there experiencing food insecurity — neighboring Garfield County is not far behind, at about 25%. 
With the SUN Bucks program, these families can buy foods like meat, fruit, vegetables, whole grains and dairy products at places that accept SNAP benefits, like grocery stores and farmers markets. The state’s “Double Up Food Bucks” program allows these benefits to earn an extra $2 for every $1 spent on fresh produce. 
Eligible children will be automatically enrolled in the program, according to the state — families whose children attend a school where students already receive a free lunch can apply at the state’s website.
SUN meals is a similar program offering free meals and snacks for school-age children, offering a to-go option for pickup or delivery in rural areas.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A bill that would have allowed people to win release from pretrial detention by paying a partial amount of a bond died in an Alabama Senate committee on Wednesday.
The Senate Judiciary Committee deadlocked on HB 42, sponsored by Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, in a tie vote of 5-5. All the Democrats on the committee and committee chair Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, voted for the bill. The remaining Republicans on the committee abstained or voted against the measure.
No member offered a reason for their vote except for Sen. Josh Carnley, R-Enterprise, who said he was voting the way he was after speaking with judges and court officials before he cast his vote.

The legislation would have restored three words to the current bail bond statute — “a part of” — to allow judges to order defendants to pay percentage bonds to secure their release from pretrial detention, which was removed when the Legislature enacted the Bail Reform Act of 1993.
“All the bill does is add back three words to the code that were taken out a few years ago when we passed a bail reform bill,” England said to the committee during the meeting Wednesday.
The legislation passed the House with bipartisan support on April 15.
It is one of two bills aimed at changing the state’s bail system, and the only one that the Alabama Bail Bond Association publicly opposed as it made its way through the Legislature.
Chris McNeil, president of the Alabama Bail Bond Association and who owns a bail bond company, suggested that the bill, if enacted, would increase the rates at which defendants failed to appear in court for their cases.
England said that those figures are not a fair comparison.
England filed the same bill during the 2024 legislative session. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the legislation last year but it stalled in the Senate chamber.

Joseph Shekarchi is seen presiding over the House of Representatives during the 2024 session. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)When House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi rolled out a 12-bill housing package in late February, he wasn’t thinking about one of his private law practice clients from four years ago.
But after Shekarchi got an email from a resident of Cranston’s Alpine Estates a month later, he questioned whether his day job might conflict with State House advocacy on a bill aiming to ease local restrictions on subdividing large parcels of land. 
“I thought it would be prudent to ask the Ethics Commission if it was appropriate to vote on the legislation,” Shekarchi said in an email Wednesday.
Good news for Shekarchi: The state ethics panel determined there’s no ethical conflict between his housing bill and his former client, Thomas Casale.
Because the Cranston developer is no longer Shekarchi’s client, there’s no way Shekarchi might benefit from the bill’s passage, concluded an advisory opinion written by the Rhode Island Ethics Commission’s staff. The nine-member panel voted unanimously to accept the opinion Tuesday, with one recusal and one member absent, to approve the staff opinion. 
Shekarchi hasn’t represented Casale since 2021 in his battle with municipal officials to develop a few acres of empty residential land in western Cranston, and has been paid in full by Casale for his work, Shekarchi wrote in his request to the ethics panel. Shekarchi also wrote that he does not anticipate a future business relationship with the developer.
Therefore, Shekarchi is free to discuss, advocate for, and vote on the legislation, according to the ethics opinion.
Shekarchi in a statement Wednesday said he was “pleased” with the ethics panel’s determination.
Shekarchi is one of nine Democratic co-sponsors on the subdivision bill put in by Rep. Cherie Cruz, a Pawtucket Democrat. The legislation had an initial vetting before the House Municipal Government and Housing Committee on March 11, with a slightly amended version advanced out of committee in a vote on March 20.
A floor vote has not been scheduled as of Wednesday, Larry Berman, a spokesperson for House leadership, said.
There is also no Senate companion bill yet.
Shekarchi’s work representing Casale has ended, but the high-profile dispute over residential development is far from over, with an appeal filed by Casale now pending before the state Superior Court, according to news reports.
The pending legislation does not specifically name Alpine Estates or his former client, Casale. But if signed into law, the bill could help Casale win the legal battle by easing restrictions on subdividing “oversized lots.”
Casale, who owns an auto body shop in Johnston, declined to comment when reached by phone Wednesday.
“I don’t really have anything to do with that,” he said of the bill before hanging up.
The legislation authorizes municipal zoning officials to grant exceptions to local zoning rules on residential development, including subdivisions, as long as the changes reflect the surrounding neighborhood.
The proposal drew praise from housing advocates, including the Rhode Island Coalition for Housing Providers and Neighbors Welcome! Rhode Island, in written comments to the House Municipal Government and Housing Committee. Robert Azar, deputy director of planning and development for the city of Providence, also expressed written support for the intent of the legislation, but suggested a few tweaks.
No one from the city of Cranston or Alpine Estates wrote the House panel regarding the bill. 
Cranston city planning staff initially agreed to the requested zone change, filed in 2019, that would let Casale divide four open lots into eight. However, the City Council initially rejected the zoning change in 2022. After signing a consent order noting that the zone change was consistent with its long-term comprehensive plan, the City Council in 2024 approved a second application for the same zoning change. However, Mayor Ken Hopkins vetoed the council’s approval, and the council failed to garner enough votes to override Hopkins’ veto, sending the dispute back to the courts, where it remains pending, according to news reports. 
Nicholas Hemond, the outside counsel representing the city in the development dispute was not immediately available to comment on Wednesday. Zachary DeLuca, a spokesperson for the mayor’s office, acknowledged but was not immediately able to provide a comment Wednesday.
Christopher Millea, city solicitor, also did not immediately return inquiries for comment. 
Ethics Commission Chairman Lauren Jones recused himself from the commission’s vote Tuesday on the advisory opinion for Shekarchi. Commissioner Emma Peterson was absent from the meeting.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Starting in the 2025-2026 school year, public Iowa K-12 school districts will be required to set policies that, at minimum, ban the use of cellphones during class time under a law signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds Wednesday.
The ban on cellphones during instructional periods was one of the governor’s top priorities heading into the 2025 legislative session. At a ceremony signing the measure into law, Reynolds said House File 782 will help improve Iowa students’ learning and mental health.
“Smartphones and other digital devices have made information, media and entertainment immediately available at any time, any place, and this level of connectivity has changed the way that we live, learn and communicate,” Reynolds said. “And while the positive impacts are undeniable, we can’t ignore that our phones can also be a source of constant distraction in our daily lives, whether at home or at work or, especially for our kids, at school.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Reynolds cited a Pew Research Center survey that found 72% of high school teachers say students being distracted by cellphones is a major problem in their classroom. Data also shows policies limiting cellphones and other personal electronic devices have a positive impact on student outcomes, Reynolds said, pointing to statistics on higher grades and lower disciplinary rates at Iowa schools that have already put cellphone policies in place.
The Ottumwa Community School District, which implemented a cellphone ban for the entire school day starting in the current school year, saw a 12% increase in A and B grades and a 60% decrease in failing grades for 8-12 students compared to the first semester of the previous year. Additionally, the district saw a 20% decrease in referrals for behavior issues.
Mike McGrory, superintendent of the Ottumwa Community School District, said “Ottumwa schools this year experienced firsthand how powerful a bell-to-bell cellphone policy can be,” and said the new law will help other schools across the district see improved learning and engagement with students.
“The results, as the governor was alluding to, far exceeded our expectations,” McGrory said. “They were truly profound … by eliminating those learning distractions for our students, it allowed the following three things: (for) our students to refocus on their learning, focus on their mental health, and also — this is so important — with building meaningful face-to-face relationships with each other.”
The Ottumwa school district’s policy of no cellphone use for the entire school day is a higher standard than what would be required under the new law. School boards are required to set a ban on cellphone use during class times by July 1, but have discretion on whether to restrict devices during other periods of the school day. The Iowa Department of Education is required to develop and distribute a model policy for use as boards develop their own policies.
The law requires that cellphone bans include exceptions, such as for students who are English Second Language (ESL) learners or who have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or 504 plan that involves accommodations using a cellphone or other personal electronic device. Parents will also be allowed to petition a school district for their child to retain access of their cellphone during class periods, if they establish a “legitimate” reason related to a student’s mental or physical health that requires the device to be readily available.
Gabe Polich, a senior at Des Moines Hoover High School, also spoke on the measure, saying that he has seen improved grades as a result of not using his cellphone in class. Hoover High School implemented a ban on cellphones during class at the beginning of the 2024-2025 school year, which Reynolds said resulted in a 14% increase in A and B grades, a 12% decrease in students’ failure rate and decrease of out-of-school suspensions by 60%.
Polich said he is less distracted in class and that students are happier in school because of the ban.
“I wasn’t happy they were taking away our cellphones,” Polich said. “But now I can see that it’s really improved our school.”
Reynolds joked “my grandchildren weren’t very happy with me either” when she brought up the school cellphone ban, but that the measure will help other students like Polich learn and be more engaged in schools with the policy in place.
The governor said she believes the policy will help Iowa schools and students while including important provisions addressing concerns about students’ lack of access to phones. This includes the provisions allowing exceptions, as well as requiring schools update their safety and emergency plans, with guidance from the state departments of Education and Public Safety, to account for communications needs during these situations.
Reynolds also thanked lawmakers for their efforts getting the bill to her desk, saying she was happy to see it pass through the Legislature with bipartisan support.
“I think it’s a great example of how we can come together to support simple, common sense solutions that can make an overwhelmingly positive difference,” Reynolds said.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Susan Rankin.","Born Sept. 8, 1948Hiram, MaineDied Jan. 3, 2025St. Johnsbury, VermontDetails of servicesThere will be a party in remembrance of Susan on Sat. June 7th 3pm in Peacham. To attend please contact Bess O’Brien at bobrien@pshift.com. A remembrance of Susan Rankin by Jasper CravenOn a perfect summer day in late August of 2022, I met Susan Rankin on the bank of the Passumpsic River, in St. Johnsbury. It was the first I’d seen her since the pandemic and we caught up for hours, seated at a picnic table with pizza from Kingdom Crust. I’d brought my then-new girlfriend, Lauren, on Susan’s insistence, even though the reason for our gathering was somewhat grim. We were supposed to discuss her obituary.Susan was then in her early 70s, and for much of her life she’d been sick. Shortly after she moved to Vermont, in the mid 1980s, she’d been in a bad car accident that left her with a brain injury. In the decades since, she’d struggled mightily with migraines and other comorbidities, yet remained insatiably curious and exceptionally witty. She was also deeply caring.For the first eight years of my life, Susan lived across my driveway, in an apartment she rented from my parents on Old West Road, in West Barnet. During my early childhood, she took care of me a lot. Nominally, she was my baby-sitter, but she always treated me like family. I don’t think she ever charged my parents for her services, nor did she gripe at any last-minute requests for care.I was an energetic flower child, prone to bursts of wild dancing in the nude and other forms of joyful chaos. Susan handled me with patience, letting my wild side thrive while also imparting some manners and responsibility. She had me haul things to her shed and help with other chores, but also spoiled me rotten. She read to me, took me to the playground, introduced me to figure skating. She also cooked for me a lot, reminding me at the river that among all the creative dishes she made I was most obsessed with a simple peasant meal: creamed tuna and peas.At Christmas each year, Susan would shower me with presents. But she also tempered my materialism by insisting we purchase presents and wrap them for less fortunate families. She also drilled into me the value of thank you cards — which has served me well through the years.As I grew up, Susan continued to be in my life. She read books to my elementary and middle school classes, picked me up after high school, and called regularly while I was in college. We talked about life, politics, television, and religion.Rarely would she dwell on her own acute medical issues. Instead, she wanted to know how I was doing, an instinct she turned to even during our riverside chat. I was there to learn more about Susan’s life so that, one day, I could properly chronicle it for her obituary. Still, she couldn’t help but spend the majority of our time discussing the particulars of mine, regaling Lauren with many tales of my mischievous youth.As the sun started to set, Lauren and I walked Susan to her car, said goodbye, and went our separate ways. We hadn’t discussed her obituary much, but I assumed we’d carve out another time to do so. We spoke a good deal more after that, but neither of us ever broached the obituary again, hoping, perhaps, that such evasion would forestall the inevitable. Then, on January 3rd 2025, Susan died at the age of 76.Susan P. Rankin was born on September 8th, 1948. She grew up in the rural hamlet of Hiram, Maine, with her parents Albert P. Rankin and Helen E. (Brown) Rankin. She also had a younger brother, Alan.Susan attended at Fryeburg Academy, in Maine, then spent in college before working for about a decade as a medical secretary. At age 30, Susan heard the call of the ministry.Susan then served at several churches under the umbrella of the United Church of Christ, a socially liberal mainline Protestant denomination with New England roots. Its flock came to encompass three of Susan’s favorite politicians: Barack Obama, Howard Dean, and Jim Douglas.In 1982, Susan served as the Interim Pastor at a church in North Haven — one of the Maine’s most remote islands, with a wintertime population of just 400. At the end of that year, she was appointed Associate Pastor at the First Congregational Church of Old Lyme, Connecticut. A news article announcing Susan’s appointment noted that she would be spending much of her time focused on youth programs. It was this work, she told the paper, that excited her the most.In October 1985, Susan landed as interim pastor at the United Church of Christ, in Greensboro, where she served for a year. She also served as an interim pastor at Hampden Congregational Church in Hampden, Maine. Before the first day of her dream job, settled pastor of the United Church of Strafford, Vermont, she was rear-ended in a motor vehicle accident and suffered a chronic brain injury. At the congregation’s behest, she struggled to serve as best she could until they could call another pastor, but she was never able to serve as a full-time parish minister again.Still, Susan remained active in the Vermont Conference of the United Church of Christ. She served as head of the Nominating Committee, and contributed significantly to the Ministerial Standing Committee, the Department of Mission, and Department of Christian Education.“I sometimes felt that Susan was a modern-day Job,” reflected her former pastor in Barnet, Reverend Howard Gaston. “She had lost so much in her life and yet continued to have a faith that she tried to share with others and for her own life struggles.”He concluded: “I know that like Job, ‘the lord has restored her fortunes and gave her twice as much as she had before’ in God’s loving presence.”Susan spent much of the 1990s volunteering in the community when her health allowed it. She was an active ally and, later, board member, for the Brain Injury Alliance of Vermont. She also helped lead support groups for people with head injuries at her two favorite hospitals: NVRH and Dartmouth-Hitchcock. (She would frequently illustrate for me the caring and humane staff she dealt with in both locales.)Susan’s brain injury made it difficult for her to grasp technology, but she loved keeping in touch with the ones she loved. And so, in the early aughts, she bought a newfangled email machine. Her most frequent pen pal was her brother, Alan, who, in 2004, became homeless in Boston due to a debilitating mental health condition.Alan corresponded with Susan from a computer in the library, which he visited often to check in on the season of his beloved Boston Red Sox. Like Susan, Alan was uncommonly kind and tender despite his struggles. He was quieter than she was, but nonetheless caring.Alan was often resistant to Susan’s help, though she convinced him to visit once a year or so for a “vacation” marked by hot showers, good food, and fun outings. Later the family of my close friend, Ezra Racine, offered Alan a job at Eagle Eye Farm, a residential care facility near Lake Willoughby.He worked there until his physical and mental health became too compromised to continue. Eagle Eye Farm helped Alan for months after he ceased to be their employee. The whole Alexander family — particularly John, the patriarch — was extremely kind and generous.Susan tirelessly coordinated efforts to keep Alan housed and cared for. After he had a stroke, she also expertly coordinated his care. Susan participated in the National Alliance on Mental Illness Family Support Group while Alan was alive. After he passed, in November 2017, she continued to provide support for others. She also wrote his touching obituary, and dusted off her pastoral skills to plan his funeral.The pandemic hit Susan hard. She was hoping to start a grief support group for people who had lost loved ones, but her own health was deteriorating. Among other things, she developed a tremor that interfered with her ability to use an iPad for video conferencing into meetings for the Brain Injury Alliance. “Susan was an advocate who tirelessly gave her support and unwavering resolve to make Vermont a better place for the brain injury community,” the organization recently stated.Despite her mounting health challenges, Susan took pride in keeping her check book balanced, and her bedside table stacked high with books. She loved to read, especially memoirs and biographies. She also subscribed to, and read, many magazines. If she caught wind that I was writing for a new publication, she would often subscribe to it. Once, when one of these publications didn’t pay me for months, she angrily canceled her subscription. I often joked that her voracious reading habits were single-handedly keeping my industry alive.I last saw Susan a few days before Christmas on a short stay in a rehabilitation facility. She was clearly weak physically, but maintained the funny spark I’d come to adore.She told my mother and me about the strangest new turn in her health struggles: hearing the same Christmas song play incessantly in her hand. She told it in her classic way, finding humor and resilience in an objectively terrible situation.Not long after, Susan returned home and died of natural causes in her own home, as she had wished.Susan is predeceased by her parents, her brother, Alan, her dog Clooney to whom she was devoted, and many dear friends. She is survived by close friends she considered family, including me, my folks, Kathy Gale, Betty Keller, Bob Hawes, Allyson Crawford, Jeanne Eisner, and her old neighbors on Old West.There will be a party in remembrance of Susan on Sat. June 7th in Peacham.Please contact Bess O’Brien at bobrien@pshift.com to attend.Donations in Susan’s memory may be made to Doctors without Borders and/or Brain Injury Alliance of Vermont.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Susan Rankin.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Obit-placeholder.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 15:12:31.307644

Matt Little is running for the U.S. House in Minnesota’s 2nd Congressional District, the seat soon to be vacated by U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, who is running for Senate. 
Little, a resident of New Market Township, is a personal injury attorney and the former mayor of Lakeville. He is the first candidate to officially launch a campaign for the 2nd District, though businessman and internet poster Mike Norton is also exploring a run. Other potential candidates include state Sens. Erin Maye Quade and Matt Klein; GOP state Sen. Eric Pratt; 2024 GOP nominee Joe Teirab; and 2020 and 2022 GOP nominee Tyler Kistner.
“I’m running for every underdog out there, for every person working their tail off, chasing the American Dream,” Little said in a press release announcing his candidacy. “But, unless Washington D.C. wakes up, that dream will never be reality for many people. Groceries, child care, health care, assisted living, you name it — people are struggling to figure out how to pay for basics and have something left over.”
Little served two terms as mayor of Lakeville, then represented the area in the state Senate from 2016 until 2020, when he lost his re-election race to Republican Sen. Zach Duckworth. As a senator, he worked on prescription drug affordability, infrastructure funding and expanding Metro Mobility to his district.
Little was known as a forward-thinking DFL campaigner, aggressively employing TikTok and other novel ways of reaching voters before it became commonplace. 
The 2nd District, in the south Twin Cities metro, has been purple for the past decade, though Craig won by more than 13 percentage points in 2024. Craig has succeeded in the district as a moderate, splitting with the Democratic Party on issues like immigration and law enforcement. 
In the press release announcing his candidacy, Little touted his investments in public safety as mayor of Lakeville. Once, as a city council member, he offered to donate half of his small salary — around $4,000 — to offset the cost of adding a staff position to the police department.

In lieu of flowers, gifts can be made to the Vermont Foodbank or to Vermont Public.Betsy Ann Berry passed peacefully on April 19, 2025 at her home in South Burlington, VT, in the loving presence of her two children.She was born in Montclair NJ, the only daughter of John N Berry II and Marian Chase Berry. Her early childhood was spent in New Hampshire and on her family ranch in Burney, in Northern California, where her most cherished childhood memories were forged. For the rest of her life she enjoyed a fondness for California poppies and the vast open land and wild terrain that expanded to the striking profile of Mount Shasta — a vision that forever captivated her imagination. Following her family’s return to New Hampshire, Betsy attended Wheelock College in Boston, where she received her Bachelor’s Degree in Education. She married and had two children, raising them in Burlington, VT as a member of the University of Vermont community, with her then-husband, Professor Garrison Nelson. She was a kindergarten teacher at Williston Central School for nearly 20 years, and over the years she enjoyed reconnecting with many of her former students who fondly recall their experience in Betsy’s kindergarten. She was a mentor to education students and student teachers at the University of Vermont. Later in her career, she served as an advisor to the Lily Foundation, providing grants that funded groundbreaking research and innovative programs in early childhood education throughout the U.S.She was both a writer and appreciator of the written word, particularly enjoying the poetry of Mary Oliver and Wisława Szymborska, the spiritual writings of Eknath Easwaran and Eckhart Tolle, as well as the poetry of her childhood friend of 75 years, Pat Whitney of Sunapee, NH. She also played guitar and was a lifelong fan of the iconic folk musicians of the 1960s: Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Peter Paul and Mary, Odetta, and Pete Seeger.She is survived by her daughter and son-in-law, Shyla and Andrew Stewart of Pasadena, CA, her son, Ethan Nelson of New York, NY, her five grandchildren: Emily and Sophia Foster, Addison and Chase Nelson, and Tyler Nelson-White, and her three great-grandchildren: Jalani Anthony, Khari and Zaire Dawkins, her extended family, as well as her many cherished friends, colleagues, and students from her decades as an educator and active member of her community. Her family was a source of deepest joy and delight, and she loved being present to watch her grandchildren and great-grandchildren grow up, embarking on adventures of their own.She was predeceased by her beloved husband of 20 years, UVM History Professor Jeremy P.

Measles cases in Kansas jumped from 37 to 46 over the past week, with all cases located in southwest counties, according to Kansas Department of Health and Environment data released Wednesday […]","Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Vaccine Research Group, spoke recently at a University of Kansas Health System panel, addressing concerns about the measles outbreak. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from KU Health video)TOPEKA — New legislation may make it more difficult for public health officials to manage a measles outbreak, which has increased by nine cases.
Measles cases in Kansas jumped from 37 to 46 over the past week, with all cases located in southwest counties, according to Kansas Department of Health and Environment data released Wednesday morning.
KDHE spokeswoman Jill Bronaugh said the state agency is working with local health departments to communicate about measles and to educate the public.
But the Legislature’s passage of Senate Bill 29 may complicate the ability of local health officials to react to the increasing number of measles cases. This bill removed the ability of local health officials to ban public gatherings during infectious disease outbreaks and added the expectation that health officials show probable cause if they quarantine or isolate individuals during an outbreak.
The bill says those who are quarantined can file a civil lawsuit that must be heard within 72 hours if they believe the decision was unjust. Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed the bill, but the Republican-led Legislature overturned her veto.
“Taking away the authority of public health officials to prohibit public gatherings and issue quarantines, when necessary, contradicts effective, evidence-based health intervention advice, but we will do all we can to protect the health of the communities we are entrusted to serve,” Bronaugh said.
Sen. Bill Clifford, a Republican ophthalmologist from Garden City, expressed concern during hearings that not all cases of measles are being reported.
“This weekend I spoke to several pediatricians. In an affected family, one member is going in,” he said, speaking at a time when there were 31 reported measles cases. “In fact, they won’t allow them in the pediatric clinic. We have well babies there and we don’t want to infect them. That one family member is the signal case of what’s going on in the family, and the families are not coming in.”
 
Latest data
KDHE updated its measles dashboard Wednesday morning to highlight the number of cases and the affected counties: Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray, Haskell, Kiowa, Morton and Stevens. In addition, it shows vaccination data, which indicates that 39 people with measles were unvaccinated, one did not have age-appropriate vaccinations, three did not have verified vaccination status and three were age-appropriately vaccinated.
One person has been hospitalized.
Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection prevention and control at the University of Kansas Health System, said fully vaccinated people can get the disease, but typically have fewer complications and overall less severity of illness. With one dose of the vaccine, people have 93% protection from measles, and after two doses, 97% protection, he said.
 
How we got here
Measles was considered eliminated in 2000 but has since popped up throughout the United States, typically in unvaccinated communities. Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Vaccine Research Group, joined a panel of University of Kansas Health System experts to talk about how we got to where we are today and to address vaccine skepticism.
Poland explained what it means to eliminate a disease.
“You need a robust surveillance system. You need to know are you seeing cases, and are they measles,” he said. “Then what you have to have is documentation of interruption of indigenous transmission for at least 12 months. We are very likely going to lose that, and that is a real shame because achieving that in 2000 was a monumental public health achievement.”
Indigenous transmission refers to the spread of a disease within a population and is not coming from contact that began with someone outside the community, such as during a trip abroad.
 
Side effects of vaccination
Poland said the vaccine that has been available since 1968 is “well documented to be protective and to have minimal side effects.”
“It always bothers me when people say, ‘Well, isn’t natural immunity better.’ Before there was a measles vaccine in the U.S., essentially every child got it, so three to four million people a year. Forty-eight thousand of those kids ended up sick enough that they were hospitalized, 1,000 of them developed encephalitis, and 500 of them on average each year died. That’s what natural immunity gets you,” Poland said.
Side effects of the vaccine are a few cases of low platelets, transient fever and possibly a rash, he said.
No known deaths related to the MMR vaccine given to healthy people have been reported, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Rare cases of deaths from vaccine side effects among children are connected to those who are immune compromised, and it is recommended they not get the vaccine.
 
Distrust of science
Unfortunately, Hawkinson said, times have changed in terms of how much people listen to medical professionals and how they assess scientific research. Right now is different than in 2019, when the most recent measles outbreak occurred.
“There are major points and reasons why this is much different,” he said. “I think it is in the context of extreme disinformation and misinformation and mistrust of medicine and public health. Mistrust of science. We have to get back to knowing and understanding what is true, but it is just so difficult out there.”
Hawkinson pointed to an overall decreased willingness to listen to and adhere to medical guidance and recommendations.
“We don’t do that when we listen to our plumbers, our mechanics, our lawyers,” he said.
And, he said, overall vaccination rates have declined.
“Many areas locally here in Kansas and Missouri are down to 90% (of people vaccinated),” he said. “You will only see more patients developing this disease and, unfortunately, the complications that come along with it.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PolandScreenshot-1024x579.jpg,,,2025-04-30 15:12:31.307644

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A bill to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America” passed in a last-minute scheduled committee meeting that lasted just over three minutes.
HB 247, sponsored by Rep. David Standridge, R-Hayden, previously failed to pass the Senate County and Municipal Committee Tuesday after Sen.

He said in the meeting he had an issue with the fiscal note when he voted against the bill, and he didn’t know it would end up in a tie.
With only Republican senators present at the meeting, the bill passed on a 6-0 vote.
“We’re in the middle of the waning days of our session and still have a lot of unfinished business. We got a significant education package of bills still out there looming. We just passed a lovely set of tax reform, tax relief bills in a committee earlier, so we still had a lot on our plate,” Hovey said, adding that he didn’t think it was a high priority bill.

The bill’s fiscal note states it would increase “administrative obligations” of state and local governments, but it does not state the amount. Hovey said Wednesday that he has “been assured” that it would “affect the state’s coffers minimally.”
“And so, I do have the opportunity to change my vote, and I would like to call for that vote,” he said.
The legislation, which passed the House on April 18, would have also mandated that reasonable efforts be made to update pre-existing resources, unless it imposes an operational or financial burden on the entities. An exception allowed the term “Gulf of Mexico” to be used in academic instruction for historical purposes in public K-12 schools and institutions of higher education.
The National Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico announced plans to change its name to the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf in response to the bill and President Donald Trump’s executive order.
The bill moves to the Senate.

(Photo by SDI Productions via Getty Images)Public school districts have about three months to develop phone-free policies for students, an initiative passed during the recent legislative session and signed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham this month.
Senate Bill 11, sponsored by Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte), requires all New Mexico school districts and charter schools to develop rules for students’ use during instructional time of cell phones, smart watches, tablets, laptops and gaming devices in an effort to limit distractions and improve student performance.
“This bill isn’t just about test scores. It’s about showing our kids that we care enough about their future to take practical steps forward when we can,” Brantley said in a written statement. “Reducing distractions helps not only academic outcomes but also our students’ mental health, safety, and focus.”
According to the bill, districts have until Aug. 1 to create and implement a “wireless communication device policy.” The bill also states that the Public Education Department will provide districts with guidelines for minimum policy requirements, and outlines possible requirements such as: limiting device usage during instructional hours; allowing teachers to grant students permission to use devices during instructional time; allowing students to use devices in emergency situations or for accessibility needs; and establishing consequences for violating the policy.
Lujan Grisham signed the bill on April 10, ahead of the April 11 deadline she had for taking action on legislation passed by the Legislature and sent to her desk. In a legislative message, Lujan Grisham described SB11 as a “first step towards meaningful regulation” of electronic devices in New Mexico schools. However, she called out lawmakers for amending the original bill and making participation in creating policies optional for districts. 
“The Legislature squirmed out of taking a meaningful step to improve education under the auspice[s] of local control,” Lujan Grisham wrote. “That is all well and good until this same body blames the Public Education Department—and now the local bodies—for poor educational outcomes of New Mexico students. I once again encourage the Legislature to hold local school districts accountable for educational outcomes. Our students deserve it.”
Kelly Jameson, director of communications for Las Cruces Public Schools, told Source NM in a written statement that the district supports the “intent of SB11 to create safer, more focused learning environments for all students.” She added that the LCPS Board of Education adopted a policy in 2009 concerning the use of electronic communication devices in school. The policy notes that having a device in school is “a privilege” that can be taken away.
The LCPS board also adopted a regulation in 2023 that outlines by grade level when students may use devices during the school day. For example, elementary students may only use devices before or after school. Middle school students may use their devices during lunch periods, but not during passing periods between classes and regulations for high school students are more lenient. 
Violating the LCPS policy can mean devices are confiscated; devices must be left in the school’s front office during the school day; or other disciplinary actions are taken with multiple violations.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Max Misch found guilty for possession of high-capacity gun magazines.","Max Misch before a court appearance in August 2019. File photo by Mike Dougherty/VTDiggerBENNINGTON — A jury convicted Max Misch in Bennington Superior criminal court after a one-day trial on Tuesday for two misdemeanor charges of illegal possession of high-capacity firearm magazines. A previously self-professed white nationalist, Misch had a central role in the racial harassment of a former Bennington representative. The case against Misch, 42, of Bennington, went before a jury after a Vermont Superior Court judge denied Misch’s previous attempts to challenge the charges on grounds that Vermont’s magazine restrictions were unconstitutional earlier this year. In 2018, the Vermont Legislature passed an update of the state’s firearm law, placing a 10 round limit on long guns and a 15 round limit on handguns. Gov. Phil Scott signed the provision into law, and it took effect Oct. 1, 2018. Two 30-round magazines for an AR-15 style rifle were seized from Misch’s apartment after a search warrant was obtained by Vermont State Police on Feb. 6, 2019, according to a state’s witness, James Wright, a detective sergeant with the state police.Misch’s ex-wife Lisa Shapiro testified that she drove him across state lines to New Hampshire on Dec. 1, 2018 — two months after the firearm law took effect — where he acquired the magazines and brought them back to his residence in Bennington. Shapiro said Misch used her debit card for the purchase of the magazines because Misch forgot his wallet. The duo had travelled to the sporting goods store in New Hampshire earlier in 2018 to purchase magazines, but Shapiro said the store was out of stock of the product Misch wanted at the time. Misch placed an order for the magazines to be purchased at a later date, but during her testimony Shapiro could not recall the exact date the order was placed.In the defense’s closing argument, public defender Fred Bragdon claimed that Misch and Shapiro should have “joint possession” of the magazines since they were purchased under Shapiro’s name and she helped transport Misch. READ MORE





 


Judge upholds state’s high-capacity firearm magazine ban in case against white nationalist

Bragdon claimed that because Shapiro could not definitively recall the date Misch placed the order, Misch could have sought the magazines before Oct. 1, 2018, the date of the law’s effect. For that reason, Bragdon claimed that there is a reasonable doubt to whether Misch’s possession of the magazines would constitute an offense under the timeline of the statute. In his closing arguments, Franklin Paulino, the attorney representing the State of Vermont, said that the evidence submitted by the state met the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Misch was guilty of possessing two high-capacity magazines.Once both the state and the defense rested their cases, the jury delivered a guilty verdict for both charges after deliberating for less than a half hour. Misch’s sentencing hearing is expected to be scheduled within the next 60 days, and the court has 45 days for post-trial motions. The presiding judge, Jennifer Barrett ordered Misch be released pending the sentence for the two charges, which each carry a potential maximum penalty for one year in prison and a $500 fine. In an interview after the trial, Misch said that he was disappointed by the result and planned to appeal. Even though he said any jail time he would receive through sentencing would likely be minimal, Misch said he was seeking a “moral victory” that was thwarted by the jury verdict Tuesday. An honorably discharged Iraq war veteran, Misch said in an interview he previously self-identified as a white nationalist but now considers himself a follower of Jesus Christ. Misch has faced several charges in the past, including aggravated domestic assault, a hate crime charge of disorderly conduct and repeated violations of his conditions of release. Misch also previously admitted to engaging in racial harassment and trolling against former Vermont state representative from Bennington, Kiah Morris. Morris was the only Black woman in the legislative body at the time and eventually resigned, in part, due to online attacks. The defense also cited the duplicity doctrine in the beginning of the trial, a constitutional provision that asserts that it is impermissible for states to divide a single offense into multiple counts. While the current statute places a charge on possession of each singular large capacity ammunition feeding device, the defense co-council lawyer Jeff Rubin said that the purchase of the two magazines in one transaction should be considered a single offense. Barrett said the court found the two charges are not duplicitous based on a “plain reading” of the statute, but the court would consider further discussion of the doctrine’s relevance to the case if the defense filed a post-trial brief on the matter after the conviction. Attorney General Charity Clark expressed gratitude to those involved in the conclusion of the jury verdict, which began six years earlier in February of 2019. “I want to thank the jury for their service in carefully considering the law and facts in this case,” Attorney General Clark wrote in a statement. “I also want to thank our law enforcement partners for their assistance with the investigation, whose work was instrumental in bringing this case to a successful resolution.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Max Misch found guilty for possession of high-capacity gun magazines.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/max-misch-2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 15:12:31.307644

Photo by Getty Images.Minnesota Republicans held a press conference last week claiming that a program allowing undocumented people to receive free or discounted health insurance would cost the state over $600 million over four years.
State data show the figure is a wild exaggeration, however. 
The Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2023 made undocumented immigrants eligible for MinnesotaCare — the state’s health insurance program for the working poor — as of Jan. 1, 2025.
Nearly 17,400 undocumented people have enrolled in MinnesotaCare. The program is fee-for-service, meaning the state only pays claims after services are administered.
The Department of Health in a statement said it had 3,378 claims for service, costing Minnesota about $3.3 million as of April 1 during the first quarter. The state budget office projects the cost for the next four years would be around $200 million — or one-third the GOP estimate. 
As for now, MDH says per-enrollee spending is below projections.
“The number of enrollees is currently higher than what was expected, however the amount spent per person is currently lower than what was originally expected,” a department spokesperson said. MDH cautioned that one quarter is not enough data to reliably predict expenditures for the next four years.
What is MinnesotaCare?
MinnesotaCare was created in 1992 to help close the gap in coverage for low-income families who make more than the income threshold for Medicaid, which is called Medical Assistance in Minnesota.
Uninsured Minnesotans who are not eligible for Medical Assistance and have an income at or below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines can qualify for MinnesotaCare. This applies for undocumented people as well, as of Jan. 1.
Some MinnesotaCare enrollees pay a monthly premium, and the program is funded by a combination of payments from the state, taxes on hospitals and other health care providers and enrollee premium payments.
Under the expansion, many undocumented people receiving MinnesotaCare pay a monthly premium, similar to other residents who receive health care through the program. The premium is based on income and the number of family members in the household. If a person fails to pay the premium, their coverage is canceled.
The federal government kicks in money to pay for MinnesotaCare, but not the portion for undocumented people. 
Minnesota hospital leaders have publicly supported expanding insurance access because it increases the number of paying patients and encourages people to seek preventative care before ailments become more costly, like if they were to seek emergency services.
Federal law requires hospitals to care for all patients who walk through their doors, regardless of whether they are able to pay or their immigration status. The Minnesota Hospital Association has said that revoking MinnesotaCare for undocumented people could make such care more expensive for hospitals across the state.
“Such a change won’t block health care for undocumented immigrants,” the Minnesota Hospital Association said in a February social media post.
Republicans are opposed to the program and have made cutting it one of their top priorities this session. 
“It’s wrong when a person takes an oath of office to serve their constituents and to help them, but they instead prioritize illegal immigrants over their law-abiding constituents,” said Rep. Jeff Backer, R-Browns Valley and co-chair of the Health finance committee, at a press conference last week.
Sen. Alice Mann, DFL-Edina and chief author of the 2023 MinnesotaCare expansion bill, said Republicans have lied to Minnesotans about the program. 
“Republicans are telling you that if we take away people’s health care, that’s gonna fix the problem. Those are absolute lies, and it was egregious what they said. They are taking our crumbling health care system and they’re blaming it on immigrants,” Mann said at a rally last week.
Leaders of the Health Finance and Policy Committee are deadlocked in budget negotiations, in part over the MinnesotaCare issue.

At a giant dirt lot off a side road in Emmet County, the air smells sharply of pine. Enormous piles of logs and branches sit around the property.
Terry and Nancy Chamberlin drag pine branches out of the bed of a black pickup truck and a small trailer — trees from their five-acre property in Alanson.
“We got hit real hard on this. We went out here — I think this is our 10th double trip down here in three days — and we’re just having a ball doing this,” Terry said. “And then I can start in the woods, which is going to take me two years to clean up.”
Debris from a massive ice storm at the end of March was strewn across the region. A lot of it fell on power lines, causing widespread outages.
But now, the same debris that knocked out the power a few weeks ago could be used to make electricity.
 ‘Doing the best that we can’

Utilities worked to clear much of the debris from power lines, and it was up to local emergency management teams and road commissions to figure out what to do with debris piling up around right of ways along the road and on private land.
So some set up these drop off sites, where people can bring branches and trees that were damaged or destroyed by the ice.
Lindsey Walker, who works in outreach for Emmet County Recycling, said they were able to pivot to accepting wooden debris pretty quickly. Usually, a company will come through to grind wood people drop off at the county’s waste facility into wood chips.
“We have to justify mobilizing these very expensive grinders and haulers of this material. And so every two years, we’re normally grinding our wood waste,” she said. “We need to have about 5,000 cubic yards on the ground at any time, and now we’ve got about 10 times the amount of that.”
Some established drop-off sites have been open around the clock, receiving debris by truck, trailer and even dump trucks.
“Having sites that are free and ample space for the public to bring debris is really important,” Walker said. “So this site has plenty of capacity for further debris, and then once we get that material ground, then we’re hauling, and so there’s this process of cleaning up sites as they go along. This is like us doing the best that we can with the resources that we have.”

 Turning heat into light

Some of the woody debris might go to places like landscaping businesses to use as mulch. But they’re also selling it to biomass facilities nearby, which will turn that into energy.
“I like to use the little saying that we were green before green was cool,” said Thomas Clift, the director of biomass operations at NorthStar Clean Energy, a company that runs four such facilities, including one in Grayling. “We’ve been in the renewable power business for a long time.”
NorthStar is one of the companies buying and burning that wooden debris from the storm. It uses that to create electricity. In all, the facility powers up to 38,000 homes. It works with another company, AJD Forest Products, to source and organize deliveries.
“All wood is graded by different levels,” he said. “Biomass levels are really looking at the [British thermal unit] of the wood. If it’s a higher quality BTU product they’ll pay more because it will burn better.”
Clift said they’re not cutting down trees for wood to produce that power.
“Any wood product that we use here was either going to be left on the forest floor, to turn into methane and be released on its own, or it’s other materials that would have gone to the landfill,” he said.
Dealing with forest management and debris after natural disasters is something other areas of the country have been trying to figure out as well, such as places in the southeast hit by Hurricane Helene.
But officials say this is an unusual issue in northern Michigan, which hasn’t typically faced the same kinds of disasters. Having biomass facilities in the region make dealing with debris in this way easier.
 Not a new idea

Biomass refers to a range of fuels, from animal manure to trash to wood. Using biomass for energy has a long history. For instance, in the United States residue from wood pulp manufacturing has been a popular source of fuel for electricity over the decades, though that has declined, said Brent Sohngen, a professor at Ohio State University who studies the economics of forestry.
The relationship between biomass-fueled energy and climate is far from straightforward.
Public health researchers and environmental groups have raised alarms about biomass for years, pointing to pollution from facilities, health issues and harm to nearby communities, which are often communities of color or low-income communities, according to advocates. Critics say framing of biomass energy as better for the climate is misleading; it can rely on logging, and burning matter like wood also emits greenhouse gases. And some argue the focus should instead be on cleaner forms of energy, such as solar.
There are situations where biomass-fueled energy will emit more carbon than it saves, Sohngen said — for instance, logging old growth trees for fuel. But in circumstances like the ice storm, biomass could be considered a carbon-neutral energy option, because that wooden debris would otherwise decompose over time, emitting greenhouse gases.
“The nice thing about taking that material and using it for electricity is that it creates electricity, and if you’re creating extra units of electricity from that material, then you’re potentially offsetting some other source of electricity on the system on the grid,” such as coal, he said.
Removing woody debris from the landscape to burn for electricity poses other issues. One example: Dead and dying trees provide a wide range of benefits that should be considered before removing them.
“There’s huge numbers of bugs that will basically use that wood material for growing themselves, and there’s animals or birds or other kinds of things that’ll use the bugs for their own life cycle,” said Sohngen. “It’s really important that, you know, we can’t just take all of the dead material out of a forest and expect a forest to function well.”
There may also be an increasing interest in biochar following disasters like Helene, he said. Biochar is an almost pure form of carbon made from heating up materials like plant matter, and can be spread out in farm fields or forests.
“What we found is that this biochar material has such a long life that it’s a way to lock up a lot of carbon in the forest system for many, many years — millennia, even,” he said.
At another drop-off site in Emmet County, Lindsey Walker walked around yet another mound of logs and branches. Biochar is on her mind as well.
“We rank it by highest and best use,” she said of dealing with the debris. “In my world of worlds, we would be making biochar out of this, because biochar has such value for composting operations, for water filtration, for sequestering PFAS. I mean, the opportunities for biochar are endless.”
But such operations aren’t an option right now, she said, so they turned to biomass and other uses, like mulch for landscaping.
For now, some debris drop-off sites will be open until things slow down, though others are closing.
Local governments are asking people not to leave wood along right-of-ways. It’s also been a dry spring so far, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources recommends that people check on burn permits and conditions in their area.
The timber industry is facing a glut of wood following the storm. One Cheboygan road commission official told IPR they reached out to people in the industry to ask about selling the wood they’re collecting at sites. The only reply they’ve received so far came from a lobbying group, which said the wood chip market is flooded.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2437-min-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 14:11:22.092590

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)A North Carolina House committee advanced nearly a dozen bills in a two-hour session Tuesday afternoon as the General Assembly nears the crossover deadline for bills to pass at least one chamber of the legislature.
Many of the bills approved by the House Judiciary 2 Committee touched on controversial issues and drew concerns from members of advocacy groups during public comment, with bills prohibiting homeless encampments and requiring parents to be informed about minors’ health care garnering extended discussion.
Several of the passed proposals focused on criminal punishment and the state’s capacity for retributive justice. Lawmakers voted in favor of a bill that would once again allow for death by firing squad and electric chair in North Carolina with the aim of resuming death row executions that have been under effective moratorium since 2006.
Undocumented immigrants were a particular focus of Tuesday’s meeting, with the committee voting in favor of one bill aimed at increasing the level of felony convictions when the defendant is in the United States without authorization and another directing health and housing agencies, social services, and public universities to verify individuals’ immigration status.
The flurry of bills owes to the upcoming General Assembly crossover deadline of May 8. Bills that do not pass either the House or the Senate by that point are formally required to wait until 2027 for renewed consideration, though in practice, legislative maneuvers allow some bills to bypass this deadline.
The death penalty
The Judiciary 2 Committee advanced a proposal with the goal of bypassing the two-decade pause on executions in North Carolina, allowing death row inmates a choice between a firing squad, electrocution, and chemical injection.
House Bill 270 would repeal a section of the law abolishing the use of the electric chair and again make this the default method of execution in North Carolina, with inmates having the option to request one of the other two methods instead. The state banned the use of electrocution for capital punishment in 1998, and has executed no one since 2006, with the use of the death penalty postponed by lawsuits over the method of execution as well as racial bias in sentencing.
The proposal comes four years after South Carolina passed a similar bill reviving the use of the electric chair and firing squad, citing an inability for prisons to obtain the chemicals used for lethal injection. While that bill led to further legal challenges over whether these two methods of execution constituted cruel and unusual punishment, the South Carolina Supreme Court ultimately upheld their use in 2024, allowing executions to resume after a decade-plus pause.

“We know that there are court cases out there that are pending. Those court cases have been frozen in place for the last, you know, close to 20 years,” said Rep. David Willis (R-Union), a lead sponsor of the bill. “It’s time for these cases to be moved forward, either through resolution by action of this body or through the courts themselves.”
The move comes months after former Gov. Roy Cooper granted the most death sentence commutations in state history, converting 15 into life sentences. With the understanding that executions might resume in the near future, advocates pushed Cooper’s administration heavily to commute all death sentences in the state.
It’s unclear whether the additional execution methods would have an immediate impact on the unofficial moratorium. While the pause initially took effect because the state medical board barred doctors from participating in lethal injections, the Supreme Court struck down that prohibition in 2009. Since then, legal challenges have centered on objections under the Racial Justice Act, with death row inmates alleging racial bias in their convictions — a claim a Johnston County judge affirmed in February for Hasson Bacote, who received a commutation from Cooper.
In his pitch for the bill, Willis took aim at Cooper and other North Carolina leaders for enabling the pause on the death penalty. “We’ve seen no support from our attorney general. We’ve seen no support from our previous two governors. And it’s time for action on this,” he said.
  Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) (photo: ncleg.gov)
In a statement prior to the vote, Noel Nickle, the executive director of the North Carolina Center for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, said the additional execution methods would only cause harm to the officials asked to carry them out.
“It forces our already overburdened state employees to carry out executions using violent methods we know will be extraordinarily damaging to their mental health,” she wrote.
Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) condemned lawmakers for advancing this bill at the same time the Senate was moving to end support for the state’s Innocence Inquiry Commission in its budget proposal.
“My heart goes out to those families who have lost someone and are watching the appeals go on and on,” Budd said. “But if we make a mistake and we take another person’s life, then twice we have committed a wrong.”
Concealed carry
The committee also approved a bill creating a “lifetime” concealed carry program and permitting schools to store less-than-lethal weapons like tasers and pepper spray for self-defense.
House Bill 674, titled the “Firearms Liberty Act,” creates lifetime permits to carry concealed firearms separate from the state’s existing five-year permits, allowing them to remain in effect indefinitely unless revoked by the state or surrendered by the gun owner.
  Rep. Jay Adams (photo: ncleg.gov)
Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba) said the lifetime permit would have the same background check, educational, and training requirements as the state’s current temporary permits, and holders would need to notify their local sheriff’s department of any change of address. Unlike the temporary permits, the lifetime permits would not have “reciprocity” with other states, meaning they would only be valid for use in North Carolina.
The bill also allows for individuals who are ordered to surrender their guns, such as after incidents of domestic violence, to transfer them to the custody of a licensed firearms dealer while the order remains in effect, rather than with the local sheriff’s department. In what Adams described as a bipartisan element of the bill, gun owners may also enter into a “safety hold” with a licensed firearms dealer, temporarily storing their guns under the shop’s care such as if they are undergoing mental or emotional distress, or if they simply require more secure storage due to a period of absence.
Finally, the proposal would allow schools to keep “defensive devices” in biometric safes for school employees who have completed annual trainings for their use. This does not include guns or other lethal weapons like knives, but allows for the secure storage of tasers, pepper spray, and other less-than-lethal defense implements on school property.
Budd, the Democrat from Mecklenburg County, raised concerns that law enforcement could mistake someone using one of these less-than-lethal weapons as a threat. She also warned that allowing items like tasers and pepper spray on school property could cause a “slippery slope” toward the inclusion of more dangerous weapons in schools.
Susanne Duncan, a former schoolteacher with North Carolinians Against Gun Violence, said he finds the bill “very alarming” during public comment, warning that having more armed individuals in a crisis could add to the danger to students and staff rather than ameliorating it.
“I was once caught in a riot in a school of 4,000 students. I was pinned against a wall,” Duncan said. “I can tell you, if people had come running down that hall with tasers or with pepper spray or with guns, there would have been dozens of children and staff injured. It would have been a very dangerous situation.”
Immigration bills
Two bills advanced by the committee targeted undocumented immigrants, including a bill increasing criminal penalties if they commit felonies and a requirement for various state agencies to vet immigration status in the course of their public work.
The first, House Bill 261, raises the level of a felony conviction for any defendant previously found guilty of a crime related to reentry after removal by immigration authorities. It also enhances sentences for committing felonies and misdemeanors while conspiring to promote or further criminal activity among all defendants.
Lead sponsor Rep. Neal Jackson (R-Moore) said his local district attorney had requested the bill. The goal, he said, was to send a message that people cannot “come to North Carolina and commit serious crimes” or they will face greater consequences. “The effect of this bill will be that a person who is here illegally in the country and commits a crime will be guilty of a felony that is one step higher than what they were initially convicted for,” he said.
Mark Swallow, an advocate with Democracy Out Loud, said he believes the bill is “likely unconstitutional.” He argued that any requirement to increase felony status based on immigration status would violate the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, and federal civil rights laws. He noted that sentence enhancements targeting noncitizens had previously been found unconstitutional in federal court.
Sammy Salkin, a policy analyst with the ACLU of North Carolina, denounced the proposal as a “cruel attack on immigrant communities.”
“Penalizing individuals differently for the same offense based on their immigration status sets a dangerous precedent and raises significant equal protection concerns,” Salkin said. “Punishment should reflect the nature of the crime, not the immigration status of the accused.”
Chuck Spahos, general counsel for the North Carolina Conference of District Attorneys, which backed the bill, said it was important to note the provision does not apply to all undocumented immigrants, only those with a prior conviction for a reentry offense. This, he said, means the law does not discern based on immigration status but instead on prior criminal record.
The second bill passed by the committee concerning immigration was House Bill 690, the “Citizens Support Act.” That bill directs the state Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Commerce, housing agencies, state public universities, and the unemployment service to vet immigration status before providing benefits and social services to North Carolina residents.
Jackson, who also sponsored this bill, said the goal is to ensure that state benefits are “provided only to U.S. citizens and noncitizens who are legally authorized to reside in the United States.” His co-sponsor, Rep. Jennifer Balkcom (R-Henderson), said the verification measures were necessary as “accountability for tax holders’ dollars.”
Rep. Ya Liu (D-Wake) suggested that in emergency situations, such verification processes could prove life-threatening.
“So, say if a patient is very ill and actively dying in front of a hospital, a state-funded hospital, so the doctors will have to check their immigration status to verify if they are a legal resident before they render any treatments?” she asked.
Balkcom said food, emergency services, and life-saving care are exempted for protection under federal law and so would not be affected by the new proposed verification requirements.
Salkin, the ACLU analyst, warned that the new restrictions could deter mixed-status families from seeking benefits for children who are U.S. citizens. “This is likely to reduce benefit use among U.S. citizens and lawfully present immigrants. We urge you to vote no,” she said.
The sentence enhancement bill is scheduled before the House of Representatives for a floor vote Wednesday afternoon. The Citizens Support Act, Firearms Liberty Act, and death penalty bill all advance to the Committee on State and Local Government for further deliberation.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3140930-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-30 14:11:22.092590

Her organization is suing Missouri, arguing the state's parental consent laws for minors seeking abortions are unconstitutional (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).A reproductive health care nonprofit filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking to overturn Missouri’s law requiring minors to get parental approval before getting an abortion.
The lawsuit contends the consent law is unconstitutional after voters passed an abortion rights amendment last year. Right By You, a nonprofit that helps young people navigate pregnancy decisions, including by increasing access to and awareness around contraceptives, prenatal care, abortion, parenting and adoption, filed the lawsuit in Jackson County Circuit Court
Missouri’s parental consent law, which remains on the books, requires that a minor attempting to access abortion receive at least one parent’s consent. The other parent must also be notified. If that’s not possible, they can also seek out a judicial bypass process.
Right By You is also challenging Missouri’s ban on aiding or assisting a minor seeking an abortion. 
“The laws bully pregnant young people without parental support into giving birth and threaten legal action against and undermine the core activities of Good Samaritans who seek to help young people effectuate their own decisions about their pregnancies with dignity,” the lawsuit reads.
Missourians in November narrowly voted to enshrine the right to reproductive health care, including abortion, in the state constitution. That language, known during the election as Amendment 3, includes a provision that prohibits the government from discriminating “against persons providing or obtaining reproductive health care or assisting another person in doing so.” 
The amendment does allow the government to legislate abortion access if compelling governmental interest exists. 
The current parental consent requirements and ban on assisting minors seeking an abortion “enhance the information, guidance or support (young people) receive,” but does “disregard, burden and punish young people’s decision to end a pregnancy,” the lawsuit reads.
Abortion returns to Columbia, opening access for mid-Missouri for first time since 2018

Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, said most young people do involve a parent or trusted adult in conversations about abortion. It’s those who can’t whom she worries most about.
“It makes sense that folks that are in healthy relationships with their children have this instinct that they would want their children to come to them, but a law that forces that to happen in every case is not the solution to that problem, because it’s not possible for a law to legislate a healthy family dynamic.” she said. 
The impact of the law, Kraft Sheley said, is “not actually on the young person that you’re imagining who has a good relationship with their parent, it’s on a young person who’s very safety and well being would be compromised by having this conversation with a parent.”
Right By You is asking the court to strike down the parental consent law and to allow the group to begin funding and arranging logistics for minors seeking abortions, including transportation, hotel and child care costs. 
“Young people are shooting this really narrow gap, and then they’re navigating this obstacle course that’s just traumatic and harmful and doesn’t provide any corresponding benefit to them,” Kraft Sheley said. “I see it play out with a lot of confusion, a lot of turmoil, and in some cases, I see young people not able to access care.”
The state of Missouri and Attorney General Andrew Bailey are named as defendants in the lawsuit, as is the Jackson County prosecutor, who is being sued as a representative of the prosecutors across Missouri. 
A separate lawsuit challenging several of Missouri’s other laws regulating abortion is also playing out in Jackson County. The day after the November election, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the same defendants on similar grounds, arguing current targeted regulation of abortion provider laws were unconstitutional under Amendment 3. 
A judge temporarily struck down most of the TRAP laws, allowing some abortions to resume in Missouri. The full trial is set for early 2026. 
Meanwhile, Bailey is also suing Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which oversees clinics in Kansas City and Columbia, over allegations that the organization is transporting minors out of state for abortions. 
The lawsuit is based on a video filmed more than a year ago at the Kansas City clinic. In the recording, a man secretly taped an interaction for Project Veritas in which he pretended to be the uncle of a 13-year-old in need of an abortion whose parents couldn’t know. 
Planned Parenthood staff then directed him to their affiliate clinics in Kansas where they said he could “bypass” parental consent. When the man asked how often girls go out of state for abortions, the Planned Parenthood employee said it happens “every day.”
During a court hearing on Monday in Cole County, attorneys for Planned Parenthood argued the lawsuit should be dropped on the grounds that the video was “hypothetical” and that abortion is now legal. 
“I find that the right to reproductive freedom initiative does not address the issue of parental consent,” Boone County Judge J. Hasbrouck Jacobs said Monday. “And because of that, I’m going to deny the motion to dismiss.”
Kraft Sheley is also a co-founder of What’s Next, an Amendment 3 accountability group made up of organizers and activists who previously called for a constitutional amendment to appear on the Missouri ballot with no restrictions on abortion. 
Immediately after Amendment 3 was approved by voters, the coalition started calling on the state’s major reproductive rights groups to challenge Missouri’s parental consent law. 
“They haven’t done so,” Kraft Sheley said. “And we can’t sit and watch those people be left behind.”
The lawsuit also notes that current policy does not clearly state how or if minors in state custody or in the foster care system can access abortion through the current parental consent law.
A Missouri teen spent her life in foster care. Now she’s fighting the state to keep her baby

The Independent recently published a story detailing the journey of a young teenager in foster care who was denied an abortion in 2024 at the age of 15. After the state said abortion wasn’t an option, she spent her pregnancy and postpartum in constant fear of the state removing her baby, despite providing her with practically no resources to help her parent. 
“My fear is we’ll see more cases like (this one,)” which Kraft Sheley described as “my literal fear of what will become of young people who are forced to continue pregnancies. That’s what is proposed by these criminal involvement laws, and that is what this constitutional amendment explicitly disallows.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8628-2-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-30 14:11:22.092590

In that role during the first Trump administration, he implemented a policy that required asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their cases pending in immigration court.Death in custodyThe top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, raised concerns about a 2010 death at a CBP station in San Diego that Scott ran.Anastasio Hernández Rojas was detained by CBP officers where he was beaten and later died from his injuries, Wyden said.Scott was later accused of covering up the death of Hernández Rojas, Wyden said.“Rather than following the agency’s own policy and immediately referring the incident to outside investigators, the San Diego CBP office began its own investigation,” Wyden said. “In the course of that investigation, the CBP officers taped over the only video copy of Hernández Rojas’s death and tampered with physical evidence, according to court documents.”The U.S. paid $1 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Hernández Rojas’ widow. The U.S. Department of Justice in 2015 declined to pursue federal charges against any of the officers or leaders involved in the Hernández Rojas case.Committee Chair Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho, defended Scott and said that U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote a letter to the committee to inform members that she reviewed the 2010 incident and that Scott’s work “was in accordance with his duties, the law and professional standards.”“Mr. Scott did not impede any investigation, nor did he take steps to conceal facts from investigators,” Crapo said Wednesday.Wyden argued that Noem was not head of DHS in 2010 and that he had spoken to officials who were present at the time of the investigation that took place surrounding Hernández Rojas’ death.“There have been these serious allegations made by the former heads of internal affairs about Mr. Scott's involvement and the cover up of the death of Mr. Hernández Rojas,” he said. “I don't believe this committee should take this letter on faith.

That’s not to say everyday kindness has disappeared altogether, but it is being overwhelmed by its opposites. And because we create our politics and not the other way around, nobody should be surprised by the state of things. Better angels have flown underground, abandoning the surface to an American primordial goop of endemic selfishness, cultivated prejudice, and practiced ignorance. And those are the exact ingredients necessary to conjure and animate somebody like President Donald Trump.
He is an American creation, through and through, inside and out.
Amid Trump’s inevitable era of sweeping cruelty, his supporters can be sorted into two buckets, albeit with some double-dipping. In one there are those who cheer each deportation, termination, and financial strangulation as independent victories in a too-woke world, and in the other are the “Reagan Republicans” who are willing to accept a degree of heavy-handed unpleasantness if it means furthering certain neoliberal aims when it’s all said and done.
Here in New Hampshire, for example, the MAGA bulldogs who serve in various leadership roles in the Legislature are in the first bucket, while Gov. Kelly Ayotte and her predecessor are among those in the second. 
The Democrats, meanwhile, have taken on a shaky dual formation with the shared goal of harm reduction: on one flank is moderation to the extreme (as exemplified by New Hampshire’s congressional delegation) and on the other a full-throated resistance movement calibrated for social media.
I’ve seen enough, in the left’s silence and its misdirected online fury, to say that the right holds no monopoly on callousness. 
Those are, generally speaking, the opposing political currents that we experience either directly or indirectly in our daily lives. But orbiting above all is the power that drives the tides now tossing us about — the force we sense but cannot see.
That American tidal power — and I’m talking about monied strength capable of moving policies and politicians like game pieces — has inflicted countless evils upon the modern world but there are two that stand apart: economic inequality and environmental degradation.
There is nothing about those two outgrowths of corporate and personal greed that should set regular people against each other, yet here we are like clockwork toy soldiers turned by an unseen hand. 
And the billionaires fiddle while Rome burns.      
What I’m saying is that you don’t have to dig very deep to see that America’s biggest divides are not natural divides. Economic inequality isn’t necessarily political nor is it theoretical — it is present in every hospital bill that can’t be paid, in every “For Sale” sign resulting from too-high property taxes, in every printed statement of unconquerable college debt. And if you think the price of environmental degradation isn’t paid by Republicans and Democrats alike then I invite you to read up on Saint-Gobain in Merrimack, Casella in Bethlehem, and the “National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System” in Manchester. Those are inconvenient stories in your backyard, stories that you can see, smell, and be poisoned by, but tell me: Are they “fake news” too?
It’s hard not to be angry today, and it’s harder still to do something meaningful with that anger. 
Over the years, I’ve talked to plenty of people who should be angry but somehow aren’t. One of them was Ellen Groh, who spent almost a decade as the director of the hopefully named Concord Coalition to End Homelessness before she retired in 2022. I’m certain that Ellen wouldn’t remember me or the group conversation we had in a newspaper conference room years back, but I think about that day now and then, and gratefully. She helped me better understand homelessness in the city where I spend so much time, which I’m sure is what she had set out to accomplish. But she also inadvertently taught me something about the limits of politics and policy, and the limitlessness of people. 
You see, we asked her question after question about the problem — its causes, its solutions, and everything in between. She listened with infinite patience and answered thoughtfully, because those were other ways that someone in her position could help. And I felt that more than anything else she was that: somebody who was trying to help. Because somebody has to.
The policy prescriptions we were asking her about mattered — and some of them mattered a whole lot. But whether they came to be or not, it seemed clear to me that the world would always need people like her — the steady ones who hold the broken pieces together, with two weary hands, even as the frenetic crowd bays at the moon.
In this nation governed by tidal powers, unseen but so harshly felt, I know we could use more Ellen Grohs to stand at the waves of fresh need, of new suffering. But things have gotten so far away from us, maybe it’s best to set the bar a little lower: “Don’t be (crappy) to the waiter,” Jason Isbell sings, “he’s had a harder day than you.”
Because I swear to God it’s the callousness that’s killing us. Bit by bit, year by year. And I know in a moment like this, with our politics mercilessly churning real bodies and real lives, that maybe, probably, less callousness isn’t enough. But here’s what else I know: I’ve been on the receiving end of enough kindness to know that it’s not nothing.
And that’s what we always seem to forget here in America: You have to take the first step first.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/barnflag-1024x709.jpg,,,2025-04-30 13:14:42.699398
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-30 17:06:18+00:00,CT Mirror,Clean Slate erasure of CT criminal records to resume in fall 2025,Maysoon Khan | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/30/clean-slate-erasure-ct-criminal-records-resume/,"After years of delays, CT officials are targeting fall 2025 to resume automatic erasure of most old criminal records under Clean Slate law.","After years of delays, state officials are now targeting fall 2025 to resume the automatic erasure of most old criminal records under Connecticut’s Clean Slate law.
The Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP), which is overseeing the law’s implementation, was approved for $10 million in state bond funding in April to put toward the project.
DESPP Commissioner Ronnell Higgins told lawmakers the funding is crucial for the department to deliver on its promise to erase the criminal records of the estimated 119,000 people in Connecticut who are believed to be eligible.
“Although I am troubled that we have not fully delivered, I can say that under my leadership and with this team, we have put the infrastructure in place to deliver on that promise,” he said.
Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in 2021 signed the Clean Slate law, which requires the state to automatically erase most low-level convictions after a period of time. The measure was seen as a major victory in criminal justice reform.
But it was stymied by ongoing technical challenges. Higgins told lawmakers during a legislative hearing in February that implementing Clean Slate is “likely the most complex IT project that the state of Connecticut has ever taken on.”
The state has missed a series of targets to begin automatic erasures. Most recently, Lamont said in December 2023 that the process to erase the vast majority of eligible records would finish in January 2024. But officials pushed back that deadline, blaming data quality issues and aging computer systems.
Lamont’s office has not responded to requests for comment.
So far, only about 13,000 people have had their criminal records erased, according to DESPP spokesperson Rick Green.
Connecticut Public reviewed hundreds of email messages between Lamont’s staff and managers working on the project, which it obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.
Those emails, dated from November 2023 through February 2024, describe conversations that unfolded as the state geared up to fully implement the law, but failed to meet the governor’s stated timeline.
The emails show officials were on the precipice of getting erasures up and running, but discovered yet another category of data quality issues that needed to be fixed.
One of those email exchanges in November 2023 involved a group of high-ranking state officials, including Patrick Hulin, the governor’s deputy policy director; Jonathan Dach, a senior advisor to Lamont; and Marc Pelka, then the undersecretary for criminal justice policy and planning at the Office of Policy and Management.;
“I am frustrated about where we are,” Hulin wrote in a Nov. 21, 2023 message, “but it remains better to fully test the system than to rush it to hit the date the Governor gave last winter.”
The state later hired quality assurance company iLab Consultants to help resolve ongoing technical problems.
Green said the company has been testing and validating Connecticut’s systems to make sure people whose records are eligible for erasure aren’t being missed.
“It involves this cumbersome process of verifying old, flawed, data from computer systems that are 60 years old in some cases,” he said.
DESPP spent $5.8 million on Clean Slate in 2024. The department is expected to spend another $10.8 million this year and through 2026, according to Green. 
Advocates say patience is wearing thin for people who, despite completing their sentences, face hurdles in accessing secure housing, employment and education.
Matt McDermott, a member of Congregations Organized for a New Connecticut, which pushed for the law, said he’s skeptical Connecticut can hit its new target, given the number of deadlines that have already passed. The organization has met with state officials regularly to discuss Clean Slate’s progress.
“It’s extremely frustrating,” McDermott said. “We’ve heard other dates that didn’t prove true.”
Under Clean Slate, the state will erase eligible misdemeanors from people’s criminal records seven years after they complete their sentence, and eligible felony convictions after 10 years. Sex crimes and family violence crimes are not eligible for erasure.
McDermott said he wants to hold state officials accountable, and push them to implement the law as quickly as possible.

(Courtesy of South Dakota Humanities Council)The South Dakota Humanities Council is set to receive at least $200,000 from a national charitable foundation to keep it afloat after the federal government terminated nearly $1 million in grant funding awarded to the organization this year.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order in February urging agencies to streamline the federal bureaucracy. The National Endowment for the Humanities, which provides funding to humanities organizations across the country, cited the executive order when it terminated $65 million in grants to all 56 humanities councils across the country and its territories earlier this month.
New York-based Mellon Foundation pledged Tuesday to provide $15 million to be divided among all 56 humanities councils. Each council will receive a minimum of $200,000, though the foundation will donate an extra $50,000 if the council matches that amount in local fundraising, said South Dakota Humanities Council Executive Director Christina Oey.
The nonprofit provides public education in literacy, civics, the arts and culture.
“It’ll allow us to continue going longer than we anticipated,” Oey said of the donation. “It was that light of hope we needed.”
The money will help keep the council’s programs running, including the annual Festival of Books and the Young Readers program. The Young Readers program distributes 15,000 copies of a book to South Dakota third graders each year.

The funding will help pay for shipping of the Young Readers books to schools, and allow this year’s Festival of Books to continue. The festival is planned for Sept. 26-28 in Spearfish.
But the donation is just a fifth of what was lost. The federal funding made up 73% of the council’s overall budget, Oey said.
Mellon Foundation President Elizabeth Alexander said in a news release Tuesday that although the donation won’t cover all the lost funding, she hopes it’ll help councils get by.
“At stake are both the operational integrity of organizations like museums, libraries, historical societies in every single state, as well as the mechanisms to participate in the cultural dynamism and exchange that is a fundamental part of American civic life,” Alexander said.

The University of Mississippi Medical Center’s Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery hosted a free oral, head, and neck cancer screening Wednesday at the Jackson Medical Mall as part of Oral, Head and Neck Cancer Awareness Week.
The event featured quick, noninvasive screenings aimed at catching cancer early — when treatment is most effective. Onyx Care provided free HPV vaccinations, while the ACT Center for Tobacco Treatment, Education, and Research offered resources on smoking cessation and free services.
“These screenings take about 10 minutes and can save lives,” said Dr. Gina Jefferson, head and neck surgical oncologist at UMMC. “The earlier a cancer is diagnosed, the better chance we have of curing it.”
Tobacco and alcohol use remain major risk factors for these cancers. However, physicians say an increasing number of cases are linked to HPV, especially among younger adults with no history of smoking or drinking. Dentists are often the first to spot early signs, which can include persistent sores, lumps in the neck, or difficulty swallowing.

Chung joins former special victims prosecutor Christina Hines, Pontiac Mayor Tim Greimel and Army veteran Alex Hawkins in looking to fill U.S. Rep. John James’ seat in Congress, as James (R-Shelby Township) forgoes a reelection bid to seek the governor’s office.
Chung grew up in Oakland and Macomb County, the son of Vietnamese immigrants, worked as an attorney bringing cases on behalf of children made ill by lead contaminated water and veterans who were denied benefits. 
Chung advised the Senate Judiciary Committee on the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. He also worked with the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of Justice on issues of fairness and opportunity in education, and served as a senior lawyer at the U.S. Department of Commerce to help implement the CHIPS and Science Act, which aimed to bring manufacturing back to the United States. 
“I’m running for Congress to bring back an American Dream where every Michigander can provide for their families, and where the government makes our lives easier, not harder,” Chung said in a statement. 
“I saw firsthand how little Donald Trump and Elon Musk actually care about working Americans.The Trump Administration is gambling away people’s life savings by taking a chainsaw to job creation programs like the one I worked on, along with Social Security, Medicaid and public education. They’re playing games with unhinged shoot-from-the-hip policies. We need new leadership that can push back against their overreach,” Chung said.
If elected, Chung said he would take on the Trump administration when it abuses its power. He also promised to fight for good-paying jobs and lower costs to give all Michiganders a shot at the American dream. 
Michigan’s 10th district runs through Rochester, Rochester Hills and southern Macomb County in Southeast Michigan.

(Jill Hummels for Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Pulitzer Prize winner Edward Larson is convinced building blocks of the Scopes trial — a showdown between human evolutionary biologists and fundamentalists beholden to creationism — remains relevant as activists work to build national political movements long after dust settled in Dayton, Tennessee.
The highly publicized battle in the summer of 1925 between defense attorney Clarence Darrow and prosecutor William Jennings Bryan at the trial of high school teacher John Scopes was an international spectacle. Darrow worked on behalf of the forces of scientific inquiry and champions of the separation of church and state, while Bryan stood with Bible-thumping Christian creationists defending a Tennessee law banning the teaching of evolution in public schools.
Larson, who earned the Pulitzer Prize in history for “Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America’s Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion,” said Tuesday at University of Kansas the 100-year-old drama addressed broad cultural, religious and legal issues of the post-World War I and pre-Depression era.
Larson said the rhetorical style favored by Darrow and honed by Bryan had periodically resurfaced in American politics as folks sought to capture the public’s imagination about the risk of teaching human evolution in classrooms. It’s been a factor in debates about other issues blending politics, law, science and faith, including gay marriage, climate change and cloning, he said.
Moving forward, Larson said, old-fashioned strategy rooted in populism was being used to undermine public health ideas of mass vaccination tamping down disease threats. Robert Kennedy Jr., the antivaccination activist turned secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has challenged effectiveness of vaccines at a moment when the threat of measles escalated. 
“Most people I’m talking to agree it’s not evolution right now. They tend to say it’s the anti-vaccine,” he said. “Another one that could come back is gay marriage. Some states are beginning to play with laws and to test the Supreme Court on that one.”
Despite political maneuvering in a few states, Larson said, the fight over evolution lost some of its luster. In Louisiana and Tennessee, lawmakers sought to skirt constitutional boundaries set by the U.S. Supreme Court to advance legislation promoting religion. The creationist mantra is shrouded in statute urging critical analysis of all sorts of theories, including evolution.
“The 2008 Louisiana law expressly allows local school boards to promote critical thinking. Not only about evolution and the origins of life, but also global warming and human cloning,” he said. “The 2012 Tennessee act goes further by protecting and encouraging critical studies of such controversial scientific theories as evolution, the chemical origins of life, global warming and human cloning.”
Larson, who spoke 25 years ago in Lawrence on the Scopes trial, said a common question was why a small, rural community in southern Tennessee became the focal point of tension between religious fundamentalism and scientific theories regarding evolution.
In part, he said, the courthouse trial was a publicity stunt by locals to generate attention for Dayton.
He said the forum also placed on a legal scale literal interpretations of creationism found in the Bible and fossil evidence discovered by scientists that pointed to evolution of the species. The messaging was so alluring the trial was the first in the United States to be broadcast on national radio.
“The answer was, because this was every town,” he said. “Such actions generate legislation and lawsuits precisely because religion matters in America. Public opinion surveys invariably find that most Americans believe in God. It troubles many Americans that science does not affirm their faith and outrages some when their children’s coursework seems to deny their religious beliefs.”
He said people who embraced diversity often sought middle ground on controversial topics when possible, but the modern era dominated by social media demonstrated people continued to instinctively respond to stirring oratory.
People will be drawn to the likes of Bryan and Darrow when they persuasively delve into prominent issues of the times, he said.
“They tapped into a cultural device that deeply troubles our national house,” Larson said. “If history is any guide, to borrow from the title of Scope’s own memoirs, we remain in the center of the storm.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scopes-trial-100th-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-30 13:14:42.699398

Asked by David Axelrod during an event Tuesday at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics whether she was considering a top-of-the-ticket campaign in three years, Raimondo answered directly, and succinctly: “yes”
“I care deeply about this country, I’ve dedicated 15 years to public service and if I think there’s a big way for me to serve again including running, I’ll do it,” Raimondo told Axelrod during the live audience event, a clip from which was posted by Axelrod to X.
 “But I also, if I thought somebody else would be better, or better able to win, I’d get behind that person in a minute.”
Her comments come months after she left her job as U.S. Department of Commerce secretary, which she held for nearly four years under former President Joe Biden. Prior to her ascendance to Biden’s cabinet, Raimondo served six years as Rhode Island governor, the first woman in the state’s top leadership role.
A former venture capitalist, Raimondo garnered a reputation for a pragmatic approach and moderate ideology, with a focus on economic development.
The Smithfield native and LaSalle Academy graduate returned to her home state Monday morning to attend the funeral Mass in celebration for the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio. In an interview after the Mass, Raimondo confirmed she is still living in D.C., though she plans to return to Rhode Island after her son graduates high school in June.
Since leaving the federal administration in January, Raimondo has joined the Council on Foreign Relations in D.C. as a distinguished fellow and co-chair of a task force on economic security. 
In 2020, her name surfaced on a short list of candidates under consideration to serve as Joe Biden’s vice president, and again in 2024 for the vice president slot on a ticket with Kamala Harris.
Her appearance with Axelrod was billed as a conversation about “all things capital and commerce,” including AI, tariffs and the United States’ economic relationship with China. But Raimondo also addressed the challenges that lie ahead for the Democratic Party to regain control in D.C., along with remarks on the media landscape and higher education, according to news coverage of the event.

In an order issued late Tuesday night, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams wrote that Uthmeier will have to prove that he shouldn’t face legal consequences over his greenlighting of arrests under the law, which she had temporarily blocked as likely unconstitutional.
At issue is an April 23 letter Uthmeier sent to law enforcement declaring that he couldn’t stop them from enforcing first-degree misdemeanor penalties to suspects accused of entering the state as an “unauthorized alien.” The law adds heightened penalties for re-entry.
Tuesday’s order also extends the suspension of enforcement of the law through the remainder of the litigation. The defendants — Uthmeier, plus Florida’s statewide prosecutor and state’s attorneys — almost simultaneously filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
Williams scheduled a hearing to discuss sanctions for May 29 in federal court in Miami.
“Even prior to any formal discovery, there is evidence that AG Uthmeier has used his authority to encourage local law enforcement to continue making arrests under a law the Court has, for the time being, found unconstitutional,” Williams wrote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Violation of court order
U.S. citizen released from jail after arrest under Florida’s new anti-immigration law

Uthmeier took office as attorney general in February, after Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed him to fill the vacancy left by predecessor Ashley Moody’s elevation to the U.S. Senate (also by DeSantis). Before becoming the state’s chief legal officer, Uthmeier was DeSantis’ chief of staff.
The class action by the Florida Immigrant Coalition, The Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status came after DeSantis signed the law on Feb. 13.
Williams referred to Uthmeier’s letter as a violation of the court’s temporary restraining order barring enforcement of the illegal entry law, which she originally issued on April 4 and emphasized on April 18 that it applied to law enforcement.
The irritated judge said she found it problematic and was offended by Uthmeier’s April 23 letter, in which he wrote that he believed “no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes your agencies from continuing to enforce Florida’s new illegal entry and reentry laws.”
“Do I need to put a ribbon on it?” Williams asked during a Tuesday afternoon hearing, referring to what more she could do to make her order legitimate.
Even then, Williams said she wouldn’t make Uthmeier sit for a deposition, a request plaintiffs’ attorneys said they have considered as the suit goes on. Although she didn’t discourage plaintiffs from filing a motion to depose Uthmeier, she said his state of mind when writing the letter was clear.
Acting Florida Solicitor General Jeffrey DeSousa told Williams the state viewed Uthmeier’s letter as explaining the position the defendants are arguing in court rather than an invitation to disobey the temporary block on the law. Instead, DeSousa shifted blame for the dispute to the plaintiffs, saying they should also have sued the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida Highway Patrol, sheriffs, and police chiefs.
The defendants asked the court on Wednesday to pause the suspension of the law.
“The State would suffer the sovereign harm of having one of its laws enjoined, while continuing to suffer from the effects of illegal immigration,” the defendants’ attorneys wrote in a motion. “Meanwhile, the individual Plaintiffs continue with their violations of federal and state law and the organizational Plaintiffs seek to further that unlawfulness.”
Judge’s rebuttal
Williams pushed back against the defendants’ position that law enforcement isn’t bound by the suspension because they’re not named in the suit and Uthmeier lacks authority to discipline them.
In the order as well as during the hearing, Williams zeroed in on Uthmeier’s posts on X, stating that he had directed FDLE and FHP to monitor protests at Tesla dealerships and FDLE and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to execute a search warrant at a Panama City Beach aquarium.
“Those statements by the party Defendant support a conclusion that he exerts a measure of control over state and local law enforcement agencies’ criminal enforcement efforts, including those related to immigration,” Williams wrote in the order.
Allowing arrests that state prosecutors would be barred from pursuing in court would raise grave constitutional concerns, Williams wrote.
Continued arrests following the suspension of the law had prompted frustration from Williams. In her order, she mentioned the arrest of a U.S. citizen in Leon County.
An FHP trooper arrested Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, on April 16. The case garnered national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reporting of the arrest without probable cause and Lopez-Gomez’s subsequent release from the Leon County Jail.

Iowa Board of Nursing records indicate Brandy Wicks, a registered nurse from Treynor, was working at an unspecified acute care hospital in 2023 when she admitted to pulling controlled and non-controlled medications from the electronic medication dispensing machine and placing the drugs in drawers in patient rooms for administration at a later time.
The board also alleged Wicks pulled a dose of oxycodone out of the medication dispensing machine and documented administering the drug to a patient who later said they never received it.
The board charged Wicks with misappropriating or attempting to misappropriate medications, failing to properly document or perform the disposal of medications, and failing to properly safeguard or secure medications.

To resolve the case, Wicks recently agreed to a settlement with the board that will allow her to keep her Iowa license, although it we be placed on probationary status for two years.
Records from Nebraska’s Division of Public Health show that Wicks’ ability to practice nursing in that state was revoked in October 2024.
The division alleged Wicks was working for a Council Bluffs hospice agency, St. Croix Hospice, when a patient’s spouse noticed the patient’s morphine pills were missing after Wicks had visited. After the spouse inquired about the missing drugs, Wicks allegedly went back to the patient’s home and returned the drugs, saying they must have fallen off a table unnoticed into her bag.
Eight pills were missing from the patient’s supply after Wicks returned them, according to the division.
In 2023, the division alleges, Wicks was working with patients at Nebraska Medicine’s trauma center when she charted that she had given a patient Oxycodone, which the patient later denied receiving. A subsequent audit allegedly revealed that over 15 days, there were 52 discrepancies in medication records involving 17 patients cared for by Wicks.
According to division records, Wicks was fired from Nebraska Medicine and later failed to appear for a hearing on licensing charges. A hearing officer, Robert E. Harkins, revoked Wicks’ ability to practice in Nebraska, stating that her actions were “serious and constitute a significant risk to public safety.”
The decision was affirmed by the chief medical officer of Nebraska’s Division of Public Health.
Wicks told the Iowa Capital Dispatch she didn’t feel the Nebraska division fairly characterized her actions at the trauma center. “They made it out to sound, like, almost like I was taking the medications — which I was not,” she said. “That was not the case.”
As for the home-hospice client’s missing morphine, Wicks said, “I believe that was a set-up. I think the family took the medication and blamed it on me. I have never taken medications from a patient, ever.”
Wicks said she’s currently dealing with some personal issues, but plans to resume working as a nurse soon, possibly at a nursing home in the western Iowa town of Oakland.
Court records indicate Wicks is currently facing a charge of child endangerment, which, after nine continuances, is scheduled for trial on May 27. A related charge of domestic abuse assault was dismissed and a related charge of violating a no-contact order is currently “on hold,” according to court records, pending the resolution of the child endangerment case.
Iowa, Nebraska boards diverged in previous case
Earlier this year, the Iowa Board of Nursing allowed another nurse to keep her licenses after her privileges had been revoked in Nebraska. In that case, the Iowa board charged Kristine Brammer of Clearfield in 2024 with misappropriating medications or property, having her license to practice nursing revoked or suspended by another authority, and unauthorized possession or use of a controlled substance.
The board alleged that while employed as a nurse at an unspecified care facility in May 2023, Brammer failed to complete the required medication counts and that narcotic medications were later found to be missing. While employed at a different care facility in June 2023, Brammer allegedly documented the administration of narcotic pain medications to patients who later denied receiving them.
On Aug. 30, 2023, the State of Nebraska revoked Brammer’s ability to practice there. The Nebraska records indicate that in 2022, she was fired or lost her privileges while working at two separate health care facilities and then failed to report those matters to the state.
In January 2025, the Iowa Board of Nursing resolved its 2024 case against Brammer by issuing her a warning and advising her that if she failed to continue her participation in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program, she may be subject to further discipline.
Separate board actions
Other nurses recently sanctioned by the Iowa Board of Nursing include:
— Judith Gonzales, an advanced registered nurse practitioner who works in the Des Moines area and is certified as a psychiatric mental health nurse. Gonzales was charged by the Iowa Board of Nursing with engaging in behavior which constitutes unethical conduct or practice harmful or detrimental to the public.
She was also charged with demonstrating professional incompetence by failing to meet state standards related to controlled substances, and committing an act which causes physical, emotional or financial injury to the patient or client.
Recently, the board resolved the case with a settlement agreement with Gonzales. In that agreement, the board says it charged Gonzales with professional boundary violations; prescribing or administering drugs in an unsafe manner by failing to accurately document the action and assess the patient; prescribing or administering drugs to individuals who weren’t patients or who were outside her area of specialty; and committing an act that caused physical, emotional, or financial harm to a patient.
The settlement agreement makes no mention of the charge of professional incompetence.
According to the agreement, Gonzales’ employer, who is not named by the board, received patient complaints that Gonzales was not maintaining proper physical or emotional boundaries with her clients and was oversharing her personal matters in their sessions.
Further investigation subsequently revealed Gonzales had not adequately documented her patient sessions or her prescribing of pharmaceuticals, the board alleges.
The board has placed Gonzales’ license on probation for two years, during which time she must complete three separate six-hour courses on professional boundaries, recordkeeping, and prescribing practices.
— Emma Fedler, a licensed practical nurse from Adel. Board records give conflicting accounts as to when Fedler was first issued an LPN license, with some documents indicating 2013 and some stating 2023. In 2023, Fedler’s license was placed on 12 months of probation after the board charged her with an excessive use of alcohol that might impair her ability to practice nursing. That charge was tied to a criminal conviction for second-offense drunken driving, according to the board.
On April 30, 2024, the board alleges, it received information that Fedler stole her co-worker’s prescribed Adderall and was fired from her place of employment, which the board has not named. The board subsequently charged Fedler with engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum, and being involved in the unauthorized possession or use of a controlled substance.
To settle the case, Fedler has agreed to submit to a multidisciplinary fitness for duty assessment that includes a substance abuse evaluation. Her license will again be placed on probation, this time for two years, and she will be required to submit to chemical screening.

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Supreme Court justices heard oral arguments Wednesday over the nation’s first religious charter school that aims to open in Oklahoma, putting the constitutionality of a state-funded Catholic education to the test.
A state board in Oklahoma approved St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to operate as a publicly funded charter school in 2023. The Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the school from opening in a June ruling, finding the concept of a religious charter school a violation of the Constitution’s prohibition against government-established religion.
The nation’s highest Court, with its conservative majority, agreed to hear an appeal of the ruling. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Catholic with ties to two legal groups behind St. Isidore, has recused.
Five of the eight remaining justices who heard the case also are Catholic — John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan is Jewish, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is a nondenominational Protestant.
A decision from the Court is expected by the end of June.

The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa applied to open St. Isidore, named after the patron saint of the internet, to offer an online Catholic education to students in all parts of the state, particularly in rural areas with no brick-and-mortar Catholic school.
Both the school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which approved St. Isidore’s founding contract, appealed the state Supreme Court ruling.
Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel of the national conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, presented the statewide board’s oral arguments Wednesday. Michael H. McGinley of Deckert LLP represented St. Isidore. Both contend states cannot exclude certain charter schools from education funding on the basis of religion.
Former U.S. Solicitor General Gregory Garre, now of Latham & Watkins LLP, gave oral arguments on behalf of the Oklahoma attorney general, who said the concept of a publicly funded religious school is unconstitutional.
St. Isidore would be Catholic in all ways but open to students of all belief systems, archdiocese officials have said. Students would have to learn Catholic doctrine, attend Mass and obey school rules inspired by church beliefs.
Oklahoma and federal law have long specified that charter schools are public schools. State statute requires charter school programs to be non-sectarian and forbids charter schools from affiliation with a religious institution.
Charter schools are subject to most regulations that apply to traditional public schools in Oklahoma, but they have more flexibility with teaching methods and employee hiring. 
They are governed by independent boards, though they must contract with a traditional school district, college or university, Native American tribe or a state board that oversees them as a charter authorizer.
Attorneys representing St. Isidore and the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board, which approved the school in 2023, contend charter schools aren’t an arm of the government like traditional public schools. 
Rather, they are private entities who contract with the state to provide a public service, like a private hospital, and therefore should be free to adopt a religion, the board and the school’s legal counsel said.
Supporters of the school cited recent rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court that found faith-based private schools can’t be excluded on the basis of religion from receiving government grants or state-funded tuition vouchers.

“The Court has made it clear time and again that you can’t open up a program to private organizations but then say, ‘But we can’t allow religious organizations into that program,’” Phil Sechler, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, told Oklahoma Voice.
Rejecting St. Isidore because of its Catholic faith is religious discrimination, Sechler said.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has been the school’s leading opponent, despite it having support from fellow Republican leaders in the state, including Gov. Kevin Stitt and state Superintendent Ryan Walters.
Drummond said before the hearing he isn’t worried the Court’s conservative majority will rule against him.
“I think even conservative people such as myself know how to read the Constitution,” he said.
Charter schools are entwined with the government as public schools, Drummond said, so one becoming religious would violate constitutionally required church-state separation.
“St. Isidore, the charter school, would not exist but for the contract (with the state),” Drummond said. “The school is established by the state. The school can be closed by the state. The school must be open to all, free, subject to substantive oversight, subject to state control. This is not a private contractor.”

The attorney general said allowing a Catholic charter school creates a “slippery slope” to any faith group operating a school with state dollars. Oklahoma taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to finance religious schools that contradict their faiths, he said.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court agreed. The state’s justices found charter schools meet the definition of a “state actor” under two tests the U.S. Supreme Court established. 
They decided a charter school is sufficiently entwined with government control and that it provides a “public function” of free public education, a duty the Oklahoma Constitution gives exclusively to the state.

In the absence of federal funding and support, municipalities feel added challenges on their paths to net zero but many chug along with the state’s help in projects to decarbonize buildings, municipal fleets, and put up solar arrays. 
The post How these Massachusetts communities are pushing forward to meet state climate goals  appeared first on CommonWealth[...]","Around 3pm in the afternoon on a Monday, not long after school was dismissed, about forty kids were running around the playground and under the large solar panel awning over the parking lot next to Hosmer Elementary School in Watertown. There were electric vehicle chargers spaced out in the parking lot and a box sat in the back of the school containing battery storage. Out of the windows in one of the science classrooms, parts of the roof are visible and solar arrays line every free square foot. Inside the school, there is a constant hum of fresh air circulating, and the walls of the hallways are decorated with brightly colored infographics that lay out facts about the school’s green features. One reads: “1920 photovoltaic solar panels are located on the school property, which generate close to 800 kWh of energy.”  Hallway in Hosmer Elementary School with infographics about the school. (Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria)One can imagine students who are just beginning to learn to read picking up the definitions of “fossil fuel,” “solar power,” and “renewable energy” as they walk through the walls.   Hosmer is one of two net-zero energy elementary schools in Watertown. The school, which has been open for about three years, consumes no more energy than it produces from the solar arrays on its roofs and over its parking lots.  Jess Donato, a third-grade teacher whose children attend Hosmer, said that the building makes the students more conscious of the climate and the environment. Her oldest son, who is now in middle school, still talks about how the school helped him learn to think about the environment and green solutions. He started thinking about “how much energy is being used, and different ideas like solar panels over parking lots. [He asked] why every school isn’t doing this? To him it seems so obvious,” Donato said. Teachers at Watertown’s net-zero Hosmer Elementary School. From left: student teacher Aleen Bowius, second grade teacher Katja Pearse, and third grade teacher Jess Donato. (Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria)The city is in the process of building yet another net-zero school — this time a high school that is going to incorporate geothermal energy along with solar panels. The high school is set to be built to LEED Platinum 4.0 standards — one of the highest certifications a building can receive for energy efficiency and sustainability. According to Watertown officials, it will be the first high school building in the country to both be net zero and LEED Platinum certified.  Watertown isn’t the only municipality in Massachusetts taking steps — and allocating scarce budget resources — to combat climate change. Cities and towns across state are funding programs to decarbonize their buildings, their municipal fleets, their schools, and contribute to the state’s climate goals. As the average global temperature rises, storms intensify, and droughts disrupt food production — and the federal government rolls back decades of climate policy — there is an added spotlight on these efforts as a way for decarbonization to continue in the state. “We can keep moving forward at the municipal level,” said Amy Boyd, the vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the Environmental Justice League of Massachusetts. “Municipal leaders can be responsive to their community’s concerns and desires to face the climate crisis head on and be ready and do what we can to protect our communities from the worst of it even if at the federal level, they’re rolling back such protections.” But most towns and cities — especially in the absence of a federal partner — remain reliant on the state to make major changes, and the state tends to move at a slow pace.  Massachusetts is a leader in climate policies, but environmentalists say that the state can do more to support municipalities in their efforts to decarbonize. The scale of the funding that the state can provide is much lower than what the federal government can. But as the Trump administration freezes funding for climate initiatives, lays off workers at the Environmental Protection Agency, and stymies offshore wind, the state will have to step in to decide what programs it can fund and what projects must be put on the chopping block.  Solar panels over library parking lot in Newton. (Photo by Laura Colarusso)Watertown, which was one of the first communities in New England to pass an ordinance requiring solar panels on most new buildings larger than 10,000 square feet or containing 10 or more residential units, has been committed to mirroring the state goal of reducing emissions to net zero by 2050. The city has a committee dedicated to environment and energy efficiency that works on pushing for green policies.  “Any city has to decide where they want to put [their] money,” said Jocelyn Tager, a resident of Watertown who has led the push for the city to invest in solar energy. “Some other school could spend $6 million on some fancy gym. And we spent it on solar arrays.” In 2017, the city had three elementary schools that needed to be replaced or renovated. Hosmer and Cuniff elementary schools were rebuilt as net-zero buildings. The third — Lowell School — was upgraded to be more energy efficient. These three projects cost about $170 million and were entirely funded through the city’s budget.  The new high school will cost about $220 million, most of which will be funded by the city, though the Massachusetts School Building Authority will kick in $50 million. The school, set to open in 2026, will serve just under 800 students. The under-construction new Watertown High School which will have solar panels and geothermal on site. (Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria)“We have found … that it is a lot easier to convince a small group of local people that this is good thing to do — that our environment is important to us — than it is to convince the state to do something,” said Pat Rathbone, a member of Watertown’s environmental and energy committee. “Massachusetts has very good climate goals, and Massachusetts will do its best to meet them. But this is the kind of thing that you could do in a state … less progressive than Massachusetts. Every single town is able to take a step like this, and our town is enormously proud of these schools.”  Tager emphasized that Watertown isn’t a rich community in comparison to its neighbors but that it has still been able to achieve this major step.  Danvers, a town located in Essex County which has its own municipal-owned electric company, has a project underway to build solar arrays on top of an existing landfill. The system is expected to generate around 3,200 megawatt hours of energy per year — enough to power roughly 1,000 homes and reduce carbon emissions by 2.7 million pounds. The solar arrays are set to be installed sometime in the next two years, and the entire project is estimated to cost the town around $3.6 million.    In the northwestern corner of the state, Williamstown — which is home to Williams College — is building its new fire station with the aim of making it a net-zero carbon facility with onsite solar panels. It’s a part of the town’s goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. In Newton, there are solar arrays operating at 19 city-owned parking lots, building rooftops, and a landfill. The city has a plan to add nine more by the end of 2026. Once the new arrays come online, 40 percent of the total electricity municipal buildings use will come from solar. Most of the planned projects will put solar arrays at public schools around the city on roofs and over parking lots.  Newton has pursued several other initiatives like converting its municipal fleet to electric vehicles as of 2022. As of this year, the city has 68 electric vehicles in its fleet program supporting 21 departments.   “Local government efforts in climate action are extremely important right now,” said Caroline Weiss, the climate action coordinator in Newton. “It’s important to continue to work on climate action in times where that’s not happening everywhere in this country. That really can still make a difference and empower residents.” Many towns choose to pursue climate initiatives not just because they are good for the environment but because they save money. Watertown owns the solar arrays on the schools, which means that the city has a locked-in cost of electricity and is therefore not subject to fluctuations in natural gas prices.  “Putting solar panels on a parking lot or on the roof [of a] school saves money for the town,” said Boyd. “That’s not an investment that’s being made just out of altruism or, love for the earth. It’s actually a good fiscal decision that saves money on the town’s power bills, which can then be spent on more books, more police officers, or whatever else the town needs to do.”  Solar arrays over Hosmer Elementary School’s parking lot. (Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria)Towns and cities face tradeoffs when choosing to invest in climate initiatives because they often finance projects through their tax base, leaving less money for other priorities as inflation and the uncertainty around tariffs raise costs. And unlike the federal government, local governments can’t run a deficit to make ends meet. In Marblehead, a community on the North Shore, community leaders are also trying to decarbonize municipal buildings but face budget constraints.  In the town, residents have been frustrated that the restrooms have been closed down seasonally due to failing heating equipment. The town has chosen a climate-friendly way to solve this problem: install a heat pump system for the restrooms. The project used money from American Rescue Plan Act funding to put in the heat pump. But other climate projects are difficult for the town to afford. Marblehead has struggled to find the funds for a $13.8 million project to replace the deteriorating seawalls that protect the town from erosion and flooding, both of which are intensifying because of climate change. Town officials were counting on a federal PROTECT grant to fund the project, but that program was canceled. They’re pursuing another federal grant, but there is still uncertainty there on whether the town will get funding. It’s difficult to do climate initiatives with just town funds, according to Logan Casey, the town’s sustainability coordinator.  “Municipalities [are] cash-strapped, and that is very much the situation in Marblehead,” said Casey. “[For] a lot of other municipalities in Massachusetts there isn’t a lot of free cash just flying around ready to pick up for any capital project that you can imagine.” Federal and state funds are crucial to helping the town move forward on its climate goals, Casey added. Massachusetts’ Green Communities Grant program, established through a 2008 law, provides funding to municipalities that want to reduce municipal energy use and costs through clean energy projects. Municipalities must first be designated as a “green community” and pledge to cut municipal energy use by 20 percent over five years, support renewable energy, and promote energy efficiency in municipal buildings and transportation to qualify for the program.  Since 2010, the program has awarded more than $191 million for projects like installing high-efficiency lighting, upgrading energy management systems, and transitioning HVAC systems away from fossil fuels. In March 2025 alone, the state gave more than $7.2 million to cities and towns across Massachusetts to fund clean energy projects. Newton has received a total of $2.2 million in Green Communities grants since 2010 for projects like weatherizing public buildings and installing heat pumps. Weiss said that Green Communities and Mass Save, the state’s energy efficiency program for residential and commercial properties, are some of the biggest drivers of decarbonization in Newton. (Mass Save also offers rebates for converting HVAC systems and appliances to clean energy.)  State programs allow decarbonization to happen on a larger scale than a single community could afford, said Boyd “Larger towns that are able to have a sustainability professional on staff are going to be able to move farther and faster than towns that that can’t afford to have somebody whose whole job is focused on that,” said Boyd. “But every town [can decarbonize] if we can help them with state policies and provide some of the upfront funding … to get over the initial hump of the upfront cost of investment.” Michael Barrett, the Senate chair of the Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy Committee, emphasized the importance of the state providing financial backing to local projects that provide outreach to residents about utilizing the Mass Save program or state funding to decarbonize at the individual level. “There are all kinds of local activities for example that involve nonprofit, volunteer coaching in which somebody retired perhaps from a regular day job, but smart about heat pumps or solar panels participate in a community backed effort to offer advice to residents of the community that want to do the same thing,” said Barrett. “The reason that so many of these programs are appealing to state officials like me is that you get a lot of bang for your buck. [It is a] human capital extender — the effort is being expended by local volunteers with the help of a compensated coordinator or two.” One such program is the PlugIn program, a partnership between Acton, Ashland, Natick, Sudbury, Wayland, Westborough, and Framingham to do outreach to individual households on how to shift away from fossil fuels and transition to electrification. The program focuses on rooftop solar, community solar, and heat pumps. The program is run by the non-profit MassEnergize and has received funding from the Legislature.  Legislators set aside money in the state’s budget for programs like these to help municipalities. However, the environmental community argues that the state can do more to support municipalities in their efforts to decarbonize — especially for environmental justice communities that lack resources — in the absence of federal support. “Municipalities do not have the tools to raise the kind of revenue that they need to do a transition to a clean energy economy,” said Vickash Mohanka, head of the Massachusetts Sierra Club. “We can see that through energy efficiency and Mass Save program. If towns and small cities had to fund their own version of Mass Save, we wouldn’t have any energy efficiency in the state basically. It would be extremely difficult…So having the state step in is a necessary tool.”  Municipally-owned cars in Newton charging in the Newton City Hall parking lot. (Photo by Laura Colarusso)Local governments aren’t just limited by their lack of funds. In some cases, they require approval from the Legislature to take steps to decarbonize. For example, municipalities cannot adopt an ordinance that requires all new buildings or major renovation projects to be fossil fuel-free unless the Legislature approves it. This is a policy that many towns and cities across Massachusetts have wanted to adopt, but the state does not allow municipalities to regulate or restrict the use of fossil fuels in construction.  In 2022, the Legislature launched a pilot program that allows up to 10 communities to adopt such a policy. The communities are: Arlington, Newton, Acton, Aquinnah, Brookline, Cambridge, Concord, Lincoln, Lexington, and Northampton. The program is supposed to serve as a demonstration program for a fossil-fuel free mandate for new buildings.  The roll out has been slow for the program with communities getting approved nearly two years after the law passed. There are many communities including Salem, Boston, and Somerville that wanted to be a part of the program but couldn’t. Environmentalists say that the pilot program needs to be expanded. “The Legislature must act with urgency to facilitate the expansion of this program and allow an equitable adoption of this opt-in program so that more diverse communities are able to achieve cleaner air quality, along with lower construction and operational building costs,” said Lisa Cunningham, a co-founder of advocacy group ZeroCarbonMA. Municipalities have led the push on adopting strict emissions reduction standards for existing larger buildings through “BERDO,” or the Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure initiative. The policy sets declining emissions standards for larger buildings and sets fines for buildings that don’t comply.   Boston, Cambridge, and Newton have all adopted versions of BERDO with their own schedules for compliance. For Boston, the first compliance window began in 2025, and the city has created a fund aimed at supporting projects to reduce building emissions, especially for “communities disproportionately impacted by air pollution.” Watertown is in the process of drafting a BERDO ordinance. According to Boyd, communities like Boston adopting BERDO can serve as an example of a success story that other communities and the state can learn from. But outside of ordinances like BERDO, the energy profile of buildings is still largely regulated through state standards.  “There are other ways besides grants that state aid is hugely helpful to municipalities,” said Ann Berwick, the co-director of climate and sustainability in Newton. “Cities and towns can’t adopt their own building codes. So the state plays an important role in promulgating progressive building codes.” Another way that towns and cities have sought to green their energy portfolios is by setting up municipal aggregation programs. A municipality can negotiate a competitive rate for electricity pricing on behalf of the residents and businesses within a community and they can set how much of the energy mix is provided by renewable sources. These arrangements have been around in the state since 2000, but more recently, municipalities have begun to choose increasing amounts of renewable energy content. There are 199 municipal aggregation programs with around 1.27 million customers enrolled in them across the state, as of January 2024. The biggest one is in Boston where residents are automatically enrolled in a program that has 42 percent renewable energy unless they opt out. (Newton, for example, has a much higher base option of 95 percent renewables in which residents are automatically enrolled.) The cost of electricity through the Boston program is currently higher than the rate offered by the local utility company but given the fluctuations in fossil fuel-based energy, there are times when the negotiated price is lower than the rate offered by the utility company. The Department of Public Utilities is tasked with approving each municipal aggregation program and that has led to years-long delays for municipalities seeking approval. The state has made the approval process easier by creating a template and guidelines for municipalities to follow. That has reduced the delay significantly, according to Larry Chretien, executive director of the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance.  The country is entering a new era of federal climate policy where funding for decarbonization and mitigation programs is being frozen as the Trump administration rolls back state-level rules and other protections designed to avoid the worst of climate change.  Towns and cities are doing the best they can to decarbonize but they are looking to the state for more funding, more guidance, and more permission to be aggressive in their climate goals. The state’s climate chief, Melissa Hoffer, emphasized that a partnership between communities and the state will be crucial to meet the current moment.  “It’s not only important to think about individual projects in municipalities, but to think about how [we] can coordinate efforts across districts,” said Hoffer. “Instead of one-off projects and one-off planning, how can we coordinate that to address that risk and better coordinate the capital that is available…We’re in a capital-constrained environment now.” The question on many environmentalists’ minds is whether the Legislature will meet the moment.  “The [Massachusetts] Legislature definitely is [slow],” said Gandbhir. “I appreciate all the work that they’ve done so far, but there’s definitely a need of a jump start. There’s a lack of transparency with the Legislature and… that can really cause a loss of perspective and a loss of sight over what we really need to accomplish. There’s a lot that needs to be done moving forward, and we do really need to pick up the pace.” Sen. Jamie Eldridge, who sponsored the funding for the PlugIn program and has pushed for drought management policies and a plastic bag ban, said the Legislature can do more for municipalities. “The state certainly needs to step up and we need to pass a very robust climate bill, perhaps [with] more state incentives for electric vehicles, battery storage, [and] solar panels,” said Eldridge. “What are we doing to make it easier to put up solar, given the Trump administration’s hostility to offshore wind?” Eldridge is pushing this session for a bill that would create a climate change superfund that would collect money from companies that are responsible for the more greenhouse gas emissions to fund resilience and adaptation projects in communities that are most impacted by climate change. “It’s reasonable whether it’s going after multinational corporations or finding some progressive tax to find a dedicated revenue source to do climate projects, whether it’s energy efficiency, solar, geothermal [or to] help communities hire sustainability managers,” Eldridge said.  Barrett, the state senator from Lexington, added a note of hope for local efforts even in the face of federal hostility to climate policies. “When it comes to climate initiatives, Trump is torching the field,” said Barrett. “He is riding roughshod over the crop and really putting it to ruin, but he’s not really destroying the root system of the climate movement. We’ve got lots of local activists with [some] state and local government help available to preserve the … climate movements — the root system. We can keep things healthy and going even though he’s doing a lot of damage on the surface. … The more localized climate action is, the less likely is it that Trump can reach it and damage it.” The post How these Massachusetts communities are pushing forward to meet state climate goals  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HosmerOutFront-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 12:21:00.334084

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Lawmakers gave wide final approval Wednesday to two measures designed to shrink the state’s looming budget deficit by $136 million.
The two bills are Legislative Bill 650, from State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, related to trimming business incentives, and LB 645, from State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, related to scaling back school retirement contributions based on how well funded the pension plan is. 
LB 650 passed 40-7. LB 645 passed 45-2.
Tax incentives pared back
LB 650 from von Gillern, who chairs the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, would reduce or defund various tax incentives with savings this biennium, including:

Buyer-based exemption for construction contractors to purchase materials tax-free if appointed to do so by a client ($12.9 million).
Credit for retailers collecting sales taxes (reduced, $11.7 million savings).
Renewable Chemical Production Tax Credit Act for local businesses producing renewable chemicals (defunded after 2025, $8.5 million savings).
Nebraska Relocation Incentive Act offering tax incentives for relocation expenses (reduced, $8 million savings).
Nebraska Advantage Rural Development Act for individuals or companies that increase economic activities intended to benefit rural Nebraska (reduced, $6.8 million savings).
Nebraska Biodiesel Tax Credit Act for retail dealers who sell and dispense biodiesel at a taxpayer’s retail gas station (reduced, $1 million savings).
Creating High Impact Economic Futures (CHIEF) Act for charitable contributions to community assistance or services helping to alleviate areas of chronic economic distress (defunded after 2025, $900,000 savings).
Nebraska Shortline Rail Modernization Act to offset railroad infrastructure maintenance and capital improvements for Class III railroads (reduced, $500,000 savings).
Food donation income tax credit for grocery stores, restaurants or agricultural producers that donate food to a food bank, food pantry or food rescue (defunded after 2025, $500,000 savings).
Cast and Crew Nebraska Act for qualifying film companies, productions and actors (defunded after 2025, $500,000 savings).
Reverse Osmosis System Tax Credit Act for the one-time installation of a reverse osmosis system at a taxpayer’s primary residence (reduced, $250,000 savings).
Urban Redevelopment Act designed to grow small businesses and generate investment in Nebraska’s urban cores (defunded after 2025, $101,000 savings).

School retirement changes
LB 645 from Ballard, who chairs the Legislature’s Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee, would reduce annual contributions to the state’s school retirement pension plan — for all employees outside Omaha Public Schools, who have a separate retirement plan — depending on the actuarial funding level of the pension plan. The school plan is currently 99.91% funded.
The state currently gives 2% of statewide payroll for employees covered under the plan. School employees contribute 9.78% of their monthly payroll, while school districts match that at 9.88% of the eligible employees in their district.
  The following represents the scaling retirement contribution rates that would be in place under an amended LB 645 proposed by State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln. (Courtesy of Sen. Beau Ballard)
Under the amended LB 645, contribution rates would change each July 1 for all three groups depending on whether the plan is:

Less than 96% funded (employees 9.75%, employers 9.85%, state 2%).
Between 96% and 98% funded (employees 8.75%, employers 8.84%, state 0.7%).
Between 98% and 100% funded (employees 8%, employers 8.08%, state 0.7%).
100% funded or more (employees 7.25%, employers 7.32%, state 0%).

Multiple senators said the tiered system could offer a “cushion” in hard economic times. 
Teachers and other school employees could see an immediate take-home pay increase, and school districts could have a property tax reduction. However, if the plan’s funding level falls, closing the gap would fall back to the state, employees and school districts.
Ballard, at the urging of State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, earlier this week put in language to LB 645 protecting the state’s continued contributions of 2% of payroll for Omaha Public Schools employees to the separate district retirement plan each year. That amendment also said it isn’t the Legislature’s intent to pick up “any financial responsibility or liability” for the OPS pension, which the state now manages.
Budget impacts
With the passage of LB 650 and LB 645, and with Gov. Jim Pillen’s expected support — he included both measures in his January budget proposal — the state’s projected budget deficit would fall by $136 million. The state also would save $187.24 million in the following two-year budget cycle, based on current projections.
Lawmakers still would need to find $259.4 million over the next two weeks to balance the budget and meet a statutorily required reserve limit, according to estimates from the Legislative Fiscal Office.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., hopes to put the entire package on the floor for a vote before the Memorial Day recess begins.Nearly every one of the chamber’s 220 GOP lawmakers will need to vote to approve the 11-bill package in order to send it to the Senate, where Republicans will likely make changes to the legislation.The first three markups included some of the less controversial aspects of the package for Republicans, including plans to increase spending on defense by $150 billion, a $70 billion boost to border security funding and an overhaul of federal student loans and Pell grants.Homeland Security Chairman Mark E. Green, R-Tenn., wrote in a statement that GOP lawmakers on the panel ""advanced funding to give Border Patrol agents the tools they have long requested to accomplish their homeland security mission in the field while protecting our communities.”“Conversely, the actions of our colleagues across the aisle today proved what the American people have known for some time,” Green wrote. “Democrats would rather advocate for a radical, open-borders agenda than for the safety of their own constituents, or the CBP personnel who suffered through a historic border crisis under the Biden-Harris administration.”The panel voted 18-14 along party lines to approve the bill. Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., wrote in a statement after his panel approved its bill that the measures ""not only would save taxpayers over $350 billion but also bring much-needed reform in three key areas: simplified loan repayment, streamlined student loan options, and accountability for students and taxpayers.""""I’m proud of the Committee’s work today to finally stand up and end the status quo of endless borrowing,” Walberg wrote.That panel voted 21-14 along party lines to approve its bill.House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., wrote the defense funding increase would ensure “that our national defense remains the strongest in the world and supports an agile and modern fighting force.”That committee voted 35-21 to advance its bill, with five Democrats — Don Davis of North Carolina, Jared Golden of Maine, Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico, Eugene Vindman of Virginia and George Whitesides of California — voting with all committee Republicans in favor.House committees are expected to release bills next week showing how Republicans plan to extend the 2017 GOP tax law as well as how they plan to cut federal funding on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, program.",,,,2025-04-30 12:21:00.334084

(Getty Images)Voters in Morgantown have narrowly rejected repealing an ordinance prohibiting homeless people from sleeping on the streets and in other public areas. 
The city voted 982 to 904 Tuesday in favor of not repealing the camping ban. The election results are unofficial until a canvas takes place May 5, the city said in a news release. 
The law, which is so far not yet in effect, prohibits camping on any public property — including streets, parks and trails — and also prohibits storing personal property in public areas. Second and third violations of the law are punishable by fines of $200 and $300 and/or 30 days in jail, respectively.
Council passed the ordinance in September. After that, the Morgantown Coalition for Housing Action successfully petitioned to have it repealed or put on the ballot. Council chose to put it on the ballot rather than repealing it. 
Proponents of the law have said homeless people sleeping in public areas is a health and safety issue.
Councilwoman Louise “Weez” Michael, who proposed the ordinance, said in a statement Wednesday she appreciates the trust of the community placed in council by supporting the ordinance. 
“This decision reflects our dedication to maintaining public safety and enhancing the quality of life for all residents,” she said. “We remain committed to working collaboratively with various stakeholders to ensure that our policies are effective and compassionate, addressing the needs of both our unsheltered population and the broader community.”
Opponents of the laws say camping bans do nothing to address the causes of homelessness and can make it worse by imposing fines and criminal penalties that make it harder for people to get into housing. 
They also point out that the city does not have enough resources for homeless people who want shelter. Morgantown has 54 year-round emergency shelter beds and another 21 beds when the winter shelter is open — not enough to accommodate the 100 homeless people identified during the 2024 point in time count. 
Councilman Brian Butcher, a homeless service provider, said Wednesday he’s very disappointed in the election results.
“[I’m] hopeful that the folks who said that this would spur them to create more resources actually do that now,” he said in a text message. 
Dozens of cities around the country have prohibited public camping after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a similar camping ban in Grants Pass, Oregon, amid record levels of homelessness. 
During the most recent legislative session, Del. Geno Chiarelli, a Republican who represents Monongolia County, introduced a bill that would have implemented a camping ban statewide. The bill passed in the House of Delegates but not in the Senate. 
“I was pleased, but not surprised to see Morgantown voters spoke at the ballot box yesterday to maintain a ban on individuals using our public property as camp sites,” Chiarelli said in a statement Wednesday. “I know this is an important safety issue in other parts of the state, which is why I plan to introduce my bill to ban urban camping again next year during the regular legislative session.”

When he called his dad and told him he was on suicide watch, his father started to cry.
During a previous facility inspection, a licensing specialist from the Louisiana Office of Juvenile Justice (OJJ) reported that the jail failed to “identify youth who may be at risk of suicide or who may need prompt mental health services.”
OJJ licensing specialists visited the jail multiple times between July and February and found the facility violated state regulations 83 times. The Appeal also received reports for an additional 11 juvenile detention facilities inspected during the same period. Jackson Parish had more violations than the combined total of those facilities and almost 12 times more than the second-worst lock-up.
The Jackson Parish Sheriff’s Office and the Office of Juvenile Justice did not answer a list of questions sent by The Appeal.

Inspectors detailed numerous violations of the kids’ rights. In February, an OJJ inspector reported that the Jackson Parish Jail “failed to ensure the youth are available for the minimum minutes in a school day as required by law.”
During multiple visits, specialists observed that the young people had no privacy when using the bathroom.
“Based upon observations, the provider’s bathroom facilities are not designed to allow youth to shower and/or perform bodily functions without others viewing them naked,” an OJJ specialist wrote in a February report. At the time, the jail held 20 young people. Their ages were not listed.
In another report, a specialist wrote that “a youth was observed on the toilet using the restroom in full view of other youth.”

Since 2022, civil rights attorneys have fought a protracted legal battle to ensure incarcerated kids receive the services they’re entitled to in a supportive environment. That year, the state announced it would send children to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, better known as Angola. A federal judge allowed the transfers to proceed, ruling that the unit is “therapeutic and rehabilitative while maintaining discipline, safety, and security,” in line with OJJ’s “rehabilitative, not punitive, mission.”
But after that judge visited the prison a year later, she ordered all children removed from Angola, finding that they ​​“are being victimized, traumatized, and seriously and irreparably harmed.” State officials moved the kids to the Jackson Parish Jail. Since then, children at the jail have said that they’ve been held in solitary confinement, sprayed with mace, shot with pepper balls, and denied educational and therapeutic services.
In November, OJJ terminated its contract with the Jackson Parish Sheriff’s Office, but the facility continues to hold kids. Invoices show that the agency paid the sheriff’s office more than $82,000 and over $86,000 for “juvenile housing” for December 2024 and January 2025, respectively. OJJ was billed more than $47,000 for March’s “juvenile housing.”
OJJ’s inspection reports echo many of the same issues documented by the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services, which visited the jail last April. As of July 1, 2024, OJJ became responsible for regulating and licensing juvenile detention facilities.
Although federal law requires that carceral facilities separate juveniles and adults by both sight and sound, an OJJ inspector reported in July that two adult detainees were housed in a room that was licensed to house children. The inspector did not specify if kids were also present. However, multiple young people have told the court that they frequently encounter adult detainees.
“The guards, who all wear sheriff deputy uniforms, did not keep me safe when I arrived here,” one child said in a January statement. “I was jumped by other kids thirteen (13) times, and once I was beaten up by guards.”
He says guards maced him seven or eight times.
“The mace really stings,” he said.

OJJ investigators found that the Jackson Parish Jail improperly handled suicide attempts that occurred in September and October.
According to a report on the September attempt, video shows a young person tying a ligature while an officer sat at a desk. About seven minutes later, the youth attempted to harm himself. The officer then radioed for assistance.
“[OJJ] [s]pecialists observed very little to no movement by staff during this time,” the investigator wrote. “Staff members must be moving around. The bunks are a critical issue and need to be addressed immediately to avoid any more attempts of suicide.”
The young person was placed on suicide watch. But, from Sept. 9 to Sept. 17, jail staff missed over 50 scheduled checks, which must occur every 15 minutes.
The OJJ specialist interviewed staff members who had spoken with the youth: three counselors, a nursing assistant, and several corrections officers. A counselor reported that the young person should speak with a psychiatrist, but documents do not indicate that he ever did.
One of the counselors told the OJJ specialist that only the nurse practitioner could take the young person off suicide watch.
In violation of state regulations, the jail also failed to report the suicide attempt to the “parent/legal guardian, defense counsel, and judge of record.”
Another report details an Oct. 30 suicide attempt, but it’s unclear if it involved the same person who attempted suicide in September.
In the October case, the report says jail staff failed to properly monitor the youth.
“Based upon record review, the level of mental health supervision provided to C-1 [the youth] was not determined by a qualified mental health professional,” the OJJ specialist wrote. “Provider failed to provide current policy for Suicide Management and Prevention.”
Instead of conducting in-person suicide watch checks, the report says jail staff monitored the young person using cameras—yet another violation of state regulations. On nine separate occasions, staff did not conduct the required 15-minute checks.

The reports also detail abuse by employees. During a five-week period from August to September, staff sprayed kids with a “chemical agent” at least 15 times, sometimes multiple times a day. After one incident, the staff failed to obtain immediate medical follow-ups for two young people. Specialists also found that the jail violated the required staff-to-youth ratio of 1 to 8. On one occasion, the specialist observed one staff member supervising 15 youth.
In a January inspection report, an OJJ specialist said he viewed footage of a jailer using a “chemical agent” against a youth. Although a “medical professional” told the specialist that he had “conducted an assessment” of the victim, there was no documentation that any examination had occurred.
The specialist viewed a video of another attack that occurred on the same day. In that case, two staffers used “a type of intervention on a youth that was not an approved physical escort technique, physical restraint, or mechanical restraint device.” The investigator said the detainee was removed “in a seated position,” and that the restraint techniques were “disproportionate to the actions and behavior” the youth exhibited. The specialist said the youth was not threatening themselves or others.
The two staff members “each had an arm extended above [the victim’s] head and behind his back,” and “were walking out of the room while dragging [the victim] out by the arms.”
After reviewing the inspection reports provided by The Appeal, David Utter, a member of the kids’ legal team, said that two state agencies have “found the jail to be severely lacking in the most basic treatment and rehabilitative and educational programs.”
Utter said that decades of research show that subjecting children to these types of conditions has catastrophic consequences.
“Kids do better when they’re home,” he told The Appeal. “Kids do better when we wrap services around them in their community. But Louisiana keeps on sending children to these punitive environments in the face of proven justice policy.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/jackson-parish-sheriffs-office-hq-png-1024x813.webp,,,2025-04-30 12:21:00.334084

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Coloradans’ trash negatively affects our health after going to landfills. How? Trash, especially food and yard waste, creates large amounts of invisible air pollution in the form of gases. This air pollution contains methane that negatively impacts our climate and toxic air pollutants like benzene and hydrogen sulfide that can make people sick. Coloradans living closest to landfills suffer the worst effects. All of us experience harm from landfill air pollution no matter where we live.
To help address this problem, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment recently proposed a Landfill Methane Rule to the Air Quality Control Commission. The rule’s purpose is to reduce the landfill gases that harm our bodies, our air, and our environment.
This rule would provide highly effective and economical ways to collect and reduce landfill air pollution. Biocovers and biofilters, which use bacteria to break down the gases, are one approach included in the proposed rule. Collecting the gases then burning them inside a closed structure (called enclosed flaring) is another. For either method to work well, highly accurate measurement of the amount of gases released from landfills is necessary to make sure landfill gases are being optimally reduced.
While biocovers and biofilters work well to reduce landfill gases, they are not enough to handle the overall amount of air pollution created by landfills. In order to meet our climate goals and protect public health, landfills will have to collect and burn landfill gases or put them to beneficial use (for instance, using landfill gases to generate energy).

When I first learned the rule allows enclosed flaring as a method of pollution control, I was alarmed. I pictured oil and gas operations burning unwanted gases in highly polluting and inefficient open flames (called open flaring), a process that has serious impacts on our health. The proposed rule requires new landfill flares to be enclosed and existing open flares at landfills to be phased out by 2029. Enclosed flaring is a tightly controlled process that eliminates 98% to 99% of gases collected from a landfill.
Enclosed flaring is different from open flaring because an enclosed flare burns almost all of the gases collected and can be tested to make sure pollution reduction targets are being met. Unfortunately, some particulate air pollution is created during enclosed flaring (called combustion products), but enclosed flaring removes much more air pollution than it creates. As such, enclosed flaring is a needed tool to decrease the harm landfill gases cause to our health and environment.
While enclosed flaring is necessary, the public must be protected from combustion products created by the process. The combustion products released by enclosed flaring can be closely monitored and accurately measured. The proposed Landfill Methane Rule requires such monitoring and also requires that any pollution created by enclosed flaring meet air quality standards. In order to minimize the potential harms of enclosed flaring, air quality standards and the proposed monitoring processes must be rigorously enforced.
As a physician, I care a lot about the negative impacts of air pollution on our well-being. The best way to prevent landfill air pollution is to reduce the amount of food and yard waste going into landfills. We also must address the ongoing current air pollution from landfills. CDPHE’s proposed Landfill Methane Rule creates some of the strongest requirements in the country for reducing landfill air pollution.

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states, including South Dakota, have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
Education board votes to finalize embrace of phonics-based reading instruction for South Dakota

In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
‘It’s the system that needs fixing’
Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed it into law Monday.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
Federal education cuts and Trump DEI demands leave states, teachers in limbo

The new law requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
Opposition to ‘science of reading’
Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.










A student's likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute


In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

Shelley Moore Capito. (Getty Images)
At least some workers at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health are getting back to work this week after federal cuts in early April took them off the job, according to a statement released Tuesday by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.
Those returning to work include some employees from the Coal Worker Health Surveillance Program and the Fire Fighters’ Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program. The total number of individuals who were granted reemployment has not been released.
And those who are returning to work will, at this time, only be doing so temporarily.
A Reduction In Force for the “vital” federal agency is still slated to go into effect in June and will impact these workers, according to a statement from the local chapter of the American Federation of Governmental Employees, a labor union representing the employees.
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of AFGE Local 3430 in Morgantown, said in a news release that the union is “encouraged” by the decision to call crucial workers back to work.
“This action, though temporary, allows these dedicated professionals to return to their critical roles in advancing worker safety and health across the country,” Tinney-Zara said. “Their return means renewed momentum for life-saving research, outreach and interventions that protect workers in high-risk industries and help prevent illness, injury, and death on the job.”
Notably, Tinney-Zara continued, it seems only workers in the CWHSP and the FFFIPP — programs that are “currently in the media spotlight” — were included in the calls to return to work. That leaves numerous other programs and initiatives undertaken by NIOSH still inoperable after cuts from the new federal Department of Government Efficiency hit the agency in early April.
“These are undoubtedly vital initiatives, but they are only a portion of the comprehensive, nationwide worker protection mission NIOSH fulfills,” Tinney-Zara said. “From construction sites to health care facilities, from transportation hubs to agricultural fields, NIOSH’s work touches nearly every corner of the American labor force.”
The directive offering some people their jobs back came after Capito, earlier this month, wrote a letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging him to reconsider the cuts that cost at least 200 people their jobs — and, in turn, ended the programs they worked for — in the Morgantown NIOSH facility.
On Tuesday, Capito said in a statement that she was “encouraged that some NIOSH functions for coal miner and firefighter safety are slated to resume with some select staff returning to work this week.”
“But my understanding is that this is temporary so my focus will continue to be on working with [the federal Department of Health and Human Services] on permanently restoring these functions and personnel in the most efficient and effective manner,” Capito continued.
In her letter to Kennedy on April 21, Capito emphasized how critical Morgantown’s NIOSH facility and the workers within it were to combatting deadly black lung disease and protecting miners who are now being pushed, through initiatives by the Trump Administration, to mine more coal than any time in recent memory.
“The NIOSH Mining Program works to eliminate mining fatalities and injuries. Research in rock dust has resulted in safety changes to prevent explosions in underground mines …” Capito wrote. “NIOSH’s [CWHSP] studies respiratory disease and provides black lung screenings to coal miners. It is my understanding that the RIF impacted every employee in these important programs.”
With work by the CWHSP halted since April 1, coal miners in central Appalachia have been without access to critical health services and surveillance, including free screeningsfor black lung and a program that allows them, once diagnosed with black lung, to request relocating to a different, less dusty portion of a mine in order to mitigate the worst developments of the deadly disease.
Anyone requesting to relocate in a mine — a labor right afforded to miners through the Part 90 program — must have their black lung testing results evaluated and marked eligible by a NIOSH worker in order to be approved.
But with DOGE’s cuts, those workers didn’t exist anymore.
The reduction in services for coal miners comes as a surge of black lung disease is hitting the workforce. It also hits as implementation of a federal rule that would limit miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust for the first time ever has been delayed.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners in central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
And the resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before. This is due to miners, because of a lack of easily accessible coal, being forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone than their predecessors in order to reach what little coal remains.
When the silica dust rule was slated to go into effect this month, the former secretary for the federal Department of Labor estimated that it could potentially save thousands of lives.
Now, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the federal Mine Health and Safety Administration — the agency that would be in charge of enacting and enforcing the silica rule — is being temporarily headed by an attorney who worked with industry groups that lobbied against implementation of exposure limits for silica, which advocates and coal mining veterans have colored as being life saving if ever implemented.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NIOSH-GettyImages-1439782819-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 12:21:00.334084

President Donald Trump marked the 100th day of his second term on Tuesday as Gov. JB Pritzker has spent the week calling on Americans to pressure congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s agenda and highlighting how Trump’s policies affect Illinois.

President Donald Trump marked the 100th day of his second term on Tuesday as Gov. JB Pritzker has spent the week calling on Americans to pressure congressional Republicans to oppose Trump’s agenda and highlighting how Trump’s policies affect Illinois.

“I'm deeply concerned about what the next 100 days, and frankly, the next 1,000 days will be like,” Pritzker said Tuesday night during a virtual town hall.

Pritzker appeared on the progressive MeidasTouch podcast’s live town hall alongside three other Democratic governors: Kathy Hochul, of New York, Maura Healey, of Massachusetts, and Tim Walz, of Minnesota — the unsuccessful 2024 vice presidential nominee.

Throughout the town hall, the second-term Illinois governor continued calling for Americans to make their voices heard against what he perceives as a destructive Trump administration.

“I believe that we all ought to be mobilizing,” Pritzker told a Florida resident. “It's the best way for us to get across what we really believe is that, you know, show up at your Republican congressman's office and let them know: Quit shutting down veteran services, quit taking away Social Security and Medicaid.”

But for Democrats to be successful in future election cycles, the party must deliver results on voters’ priorities, Pritzker said. In addition to explaining a “simple message” about the party’s values to voters, Democrats should also embrace alternative media interviews to reach new voters, he said, pointing to a string of podcasts Walz appeared on during last year’s vice-presidential campaign.

“He was everywhere,” Pritzker said. “We've got to do that, all of us, and make sure that the Democratic message of standing up for working families is heard everywhere and directly to people who are online.”

Pritzker’s live podcast appearance Tuesday came two days after he delivered blistering criticism of unnamed people in his party for using podcasts and media interviews to chastise other Democrats.

“What I find ironic about the current conversation surrounding our party is that the voices flocking to podcasts and cable news shows to admonish fellow Democrats for not caring enough about the struggles of working families are the same ones who, when it comes to relieving the struggles of real people, have been timid, not bold,” Pritzker told a fundraiser for the New Hampshire Democratic Party on Sunday.

New Hampshire has typically held the first presidential primary election, usually following the Iowa caucus.

Pritzker, who also appeared Monday on MSNBC, has been working himself into the national spotlight for months since Trump took over the White House in January. Appearances on trendy podcasts and prime time cable TV shows have become a regular part of the governor’s schedule.

Pritzker received national attention after he warned of similarities between Nazi Germany and the Trump administration in his February State of the State address. His remarks in New Hampshire on Sunday drew more attention as headlines in publications including The New York Times declared the speech “stokes 2028 talks.”

Pritzker downplayed any links between the speech and his personal ambitions, saying he’s only trying to send a message to the party about what the platform for 2026 should be while defending Illinois against the Trump administration’s policies.

“I was surprised that so many people covered that,” Pritzker told reporters in Chicago on Monday.

The speech also struck a nerve with Republicans as Pritzker suggested Democrats “will never join so many Republicans in the special place in hell reserved for quislings and cowards.”

“Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption,” Pritzker said Sunday. “But I am now. These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace. They must understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone that we have. We must castigate them on the soap box and then punish them at the ballot box.”

Pritzker first called on Democrats to become “street fighters” and engage in mass protest at a Human Rights Campaign dinner in March in Los Angelas.

The Illinois Republican Party cried foul in a news release titled “Pritzker calls for violence against Republicans.”

“His comments if nothing else could be construed as inciting violence,” Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said.

Pritzker scoffed at Miller’s criticism, saying he didn’t listen to the speech.

“Peaceful protest is what I’m talking about. It’s about standing up, speaking out,” Pritzker told reporters. “Again, using your megaphone, your microphone, whatever you’ve got. And the peace that I’m talking about is making sure that they know at all times that the American public opposes the policies of Congressional Republicans and of the White House.”

Outside public appearances this week, Pritzker’s political organization also announced it was beginning a new video series highlighting Illinoisians who have been hurt by cuts to the federal government under Trump. And to mark Trump’s 100th day in office, the governor’s office released a list of 100 ways “Trump and Republicans are hurting Illinois.”

Responding to a Chicago voter’s concerns about affordable housing during Tuesday night’s town hall, Pritzker rattled off legislation and state spending increases approved under his administration as a way he’s trying to help. But he also argued it’s ultimately going to be challenging to address such concerns with Trump as president.

“Donald Trump is making everything harder,” Pritzker said. “Housing, rent, being able to borrow money to buy your first home, or any home, and that's something that we're all going to have to live with until we're able to overturn the Congress.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/30/ct-budget-republicans/,"With pressure on the spending cap and the threat of federal cuts, CT legislators are facing a tricky political mix as they craft a budget.","Drafting a state budget that spends tens of billions of dollars annually, often increases taxes or fees at least modestly — and always leaves some groups dissatisfied — is never an easy process.
Add to the mix the potential loss of billions in federal aid later this year, and the politics goes beyond tricky as legislators begin the final push to craft a new spending plan before they adjourn five weeks from now.
Majority Democratic legislators recently reminded Republicans to be careful with their budget rhetoric — because they may have to put their votes where their mouths are.
Meanwhile, House Republicans will remind Democrats on Thursday to be careful what they wish for when the GOP caucus unveils its own plan to solve Connecticut’s latest budget dilemma. And if Democrats are serious about good government, GOP leaders say, they can’t ignore ideas from the other side of the aisle.
Republicans criticize the budget but don’t always draft one
“This is a game they have played for years,” Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said of Republicans’ off-again, on-again approach to state finances.
With a couple of exceptions, Republicans have been in the minority at the state Capitol since 1985. The GOP held a slim 19-17 edge in the Senate in 1995 and 1996, and that chamber was tied 18-18 in the 2017 and 2018 sessions.
That means Democrats hold majorities on all committees, including the two budget-writing panels. It also means Republicans can propose a minority budget if they want — or simply criticize select elements of the Democrats’ plan without offering a holistic alternative.
Neither House nor Senate Republicans offered budgets in 2019 or 2021. Neither party did so in 2020, when COVID’s arrival forced the Capitol’s closure in early March. The Senate GOP also didn’t show its cards last year, and Sen. Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, the minority leader, said the caucus still hasn’t decided whether it will this year.
The GOP plans that are submitted often contain gimmicks and other questionable maneuvers, just as do the Democratic proposals they criticize. Democrats say Republican budgets routinely promise tax relief and easy fixes to deficits by exaggerating savings from hiring freezes, employing across-the-board cuts in miscellaneous accounts that don’t assess the actual impacts, and sometimes by thinking wishfully.
A 2010 GOP plan still recalled at the Capitol would have plugged a huge $800 million hole in the General Fund not by cutting programs or raising taxes — but by selling Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks and Hartford-Brainard Airport. About 5% of ongoing programs in the General Fund would have been covered, for one year, by one-time sales proceeds. Republicans decided Connecticut could get $800 million for the two airports based on the proposed 2009 sale of Chicago Midway International Airport for $2.5 billion, which ultimately fell through.
Democrats: GOP has voted to exceed the spending cap twice this year
Sen. Cathy Osten, a Democrat from Sprague who co-chairs the Appropriations Committee, was disappointed that her Senate GOP colleagues aren’t ready to write a budget detail, given their frequent calls for adherence to sound fiscal principles. 
“I think the [Republican] rhetoric is pretty strong this year,” she added.
Republicans chastised Osten’s panel last week when Democrats unveiled a $55.7 billion, biennial plan that would exceed Connecticut’s spending cap by $215 million next fiscal year.
Legislatures legally can exceed the cap, which ties most budget growth to household income and inflation, with a 60% vote of approval and the governor’s endorsement but haven’t done so since 2007. Exceeding the cap became politically taboo shortly after that as big spending growth, massive pension debt and a severe recession triggered major state tax hikes in 2009, 2011 and 2015.
Pressures on the spending cap
Democrats and Republicans voted overwhelmingly in late February to send an extra $40 million to local schools to mitigate a special education funding crisis. That happened despite warnings from Gov. Ned Lamont that the current state budget already was on pace to exceed the cap by $61 million.
And while the Appropriations Committee’s plan originally continued those extra $40 million special education payments for each of the next two fiscal years, members from both parties insisted they wanted more.
Republicans would support $124 million per year in extra payments, but only if funding for public colleges and universities were reduced by $84 million annually to offset the special ed increase. Higher education institutions entered this fiscal year with close to $1.1 billion in reserves and could absorb the cut, the GOP argued.
Democrats rejected that, noting that college students have faced significant tuition hikes in recent years. And hundreds of millions of dollars in temporary federal pandemic grants, which have propped up college and university programs, will vanish after this year.
Rep. Anthony Nolan, D-New London, then proposed adding another $84 million for special education in each of the next two years without offsetting cuts  to higher education, which pushed the committee budget from $131 million over the spending cap in 2025-26 to $215 million.
Despite their statements in support of the cap, about half of the committee’s 13 Republicans voted for Nolan’s amendment.
“If we agreed our children deserve that quality education,” Nolan said, “it shouldn’t be up for a debate.”
It’s easy to pledge allegiance to the spending cap, but harder to remain loyal when a priority like local school aid is on the chopping block, said House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, who added there are consequences to heated political attacks.
“If your rhetoric gets too strong, you may lose things you had in the budget,” he said.
GOP: Democrats don’t listen, don’t save
But Republican leaders counter that Democrats have short memories.
The GOP always has been willing to come to the table, provided they are partners and their ideas are given due consideration. Too often, they added, Democrats simply want Republicans to vote for bloated spending and unnecessary tax hikes so both parties share the blame.
When Democrats couldn’t pass a budget in 2017 despite a House majority and control of the governor’s office, Republicans joined a bipartisan effort. That yielded new budget caps that built a paltry $212 million rainy day fund, equal to about 1% of the General Fund, into a record-setting $4.1 billion bulwark against the next recession.
Those same caps, or “fiscal guardrails,” also produced more than $8.5 billion in supplemental payments against Connecticut’s massive pension debt (the state entered this fiscal year with more than $35 billion in unfunded liabilities in this area). 
Republicans note that the last time Connecticut enjoyed big surpluses, before the “guardrails” era, Democratic-controlled legislatures spent far more than they socked away, even though those legislatures were working with Republican governors.
Between the 2003-04 and 2007-08 fiscal years, Connecticut ran up $3.6 billion in potential surpluses, according to records from the comptroller’s office and the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis.
But state officials would deposit just 38% of that windfall, about $1.38 billion, in the rainy day fund during this five-year period. The remaining $2.25 billion, or nearly two-thirds of the rest, would be spent.
While acknowledging that Republicans voted this year for special education funding that threatens to break the spending cap, Harding says his caucus still believes legislators must adhere to the “fiscal guardrails” while not boosting taxes.
“And it seems there’s an unwillingness to do that on their [Democrats’] end,” Harding said. 
The Democratic-controlled Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee proposed an income tax surcharge on the capital gains earnings of wealthy households and an array of business tax increases that collectively would generate more than $460 million per year. 
But while Democrats say some of that revenue would be needed to maintain state programs in the face of likely cuts in federal funding, about $175 million of that new revenue would be returned to poor and middle-class families in the form of a new $150-per-child income tax credit.
House Republicans also are expected to offer tax relief Thursday when they provide their own budget proposal for the next two fiscal years.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House GOP member on the Appropriations Committee, said her caucus always intended to offer its own solutions to the fiscal challenges facing Connecticut, adding it will be cost-efficient and respectful of the heavy burdens state taxpayers already face.
The real question, Nuccio added, is whether majority Democrats will include House Republicans in budget negotiations with the Lamont administration and incorporate GOP proposals into the final plan.

Utah state leaders are taking the next steps in their efforts to make Utah a major nuclear energy development hub and a “national leader” in developing next-generation energy technology, reaching beyond state lines to do it.
It starts with Utah signing two memorandums of understanding with Idaho and Wyoming as part of a strategy to fire up innovation and collaboration in the region.
As part of Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’s “Built Here: Nuclear Energy Summit,” which his office said brought together leaders from across the nuclear energy industry on Tuesday, Cox joined Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, both Republicans, in signing an MOU that calls for the three states to work together coordinating nuclear infrastructure, accelerating nuclear development, and advocating for “commonsense federal policies.”
“The West will lead the next chapter of energy abundance and American prosperity,” Cox said in a statement announcing the alliance. “Today, we brought together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to chart the course for nuclear energy. Our new compact strengthens our shared commitment to aggressively pursue more affordable, reliable energy across state lines.”
According to Cox’s office, the states agreed in the MOU to collaborate on:

Aligning energy policies to support innovation and private investment.
Coordinating the development of critical energy infrastructure.
Jointly navigating regulatory and environmental challenges.
Advocating for federal support of regional energy priorities.
Enhancing energy resilience and grid reliability.
Expanding workforce development efforts to support the growing energy sector.
Ensuring continued delivery of affordable energy to residents.

The tri-state agreement comes the day after Utah officials and the Idaho National Laboratory — one of 17 national labs in the U.S. Department of Energy complex that’s focused on nuclear research — signed a memorandum of understanding Monday evening after ceremoniously signing a slate of energy bills Utah lawmakers passed earlier this year.
With more local input, Legislature signs on to the beginning of Utah’s nuclear future

The MOU between Utah leaders and the Idaho National Laboratory establishes a “formal, long-term collaboration on advanced energy research, workforce development and technology deployment — particularly on nuclear innovation,” according to the governor’s office.
“This partnership will accelerate Utah’s efforts to become the nation’s nuclear hub,” Cox said in a prepared statement issued Monday evening. “By linking our universities, labs, and industry partners with the expertise of Idaho National Laboratory, we are strengthening our ability to serve Utahns with reliable and affordable energy.”
Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner, who signed the MOU, said he and other lab officials are “excited to partner with Utah to address urgent energy needs by focusing on advanced nuclear and energy innovation.”
“This partnership establishes a cooperative framework for scientific, technological and workforce development to help Utah realize an abundant, secure, resilient and competitive energy future,” he said.
The MOU, according to the governor’s office, creates a “structural, interdisciplinary alliance” between Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory. It envisions Utah as establishing a new institute called the Advanced Nuclear Energy Institute as a “key coordinating hub” between the Idaho National Laboratory, Utah’s system of higher education, the Utah Office of Energy Development, and the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab.
“By linking the capabilities of INL with the talent and resources of Utah’s higher education institutions, this partnership positions Utah as a national leader in developing the next generation of clean, secure and resilient energy technologies,” the governor’s office said in Monday’s news release.
This new institute, state officials say, will enable Utah’s universities to collaborate with other organizations to pursue federal research grants.
“Beyond academic research, the focus is on applied innovation — ensuring resources are used effectively to develop commercially viable, scalable technologies,” the governor’s office said. “This approach will accelerate the deployment of real-world energy solutions and help build a broader, more robust nuclear energy ecosystem in Utah and the surrounding region.”
Through the MOU, state leaders say Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory will work together to:

Accelerate development of “next-generation” nuclear technologies.
Enhance scientific research in energy sectors.
Strengthen cybersecurity and physical security for energy infrastructure.
Build up the workforce needed to meet demands of a future energy economy.

The Utah legislature’s top Republican leaders both applauded the move as crucial for Utah’s future.
“Affordable, reliable energy is the driving force behind Utah’s prosperity — powering everything from the lights in Utahns homes to the unstoppable growth of the state’s vibrant economy,” Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said in a prepared statement. “As energy demands increase and technologies rapidly evolve, we as a state are committed to staying ahead of the curve through strategic partnership that ensures both innovation and stability.”
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said Utah “is leading the way with smart, strategic investments in our energy future.”
“This partnership drives innovation and keeps energy reliable and affordable for Utah families and businesses,” Schultz said. “It’s about long-term solutions that protect our economy and strengthen our position as a national energy leader.”

NEWARK — A high-speed crash involving a stolen U-Haul truck left one person dead and several others injured Monday evening in downtown Newark.
The incident began around 4:30 p.m. when Newark Police located a U-Haul vehicle reported as unauthorized after it was not returned on its scheduled due date of March 18.
The truck, occupied by two individuals, was found in a parking lot in the 200 block of East Main Street.
As officers moved in to arrest the suspects, the vehicle sped off, striking a marked police car in the process.
Police say they did not pursue the vehicle, which exited the lot at a high speed.
Just minutes later, around 4:35 p.m., the truck was traveling westbound on East Main Street when it struck two pedestrians standing beside a parked car.
The vehicle continued on, hitting multiple parked cars before becoming disabled farther down the road.
First responders arrived quickly to render aid. One pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene despite life-saving efforts.

A second victim sustained serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital.
Their identities have not yet been released, pending notification of next of kin.
The driver of the U-Haul also sustained serious injuries and was taken to the hospital. Both the driver and passenger were detained by police at the scene.
According to Aetna Hose, Hook & Ladder Company, three additional people were transported to a nearby emergency room with non-life-threatening injuries, while three others were treated on site and declined further medical care.
The Newark Police Department‘s Traffic Unit is investigating the crash.
East Main Street remains closed near South Chapel Street, and authorities expect the closure to continue for several hours.
Police emphasized that this appears to be an isolated incident and there is no ongoing threat to the public.
Further details will be released as the investigation continues.
“Just before 5 p.m. today, University leadership was made aware of a serious incident on Main Street, east of Academy Street,” University of Delaware stated in social media posts. “There is no ongoing danger to the campus community, though East Main Street is closed starting at South Chapel Street. More information will be shared if and when it is appropriate to do so. Please avoid the area and follow all instructions from the police.”

The week-long firefight began near Johnstown in Brown County after a prescribed burn escaped containment on April 21, which a private landowner had led in coordination with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, local fire departments and other partners.. 
Last week, Gov. Jim Pillen initiated a statewide burn ban through the end of April. On Tuesday, he narrowed the ban to and extended it for central and western Nebraska through midnight on May 10. He also prohibited permitted burns in eastern Nebraska if there is an active red flag warning from the National Weather Service.

More than 7,000 acres were burned in the Plum Creek area that includes canyons, hills and water on the northern edge, which state officials said had complicated the disaster response.
Over 50 different local fire departments, many volunteer-based, responded to the fire, as did the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, NEMA, State Fire Marshal’s Office, Nebraska National Guard, Nebraska State Patrol, Game and Parks and Nebraska Forest Service.
More than 45 cattle were killed, and the fire destroyed one cabin (a secondary residence) and at least eight utility poles.
The fire and continued burn ban came amid severe drought conditions for much of the state.
“It’s way too dry, and it doesn’t make any sense,” Pillen told reporters last Wednesday. “It only takes one burn, one mistake, and the one that took place … really, really made no sense.”
He continued: “We need Mother Nature to get on our side, and we need to get drenched. We need a tsunami. So if Nebraskans want to pray for a tsunami, I think we’d take that, right, or a drenching rain.”

(File photo by Getty Images)A 179-year-old, private college in South Carolina’s Upstate will officially close and sell its campus.
Limestone University’s governing board made the final decision after several hours of deliberations late Tuesday, the last day of classes for the spring semester. The vote for closure followed a series of hopes and disappointments for students unsure about the fate of their school and their academic and athletic future.
The college first made its financial straits known two weeks ago, when President Nathan Copeland announced to students and staff that Limestone faced a $6 million budget shortfall, which could lead to its closure.
Limestone had been holding out for an eleventh hour donation in hopes of keeping its doors open. It managed to raise $2.1 million but still fell short of what school officials said it needed to stay afloat in the short term.
Even if it had succeeded, the college still would have needed a long-term solution to its growing financial woes.
“Words cannot fully express the sorrow we feel in having to share this news,” Copeland said in a statement. “Our students, alumni, faculty, staff, and supporters fought tirelessly to save this historic institution. While the outcome is not what we hoped for, we are forever grateful for the passion, loyalty, and prayers of our Saints family.”
The school has cited enrollment declines impacting colleges nationwide and rising costs for its demise.
Limestone’s enrollment fell by half over the past decade, from 3,214 students in fall 2014, according to state higher education data, to 1,600 now, both online and in person according to the university’s announcement.
At first, the board said it would continue with its online classes, which would have allowed the college to continue with its associated charter school management operations — Limestone Charter Association — which sponors 13 K-12 public charter schools.
But online operations are also ending and at least 478 people employed by the college are losing their jobs.










Limestone has been a point of pride, tradition, and inspiration for our residents. It has opened doors for countless local students and families. Many of them were first-generation college students and helped shape dreams into realitie


– Lyman Dawkins III, mayor of Gaffney


Limestone was founded in 1845 by Thomas Curtis, a Baptist minister from England. It began as the Limestone Springs Female High School and held classes in the town’s former hotel, built by the founder of a limestone quarry that supported the area economy for nearly a century.
At the time of its opening, Limestone was the first women’s college in South Carolina, and among the first in the country. The college began admitting men in the early 1900s, but did not initially allow them to live on campus.
While not the largest employer in Cherokee County, it is the county’s only four-year institution of higher education.
Gaffney’s mayor and Limestone alumnus Lyman Dawkins III, called the college “a cornerstone of our city educationally, economically and culturally.”
“Limestone has provided countless jobs, brought in students and families who supported local businesses and served as a catalyst for growth,” Dawkins wrote in an online statement after closure was first announced two weeks ago.
He cited Gaffney’s efforts to revitalize its downtown and said students have played a vital role.
“Their energy, involvement, and contributions have breathed life into our city and helped us build momentum for the future,” Dawkins said.
“Limestone has been a point of pride, tradition, and inspiration for our residents. It has opened doors for countless local students and families. Many of them were first-generation college students and helped shape dreams into realities,” Dawkins added.
Auditors reported the school had a $7.6 million operating loss as of June 2024. Its shortfalls were caused by a decline in enrollment and uncontrolled spending in previous years.
Since 2020, the school has borrowed some $22 million from its small endowment, which had a balance of just $9.2 million last June the audit showed.
“These factors create uncertainty regarding the University’s ability to continue,” the auditors wrote.
The school also faced an additional $30 million in debt, according to Copeland, who took over as university president last year and laid plans he hoped could have sustained the school. The debt comes from a 40-year U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development loan, which Limestone took out in 2018 to construct a new library and student center, purchase a residence hall and refinance previous debt.
Limestone is not alone. Small, private colleges with meager endowments have been closing across the country. According to Inside Higher Ed, 2023 saw 15 colleges announce closures. That was followed by another 16 in 2024.

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA— Strangulation is among the most common types of abuse in domestic violence situations. Yet, South Carolina is the only state without specific penalties for the crime.
A Senate proposal seeks to change that.
Restricting someone’s ability to breathe with the intent to hurt them would be punishable by between three and 10 years in prison under the proposal which passed unanimously out of committee Tuesday to be taken up on the Senate floor. Penalties climb as high as 20 years in prison when someone uses a weapon, violates a restraining order or has a prior strangulation convection.
If passed in the Senate, the bill will still have to go through the legislative process in the House. Meanwhile only five legislative days remain in the first year of the two-year session.
When it was her turn to speak in favor of the bill, Lauren Moose, a forensic nurse examiner at McLeod Health in Florence, asked a Senate panel to set a timer for 2 ½ minutes and stay silent. That’s the amount of time it takes to kill someone by strangling them, she explained.
“Think about somebody sitting there, literally watching somebody’s life exit their hands,” she said.
Domestic violence victims in SC can wait weeks for legal protections

The Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention says between 68% and 80% of abused women will experience “near-fatal strangulation.”
And the likelihood of being killed by your partner is 10 times higher if they’ve strangled you, the National Domestic Violence Hotline says on its website.
South Carolina has a long history of domestic violence, particularly against women. For a quarter century, the state was consistently in the top 10 nationally in the murder rate for women killed by men, according to the Violence Policy Center. While the center no longer rates states, South Carolina still outpaced the national rate. In 2022, the most recent year of data available, 56 female victims were killed by men in the state.
The state still has the sixth-highest rate of domestic violence in the country, according to Break the Cycle, a nonprofit dedicated to helping survivors of domestic violence.
A Senator on the committee said he’s seen what strangulation can do firsthand.
Sen. Ed Sutton, D-Charleston, said his cousin was the victim of domestic violence in which her abuser strangled her. After the attack, she continued to have long-term breathing issues. Tori Burke died in 2021, a year later, after contracting COVID-19, leaving behind two daughters.
“This is a pretty awful crime and a pretty awful thing for a family to go through,” he said.
Still, others questioned whether the law was necessary, arguing these crimes already fall under assault.
Freshman Sen. J.D. Chaplin said he worries the bill is excessive.
“Why do we need something for strangulation?” the Hartsville Republican asked.
Hundreds of girls in SC are trafficking victims. A Columbia nonprofit offers help for survivors.

Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, said he supported “the overall context of protecting domestic violence victims and anyone else from strangulation” but wanted to know whether it would affect police trying to restrain a suspect.
The bill’s lead sponsor, Sen. Brian Adams, responded to questions saying strangulation tends to be more violent than a typical assault.
Plus, the state Legislature already passed a law in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death at the hands of police officers in Minnesota, the Goose Creek Republican reminded his fellow senators. That law banning the use of chokeholds except in a situation where deadly force would be reasonable went into effect on New Years Day 2023.
The proposed strangulation charge would actually help law enforcement, according to Adams, who is a retired police officer.
Cases involving strangulation tend to result in either low or medium-level assault charges, Brian Bennett, a retired officer of the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy, told the SC Daily Gazette.
“No law for strangulation means it can be minimized,” said Bennett, who has been advocating for strangulation laws for a decade.
The bill would make strangulation a felony with significant prison time, which Bennett said better fits a crime where the effects tend to be long-lasting. It also would make it easier to track how prevalent the crime is in the state.
There have been multiple bills filed in recent years to create strangulation charges, including a House proposal filed back in December before this year’s session. None have gotten significant traction. Bennett has begged legislators to consider each one, with no success. Yet, he’s felt the pleas slowly create awareness within the Statehouse, he said.
“I think they are more receptive than they were in the past,” he said. “It’s like every session we gain ground.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-76-1-1024x576.png,,,2025-04-30 10:08:23.621695

Joe Nicola, shown on the opening day of the 2025 legislative session, complained Tuesday night that the state budget process “is a dog and pony show” (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The only member of the Missouri Senate who was never a public official before winning election had a scathing verdict on the budget debate he witnessed Tuesday night.
“I think this is one of the worst processes I’ve ever seen and been a part of,” said state Sen. Joe Nicola, a Republican from Independence. “I think it’s broken.”
Nicola spoke after watching the bitterest 20 minutes of the five-hour budget debate. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough had just finished telling state Sen. Rick Brattin of Harrisonville that he would not support an amendment restoring 25 employees and $684,000 cut from Secretary of State Denny Hoskins’ budget during committee work.
One of the reasons Hough gave for opposing any amendments to the bills was that many budget lines include both state and federal money, where Missouri taxpayers supply matching funds at varying rates.
Increasing the state money spent on one, Hough said, triggers changes in how much federal funding should be listed. It was all too complicated to change anything on the floor, he added.
“There is so much work that goes in behind the scenes and in the committee that when you come out here and you start — and you can laugh, if you would like — but if you come out here and you start changing, and you start amending the budget bills, you don’t understand the actual implications,” Hough said.
But Nicola’s complaint wasn’t completely about the scene he had witnessed. It was that he was lost trying to read the 13 bills appropriating $49.5 billion in large amounts for education, public safety, health and welfare programs alongside small sums for things described in often obscure language.
“Just pass it. We can’t put an amendment, very little debate, like we’re wasting our time,” Nicola said. “This whole thing is a dog and pony show. Absolutely ridiculous.”
With Senate passage of the 13 bills, they return to the House and the process to set up a conference committee to negotiate a final proposal will begin. The Senate Appropriations Committee must now turn to capital appropriations bills spending an additional $3.7 billion and get them ready for Senate votes.
 Gov. Mike Kehoe reiterates his focus on public safety during his State of the State speech Jan. 28 in the Missouri House chamber (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The conference committee will have to reconcile differences over education funding that will test new Gov. Mike Kehoe’s ability and willingness to influence the outcome.
The Senate-passed budget allocates almost $300 million more than Kehoe requested for the public school foundation formula and omits $50 million the governor wanted to enlarge a scholarship program for private school tuition.
Overall, the Senate budget would spend $1.6 billion more than the House version and $575 million less that Kehoe requested. In general revenue — money mainly from income and sales taxes — the Senate plan would spend $15.7 billion, $491 million more than Kehoe proposed and $1.3 billion more than the House version.
Other significant differences between the House and Senate include:

The state employee pay plan. The Senate and Kehoe propose a raise of 1% for every two years worked, capped at 10%. The House version is capped at a 5% raise.
New child care funding. The Senate approved Kehoe’s request for $107 million to shift the child care subsidy program to prospective payments based on enrollment instead of after-the-fact payments based on attendance. The House did not approve the money.
Higher education funding. Kehoe proposed a 1.5% increase for colleges and universities, the House agreed and added $28 million for one-time maintenance and repair and the Senate proposed an ongoing 3% increase.
Earmarks for projects and programs. The House added 149 items to the budget with a total cost of $295 million. The Senate cut 57, totaling $126.3 million, and added 169 of its own to the operating budget at a cost of $441 million. There are 44 earmarks in the capital appropriations that have not had a Senate committee hearing yet.

The school funding differences in the budget will be the biggest item of contention in the conference committee.
When Kehoe, who is in his first year as governor, refused to fund an increase to public schools based on the statutory calculation of the foundation formula, he said the extra money was the result of bureaucratic processes that he distrusted.
The House, in the budget it approved at the beginning of April, went along with Kehoe, funding the public school formula at the $3.7 billion being spent this year.
As he presented the budget, Hough said the extra money represents a promise from the past that must be fulfilled.
“I see this as making good on the commitment that was passed by the legislature last year,” Hough said.
The element that will decide how much is eventually spent on the foundation formula is the state adequacy target, the calculation of the per-pupil amount spent in districts that are high-performing on state accountability measures. For the current year, the amount is $6,760 per student and the statutory calculation in the formula would make it $7,145 for the coming fiscal year.
The legislature can set the number in the appropriation bill and that is what will test Kehoe’s ability and willingness to influence the upcoming conference committee. 
 State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern is introduced to the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2025 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
During debate, Democrats said even the increased funding was inadequate. State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Democrat from Kansas City and a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Missouri needs to do more for schools.
“People ask me, ‘oh do you love the Senate version of the budget?’’’ Nurrenbern said. “No, I don’t love the Senate version of the budget, because we are putting less money into public education than nearly every other state in the nation.”
The discussion of the increase to the foundation formula was one of the longest of the budget debate. There was no discussion at all, however, of the cut to the private-school scholarship program.
And while most of the focus during debate on the bill funding education programs was on the increased foundation formula, discussion veered into culture wars when Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman offered an amendment to bar all funding for the YMCA.
Kansas City police are investigating reports of an incident at the North Kansas City YMCA where a child reported an adult with male genitalia exposed was in a women’s locker room. WDAF Fox4 reported that the mother of the child said the person claimed to be a woman.
Coleman said she was upset by statements from the YMCA that “individuals are allowed to use the locker room or restroom that they identify with.” She also said she was offended when representatives of the YMCA, visiting her office, did not respect her concerns that state law was not being followed.
“The frustration that I have of a lack of taking seriously the state laws from a provider that is being paid from the state I thought warranted a vote on this defunding,” Coleman said.
Other lawmakers defended YMCA as a provider of important programs for children. Hough said the organization receives about $12- to $13 million a year in state funding, mostly for after school and summer camp programs through child care programs.
“Imagine if we came in and, for one weird incident, started penalizing across the board, removing all funding” from private organizations, Nurrenbern said.
Coleman eventually withdrew the amendment, but she forced a vote later in the Department of Corrections budget when she tried to cut $21,900 in funding to purchase drugs used for executions.
“These are Chinese made pharmaceuticals that are used to kill by the state those who’ve been convicted of the death penalty,” Coleman said. “And you know when I was first elected I think I would have said that I was in favor of the death penalty, and I have had a real evolution, as I have learned more about how inconsistently it has been applied, and I no longer support it.”
Brattin spoke against the amendment, arguing that he preferred public executions by firing squads.
“Mercy to those who carry out these sorts of acts is an injustice to the victims and their families,” Brattin said.
Coleman’s amendment was defeated 11-22.
The budget is balanced by tapping the state’s accumulated surplus. But with revenues declining more than 1% and uncertainty about future federal funding, the only member who was a lawmaker during the contraction following the 2008 financial crash warned his colleagues to be careful with the surplus.
State Sen. Stephen Webber, a Democrat from Columbia, was a House member from 2009 to 20017. In his first years in office, lawmakers made budget cuts, not increases.
“I’m just telling everybody it’s a lot more enjoyable when you’re adding money for worthy projects in your district, rather than when you’re trying to explain to folks in your district that even though you support the program, it has to get cut because there’s just no other money,” Webber said.
Hough, during a discussion with Nurrenbern, said that while there are dozens of projects in the budget requested by lawmakers, he has to draw the line somewhere. He noted he had turned down her requests to help child care providers in her district.
“I’ve had other members that have come in and said, you know, we need to spend X number of dollars on this courthouse,” Hough said. “Well, that’s great, but do you know how many courthouses there are in the state? And if we open that box, how do we ever bring it back in?”
 Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, shown in 2024 while he was a member of the state Senate, lost 25 employees in a budget cut political friends said was revenge for his activities as a member of the Missouri Freedom Caucus (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The disagreement over the employees cut from Hoskins’ budget was a reminder of the factional fights that wracked the Senate over the last four years. Hoskins, a former state senator, was a member of the Freedom Caucus, and before it a group that called itself the conservative caucus.
During budget work, Hoskins would target employee slots that had been unfilled for lengthy periods. One of his factional foes, state Sen. Mike Cierpiot, a Republican from Lee’s Summit, used that logic to cut 25 of 63 open positions in Hoskins’ new office.
“I thought taking 25 of those 63 was a very reasonable, measured way to do things,” Cierpiot said while debating with state Sen. Ben Brown, a Republican from Washington 
“But only with the person that’s now running a state office, that that may have had disagreements with you in the past,” Brown replied.
“No, only with a person who has talked about doing this for years in the past,” Cierpiot said.
Every statewide elected official’s office used less than its allotment of employee hours in the most recent complete fiscal year. The vacancy rate for the secretary of state’s office was 23.3%, lower than any other office except state treasurer.
Brattin complained that offices with higher vacancy rates remained untouched while Hoskins lost 25 slots and Lt. Gov. David Wasinger, who defeated Hough in the 2024 Republican primary, lost one of eight assigned to his office.
“It is below what I thought we had kind of gotten to, the place of the Senate this session, trying to let bygones be bygones,” Brattin said. “But it’s quite clear that that’s not what we’re willing to do here, and utilize their position and act as though we’re a bunch of imbeciles.”

Photo courtesy of the Minnesota Historical Society.The Minnesota House passed a housing budget bill Tuesday, featuring funding boosts for homelessness prevention and affordable housing development, plus $100 million in bonds for financing housing developments statewide. 
But the Senate’s housing budget, which passed the chamber last week, is about $62 million smaller than the House version and it doesn’t include bonds. 
The details must be hashed out in conference committee and re-approved by both chambers before the legislative session adjourns on May 19. 
Neither the budget bill nor a housing policy bill that passed Thursday includes the sweeping zoning reforms proposed by a bipartisan coalition of advocacy groups and lawmakers, including all housing committee leaders. Those bills would have allowed apartments in areas currently zoned for commercial use; legalized duplexes on every residential lot in the state; required municipalities to allow higher-density development along transit corridors; and barred city governments from requiring builders to use certain materials, colors or designs.
Supporters of those bills argue that they would encourage the construction of more housing, alleviating Minnesota’s housing shortage and lowering prices.
The outlook is bleak for those bills, as city governments and their lobbyists oppose any legislation that rolls back local control over zoning.
In floor discussion of the budget bill, housing leaders said the budget doesn’t go far enough in addressing the shortage. 
“I’m a little disappointed,” said Rep. Jim Nash, R-Waconia, a member of the housing committee and the coalition pushing for zoning reforms. Regulatory reform is needed to make a major dent in the housing crisis, he said. 
The “Yes to Homes” coalition got one minor win: the House budget bill instructs the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency to prioritize developments in communities that have zoning rules that make it easier to build multifamily homes, allow smaller homes and don’t require certain materials or designs.  
Funding for homelessness prevention 
The House housing budget contains significantly more funding than the Senate version for a homelessness prevention program. 
The Family Homelessness Prevention and Assistance Program, or FHPAP, provides emergency assistance to families that are at risk of homelessness, or who have already lost their housing.
Lawmakers have allocated between $7 and $10 million per year to the program between 2014 and 2023; during the 2023 legislative session, lawmakers directed $120 million to the FHPAP for 2024 and 2025. The House budget would give the program $50 million in 2026 and 2027; the Senate budget allocates $30 million.
Jenny Larson, executive director of Three Rivers Community Action, which manages FHPAP in several southern Minnesota counties, said despite state investments, the program is already oversubscribed. Her agency opens up a round of funding every quarter, and they are never able to help all of the families in need, Larson said. 
Brooklyn Park resident Ta-Metta Gaines, who lives in the embattled Huntington Place apartments, works as a customer service representative for a health care company. She fell behind on rent while dealing with medical issues, she said, and she’s looking for a new place to live as Huntington Place’s future is in limbo. 
When she became homeless after her landlord died, FHPAP helped her come up with a security deposit and first month’s rent to move into a new apartment. Now, FHPAP is helping her get caught up on past-due rent, and covering some of the cost of relocating, Gaines said.
“I’m just imagining what type of things can actually go on if they remove those funds, and how many people will be destitute,” Gaines said. 
Bonding
While the House housing budget authorizes the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency to issue $100 million in bonds to finance housing projects, lawmakers and Gov. Tim Walz have not agreed on targets for a bonding bill. 
Bonds are a tool governments use to finance infrastructure projects, including housing. Bonding bills require a 60% majority to pass the Legislature, so they require robust bipartisan support. 
Walz and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say they want to pass a bonding bill this session, in addition to the regular two-year budget. If the parties can’t make a deal on bonding — as was the case last year — the bonding in the housing budget is likely to be eliminated in conference committee.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mncapitol-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-30 10:08:23.621695

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Energy policy has moved quickly in the past few years as Maine has sought to achieve climate and affordability goals with deadlines that are not so far off. 
Rep. Gerry Runte (D-York) suspects there hasn’t been sufficient time to take a 50,000-foot view to see how all the pieces of energy supply and demand could plan and work together. He’s hoping the bipartisan bill he introduced during a public hearing Tuesday afternoon will formalize and increase collaboration between agencies involved in grid planning. 
“I need to emphasize: the intent of this bill is not to interfere with the ongoing grid planning process,” Runte told the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee. Rather, its purpose is “to refine how it interacts with other initiatives and give it a bit of a tune up for future planning.” 
The grid is the system of transmission and distribution lines that bring electricity from where it is generated to the homes of ratepayers and other points of end use. 
Last summer, the Public Utilities Commission concluded its process of gathering input on priorities for grid plans. The largest privately owned utilities in the state, Central Maine Power and Versant Power, are required to submit their plans next January, Runte said. 
Meanwhile, the Governor’s Energy Office completed the state’s energy plan earlier this year that laid out pathways to achieve climate resilience and affordability goals. The portions of the plan that focused on electricity were based on a supply and demand forecast that considered reliability, emissions reductions, the role of emerging technologies and more, Runte explained. 
As Runte understands it, that forecast in the state’s energy plan looked circuit by circuit to develop a bottom-up analysis. However, the forecasting model used in the Public Utility Commission’s grid planning looks at capacity and load data from the regional grid, ISO-New England, taking a more top-down approach. 
Maine doubles down on commitment to address climate change with updated action plan

Given the connection between the state’s energy plan and future grid needs, Runte said he believes the agencies involved in grid planning should use the same load forecast. While LD 1726 calls for using the forecasting model in the state energy plan, Runte said he expects robust discussion on which of the two may be more appropriate. 
Public Advocate Heather Sanborn testified neither for nor against the bill, however, she raised concerns about limiting the forecast model over an uncertain amount of time because energy forecasting models are constantly evolving.
The bill also seeks to ensure that future planning considers grid enhancing technologies at the energy distribution level that could improve efficiency and reliability. To do that, the proposal would have the Public Utilities Commission consider adding incentives for improved data and grid monitoring of power quality reliability, the state of infrastructure, as well as capacity. 
Runte’s proposal also addresses the procurement of new energy sources. While the legislation covers multiple aspects of procurement, Runte said the bids for those new sources should be informed by the grid planning process to minimize the amount of new infrastructure. 
Another aspect of grid planning is energy demand management and non-wires alternatives — or projects that use alternative technology to avoid new investment in the transmission system. Currently, those two components are spread between three different agencies in Maine. Runte’s bill would ask the Public Utilities Commission, the Office of Public Advocate and Efficiency Maine to assess how those aspects of planning are shared among them and report back to the Legislature on how the process could be improved.
“The idea of this bill is to strengthen governance by establishing formal linkages to activities that have a direct impact on or perhaps should be subject to the findings of a grid plan,” Runte told the committee.
The Public Utilities Commission, as well as the Governor’s Energy Office, also offered neutral testimony on the proposal. Though legislative liaison Caroline Colan said the Governor’s Energy Office shares Runte’s goal of enhancing coordination where feasible in grid planning processes, she said some parts of the bill could be overly prescriptive.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s comparison of current prevalence rates to those from the 1980s or earlier ignores this historical context. Autistic people have always been here. We are simply doing a better job of recognizing and supporting them.
The post Autism is not an ‘epidemic,’ as RFK Jr. suggests appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has deeply alarmed us with his comments that repeat long-debunked theories, stigmatize people, and misrepresent everything about autism.  Instead of amplifying disinformation, we should be focusing on what really matters: recognizing the value of every person and ensuring that autistic people have the support and community they need to lead meaningful, connected lives. Calling autism an “epidemic” reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how autism is identified and diagnosed. An increase in diagnoses does not mean autism is dangerous.  It reflects decades of expanded awareness, broader diagnostic criteria, and improved access to services. It wasn’t until 1980 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual even included autism.  Since then, many people who would previously have gone undiagnosed or were misdiagnosed are now counted.   Kennedy’s comparison of current prevalence rates to those from the 1980s or earlier ignores this historical context. Autistic people have always been here. We are simply doing a better job of recognizing and supporting them. His claim that autistic individuals will “never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem, they’ll never go out on a date” is not only false, but it demonstrates a lack of understanding of the complexity of autism. Our organization, the Association for Autism and Neurodiversity (AANE), is based in Watertown but supports thousands of autistic community members across the country who prove him wrong.  Many autistic adults have run the Boston Marathon. We see autistic employees thrive at work. Autistic writers publish their poetry. We have seen relationships blossom in our community and welcomed children of autistic parents. Autistic people are not one dimensional. As often as we see people thrive, we also acknowledge the deep distress and anxiety that loneliness, isolation, under- and unemployment bring. These challenges are exacerbated by systems that do not offer understanding, inclusion, or accommodation. The effort it takes to find providers or services that are attuned to autistic needs is often exhausting and requires persistence and patience.  Studies estimate that 70–95% of autistic individuals also experience mental health challenges, yet many give up after just one or two failed attempts to find a provider who understands autism. Autistic individuals with high support needs often face long waitlists, underfunded programs, staffing shortages, and inconsistent quality of care. These are solvable problems, but they are not solved by calling autism a “tragedy.”  Kennedy’s claim that autism, “is a preventable disease. We know it’s environmental exposure. It has to be,” simply isn’t true. Decades of peer-reviewed scientific research show that genetics are the primary factor in autism. Studies published in major journals and  reports from the National Institutes of Health consistently find that inherited genetic factors can account for anywhere between 40 to 80 percent of the risk for autism.  Kennedy acts like scientists have ignored environmental factors, but that’s not true. Researchers have spent decades studying them. What they’ve found is clear: Genetics are by far the strongest factor in autism, not any one exposure or event.  In fact, the newly formed Coalition of Autism Scientists, which was founded in Massachusetts, strongly critiqued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Autism Research Initiative. This group of experienced research scientists repudiated what it calls Kennedy’s “false narrative about the incidence and causes of autism” and expressed concern “to hear the Secretary of Health & Human Services dismiss past research [and] downplay the causal role of genes.” As the group’s leader, Dr. Helen Tager-Flusber, stated, “Instead of focusing on questions that have been asked and answered, limited and valuable research dollars must focus on what we don’t yet know about autism so that we can meet the urgent needs of autism individuals and their families.” We cannot let outdated thinking shape national policy. Our leaders must reject disinformation. They need to center the voices and experiences of autistic individuals and their families. We should all want a future where every individual, regardless of neurology, is valued, supported, and empowered to thrive.  Brenda Dater is the executive director of the Association for Autism and Neurodiversity (AANE), a  Watertown, MA based organization that provides education and support for autistic and neurodivergent people and their families. The post Autism is not an ‘epidemic,’ as RFK Jr. suggests appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Autism_RFK-Jr.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

“My kids were five and seven. I was just thinking about whether or not I would live long enough to be able to dance with my sons at their weddings,” Batch recalled at a Tuesday press conference.
Batch, a primary sponsor of Senate Bill 553, said the “Save More Tatas Act” would provide health coverage parity for breast cancer diagnostic imaging.
Far too many women in North Carolina don’t get diagnosed with breast cancer early, because they don’t get the proper diagnostic treatment and preventative treatment that would save their lives.
“Most importantly, you sure as heck shouldn’t be in a situation where women are denied access because they can’t afford the actual screenings,” said Sen. Batch.
‘Divine intervention’
Sen. Val Applewhite (D-Cumberland) said when she retired from the United States Air Force after 20 years, she received a screening mammogram as she was processed out of the military. It came back normal.
  Sen. Val Applewhite (D-Cumberland) (Photo: NCGA)
A year later she credits divine intervention with saving her life.
“My mother, who had passed years earlier, came to me in my dream. She said, ‘Val, go get a mammogram.’ So, I made the appointment. And that’s when I got the diagnosis, I had breast cancer. I was lucky.”
Applewhite was lucky that she was working at the Pentagon. She received her cancer treatment at Bethesda Naval Medical Center, the same place the President of the United States receives medical care.
“That access, plain and simple, is what saved my life. Too many people in North Carolina don’t have that,” said Applewhite.
The Cumberland County Democrat said another portion of SB 553 would allocate $3.5 million to help recruit and retain mammography technologists in rural and underserved areas.
Skipping tests when you can’t afford the co-pay
Rep. Mary Belk (D-Mecklenburg) is yet another member of this extraordinary sorority of breast cancer survivors.
  Rep. Mary Belk (Photo: NCGA)
Belk said she had finished a grueling day of campaigning in 2016 when she felt something.
She didn’t want to call it a lump. That was too scary. But she made time for an overdue breast exam.
“I heard the words that no one wants to hear:  You have breast cancer,” said Belk. “I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer, three months before my first election.”
Approximately 14,700 women in North Carolina will have breast cancer this year. Fourteen hundred will not survive, Belk said.
But with first rate care, her cancer went into remission. She was one of the lucky few who did not worry about the cost of imaging.
“Women who need these medically necessary tests are skipping them because they cannot afford the co-pays,” said Belk.
Breast MRIs in North Carolina can cost anywhere between $260 and over $1,300, depending on one’s health plan.
Belk is the primary sponsor of House Bill 297. The Breast Cancer Prevention Imaging Parity bill would require insurance companies to cover diagnostic, screening as well as supplemental breast exams to the same extent as mammograms.
This coverage is especially important for women with dense breasts who are at risk of being diagnosed at later stages.
Causing a ‘ruckus’ for advanced imaging
Sheila Mikhail falls into that category. The self-described ‘serial, biotech entrepreneur’ created multiple companies in the Research Triangle Park along with thousands of well-paying jobs.

Yet when cancer was found in her left breast, she repeatedly had to push for additional screenings of her right breast.
The oncologist told her she was causing a ‘ruckus’, but the office would do a supplemental test at a cost of $1,200.
The breast MRI found a second tumor that was not detected by an ultrasound or a diagnostic mammogram.
“I was fortunate because I could afford to pay. I found my right tumor just before it metastasized.”
Mikhail wants lawmakers to pass both HB 297 and SB 553 and have insurance companies cover supplemental ultrasounds and MRIs for breast cancer.
A narrow window to gain passage
But the time to pass these bills this session is growing short. May 8th marks the crossover deadline for bills to pass at least one chamber to stay eligible for consideration.
Senate Bill 553 has been stuck in the Rules committee since March.
Belk’s bill (“Breast Cancer Prevention Imaging Parity”) was approved by three House committees, but before a floor vote in mid-April, it was withdrawn from the House calendar and kicked back to the Rules committee. No reason was provided.
Batch said she has had many, many conversations with her Republican colleagues, but faces opposition because some insurance companies don’t want another mandate that requires them to pay for additional coverage.
Sen. Applewhite said this should not be a partisan issue. She’d like female voters to call their representatives.
“You know our breasts are not Democrats or Republicans, but the men in this building that have power, don’t help us — won’t help us save lives. We should be mad as hell.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages_breastcancer-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

The original proposal would have mandated phonics instruction in K-12 classrooms. The latest version makes that optional. 


A bill that could reshape literacy education in California elementary schools cleared a major hurdle in the Legislature this week after dueling sides reached a compromise that provides funding for phonics-based instruction but stops short of requiring it. 
The compromise between English learner advocates and those who back the so-called “science of reading” or “evidence-based” approach provides funding and support for phonics-focused instruction, but doesn’t require schools or teachers to participate.

Fight over phonics: Will California require the ‘science of reading’ in schools? 

by Carolyn Jones 





Still, the legislative language, which was added to an existing bill, represents an important milestone in the fight over how schools teach children to read. For years, arguments over phonics have stalled progress on literacy policy, even as statewide reading scores have remained stubbornly low.   
“It’s exciting for California. A lot of work went into this, and it shows opposing sides can come together and find solutions,” said Marshall Tuck, director of EdVoice, an education nonprofit. “This will be a really good thing for California kids.”
The bill, sponsored by Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio, a Democrat from West Covina, and Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi, a Democrat from Torrance, requires the state to provide training for teachers and instructional materials centered on phonics-focused literacy instruction, which includes vocabulary, comprehension, the ability to sound words out and other literacy basics. The materials and training must also address the specific needs of English learners, who make up about 18% of the state’s 5.8 million K-12 students.
“We recognize the role of the Legislature in proposing solutions to improve literacy that uplifts the unique needs of multilingual learners and honors their home languages and cultures — which is why we are proud to support AB 1454,” said Martha Hernandez, director of Californians Together, an English learner advocacy group, in a statement.
Tuck said he’s confident most schools will opt to use the new instructional materials and send their teachers to learn the ins-and-outs of teaching phonics, because they’ll want to take advantage of the funding. He said he’s not overly fazed by the fact that the material isn’t required. 
Previous opposition
Previous bills to require a phonics-based approach have died, in part because not everyone agrees that phonics is the best way to teach students whose first language isn’t English. Hernandez’s group has argued that those students need an approach that gives equal weight to vocabulary and oral language development in addition to phonics.
The California Teachers Association, the state’s largest teachers union, has fought reading instruction mandates in the past, saying teachers — not legislators — are in the best position to assess the needs of individual students, and they need maximum flexibility in the classroom. The union has so far been neutral on this bill.
Research has shown that most students learn to read through explicit instruction focused on sounding words out, alongside lessons in vocabulary and comprehension. The other primary approach emphasizes sight reading, in which students memorize whole words and piece together meaning through context. 
Nearly 40 states have required phonics-based reading instruction in recent years. Some school districts in California, including Los Angeles Unified, the largest district in the state, already use curricula that’s focused on phonics. But about 80% of districts don’t, according to research by the California Reading Coalition, a literacy advocacy group.  
Stalled reading scores
California’s reading scores were steadily climbing before the pandemic, but fell during remote learning and have stalled since then. Almost 60% of third graders weren’t reading at grade level last year, with some student groups, including Black and low-income students, lagging even further behind. By fourth grade students should be reading well enough to easily understand content, according to the state’s literacy standards.
The bill, scheduled for a hearing today, was originally introduced in February but its primary focus was on school heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems. Advocates tacked on the literacy component this week, which is detailed in the bill analysis and will likely be incorporated into the bill language later this week. It replaces a previous bill, also sponsored by Rubio, that died last week. 
Because the bill is sponsored by the Assembly speaker, it’s expected to pass the Assembly. Any bill that costs money may face an uphill battle in the current economic climate, but Gov. Gavin Newsom has supported literacy efforts in the past.

Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, listens to a presentation on the proposed amendment to the Alaska Constitution on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska lawmakers confront a major budget deficit, legislators’ opposing views on possible solutions appear likely to lead to a lower Permanent Fund dividend and cuts to services, including public schools.
In public statements, members of the Alaska Senate’s majority caucus have said they oppose spending from savings to balance the budget and want to see new revenue bills instead.
Meanwhile, members of the state House and Gov. Mike Dunleavy have said they oppose new revenue bills and would prefer to spend from savings.
Those different positions leave only budget cuts — to public services and the dividend — as the way to balance the budget.
“It’s still a very dynamic conversation right now. … We can clearly see we don’t have enough funds to pay for everything,” said Rep. Bill Elam, R-Nikiski. 
“In the absence of revenue, the PFD is going to go away. An affordable PFD this year is like $500,” said Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage.
As it prepares its draft of the state’s operating budget, the Alaska Senate’s finance committee has already stripped out all spending increases proposed by the state House in its draft budget, and it has nixed most of the increases requested by Dunleavy.
Even after cutting more than $200 million from a budget draft approved by the House, the Senate Finance draft budget has a deficit of at least $70 million — and possibly much more, depending on the results of ongoing labor negotiations and other factors.
Next on the chopping block is the dividend, set at $1,400 per recipient by the House.
“I believe, because of the tightness of this year’s budget, we are looking at reducing that further, but no further than $1,000,” Hoffman said.
That reduction would save close to $420 million, he told reporters on Tuesday, but the size of the reduction hasn’t been finalized.
While legislators have not agreed on a new formula to set the dividend, the amounts each of the past two years were based on 25% of the annual draws from the Permanent Fund, a share supported by some senators since at least 2017. Reducing the dividend below $1,400 would end that practice.
With three weeks left in the Legislature’s regular session, the Senate has passed one revenue bill — modifying the state’s corporate income tax for big Internet companies like Amazon — and two others remain in committee.
On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, confirmed that the Senate will not pass the biggest revenue proposal this year: a reduction in the per-barrel tax credit given to oil companies as part of the state’s oil tax system.
That leaves only a change to the taxation of privately held companies like Hilcorp, the North Slope oil firm, on the Senate’s docket. 
Even if both bills were to pass the Legislature and gain Dunleavy’s approval, the combined gain to the state treasury would be the equivalent of less than $200 for the Permanent Fund dividend.
On top of that, the odds of the House passing and the governor allowing both revenue bills appear low.
In a March opinion column published by the Anchorage Daily News, House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, joined 15 members of the Republican House minority in opposing two of the three Senate bills.
Asked why Alaskans should endure a PFD cut to avoid higher taxes on those companies, Kopp said on April 8, “Right now, our oil and gas industry is recovering from the COVID-19 setback and we are currently on the verge of a renaissance in the energy industry. … I don’t want to kill an energy renaissance when it is just forming, coming online and showing tremendous promise.”
The House’s majority caucus has only 21 members, meaning that Kopp’s opposition would require the majority to have the support of at least one member of the House’s Republican minority in order to advance one of the oil-related bills. 
But even if a bill were to pass the House and Senate, Dunleavy would still have to OK it.
“I told legislative leadership, I’m not interested in new taxes. I’m not interested in a program that taxes and spends, taxes and spends,” the governor told reporters during a news conference earlier this month.
As an alternative to cutting the dividend and services, the Legislature could unlock the Constitutional Budget Reserve, a $2.8 billion savings account. Lawmakers are already planning to do so in order to cover a $200 million shortfall in the current year’s budget.
But on Tuesday, members of the Senate’s majority caucus reiterated their opposition to that idea.
As bad as the state’s budget situation is this year, it’s likely to be worse next year, said Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee. 
“We’re very concerned (about) any access to the CBR this year … because the concern is next year, it’s highly likely we’re going to need it,” he said.
Between federal budget cuts and depressed oil prices, the problems that the state is facing now will be repeated next year, both Stedman and Hoffman said. That’s when the Legislature will debate the budget to cover the fiscal year from July 2026 to June 2027.
“That is also an integral part of what we’re having dialogue on — positioning the state for the FY27 budget a year from now, so we’re not … halfway down a cliff, heading for a final stop,” Stedman said.

About 4 million Californians live in what Cal Fire categorizes as “high” or “very high” fire danger zones. With the state’s ongoing housing crunch, our penchant to build and rebuild homes in high-risk areas also won’t stop anytime soon.
Following the deadly Los Angeles County wildfires, home hardening — or the process of making homes resistant against fire — is considered by some state lawmakers, insurance companies, housing developers and fire experts as one of the crucial strategies the state should take to avoid the next wildfire catastrophe, writes CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.
One home developer, KB Home, is in the process of building an entire subdivision of fire-resistant homes north of San Diego County. 
But retrofitting old homes is an expensive endeavor, and with no statewide plan in place, fortifying California homes en masse will be an uphill battle for legislators and local governments alike.
Hardening, say, a two-story, 2,000 square-foot single family home could cost between $2,000 to over $100,000, according to the independent research group Headwater Economics. Despite the high price tag, experts argue that compared to losing an entire home by fire, it’s a necessary cost to pay.

Yana Valachovic, a forest health and fire expert with the University of California: “Fuels management and home hardening are just as important as a remodeled kitchen at this point.”

Some local governments, such as Marin County and the city of Novato, offer grants and incentives to homeowners to harden their dwellings and clear vegetation. Insurance companies also offer minor discounts to homeowners who make certain home-hardening investments or join neighborhood disaster preparedness groups. 
At the state level, California is carrying out a $117 million pilot wildfire mitigation program. Launched in 2019, the program has so far retrofitted 21 homes and has enough funding to harden about 2,000 homes. The pilot is currently set to expire in 2029, though the Legislature is considering a bill to make it permanent.
Lawmakers have also proposed two other related bills: One would redirect some of the tax revenue the state collects from property insurers to go towards a home-hardening grant program; and another that would create a state-run hardening certification program.

Should children have access to AI?

Following the death of a 14-year-old who killed himself last year after forming a deep relationship with an online chatbot, California lawmakers are considering two bills that seek to curb the use of artificial intelligence-powered companion bots by children, reports CalMatters’ Khari Johnson.
Senate Bill 243 would require chatbot developers to adopt standards for how to address conversations about self harm. Another measure would require developers to review and label AI systems based on their risk to kids and ban the use of emotionally manipulative chatbots.
A joint report released today by the children’s advocacy group Common Sense Media and the Stanford University School of Medicine found that companion bots mimic what users input, and are quick to engage in racist jokes and sexual roleplay. The assessment also finds that bots can worsen depression, anxiety, feelings of isolation and other mental health issues in young users. 
But some argue that these bills threaten the right to free speech and privacy. The California Chamber of Commerce and the Electronic Frontier Foundation both oppose SB 243. In a letter to one legislator, the foundation said the bill in its current form, which requires age verification, “would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.”

CA entering legal battles against Trump at twice previous pace

Since his return to the White House, President Donald Trump has issued over 130 executive orders that seek to scale back the reach of the federal government and unbraid the progressive governmental framework set forth by some of his predecessors, writes CalMatters’ Nigel Duara.
For California, that is likely to mean long legal battles ahead as state officials work to defend California’s existing policies against the administration.
Some of Trump’s orders include imposing tariffs, revoking birthright citizenship and limiting voting rights. In March, J. Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, defended the administration’s actions as “hopeful developments for the rule of law,” because they challenge federal agencies’ ability to insulate themselves from “presidential supervision.”
Meanwhile, the state has set aside $50 million for legal battles against the administration. So far, it has also filed or joined 16 lawsuits, with the latest lawsuit filed Tuesday challenging the administration’s cuts to AmeriCorps.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta: “The comparison with Trump 1.0 shows that it is high volume, high speed (this time). We’ve brought a lawsuit more than once a week in the first hundred days, and during Trump 1.0 there were about 120 lawsuits over four years. We’re gonna hit around 100 at this rate in two years, so it’s almost double the pace.”

And lastly: Committee chair pulls rent cap bill

Remember last week when dozens of tenant rights advocates and aggrieved landlords packed into an Assembly committee room to alternately cheer on and decry a bill that would have drastically limited how much landlords can hike the rent on their tenants each year?
We have an update: Never mind.
On Tuesday, Assemblymember Ash Kalra said that he would be withdrawing Assembly Bill 1157 from consideration this year, saying in a press release that “more time is needed to work on the bill.” 
Translation: He didn’t have the votes in the Assembly’s judiciary committee. The San Jose Democrat is the chairperson of that committee, so that really says something about the fervency of opposition to the bill — from landlords, moderate Democrats and possibly even the Assembly Speaker himself.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: A California bill to create a state-owned nonprofit that would provide financing for infrastructure projects may yet be another example of lawmakers proposing major programs without fully understanding the risks.
The recent death of a girl who killed herself after bullies threatened to have her parents deported underscores how incendiary rhetoric surrounding immigration can be dangerous, writes Carielle Escalante, an advocate for survivors of gender-based violence.

Detroit Area Youth Uniting Michigan student organizer Demetrius Davis said the books that are banned are often those featuring representation for oppressed groups.
“We the people reject the erasure of our stories and the whitewashing of our curricula,” Davis said.

Davis said the book bans are also meant to limit information to benefit those in power.
“They yearn to keep us ignorant,” Davis said. “They call true education dangerous and savage. The most dangerous thing you can be under a fascist regime is well educated.”
Michigan Education Justice Coalition youth organizer Imani Clark said the book bans are a threat to the wellbeing of students.
“Unsafe schools, both physically and mentally, are important to address for students,” Clark said.
Protesters said another part of that threat is a lack of funding for schools.
Grand Rapids Student Association for Leadership and Transformation student advocate Abigail Valdivia-Romero said that each floor in her school building has a television for displaying announcements.
“A healthy, nutritious lunch is way more important than watching announcements on a screen,” Valdivia-Romero said. “When our current school lunches are not nutritious, healthy or even appetizing, a lot of students go throughout the entire day without eating, and the only thing they can think about when they get home is what they’re going to eat. Having an empty stomach all day makes it harder to focus, to think clearly, to learn.”
Clark said the lack of adequate funding for schools is “all encompassing.”

Detroit student Nabiha Chowdhury, who is part of 482Forward Youth Organizing Collective, said that additional funding allows schools to offer better resources for students, including in the types of content they teach.
“Money gives schools the tools they need – and gives students access to the books, support and opportunities they deserve,” Chowdhury said.
Students had planned to attend House session and deliver a petition to the office of Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) but were disappointed to discover that session had been cancelled, leading to chants outside Hall’s office on the first floor of the Capitol.

Chuck Owen, R-Rosepine, during a legislative hearing Tuesday, April 29, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol. It would have given every parish the right to determine whether projects focused on carbon capture and sequestration could occu, but a committee rejected the proposal. (Louisiana House of Representatives video capture).Two young members of the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana are speaking out after state lawmakers voted Tuesday against a bill they say was important to their land, culture and safety.
Allie Johnson, 20, and Marianna Sickey, 16, spoke in support of House Bill 4, by Rep. Chuck Owen, R-Rosepine. It would have given every parish the right to determine whether projects focused on carbon capture and sequestration could occur. ExxonMobil has proposed drilling wells to store carbon dioxide underground less than one mile from the Coushatta reservation, according to the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources.
The two were among the youngest to testify during a House Committee on Natural Resources and Environment hearing at the State Capitol, where a host of bills dealing with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) were considered.
In phone interviews with the Illuminator after the hearing, Johnson and Sickey said official communication with the Coushatta community about CCS plans impacting their tribal land has been lacking.

Sickey, who attends high school in Lake Charles, said many of her peers were unaware of the proposed CCS projects. 
“More people my age should be aware of this,” she said. “This affects us, and we had no idea.”
“We haven’t been given opportunities to tell the youth because they want to keep it hush hush on the reservation,” Johnson said.
One proposed well site for the ExxonMobil CCS site would be approximately half a mile from Coushatta’s preschool and tribal housing. 
“This is land that has deep cultural ties to our people,” Johnson said. “It is land that we cannot just move away from or leave. Our land is sacred. It is our homes, our ancestors, our futures, and it connects me and others to all that it was before. 
“It is a place that I hope more generations get to enjoy and live on. But right now, it seems that it’s being threatened.”
Sickey attended the preschool and said many of the Coushatta words she knows today are remnants of what she was taught there.
“When you’re on the reservation at all, like there’s language in danger, all of their lives are in danger, their heritage. If anything were to happen, it would be detrimental to the tribe,” Sickey said. 
Johnson, who greeted committee members in the Coushatta tongue, worries about the lack of safety data for long-term carbon dioxide storage and the financial incentives that can cloud judgment. While Louisiana’s fossil fuel sector is well versed in the drilling needed for CCS, the storage element is new ground for a state where some 30 such projects are planned.    
“This is an experiment they’re putting on our soil,” Johnson said. “There’s no way to guarantee that it’s safe.”
CCS proponents have said the process is safe as long as carbon gases are stored and maintained properly. The biggest risks are from leakage, including with the pipelines that transport CO2 from the industrial facilities where it’s captured and send it to sequestration sites.
Five years ago, some 200 people were forced to evacuate their homes after a CO2 pipeline explosion in Sartaria, Mississippi. Exposure to the odorless, colorless gas put 45 people in the hospital. 
A year ago, Calcasieu Parish residents were unaware that a CO pipeline near their homes had ruptured. No injuries or illnesses were reported as police shut down access to the area, but neighbors said they only learned about the incident hours later from social media. There were no warning sirens or an alert system in place.
The company that owns both pipelines, Denbury Inc., is a subsidiary of ExxonMobil.    
Despite the failure of Owen’s bill, both Sickey and Johnson say they are committed to continuing the fight against CCS on their homeland.
“This is something we will not be quiet about,” Johnson said. “Even if these bills are denied, they try to sweep us under the rug, and they try anything in their power to silence us. … The good fight will keep going on, at the end of the day, until justice is served.”

Now what about the rest of California?,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/04/california-fire-home-hardening/,Dixon Trail is the first purpose-built “wildfire resilient neighborhood” in the United States. Making that a reality for the millions of Californians who already live in harm’s way is a daunting and costly challenge that lawmakers are only just beginning to grapple with.,"In summary
Dixon Trail is the first purpose-built “wildfire resilient neighborhood” in the United States. Making that a reality for the millions of Californians who already live in harm’s way is a daunting and costly challenge that lawmakers are only just beginning to grapple with. 



The homes in the half-built subdivision look a lot like all the others nestled up against the parched, shrubby hills of Escondido, north San Diego County.
But look a little closer. The gutters and vents are enclosed in a thin, wire mesh. Each window is double-paned, the glass tempered to withstand the heat of a wildfire, the stucco around the shutters resistant to flame. The privacy fences, a suburban staple, look like wood, but are actually brown-tinted steel. Every foundation sits behind a moat of gravel.
National mega-developer KB Home is marketing Dixon Trail as the first purpose-built “wildfire resilient neighborhood” in the United States. The next time fire rips through the chaparral in surrounding hills (a question of when, not if) this cluster of homes is being built to keep the flames at the subdivision’s edge. 
Though only half of the 64 homes have been constructed, the development had its grand opening earlier this month. No one from KB would say as much, but in purely marketing terms, the timing couldn’t have been better. For years, wildfire-resilient home and neighborhood design has been a niche consideration for many California homeowners. January’s Los Angeles firestorms have made it feel more like an urgent necessity.
“Buyers want to feel safe in their homes and this is a really big plus for them,” said Steve Ruffner, who oversees KB projects across the region.
The design of each house and the layout of the entire subdivision — with healthy buffers between each building and scant flammable vegetation — meet standards set by the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety, a research nonprofit funded by the insurance industry. The institute began issuing its “wildfire prepared” designations to homes in 2022. Think organic certification on produce, except for homes built to withstand wildfire.
This is the first time the institute plans to give its stamp of approval to an entire neighborhood.
Building a fire resilient home from scratch is one thing. Bringing older homes up to that heightened standard is a more daunting and costly challenge — and one that California lawmakers at the state and local level are only beginning to grapple with. 
Millions of Californians already live in tinderbox canyons and at the edges of shrub fields and overgrown forests. An unknown number live in homes built before 2008, when the state introduced its wildfire-minded building code for new construction in high hazard areas. Some home-hardening retrofits are cheap and DIY-able. Others less so. A report from 2024 by the independent research group Headwater Economics put the cost to harden a two-story, 2,000 square-foot single family home at anywhere from $2,000 to “more than $100,000.”
Karen Collins, vice president of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, calls these retrofits “pre-disaster mitigation” measures. As wildfires grow more severe and costly, these measures can offer “a huge return on investment from what is otherwise spent at the loss,” she said. Translated from insurance speak: Replacing a roof before a fire is cheaper than replacing an entire house afterward.
“But yes, to retrofit and put on new roofs and new siding, that gets into the multiple tens of thousands of dollars, so there’s a public policy trade off,” she said. “Like, how do we do this?”

Some local governments — albeit not many — offer grants and incentives to fire-wary homeowners hoping to make these upgrades. 
The insurance industry is beginning to offer discounts to some homeowners who make firewise changes, though the promised savings are often smaller than many homeowners expect or demand. 
There aren’t any statewide plans to help harden California’s housing stock en masse, though a pilot project is underway and the Legislature is considering a few other ideas.
Beyond changes in policy, California homeowners, planners, real estate agents and developers may need to change the way they think about wildfire risk, said Yana Valachovic, a forest health and fire expert with the University of California. Rather than viewing home hardening as a luxury expense, or even a necessary cost that must be begrudgingly assumed, such protections might just need to become standard features of homeownership across the increasingly fire-prone American West. 
“It needs to be spoken about in the advertisement of the house, because these are all keys to insurability and the protection of your investment,” said Valachovic. “Fuels management and home hardening are just as important as a remodeled kitchen at this point.”
A fireproof home?
Home-hardening experts try to think like embers in a windstorm.
Open eaves (the cavities beneath a roof’s overhang); vents that lead into an attic; wood decks; wood shingles; wood fences; and any plants, lawn furniture, cars, sheds and trash bins stowed right up against the house — all of these present an inviting array of nooks and crannies in which embers can settle and smolder. Hardening a home means covering them up, replacing material that burns with material that doesn’t, and clearing a five-foot non-combustible buffer around the house, an area state regulators call “zone zero”  
Ember-proofing alone isn’t always enough. In urban conflagrations, like the ones in Los Angeles, flames go horizontal in the gale-force winds, turning a burning home into a blow-torch trained upon its neighbors. The sheer heat radiating off of a burning structure can warp and melt window frames 20 feet away.
In those conditions, cement siding and tempered-glass can give a home a fighting chance.

When the Insurance Institute conducted a formal forensic survey in Los Angeles, they found repeated examples of homes where a single double-paned tempered glass window, a stucco wall or a walkway free of decorative plants likely kept the flames at bay. 
Experts turn to the surviving homes for lessons after every major fire. In Maui, after the Lahaina waterfront burned in 2023, images of a single red-roofed home, lonely and seemingly untouched, went viral. Reporting later revealed that just prior to the disaster, the homeowners replaced the roof with a thick metal one and removed its surrounding vegetation. They were trying to keep out termites, not flames, but fire doesn’t consider motive.
There may be no such thing as a fire-proof house, but if vulnerability to disaster is a numbers game, home hardening — like seat belts, bike helmets and vaccines — can up the odds of survival.
Pilots and programs
The closest thing California has to a statewide home hardening campaign at the moment is a $117 million pilot project. 
The California Wildfire Mitigation Program, run jointly by the California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) and the governor’s Office of Emergency Services, is funding half a dozen neighborhood-wide retrofits in especially fire-prone and economically distressed corners of the state. 
The program seeks to tackle the problem of fire resilience at a community scale. Managing wildfire risk is a bit like managing an infectious disease: There’s only so much a single homeowner can do if their neighbors are unprotected.
“Fuels management and home hardening are just as important as a remodeled kitchen at this point.”Yana Valachovic, forest health and fire expert, University of California
The pilot was launched by the legislature in 2019, but is only just beginning to get off the ground. So far, 21 homes have been retrofitted: 19 in Kelseyville, Lake County and two in Dulzura, east of San Diego. Neighborhoods in the Sierra foothills and California’s far north are still working through the start-up and permitting process.
Each house presents its own array of costly challenges. New roofs, new siding, new windows, replacing decks, cleaning brush. “We don’t want to just kinda harden the home,” said Deanna Fernweh, program manager for the Lake County project. 
This is new terrain for the state and the pilot has run into plenty of unexpected complications along the way. Fire-resistant materials are a specialty product that can be hard to source, particularly if you need something to be just the right size. Local contractors don’t always know much about fire risk, nor do the local permitting officials. Some counties require construction workers to be paid union-level wages. With most of the money coming from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the work is also subject to rigorous environmental standards. Any work done in the spring and summer has to wait on nest surveys to ensure that construction doesn’t disturb migratory or endangered birds.

All of that adds to the price tag. The cheapest retrofit so far has come in at roughly $36,000, said J. Lopez, executive director of the statewide program. That was a tidy, well-maintained home in Kelseyville. The most expensive so far was $110,000. At current funding levels, the program is on track to harden roughly 2,000 homes.
That’s not likely to put a noticeable dent in the total number of vulnerable homes across the state. But Lopez said part of the goal of the pilot is to figure out just how expensive, delay-ridden and generally annoying it is to harden a neighborhood — and then figure out ways to make it all less so. 
“When the VCR first came out, I think the first ones were about $1,500,” he said. “I leave it to American ingenuity to come up with solutions — and we are part of that, helping move that along.”
The pilot is currently set to expire in 2029, though the Legislature is considering a bill to make it permanent. Future funding remains an open question. So far FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Assistance Grant program, which provides much of the funding for the California program, has been spared the cuts that have felled other emergency response and preparedness initiatives under the Trump administration.
Legislators may also take up legislation this year to shave off some of the tax revenue the state currently collects from property insurers and redirect it toward a grant program for fire-resistant roofs and vegetation management work. Another bill would create a “Community Hardening Commission” inside the state’s Department of Insurance to be tasked with recommending new home hardening rules and improving old ones. A third bill would create a state-run home hardening certification program, with the hope being that insurers will be more likely to cover a home with the state’s imprimatur. 
“Almost everyone knows what the things are that we have to do with home hardening,” Assemblymember Steve Bennett, an Oxnard Democrat and the author of that certification bill, said at a budget committee hearing in February. “We’ve talked about it and talked about it, but we’re not really making much progress.”
Locals step up
Absent a comprehensive statewide hardening program, some cities are trying to fill the gaps. 
In 2020, Marin County voted overwhelmingly to tax itself to fund a countywide wildfire prevention program. The program shells out roughly $20 million each year on individualized home safety assessments, home hardening and vegetation clearing grants and evacuation route clearing operations. 
In the city of Novato, the local fire district has used those funds to inspect every house in town. Homeowners can apply for matching grants — up $1,500 for home hardening and $1,000 for brush clearing. 
Sometimes that’s enough to cover the cost of the work. Vent screens aren’t expensive, and vegetation management can be cheap if a homeowner is willing to do the work themselves.

But often the grants aren’t nearly enough to cover all the called-for work. In Novato at least, a financial nudge is often all that people need, said Fire Marshal Lynne Osgood. According to data collected by the fire district over the last fiscal year, the city doled out half a million dollars in these matching grants to fund home-hardening projects; homeowners spend four times that amount.
“(Novato homeowners) are getting pressure from the insurance companies, they’re seeing, year after year, major conflagrations where thousands upon thousands of people are losing their homes,” Osgood said. “They are highly motivated.” 
Where Marin County is offering carrots, other cities are using sticks. Across the Bay, the city of Berkeley just passed its own “zone zero” regulations which will require hill-dwelling residents to keep the five feet around their homes free of plants, wood fencing and other flammable odds and ends. The new policy will go into effect at the beginning of next year when it will be enforced with the possibility of daily fines.
That’s a few years ahead of the rest of the state. Cal Fire is scrambling to cobble together specific “zone zero” regulations for all high hazard areas, something a state law directed them to do by 2023. In February, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order directing the department to “accelerate” its regulatory process and produce a final rule by the end of the year. The most recent draft of the regulations would give homeowners three years to comply.
‘Do this or you’re done’
Byers Enterprises has run a steady roofing business out of Grass Valley, just west of the Tahoe National Forest, since the late 1980s. In 2022, it started a specific division for home hardening. 
“We’re seeing a real groundswell of interest,” said Jeff Fierstein, the company’s general manager. Some of that interest is due to the Los Angeles fires, which put fire risk top of mind for many. 
But he said roughly half of his customers are turning to him out of duress. “The insurance companies are saying ‘Do this or you’re done,’” he said.
Not every fire-prone jurisdiction has Marin’s resources or Berkeley’s political appetite for new mandates. For the majority of Californians living in the so-called wildland urban interface, the most powerful nudge toward home hardening comes in the form of an insurance company’s premium hike or non-renewal notice.
A regulation from 2023 is forcing California insurers to offer discounts to homeowners who make certain home hardening investments or join Firewise communities, voluntary neighborhood disaster preparedness groups. But the approval process has been slow, the discounts vary from carrier to carrier, the requirements coming from insurers don’t always match the state’s own standards and the savings on offer are, according to some, miserly. 
California property insurers are not in an especially discounting mood. After a decade of staggering wildfire-related losses, surging inflation and what the industry has long characterized as a sclerotic regulatory environment that doesn’t allow them to cover their costs, many carriers are looking for any excuse to drop California customers. 
That dour climate might begin to change soon, said Janet Ruiz, a spokesperson for the industry association, the Insurance Information Institute. The state’s Department of Insurance is rolling out a series of policy changes aimed at enticing insurers back into the market. That overhaul “should bring more insurance companies into writing more policies,” putting them on a stronger financial footing and making them more willing to cut certain homeowners a break.

Even with the right regulations in place, insurers aren’t known for embracing change, said Dave Jones, California’s former Department of Insurance head who now runs the Climate Risk Initiative at UC Berkeley’s law school. 
Earlier this month, Jones and the nonprofit Nature Conservancy released a new, first-of-its-kind insurance policy for Tahoe-Donner, one of the country’s largest homeowners associations. In exchange for years of tree thinning and brush clearing work, the Truckee-based HOA will receive nearly 40% off on its insurance policy. 
“It’s a very conservative industry,” he said. “You need to show them that an insurer is able to (make money doing this) before others will follow suit.” 
The upside: The new policy shows that at least one insurer — in this case, Globe Underwriting, based in London — believes it can account for the reduced risk that comes with certain wildfire mitigation efforts and then pass some of those savings onto customers. 
The downside: The policy only covers commonly held land, not individual homes and, at least for now, the Nature Conservancy is footing the $55,000 annual premium.
“The big success here is that the insurance policy was written at all because this is an area where insurers are pulling out and it was written because of the forest treatment work that the homeowners association is undertaking,” said Jones. 
Whether it’s forest management programs, zone zero mandates or home hardening grants, the public is only going to support these taxpayer-funded initiatives if they start to open up the insurance market and bring down premiums, he said. 
“Part of what we’re trying to do here is demonstrate that this can be done, convince insurers to do it, but also continue to build public support for these necessary investments,” said Jones. “Because this stuff is not inexpensive to do.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042425_Dixon-Trail_AH_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

He’s used obscure authorities to increase deportations, upended longstanding trade policy with record-high tariffs, made drastic cuts to the federal workforce and ordered the closure of the Education Department.Those moves have garnered mixed results and led to legal challenges.The approach to immigration enforcement has yielded lower numbers of unauthorized border crossings compared to last year. But the immigration crackdown has barreled the country toward a constitutional crisis through various clashes with the judiciary branch.Those nearing retirement have watched their savings shrink as Trump’s blunt application of tariffs, which he promises will replace income taxes, roils markets. Administration officials have promised the short-term tariff pain will benefit the country in the long term.And White House advisor and top campaign donor Elon Musk’s efforts at government efficiency have resulted in eliminations of wide swaths of government jobs. That includes about half of the Education Department workforce so far, though Trump has signed an executive order to eliminate the department.The controversial moves appear unpopular, as Americans delivered record low approval ratings for a president so early in his term. Polls spearheaded by Fox News, NPR, Gallup and numerous others yield overall disapproval of Trump’s job performance.

Deportation push tests legal boundariesImmigration was Trump’s signature issue on the campaign trail and his first 100 days were marked by a crackdown carried out against people with a range of immigration statuses and at least three U.S. citizen children. The aggressive push has led to clashes with the judiciary branch.A burst of Inauguration Day executive orders Trump signed upon his return to office included some hardline immigration policies he’d promised.On day one, he declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border that enabled his deployment two days later of 1,500 troops to help border enforcement.He sought to end birthright citizenship and ended several forms of legal immigration, including humanitarian parole for people from certain countries, and suspended refugee resettlement services.District courts blocked the birthright citizenship and refugee resettlement measures and an appeals court has upheld those interpretations. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in May on birthright citizenship.Trump’s record on immigration is a clear example of his desire to expand executive power, said Ahilan Arulanantham, a co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law.“It's an attempt to expand the government's powers far beyond anything that we have seen before in this realm,” he said.Unprecedented authoritiesThe administration has taken a series of actions considered nearly unprecedented to conduct mass deportations.On March 8, immigration authorities detained Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident who helped organize Palestinian protests at Columbia University.Authorities never accused Khalil of committing a crime, but sought to revoke his green card under a Cold War-era provision that allows the secretary of State to remove lawful permanent residents if the secretary deems their presence has “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.”Similar arrests followed at universities across the country.In mid-March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport two planeloads of people his administration said belonged to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.It was only the fourth time the law was invoked and the first outside of wartime. The first flights left U.S. soil en route to a mega-prison in El Salvador on Saturday, March 15, amid a hearing on the legality of using the law in peacetime.

When a federal judge entered an oral order to turn the flights around, the administration refused, arguing the oral order was not valid. The administration also ignored a subsequent written order demanding the return of the flights, later arguing the flights were outside U.S. airspace at that time and impossible to order returned.Administration officials mocked the court order on social media.The Supreme Court on April 7 allowed for the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected gang members of Tren de Aragu. However, the justices unanimously agreed that those removed under the wartime law needed to have due process and have a hearing to challenge their removal.Abrego GarciaA third March 15 flight carried a man who was mistakenly deported in an episode that has gained a national spotlight.Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, had a final order of removal, but was granted deportation protections by an immigration judge because of the threat he would be harmed by gangs if he were returned to his home country. Despite the protective order, he was deported to the notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT prison.After his family sued over his deportation, the administration admitted he’d been removed through an “administrative error,” but stood by its decision.The administration argued it had no power to compel the El Salvador government to release Abrego Garcia, despite a possibly illegal $6 million agreement with the country to detain the roughly 300 men.A Maryland federal court and an appeals court ruled the administration must repatriate Abrego Garcia, whose wife and 5-year-old son are U.S. citizens, and the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” his return, but stopped short of requiring it.The administration has done little to indicate it is complying with that order, earning a rebuke from a conservative judge on the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.“The Supreme Court’s decision does not … allow the government to do essentially nothing,” Circuit Court Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III wrote.  “‘Facilitate’ is an active verb. It requires that steps be taken as the Supreme Court has made perfectly clear.”The administration’s relationship with the courts — delaying compliance with orders and showing a clear distaste for doing so — has led to the brink of a constitutional crisis, Arulanantham said.“They’re playing footsy with disregarding court orders,” he said. “On the one hand, they're not just complying. If they were complying, Abrego Garcia would be here now.”But the administration has also not flagrantly refused to comply, Arulanantham added. “They’re sort of testing the bounds.”Tariffs prompted market dropTrump’s first 100 days spiraled into economic uncertainty as he ramped up tariffs on allies and trading partners. In early April, the president declared foreign trade a national emergency and shocked economies around the world with costly import taxes.Following a week of market upheaval, Trump paused for 90 days what he had billed as “reciprocal” tariffs and left a universal 10% levy on nearly all countries, except China, which received a bruising 125%.Some products, including pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber and copper, remain exempt for now, though the administration is eyeing the possibilities of tariffs on those goods.

The administration now contends it will strike trade deals with some 90 foreign governments over the pause, set to expire in July.Meanwhile, an all-out trade war rages with China after Trump hiked tariffs on the world’s no. 2 economy even further to 145%. China responded with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. The two economies share a massive trading relationship, both in the top three for each other’s imports and exports.‘Chaotic’ strategyInu Manak, fellow for trade policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, summed up Trump’s first 100 days as “chaotic.”“We haven't seen anything like this in our U.S. history in terms of how trade policy is being handled. It's very ad hoc,” Manak said.“U.S. businesses can't figure out what to do. And even for the large companies, it's hard for them to know some of the long-term trajectories of where this was going to go,” Manak said.Shortly after his second term began, Trump declared a national emergency over illicit fentanyl entering the U.S. — an unprecedented move to trigger import taxes — and began escalating tariffs on Chinese goods, as well as up to 25% on certain products crossing the borders from Canada and Mexico.Trump hiked existing tariffs on steel and aluminum in mid-March under trade provisions meant to protect domestic production and national security, followed by 25% levies on foreign cars and auto parts — though Trump signed two executive orders Tuesday to grant some tariff relief to carmakers. The import taxes have alarmed investors, small businesses and American consumers following the 2024 presidential campaign when Trump made lowering prices a major tenet of his platform.The latest University of Michigan survey of consumers — a staple indicator for economists — reported consumer outlook on personal finances and business conditions took a nosedive in April. Expectations dropped 32% since January, the largest three-month percentage decline since the 1990 recession, according to the analysis. Manak said Trump’s tariffs are “really at odds with” with the administration’s objectives of helping U.S. manufacturers and cutting costs for Americans.“The U.S. now has the highest tariff rates in the world,” she said. “That's going to hurt both consuming industries that import products to make things, and then consumers as well. We're starting to see notifications coming out on layoffs, and some small businesses considering closing up shop already. And the tariffs haven't been in place for that long.”Rhett Buttle, of Small Business for America's Future, said the policies are “causing real damage in terms of not just planning, but in terms of day-to-day operations.”Buttle, a senior advisor for the advocacy group that claims 85,000 small business members, said even if Trump begins to strike deals with other countries, entrepreneurs will likely be on edge for months to come.“It's that uncertainty that makes business owners not want to hire or not want to grow,” Buttle said. “So it's like, ‘Okay, we got through this mess, but why would I hire a person if I don't know if I'm gonna wake up in two weeks and there's gonna be another announcement?’”Support droppingTrillions were erased from the U.S. stock market after “Liberation Day” — the White House’s term for the start of its global tariff policy. The S&P 500 index, which tracks the performance of the 500 largest U.S. companies, is overall down 8.5% since Trump’s inauguration, according to The Wall Street Journal’s analysis.Numerous recent polls showed flagging support for Trump’s economic policies.In a poll released Monday, Gallup found 89% of Americans believe tariffs will result in increasing prices. And a majority of Americans are concerned about an economic recession and increasing costs of groceries and other goods, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey between April 17 and April 22.The Pew Research Center similarly found a growing gloomy outlook among U.S. adults from April 7 to April 13. Results showed a majority of Americans — 59% across race, age and income levels — disapproved of Trump’s approach to tariffs. But when broken down by party, the survey showed a majority of Democrats disapprove while the majority of Republicans approve of the tariff policy.American households are poised to lose up to $2,600 annually if tariffs remain in place and U.S. fiscal policy doesn’t change, according to the Yale Budget Lab. Analyses show low-income households will be disproportionately affected.“If these tariffs stay in place, some folks are going to benefit, but a lot of people are going to get hurt,” Manak said.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Government spending

Trump began his second term with a flurry of action on government spending, challenging the balance of power between the president and Congress.Efforts to unilaterally cancel funding already approved by lawmakers, who hold the authority to spend federal dollars under the Constitution, led to confusion and frustration from both Democrats and Republicans, especially after the U.S. DOGE Service froze allocations on programs that have long elicited bipartisan support.Many of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back appropriations are subject to injunctions from federal courts, blocking the cuts from moving forward while the lawsuits advance through the judicial system.Kevin Kosar, senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said Trump’s actions on spending so far have sought to expand the bounds of presidential authority.""We've never seen a president in modern times who's been this aggressive in trying to seize control of the power of the purse,"" he said. “To just say, ‘I'm not going to fund this agency, like USAID, despite money being appropriated for it. And we're going to walk over and take their plaque off their wall and lock their doors.’ This is new.""Many of Trump’s actions so far indicate to Kosar that the administration expects a change to the balance of power following next year’s midterm elections, when the president’s party historically loses control of at least one chamber of Congress.“It feels to me that the first 100 days are in large part predicated on an assumption that they may only have two years of unified Republican control of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the presidency,” he said. “We know the margins in the House are quite narrow, and the heavy use of executive actions and the simple defunding of various government contracts and agencies all through executive action, just tell me that the administration feels like they have to get everything done as fast as they possibly can, because the time is short.”Kosar said he’s watching to see if Trump works with Republicans in Congress, while they still have unified control, to codify his executive orders into law — something he didn’t do with many of the unilateral actions he took during his first term.“He just did executive actions, which, of course, (President Joe) Biden just undid,” he said. “And I'm just wondering: Are we going to see this movie all over again? Or is he going to actually partner with Congress on these various policy matters and pass statutes so that they stick?”Zachary Peskowitz, associate professor of political science at Emory University, said Trump has been much more “assertive” during the last 100 days than during the first few months of 2017.DOGE ‘winding down’U.S. DOGE Service and Musk hit the ground running, though their actions have fallen short of the goals he set, and appear to be sunsetting with the billionaire turning his attention back toward his businesses.“I think the big bang is winding down. They did a lot of things early on. It's not clear how many of them are going to stick, what the consequences are,” Peskowitz said. “And I think, big picture, in terms of federal spending, the amounts of money that may have been saved or not are pretty small.”Democrats in Congress released a tracker Tuesday listing which accounts the Trump administration has frozen or canceled to the tune of more than $430 billion.But Trump has just gotten started.The administration plans to submit its first budget request to Congress in the coming days, a step that’s typically taken in early February, though it happens a couple months behind schedule during a president’s first year.That massive tax-and-spending proposal will begin the classic tug-of-war between Congress, which will draft the dozen annual appropriations bills, and Trump, who has shown a willingness to act unilaterally when he doesn’t get his way.Trump and lawmakers must agree to some sort of government funding bill before the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, otherwise a partial government shutdown would begin. And unlike the reconciliation package that Republicans can enact all on their own, funding bills require some Democratic support to move past the Senate’s 60-vote cloture threshold.

Eliminating the Education DepartmentResearchers and advocates predicted even more changes to the federal role in education, underscoring anti-diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and a continued ideological battle with higher education that have marked Trump’s approach to education policy in his first 100 days.In a torrent of education-related decisions, Trump and his administration have tried to dismantle the Education Department via an executive order, slashed more than 1,300 employees at the department, threatened to revoke funds for schools that use DEI practices and cracked down on “woke” higher education.The Trump administration has taken drastic steps to revoke federal funding for a number of elite universities in an attempt to make the institutions align more with them ideologically.Rachel Perera, a governance studies fellow at the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution, cited “brazen lawlessness” when reflecting on Trump’s approach to higher education in his second term.“The ways that they’re trying to withhold funding from universities are very clearly in violation of federal law and the processes mandated by civil rights law in terms of ensuring that institutions are offered due process in assessing whether violations have taken place,” Perera said. “There’s not even a pretense of pretending to investigate some of these institutions before taking really dramatic action.”Whether the administration’s approach continues or not depends on court action, she added.“I think what the next three years might look like is really going to depend on how some of these lawsuits play out,” Perera said, referencing some of the major legal battles involving the Trump administration. Wil Del Pilar, senior vice president at the nonprofit policy and advocacy group EdTrust, said “much of what this administration has done has been overreach.” He pointed to the Education Department’s letter threatening to yank federal funds for schools that use race-conscious practices across aspects of student life as one example.Del Pilar, who was previously deputy secretary of postsecondary and higher education for the state of Pennsylvania, said the administration is “going to take any opportunity to grab at power that advances their ideology.”Meanwhile, Perera said the consequences of the department implementing a reduction in force plan in March “have yet to be felt.”“I think we will start to see really the material consequences of the reduced staffing capacity in the coming years, in terms of how programs are administered, in terms of how funding is moving out the building, in terms of auditing, making sure funding is going to the right groups of students that Congress intended for the money to go to, whether big data collection efforts that are congressionally mandated are being carried out in timely and effective ways,” she said.“All of that remains to be seen.”Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

They can take on just about any role you like, standing in for friends in a group chat, a romantic partner,  or even a dead friend. Companies design the bots to keep people engaged and help turn a profit.
But there’s a growing awareness of the downsides for users. Megan Garcia made headlines last year when she said her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer took his own life after forming an intimate relationship with a chatbot made by Character.ai. The company has denied Garcia’s charges, made in a civil suit, that it was complicit in the suicide, saying it takes user safety seriously. It has asked a Florida judge to dismiss the suit on free speech grounds.
Garcia has spoken in support of a bill now before the California State Senate that would require chatbot makers to adopt protocols for how to address conversations about self harm and require annual reports to the Office of Suicide Prevention. Another measure, in the Assembly, would require AI makers to carry out assessments to label systems based on their risk to kids and to prohibit use of emotionally manipulative chatbots. Common Sense backs both pieces of legislation.
Business groups, including TechNet and the California Chamber of Commerce oppose the bill Garcia backs, saying they share its goals but would like to see a clearer definition of companion chatbots and oppose giving private individuals the right to sue.  Civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation is also opposed, saying in a letter to one legislator that the bill in current form “would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.”
 The new Common Sense assessment adds to the debate by pointing to further harms from companion bots. Conducted with input from Stanford’s University School of Medicine’s Brainstorm Lab for Mental Health Innovation, it evaluated social bots from Nomi and three California-based firms: Character.ai, Replika, and Snapchat

The assessment found that bots, apparently seeking to mimic what users want to hear, responded to racist jokes with adoration, supported adults having sex with young boys, and engaged in sexual roleplay with people of any age. Young kids can struggle with distinguishing fantasy and reality, and teens are vulnerable to parasocial attachment and may use social AI companions to avoid the challenges of building real relationships, according to the Common Sense assessment authors and doctors.
Stanford University’s Dr. Darja Djordjevic told CalMatters she was surprised how quickly conversations turned sexually explicit, and that one bot was willing to engage in sexual roleplay involving an adult and a minor. She and coauthors of the risk assessment believe companion bots can worsen clinical depression, anxiety disorders, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and psychosis, she said, because they are willing to encourage risky, compulsive behavior like running away from home and isolate people by encouraging them to turn away from real life relationships. And since boys may be at higher risk of problematic online activity, companion bots may feed into the mental health and suicide crisis today among young boys and men, she said.
“If we’re just thinking about developmental milestones and meeting kids where they’re at and not interfering in that critical process, that’s really where chatbots fail,” Djordjevic said. “They can’t have a sense for where a young person is developmentally and what’s appropriate for them.”

Character.ai head of communications Chelsea Harrison said in an email that the company takes user safety seriously and added a protection to detect and prevent conversations about self harm and in some cases produce a pop-up to put people in touch with the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. She declined to comment on pending legislation but said the company welcomes working with lawmakers and regulators. 
Alex Cardinell, founder of Nomi parent company Glimpse.ai, said in a written statement that Nomi is not for users under 18, that the company supports age restrictions that maintain user anonymity, and that his company takes the responsibility of creating helpful AI companions seriously. “We strongly condemn inappropriate usage of Nomi and continuously work to harden Nomi’s defenses against misuse,” he added.
Neither Nomi or Character.ai representatives responded to the results of the risk assessment. 
By endorsing an age limit on companion bots, the risk assessment brings back to the fore the issue of age verification; an online age verification bill died in the California Legislature last year. EFF said in its letter that age verification “threatens the free speech and privacy of all users.” Djordjevic supports the practice, while a number of digital rights and civil liberties groups oppose it. 
Common Sense advocates for laws such as one passed last year that bans smartphone notifications for kids late at night and during school hours, part of which was blocked in court earlier this year by a federal judge.
A study by researchers at Stanford’s School of Education lent support to the idea, put forward by companies like Replika, that companion bots can address the loneliness epidemic that’s become a public health crisis. The assessment called the study limited because its subjects spent only one month using a Replika chatbot.
“There are long-term risks we simply haven’t had enough time to understand yet,” the risk assessment reads.
Prior assessments by Common Sense found that 7 in 10 teens already use generative AI tools including companion bots, that companion bots can encourage kids to drop out of high school or run away from home, and, in 2023, that Snapchat’s My AI talks to kids about drugs and alcohol. Snapchat said at the time that My AI is optional, designed with safety in mind, and that parents can monitor usage through tools it provides. The Wall Street Journal reported just last week that, in its tests, Meta chatbots would engage in sexual conversations with minors, and a 404 Media story out this week found that Instagram chatbots lie about being licensed therapists.
MIT Tech Review reported in February that an AI girlfriend repeatedly told a man to kill himself. 
 Djordjevic said the liberatory power of total free speech should be measured against our desire to protect the sanctity of the development process of an adolescent with a developing brain. 
“I think we can all agree we want to prevent child and adolescent suicide, and there has to be a risk benefit analysis in medicine and society,” she said. “So if universal right to health is something we hold dear then we need to be thinking seriously about the guardrails that are in place with things like Character.ai to prevent something like that from happening again.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/09152021_Triplets_PU_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

Redlands Unified school board can’t legally ban transgender athletes, but a majority of its board voted for a resolution opposing them anyway. 


The Redland Unified School District Board approved a resolution to enforce “fairness in girls’ interscholastic sports,” placing the Inland Empire district in the middle of escalating conflicts over transgender students’ rights.
In a 3-2 split vote last week, the board approved a statement  “ensuring fairness, safety and equal opportunities for all student-athletes.”
While the resolution doesn’t specifically mention transgender students, it states that “biological differences between male and female athletes can create inherent advantages in sports, particularly in categories designated specifically for girls.”
That language appears to slip through the cracks between California law — which protects the rights of transgender student athletes — and federal policy under President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order in February banning transgender women and girls from women’s sports.
Redlands School Board Member Candy Olson voted for the resolution, saying that as a student athlete, she was “far behind the boys” while training for a triathlon.
“You would have to be an absolute science denier to say that the boys and the girls are of equal strength and of equal speed,” she said.
Christine Stephens, a spokesperson for the school district, said the resolution was a statement of opinion and wouldn’t affect how the district’s athletic programs operate. 
“A board resolution expresses a viewpoint or intent through a formal statement,” Stephens said. “They do not change how the district operates or impose enforceable rules. Regardless of the action taken by the board … the district’s legal responsibility to follow all applicable state and federal laws remain unchanged.”
A 2013 California law requires public schools to ensure that students can participate in all school activities and sports teams that match their gender identity.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office said in a statement to CalMatters that it will monitor the situation and noted that Redlands Unified already has a track record of civil rights complaints.
Last May, Bonta obtained a court order directing the district to address “allegations and complaints of sexual harassment, assault, and abuse of students.” A month earlier, the district reached a $45.5 million settlement of 16 sexual abuse lawsuits from former students.
Kel O’Hara, a senior attorney for Equal Rights Advocates, a San Francisco-based gender justice organization, said that even if the resolution is never enforced, the intention to exclude trans students will be harmful. 
“Discriminating against trans students has really negative implications for their mental health and academic outcomes,” they said.
By framing the resolution as an injunction against boys in girls’ sports, O’Hara said, the board quietly invalidated transgender girls’ identity: “That rhetoric that these are just boys and men trying to get into women’s spaces is not accurate and is so harmful.”
About 3.3% of high school students identified as transgender in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only a small number of students of any gender are elite athletes.
O’Hara said the few transgender students who play school sports are usually looking for teamwork and social connections, rather than seeking competitive advantage. Moreover, the focus on trans girls in women’s sports obscures more prevalent issues, such as unequal funding and resources for girls’ teams, they said.
But transgender athletes have become a political lightning rod. A week earlier Chino Valley Unified School District in Ramona unanimously agreed to ask the Trump administration to intervene against California’s protections for trans students.
And in January Assemblymember Kate Sanchez, a Rancho Santa Margarita Republican who represents Temecula and Murrieta, introduced a bill that aimed to “prohibit a pupil whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls interscholastic sports team.” That bill was killed in committee earlier this month.
Even Gov. Gavin Newsom, who gained support among LGBTQ voters when he issued marriage licenses to same sex couples as San Francisco Mayor 20 years ago,  recently stirred up controversy when he said during a podcast that it’s “deeply unfair” for transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports. 
Assemblymember Corey Jackson, a member of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, denounced the Redlands decision, saying it goes against California law and longstanding policies of the California Interscholastic Federation, which regulates school sports.
“The CIF has long held inclusive policies that align with California’s values and legal standards,” said Jackson, a Moreno Valley Democrat, in a statement to CalMatters. “These recent local decisions, including the one made by Redlands Unified, are not grounded in good faith or meaningful community dialogue. Instead, they are political in nature and designed to sow division and fear in our communities.”
At the Redlands board meeting, Olson addressed audience members who protested the resolution, denying that it expressed prejudice against trans students. 
“I see all of your signs,” she said. “It’s not discrimination whatsoever. It’s about common sense, it’s about safety and it’s about fairness.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/121924-Riverside-Trans-Gender-Athletes-GETTY-AP.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

The administration pledges more opportunities and fewer guarantees, less forgiveness and more consequences. Its 139 executive orders issued since Jan. 20 form an outline of American life as imagined by its most conservative residents, concentrating power in a unitary executive who can force changes as transformative as the New Deal.
The deluge means California, usually the state suing to advance a progressive agenda, now finds itself fighting in court to preserve the status quo – playing defense, not offense. Instead of arguing for higher vehicle emissions standards or broadening the definition of a waterway, the state has filed or joined 16 lawsuits against the Trump administration since Jan. 20 on issues ranging from preserving birthright citizenship to restoring billions of dollars in health and medical grants.
That effort continued on Tuesday with a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s extensive cuts to AmeriCorps.
“We’ve had plenty of instances of California needing to play defense, going back to the Reagan administration,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law. “I think what’s  different from the first term is qualitatively, how much of a disregard they have for the Constitution and the law.” 
Attorney General Rob Bonta, who took office in 2021, said the difference between the first and second Trump administrations has been the speed and pure number of executive orders filed early in his tenure. 
“The comparison with Trump 1.0 shows that it is high volume, high speed (this time),” Bonta said. “We’ve brought a lawsuit more than once a week in the first hundred days, and during Trump 1.0 there were about 120 lawsuits over four years.
“We’re gonna hit around 100 at this rate in two years, so it’s almost double the pace.” 
States and organizations challenging Trump in his first term won close to 70% of their legal battles, albeit a number of them were abandoned when Trump left office in 2021. That encompassed 123 lawsuits over four years, at a cost of about $10 million per year. This time around, state legislators set aside $50 million to cover the state’s legal bills. 
Bonta said he expects the pace of the lawsuits to continue.
“Any time and every time the Trump administration breaks the law, we will take them to court,” Bonta said. “It’s very not normal and also not acceptable that we have an administration that so blatantly, brazenly, frequently and consistently breaks the law.” 
The verbs used in the executive orders promise to “unleash,” “restore” and “reform” various elements of American life, from oil and gas rights to dominion over the ocean. One order targets “the Obama-Biden war on showers.” But the most far-reaching executive orders are the ones in California’s sights, including tariffs, birthright citizenship and voting rights. 
Those at the forefront of conservative legal theory find the executive orders to be a vindication of a textualist, originalist read of the Constitution and an end to the “administrative state” in which regulators and bureaucrats are politically and legally insulated from the decisions they make. 
Conservatives celebrate Trump’s strategy
One of the earliest defenses of the Trump administration’s legal strategy was delivered by Catholic University of America law professor J. Joel Alicea at the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Edwin Meese III Originalism Lecture in March. 
“Over the last three months, we have seen President Trump directly challenge the delegation of power by Congress to administrative agencies and the insulation of power from presidential supervision,” Alicea said. “Contrary to the press’s depiction of such actions, they are hopeful developments for the rule of law.”
The stakes are high, Alicea said, and the opportunity for constitutional originalists is now, after more than a century of progressivism.
“It required two progressive presidents of extraordinary determination and political skill — Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt — to create the administrative state and impose a progressive constitutional and political theory on our structure of government,” Alicea said. “It stands to reason that it will require another president of extraordinary determination and political skill to undo what his predecessors accomplished.”
The presidential administration California is fighting is not the one the state’s lawyers first faced off with in 2017. This time, the Trump administration came better prepared, worked faster and had a more concrete vision for a legal framework, Chemerinsky said. 
“I think that they were so much better prepared,” Chemerinsky said. “And they really had the flood-the-zone mentality.” 
The difference between the first and second Trump administration’s legal strategy is the 2025 version’s contempt for due process and the rule of law, Chemerinsky said. 
“He didn’t try to end birthright citizenship in his first term,” Chemerinsky said. “He didn’t try to put people in a prison in El Salvador in his first term, he didn’t claim the ability to refuse to spend money appropriated by federal statute in his first term, he didn’t claim that he could fire anyone in the executive branch, even if there’s a statute limiting it. 
“He’s taking executive power so much further than the first term, than any president ever has.” 
Where will U.S. Supreme Court draw the line?
In its lawsuit against the Trump administration over its order that voters provide proof of citizenship, California’s attorneys alleged that the executive order interferes with the state’s right to govern itself and usurps Congress’s power to legislate. 
“It bears emphasizing: the President has no power to do any of this,” the lawsuit asserts. “Neither the Constitution nor Congress has authorized the President to impose documentary proof of citizenship requirements or to modify State mail-ballot procedures.”
Much of the fight over that order and the others challenged by California will take place under the shadow of a U.S. Supreme Court that has consistently voted 6-3 to uphold elements of the Trump agenda. 
“I think that the (Supreme Court) ultimately is gonna rule in favor of Trump’s ability to fire members of agencies,” Chemerinsky said. “I think that there’s others that Trump has done, like end birthright citizenship, put people in prison in El Salvador, where I don’t think he’s likely to succeed.”
Chemerinsky said he’s not sure where the Supreme Court could or would draw a line in the sand. 
“I would’ve thought the line would be taking people, putting them in El Salvador and claiming that no court could provide release,” Chemerinsky said. “I still think that’s going to be the red line, but I don’t think it’s gonna be unanimous.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042825-Trump-V-Newsom-Split-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

How California communities discuss and pursue immigration enforcement has a profound impact on vulnerable children.","Guest Commentary written by

Carielle Escalante
Carielle Escalante is an advocate for survivors of gender-based violence. A Public Voices fellow with The OpEd Project, she has over 10 years of experience working to ensure equitable access to services for marginalized communities.


One in 10 children in California has at least one immigrant parent. I was one of those kids. 
I grew up in a home shaped by both hope and uncertainty. My father lived his entire life undocumented, right up until the day he passed. 
He wanted a better life for us, but at that time, there was no viable legal path for him to gain legal status. Even though, as an adult and a legal professional, I became familiar with immigration laws and had access to legal networks and resources, my father didn’t have the same options as others.
In the early 2000s my father was arrested for a traffic violation, which ultimately led to his immigration case, a process he had been afraid to pursue on his own terms. In 2007, when I was a college student, my father’s case led to a voluntary departure, separating him from our family.
The year he was gone felt never-ending. Ultimately, my father decided to return to the U.S. without proper permission. While I don’t condone his decision, I was relieved to have those last few years with him. I often think about how we might have missed out on those memories if he had chosen to follow the law keeping him out of the U.S. The joy of being together outweighed the legal and emotional complications. 
I know this is a bittersweet reality for so many California families forced to make impossible choices.
That said, growing up with the constant fear of my father’s deportation weighed heavily on me. Every time immigration policies changed or I heard a news broadcast about raids, I was terrified. Latino media networks often amplified the fear-mongering rhetoric, making the threat feel even more immediate. I dreaded every immigration court date: Would my father come home? Would we lose him forever to a country he hadn’t seen in decades?
These experiences shaped my perspective, especially early in my career when I worked as a paralegal supporting survivors of domestic violence with restraining orders, custody and immigration matters. I saw the same, familiar patterns of fear and trauma in the families I worked with. Survivors grappled with the threat of deportation on top of the violence they had endured.
Safety planning for these survivors was incredibly complex; the threats extended beyond the individual to their children, who — like me — lived in constant fear of losing a parent. On several occasions, I’ve spoken to survivors whose partner threatened to call immigration authorities to report their illegal status. Having their status weaponized against them, survivors were forced to choose between enduring abuse or facing deportation and being separated from their families.
This sense of fear and the profound impact of misguided immigration policies were tragically highlighted in the recent story of an 11-year-old girl in Texas. She was relentlessly bullied by classmates who threatened to have her parents deported. Unable to cope with the emotional toll, she took her own life. 
Her story underscores the dangerous, potentially life-threatening consequences of the incendiary rhetoric surrounding immigration. These children, who already bear the burden of being part of immigrant families, are further traumatized by the hate and fear that surrounds them. This is the kind of emotional damage I grew up with, and it’s something I continue to see in my work with families facing deportation.
Ethical enforcement of immigration laws requires a deeper conversation about their impact on families, especially children. The trauma caused by family separations goes far beyond the moment. It affects how children grow up, how they view themselves and how they interact with the world around them. The emotional scars linger, shaping entire generations.
As much as I wish my father were still here, I am relieved he isn’t living through today’s political climate. Even with my professional expertise, I couldn’t navigate my father’s case successfully. His illegal return to the U.S. meant he could never pursue legal status. 
Misunderstandings and misinformation about the complexities of immigration law lead many to criticize and scrutinize our undocumented population, without comprehending its devastating effects. 
The reality for undocumented families today is even more difficult and heart-wrenching than it was 20 years ago. For survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking, the fear of deportation compounds the trauma they and their family experience. 
But local communities can make a difference by organizing in support of their undocumented neighbors. This begins with education to counter negative assumptions and judgements. Communities must take accountability for how their actions contribute to harmful rhetoric (and behavior) that profoundly impact vulnerable children. Additionally, by engaging local representatives, we can push for policies that prioritize humane treatment and recognize the devastating effects on children of undocumented immigrants. 
Perhaps first, we all can strive for greater compassion and understanding in the face of draconian reforms that undermine our collective empathy and essential humanity.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/033125-UFW-March-Delano-LV08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 09:08:16.642861

(Courtesy of Catholic Community Services)It takes Aden Batar, the director of migration and refugee services at Catholic Community Services, at least a couple of minutes just to list all of the ways the refugee resettlement program he runs assists refugees coming to Utah. The program’s goal has always been clear — to allow refugees to reach self-sufficiency amid extraordinary circumstances.
The initiative has been alive for more than 45 years in the state, but after the Trump administration took charge this year, it was left without its most substantial funding source, federal funding — at least temporarily.
The organization announced on Monday it will continue operating with the help of private donations amounting to more than $1.5 million. That’s more than half of what the federal government funded before President Donald Trump signed an order suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and freezing resettlement funding.

Utahns moved fast after Catholic Community Services announced in early April it was winding down its refugee resettlement program, which annually assists about 600 families in securing housing, jobs, school enrollment, health care, and provides mentorship to teach American laws, English, and other immigration resources.
“The families were coming from all over the world in every war that happened in the world, like, for example, the most recent war in Ukraine, Afghanistan, in Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Congo, many parts of the world,” Batar said.

If the organization is able to raise $1 million more, it would allow them to transition to a smaller, self-sustaining program to keep on working on the mission for the next four years, Batar said.
“We’re going to continue to support the families that we have that have come the last two years, and we’re going to continue to support the families by providing the necessary services that they need,” Batar said. “We want them to keep their housing. We want them to have a job so they can pay their bills.”
The work of his office starts after the Department of Homeland Security grants entry to migrants fleeing conflict, providing the essentials, like a furnished home in anticipation of their arrival and food and later giving them tools to thrive in the country. 
“While the program will operate at a reduced capacity, its core services—and the impact on the lives of those we serve—remain as vital as ever,” the organization wrote in a blog post. “This transformation ensures we can uphold our mission while adapting to a changing national landscape.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Even with the abrupt freeze in funding, the organization hasn’t turned anyone away. However, the program still took a big hit and had to lay off 50% of its staff. 
It’s still uncertain whether the Trump administration will resume the admissions of refugees, with the executive order issued on Jan. 20 stating that it “suspends the (U.S. Refugee Admissions Program) until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States.”
Within 90 days of the order, however, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State are required to submit a report to the president advising on whether to bring back the refugee admissions program.
But, that deadline already passed on April 20, and Catholic Community Services can’t wait for the funding to come back to keep its doors open, Batar said.
There are roughly 70,000 refugees in Utah and the majority of them went through this program, he added. 
“They are all productive members of our society. They successfully integrated into our community. They have jobs, they have businesses, they’re doing really well. So the program is a life-saving program, and we would like this program to continue,” he said. “We are appealing to our administration to open this program again, and so we could serve as many refugees as we can.”
The organization is also asking the community to help raise the funds to continue the critical services that have helped thousands of refugees settle in the state for decades, Batar said, and to Trump to look at the issue from a compassionate point of view, and to allow the admission of new refugees in the country.
“We are here to help them. Our community wants to help them,” he said. “But the administration has to allow the refugees to come.”

The Alabama Department of Mental Health, which provides mental health care services in the state, will get a $4.7 million increase (2%) to $244 million. The Legislature cut the funding from Ivey’s recommendation by $3.7 million.
But senators also appeared to want to send a message to the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles, which has drawn mounting criticism from Democratic and Republican senators over low parole rates and what senators consider a lack of responsiveness to their questions about the parole process. The Senate cut the board’s funding from $94.5 million to $90.6 million, a 4.1% decrease. 
In addition, Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, added an amendment to make funding for the Board of Pardons & Paroles conditional on the board developing parole release guidelines. The amendment passed on a 27-0 vote.
“What they do, as y’all know, they adopt guidelines. Those are supposed to be updated and revised. They have not done that,” he said.
The board has faced backlash after parole rates declined significantly after 2017, when members granted parole to about 54% of applicants. The rates fell as low as 7% at times, according to an analysis by the ACLU of Alabama in 2023, but rebounded to slightly more than 20% within the past year.
The Senate also passed HB 185, also sponsored by Reynolds, which would appropriate $50 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to the Department of Finance and provide over $12.6 million to the Unified Judicial System.
“This bill is supplemental monies just taking federal money and appropriating it,” Albritton said.
The House concurred with the changes late Tuesday evening, sending the bill to Gov. Kay Ivey. 
The Senate also concurred with House changes to SB 112, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, a nearly $10 billion 2026 Education Trust Fund budget (ETF). 
The House changes added $17.6 million to the budget, bringing it to a 6% increase over the 2025 ETF budget. The budget does not contain pay raises for teachers in the 2025-26 fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. But it includes a $99.2 million increase for the Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Plan, as well as funding for workman’s compensation for education employees and paid parental leave. 
The Senate also concurred with the ETF supplemental funding bills, including SB 113, also sponsored by Orr, a $524 million 2025 supplemental appropriation for education that passed the House with an amendment changing language to clarify dual enrollment programs funding.
The Senate also concurred with House changes to SB 111, sponsored by Orr, which would appropriate $375 million over three years to implement changes to the state’s school funding formula. 
The House added an additional $80 million from the Education Opportunity Reserve Fund to the Creating Hope and Opportunity for Our Students’ Education (CHOOSE) Act Fund, a voucher-like program that gives tax credits for non-public school spending, including private school tuition. The first-year cost estimate will go from $100 million to $180 million, an 80% increase. Over two-thirds of applicants to the program are already in private school or are homeschooled.

Joe Lombardo and NV Energy CEO Doug Cannon at the utility'sDry Lake Solar Project north of Moapa. (Photo courtesy NV Energy)NV Energy is shrinking its carbon footprint and staying ahead of a state mandate to produce half of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, the utility announced earlier this month in its annual report on efforts to comply with Nevada’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, a mandate not only codified in law but enshrined in the state constitution. 
NV Energy announced that 47% of the electricity it sold in 2024 was from renewable sources, far exceeding the required renewable portfolio standard (RPS) threshold of 34% for 2024, and just under the 50% goal set for 2030. 
“These renewable resources provide a fuel-free energy source reducing customer energy costs and also eliminate carbon emissions to help improve the environment,” says the company’s news release.  
But some critics complain consumers aren’t getting the full picture. They say NV Energy is relying on legislative loopholes baked into the equation –  renewable energy credits that boost the utility’s RPS results without the corresponding reduction in carbon emissions. The credits were designed to ease the transition of electric utilities from carbon-emitting fossil fuels to cleaner, greener energy sources. 
Absent the credits, NV Energy produced 29% of its electricity from renewable sources last year, which is below the mandated RPS of 34% for 2024. 
NV Energy did not respond to requests for comment.
Nevada Consumer Advocate Ernest Figueroa, in a 2023 filing with the Public Utilities Commission, alleged NV Energy is fudging the percentage of electricity sales it reports from renewable energy sources, and would not meet its requirement if not for accounting practices that are being phased out. 
“It is the statutory and regulatory loopholes in the accounting for Nevada PECs (Porfolio Enegy Credits) that allow the utilities to claim much higher percentages of PEC compliance,” the Consumer Advocate asserted in the filing.
“Like all other energy providers in the state, current Nevada law requires that energy providers report energy credits, not an energy standard, as part of the RPS,” a spokesperson for the utility said in 2023. 
In 2023, NV Energy executive Jimmy Daghlian told Clark County commissioners that hitting the 50% renewable threshold by 2030 “is going to be a challenge.”
“I’ll be honest,” said Daghlian, vice president of renewable energy, during an update on the utility’s efforts to transition away from fossil fuels..“We’re seeing a lot of the costs go up. Battery prices have doubled in the last two years. Solar panel prices have gone up 40 to 50%.”
“While NV Energy technically meets its renewable targets, the numbers are inflated by older credits and accounting tactics, not by delivering more real renewable energy to customers,” Nevada Conservation League Executive Director Kristee Watson said via email. “At the same time, NV Energy is doubling down on fossil fuels by building new gas plants, which undermines the cost savings, economic benefits, and public health improvements Nevadans should be seeing.”
Until last year, NV Energy was permitted to use energy efficiency savings, known as demand-side management, to comply with up to 10% of its annual Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). As of this year, no credit for energy efficiency savings is allowed under state law. 
Three other credits remain available to NV Energy to demonstrate compliance with RPS mandates:

Behind-the-meter credits represent renewable energy created by customers, such as rooftop solar panels; 
Station Usage credits reflect the energy consumed in some operations of geothermal facilities; and
The solar multiplier, which credits NV Energy almost 2.5 hours of credit for each hour generated by a photovoltaic system installed before 2016. 

“The Rube Goldberg-esque models used to calculate credits depend significantly on purchased credits from other companies in the solar/geothermal business, many of which will be subsidized by the construction of the Greenlink project,” says Boulder City resident Fred Voltz, a close observer of the electric utility. Greenlink, which has ballooned in cost from just under $2.5 billion to more than $4.2 billion, is designed to transport renewable energy generated in remote areas of the state. 
Greenlink’s price tag is likely to increase even more, given President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on products and materials from Mexico, Canada, China and other nations.
Obstacles on the path to a carbon-free future, according to Voltz, include the failure of battery storage technology to extend beyond four hours, and a water shortage that ensures “no new U.S. hydropower projects of any consequence” will be built in the foreseeable future. 
Less than a week before a massive blackout hit Spain and other European nations earlier this month, Spain’s electrical grid ran entirely on renewable energy for the first time on a weekday. 
The cause of the outage, which is still under investigation, may stem from a loss of power generation, likely from solar plants, resulting in instability in the system, experts say. 
“As we learn by events just how essential a steady electricity supply is to modern living, it is regrettable to see the risk taking engaged in by those relentlessly pushing for renewable energy without concern for its down sides,” says Voltz, adding the grid failure in Spain should give pause to renewable energy enthusiasts. “Neither the purchase of renewable credits nor the actual solar projects NVE spends ratepayers’ money on to satisfy the government-fabricated market for renewable energy will change the need for conventional generating capacity to keep the grid stable and energized when renewables are not producing energy.”
It’s always sunny in Las Vegas 
In Southern Nevada, where the sun shines an average of 294 days a year, and where until recently, the federal government subsidized the development of green energy, solar is the dominant player. 

Gemini, a contracted 690-megawatt solar facility with 380 megawatts of integrated battery storage, began operating in March of last year, NV Energy said in its news release on the RPS; 
Dry Lake Solar, a 150-megwatt facility with battery storage, opened a year ago; and 
NV Energy’s 400-megawatt Sierra Solar in Northern Nevada is expected to begin battery storage next summer, with solar service beginning in 2027.  

The global supply chain for solar largely originates in China. Tiny photovoltaic cells that are imported from China and crafted by American companies into solar panels, are now subject to tariffs totaling 84%, according to a trade publication. Chinese companies have moved operations to south-east Asian nations in an effort to minimize tariffs.
The Trump aministration’s Golden Era of Energy Development secretarial order from the Department of Energy seeks to “Advance energy addition, not subtraction,” a policy at odds with the 38 states that adopted renewable energy standards or goals. 
“Great attention has been paid to the pursuing (sic) of a net-zero carbon future,” says the order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “Net-zero policies raise energy costs for American families and businesses, threaten the reliability of our energy system, and undermine our energy and national security. They have also achieved precious little in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.”
The Trump administration is seeking to limit the ability of states “to adopt climate mitigation strategies (including cap and trade and renewable portfolio standards) and by taking new authority to permit development of reserves of fossil fuels and other minerals critical to the energy space,” says an article from the National Law Review, adding the actions “portend radical changes to the balance between state and federal energy regulation if carried through.” 
“If they can withhold congressionally appropriated research funds for universities because they don’t like their policies with regard to free speech on their campuses, what else might they do?” San Francisco attorney Nico van Aelstyn wondered in a recent interview. “Withhold Medicaid funding to states where they don’t like their renewable energy standards?”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dry-lake-solar-project-NVEnergy-1024x626.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

Sister Rosetta Tharpe, known as the “godmother of rock ‘n’ roll,” made history by becoming the first gospel artist to rocket up the R&B charts with her gospel hit, “Strange Things Happening Every Day.” In so doing, she paved the way for a strange new sound. 
“Rock ‘n’ roll was bred between the church and the nightclubs in the soul of a queer Black woman in the 1940s named Sister Rosetta Tharpe,” National Public Radio wrote. “She was there before Elvis, Little Richard and Johnny Cash swiveled their hips and strummed their guitars. It was Tharpe, the godmother of rock ‘n’ roll, who turned this burgeoning musical style into an international sensation.” 
Born in Arkansas, the musical prodigy grew up in Mississippi in the Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal denomination that welcomed all-out music and praise. By age 6, she was performing alongside her mandolin-playing mother in a traveling evangelistic troupe. By the mid-1920s, she and her mother had joined the Great Migration to Chicago, where they continued performing. 
“As Tharpe grew up, she began fusing Delta blues, New Orleans jazz and gospel music into what would become her signature style,” NPR wrote. 
Her hard work paid off when she joined the Cotton Club Revue in New York City. She was only 23. Before the end of 1938, she recorded gospel songs for Decca, including “Rock Me,” which became a huge hit and made her an overnight sensation. Little Richard, Aretha Franklin and Jerry Lee Lewis have all cited her as an influence. 
“Sister Rosetta played guitar like the men I was listening to, only smoother, with bigger notes,” said singer-songwriter Janis Ian. “And of course, personally, any female player was a big influence on me, because there were so few.” 
After hearing her successors on the radio, Tharpe was quoted as saying, “Oh, these kids and rock and roll — this is just sped up rhythm and blues. I’ve been doing that forever.” 
On the eve of a 1973 recording session, she died of a stroke and was buried in an unmarked grave. In the decades that followed, she finally began to receive the accolades that had eluded her in life. 
In 2007, she was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, and money was raised for her headstone. Eleven years later, she was inducted into the Rock and Rock Hall of Fame. 
“She was, and is,” NPR concluded, “an unmatched artist.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/06001213/April30-FeatImage-Sister_Rosetta_Tharpe_1938_publicity_photo_with_guitar.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

SB 118, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, expands the list of crimes that will not be eligible for bond to solicitation, attempt and conspiracy to commit murder; and discharging a weapon into an occupied dwelling. Alabama voters approved the original law in 2022.
“This is up to the judge to make the determination, it is not automatic,” said Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, who carried the legislation in the House.

Prior to approval of Aniah’s Law, judges could only deny bond to individuals charged with capital murder. The amendment expanded that to include other serious crimes such as murder, kidnapping and rape.
The amendment was named after Aniah Blanchard, a Southern Union Community College student who went missing in October 2019 and whose body was found a month later. Ibraheem Yazeed, who was charged with capital murder in Blanchard’s death, had been charged with several violent crimes but released on bail months before Blanchard was killed. Yazeed is still awaiting trial.
Aniah’s Law allows prosecutors to request a hearing to determine if a defendant should be denied bond for committing a violent Class A felony such as rape and murder. But judges may still grant bond after hearing prosecution’s claims.
The bill passed 87-0 with 16 abstentions. The constitutional amendment must be approved by Alabama voters. 
The House also passed SB 119, also sponsored by Barfoot, that makes discharging a weapon into an occupied dwelling a Class A felony, up from a Class B felony. That is punishable by 10-99 years in prison and fines up to $60,000. 
Simpson said that most of those crimes come from people using a firearm modified with a Glock switch, which the Legislature banned earlier this session. 
“You can’t control what it does. You can maybe have a grasp over the first bullet that comes out, but the gun just goes off,” Simpson said.
The bill passed 66-0 with 37 abstentions. It will go to voters for approval.

The chamber adopted a committee substitute that only allowed schools where ELL students make up 15% or more of its average daily membership (ADM) to have their classification adjusted. 
“That concern came from school systems under 15, saying it wasn’t covered. And I agree, every school needs to be able to utilize the formula,” Colvin said.
But the first amendment by Rep. Danny Crawford, R-Athens, allows any schools to adjust their classification regardless of how many ELL students the school has. 
“So the fairest thing to do is to treat everybody the same and not have winners and losers,” Crawford said.
The second amendment by Rep. Chris Blackshear, R-Smiths Station, changed the effective date to the 2026-27 school year, instead of the 2025-26 school year. He said that classifications are determined by the ADM from the previous year.
“So all this amendment does is make sure that if this piece of legislation passes, it will not impact the 2025-2026 athletic calendar year,” Blackshear said. 
The third and final amendment by Rep. Leigh Hulsey, R-Helena, requires the governing body of the Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSAA) to have two additional non-voting members from the Legislature. The Speaker of the House will appoint a member from the minority party and the Senate President Pro Tempore will appoint a member of the majority party to the AHSAA board.
“I’m just trying to start getting a little bit of oversight there,” Hulsey said.
Rep. Ginny Shaver, R-Leesburg, said a school in her district dissolved their varsity football program because the school was classified as a 5A school when she said it should have been 2A. She said the number of ELL students in the district changed the classification.
“My schools there are the poster children for exactly what you’re talking about,” she said. “It’s a very big concern, there’s a lot of injury and low participation. That’s why they’ve not been able to have a varsity program for quite some time now.”
Crossville High School in DeKalb County has not had a varsity football team since 2022, but is set to return in 2026, according to the county’s local news outlet the Times-Journal. 
Heath Harmon, executive director of the AHSAA, said in a statement that he is disappointed by the legislation because it would discourage ELL students from participating in sports in the name of keeping a lower classification. He also said the third amendment on the legislation would make the AHSAA the only private association with mandated political representation.
“We strive to keep politics out of the boardroom and focus on doing what is best for all student athletes,” he wrote in the statement. “As an Association, we are committed to supporting all member schools in all sports in addition to promoting participation. This bill is in direct opposition to those commitments.”
Rep. Alan Baker, R-Brewton, was the lone “no” vote on the legislation. He said in an interview that he does not believe the Legislature should be involved in the AHSAA’s policies.
“I don’t feel the Legislature should be getting involved in the Alabama High School Athletic Association’s policies no more than I feel Congress should be involved in the NCAA and their policies as well,” he said. “It’s sort of a standard I feel at both levels of government.”
The bill goes to the Senate. There are four legislative days left in the 2025 session.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)“Drill baby drill” was a favorite mantra of candidate Donald Trump last year. And following his inauguration, the White House proclaimed Trump’s “energy dominance” policies were “unleashing American energy.” 
Trump’s belief was/is that increased energy production, especially oil, or “liquid gold,” as Trump calls it, would lead to lower gas prices, in turn contributing to lower prices for other goods.
Occasional short-term spikes notwithstanding, the price of gas has held more or less steady for several months, and is currently roughly about the same as it was on Election Day and Inauguration Day. The price of gas is not projected to rise notably for the rest of this year and into the next. 
But that’s not because of “drill baby drill” or “energy dominance” policies. It’s because the impact of Trump’s tariffs will mean “less oil demand growth,” according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration outlook published earlier this month.
Unfortunately, the same trade policies that will likely keep gas prices in check are also expected to inflate prices of many other goods and services.
Trump’s tariffs and their accompanying economic uncertainty and predictions of a slowing or shrinking economy have already raised one price substantially: The price of an ounce of gold.
Nevada mines by far more gold than any other state. If Nevada were a country, it would be the world’s fifth largest producer of gold, after China, Russia, Australia and Canada.
Gold has long been viewed by investors as a safe haven when economic disturbances or their likelihood rattle markets. Gold is seen by many as a strong hedge against inflation, as its value increases while the purchasing power of a dollar decreases.
Actual gold did not garner nearly as much attention as “liquid gold” from Trump during his presidential campaign. But his policies, albeit unintentionally, have had a tremendous impact on the commodity. In mid-March the price of an ounce of gold exceeded $3,000 for the first time ever.
As of late Tuesday, the price was $3,327.
Gold prices also spiked during the economic upheaval and uncertainty of the pandemic. Nevada state legislators, during a crisis special session wracked with budget cutting, took advantage of the gold mining industry’s countercyclical financial performance, and passed legislation by which the mining industry paid a portion of its primary mining tax a year in advance. 
During the Great Recession, another period when the price of gold rose sharply, the industry similarly pre-paid taxes as state lawmakers were struggling to cope with budget cuts.
Amid predictions of a recession and already-sagging economic indicators, state lawmakers and the governor are facing the prospects of potential budget cuts again this year.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trump-black-maga-hat-2-getty.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

(Photo: Getty Images)Let’s say you’re a general manager at a fast food restaurant. You work 55 hours a week — not at all uncommon in the field — and earn a salary that comes out to less than $13 an hour.
Last year, a federal rule would have made you eligible for a raise.
Under rules set by the Biden administration, your employer would either have to increase your salary or pay you overtime for those extra 15 hours a week you spent working instead of being with your family. But now, unless the Trump administration acts to protect that raise from one of Trump’s own judges, that raise will vanish.
President Trump’s erratic policies have created turmoil in our economy and put workers on uncertain footing. To help working families, Trump should defend this Biden administration rule, which restores and expands overtime pay to more than four million workers.
Overtime regulations are a cornerstone of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the 1938 law that guarantees a minimum wage and overtime for most workers. Strong overtime protections helped build America’s middle class and ensure that workers aren’t overworked and underpaid. They also create jobs and help families spend more time together.
While most workers get time and a half for working more than 40 hours a week, some workers aren’t legally entitled to overtime protections, including executive, administrative, and professional employees.
Back in 1938, this exemption was premised on the idea that these workers were paid much more than most hourly workers. But now these workers also include many retail store assistant managers, executive assistants, and human resource managers who are paid as little as $36,000 per year — about $13 per hour — and work 50-plus hours a week with no extra pay.
Figuring out overtime eligibility has been the Labor Department’s job for more than 80 years. The threshold needs to be raised regularly — otherwise it will end up like the $7.25/hour minimum wage, which is nowhere near as effective as when it was set over 15 years ago.
Last year, Biden’s Labor Department raised the salary threshold to $43,888 — and had planned to raise that again to $58,656 earlier this year.
But in November, a Trump-appointed judge in the Eastern District of Texas vacated the entire Biden overtime rule, including the 2024 increase. Because of this court decision, one million workers actually lost overtime protections — and three million more are in limbo. Biden’s Labor Department appealed that decision, but didn’t have time to defend its position before Trump took office.
The fate of this overtime appeal and other challenges to the rule now rests with the Trump administration. By May 6, the administration must tell the court if it will defend or abandon the rule. Millions of workers’ paychecks hang in the balance.
If anything, the first few months of the Trump administration has shown us that the White House won’t shy away from a legal battle if they care enough. Unfortunately, none of those legal battles are about fighting for working families. Here’s a chance for President Trump to show he cares about working families as much as he cares about slashing federal jobs and imposing tariffs.
This rule doesn’t need new legislation. It doesn’t require a budget fight. All it takes is defending a raise that millions of workers have already earned. President Trump says he wants to help working families. Here’s his chance to prove it.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1778173928-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

By failing to rectify its longstanding systemic indifference to non-native English speakers, the state has dismissed the opportunity to provide critical information to English language learners, sign language users, and those who rely on plain language for comprehension.


At the heart of this issue was Senate Bill 955, a bill I authored and proposed which was introduced in the 2025 legislative session by Sen. MD Rahman. The bill sought to establish policies ensuring that individuals with limited English proficiency could access information and public services through translation and interpretation resources. It was a necessary step toward creating an Office of Language Access, a centralized entity that would oversee and coordinate language accessibility efforts statewide. 
However, despite its potential to serve over 400,000 residents whose primary language is not English, the bill failed to make it out of the Government Administration and Elections Committee.

Doris Maldonado Mendez
The failure of SB 955 is more than just a legislative setback; it is a denial of fundamental rights. Language access is not a privilege—it is a necessity for equitable participation in civic life. Without it, thousands of Connecticut residents, throughout their lifespan, are left without the ability to engage with government services, healthcare providers, legal systems, and educational institutions in a meaningful way.
This decision reflects a troubling trend of information privilege and linguistic exclusion, reinforcing barriers for non-English speakers and sign language users. It is a stark contrast to the principles of inclusivity and equal opportunity that Connecticut claims to uphold. The absence of a dedicated Office of Language Access means that residents will continue to face fragmented and inconsistent language services, further marginalizing communities that already struggle to navigate bureaucratic systems.
For years, advocates have fought to correct this injustice, working tirelessly to ensure that Connecticut recognizes the rights of ALL residents, regardless of their linguistic background. The failure to pass SB 955 is not just a rejection of a bill—it is a rejection of the people it was meant to serve.
As Connecticut moves forward, it must reconsider its stance on language access. The state cannot afford to ignore the voices of those who have been systematically excluded. The fight for equitable information  and language access is far from over, and it is imperative that lawmakers revisit this issue with the urgency and commitment it deserves.
The question remains: Will Connecticut continue to turn its back on its diverse communities, or will it finally take action to ensure that language access is no longer a barrier to essential services? The answer will define the state’s commitment to civil rights for years to come.

Mike Kehoe’s desk purports to allow public schools to hire spiritual chaplains.
However, if one reads the text of the legislation, it’s actually just pushing chaplains in name only.
The bill already cleared the Senate and House committees, thus just needing support from the full House. As a Baptist minister and the father of a public school child, I hope lawmakers will recognize the bill remains fundamentally flawed.
A chaplain is not just a pastor or a Sunday School teacher or a street preacher shouting through a bullhorn. This is a unique role, often in a secular setting that requires a chaplain to assist with a variety of religious traditions and oversee a number of administrative tasks.
That’s why the U.S. military, Missouri Department of Corrections, and many other institutions include standards for chaplains like meeting educational requirements, having past experience, and receiving an endorsement from a religious denominational body.
In contrast, the legislation on school “chaplains” originally sponsored by Republican Sens. Rusty Black and Mike Moon includes no requirements for who can be chosen as a paid or volunteer school “chaplain.” Someone chosen to serve must pass a background check and cannot be a registered sex offender, but those are baseline expectations for anyone serving in our schools.
While a good start, simply passing a background check does mean one is qualified to serve as a chaplain.
The only other stipulation in the bill governing who can serve as a school “chaplain” is that they must be a member of a religious group that is eligible to endorse chaplains for the military. Senators added this amendment to prevent atheists or members of the Satanic Temple from qualifying as a school “chaplain.”
Members of the Satanic Temple testified in a Senate Education Committee hearing that they opposed the bill but would seek to fill the positions if created, which apparently spooked lawmakers. That discriminatory amendment, however, does nothing to ensure a chosen “chaplain” is actually qualified. For instance, the Episcopal Church is on the military’s list of endorsing organizations. Just because some Episcopalians meet the military’s requirements for chaplains and can serve does not mean all Episcopalians should be considered for a chaplaincy position.
While rejecting this unnecessary bill is the best option, if lawmakers really want to create a school chaplaincy program, they must significantly alter the bill to create real chaplain standards. Lawmakers could look to other states for inspiration on how to fix it.
For instance, Arizona lawmakers a few weeks ago passed a similar bill — except their legislation includes numerous requirements to limit who can serve as a chaplain. Among the various standards in the Arizona bill is that individuals chosen to serve as a school chaplain must hold a Bachelor’s degree, have at least two years of experience as a chaplain, have a graduate degree in counseling or theology or have at least seven years of chaplaincy experience and have official standing in a local religious group.
Rather than passing a pseudo-chaplaincy bill, Missouri lawmakers should add similar provisions.
The Arizona bill also includes other important guardrails missing in Missouri’s bill that will help protect the rights of students and their parents. Arizona lawmakers created provisions to require written parental consent for students to participate in programs provided by a chaplain. Especially given the lack of standards for who can serve as a school “chaplain,” the absence of parental consent forms remains especially troubling.
Additionally, Missouri’s school “chaplain” bill includes no prohibition against proselytization. This is particularly concerning since the conservative Christian group who helped craft the bill in Missouri and other states — and who sent a representative to Jefferson City to testify for the bill in a committee hearing — has clearly stated their goal is to bring unconstitutional government prayer back into public schools.
To be clear, the U.S. Supreme Court did not kick prayer out of schools. As long as there are math tests, there will be prayer in schools. What the justices did was block the government from writing a prayer and requiring students to listen to it each day. Such government coercion violated the religious liberty rights of students, parents, and houses of worship, so the justices rightly prohibited it. Using “chaplains” to return to such coercion is wrong and should be opposed.
There are many proposals and initiatives lawmakers could focus on in these waning weeks of the session if they really want to improve public education. There are numerous ways they could work to better support our teachers and assist our students. Attempting to turn public schools into Sunday Schools is not the answer.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/churchphoto-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”













It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state.


– David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst





Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 ‘Generational change’ to taxes

While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

Pope Francis called on all of us to bring mercy, dignity and humanity to our criminal legal systems.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tom Dalton: Pope Francis said God will judge us on this.","This commentary is by Tom Dalton of Essex Junction, executive director of Vermonters for Criminal Justice Reform. He is an attorney and a licensed alcohol and drug counselor.Pope Francis, who died on April 21 at the age of 88, often visited prisons where he spoke with the imprisoned and washed their feet. He was setting an example of humility and service, as Jesus did when he washed the feet of his disciples. And he was offering those who have done wrong — all of us — an outward symbol of our universal potential for spiritual cleansing and redemption.Notably, he didn’t limit this potential for redemption to “misdemeanors” or “non-violent offenses.” He did not exempt violent crimes or other listed offenses from the possibility of rehabilitation and second chances. He taught that it is immoral and wrong to simply lock people up and throw away the key, even for the most serious crimes.Pope Francis said the death penalty “does not constitute a deterrent, nor render justice to victims, but only fuels the thirst for vengeance.” In 2018, Pope Francis revised the Catechism of the Catholic Church to declare the death penalty unacceptable under all circumstances. He called for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide.Pope Francis also condemned life imprisonment, describing it as a “hidden death penalty” that wrongly deprives people of hope. He emphasized the importance of hope and rehabilitation within the criminal legal system. He said that “no one can change their life if they don’t see a horizon.”Pope Francis said that God will judge us on how we treat justice-involved people.Vermont abolished the death penalty in 1972. In 2020, the Vermont Senate passed legislation eliminating sentences of life without the possibility of parole for all crimes except aggravated murder. That bill was championed by the long-time Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the late Senator Dick Sears, and by the current Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth. The bill was sidelined by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic before it could be considered by the Vermont House of Representatives.Life sentences and life without parole sentences often bear the stain of racial bias. Sentences of life without any possibility of parole effectively take the lives of more Black men, women and youth across the United States than deaths at the hands of police or via capital punishment combined. If we want social justice, we must address this issue. And as Pope Francis himself pointed out, our knowledge about wrongful convictions, revealed by advances in DNA testing, makes use of this kind of extreme sentence especially problematic.The moral leadership of our faith leaders, the statistical evidence relating to racial bias in sentencing, the DNA evidence relating to wrongful convictions and our understanding of the human capacity for change should alert us the critical importance of building in opportunities for parole consideration or other “second look” mechanisms — especially in life sentences. After an individual has paid a significant penalty for the harm they caused by serving decades of incarceration, we should give that individual and their case another look to determine how best to serve the interests of justice going forward.Pope Francis called on all of us to bring mercy, dignity and humanity to our criminal legal systems. We can help honor his life, his work and his memory by heeding the call.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tom Dalton: Pope Francis said God will judge us on this.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

Does history not tell us that any of us can be next, unless we protest right here, right now?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mary Dingee Fillmore: The Constitution is on trial in Vermont right now.","This commentary is by Mary Dingee Fillmore of Burlington. She is author of the award-winning “An Address in Amsterdam,” an historical novel about a young Jewish woman who joins the anti-Nazi resistance, and speaker for the Vermont Humanities Council about “resistance then and now.”“The inevitability of justice and a deep belief in democracy” — these are welcome words, especially from imprisoned Mohsen Mahdawi when he spoke to Sen. Peter Welch. Mahdawi is the beloved Upper Valley resident snatched by ICE agents when he reported for his citizenship hearing April 14. At least he is jailed here in Vermont, unlike Fulbright Scholar Rümeysa Öztürk, who was abducted in Massachusetts on March 25, then hopscotched to New Hampshire and Vermont on her way to a notorious detention center in Louisiana. The video of her “arrest” showed the 30 year old female doctoral candidate marched off in handcuffs after her screams were ignored. Despite being jailed in inhumane conditions and denied medical care, visiting legislators were “struck by her unwavering spirit.”Will the courts — and you and I — vindicate Mahdawi’s faith in our system, and Öztürk’s spirit? Our brave little state is the front line of the battle to protect the Constitution, especially freedom of speech and due process of law. The international press is a rare sight outside our Burlington courthouse. But they understand that the Mahdawi and Öztürk cases will determine whether our constitutional rights are still alive.Fully 250 years ago this month, Americans rebelled against tyranny and the arbitrary use of power — and fought for the very liberties which are at issue in these cases.Both Öztürk and Mahdawi are petitioning for habeas corpus, a concept rooted in 15th-century England to protect people from unjust detention by the King. Öztürk’s case will be heard May 6 before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.  We can hope she will eventually be returned to Vermont.Meanwhile, Mahdawi’s case was scheduled for April 30, partly to give the government time to review 94 letters of support, “unprecedented” in Judge Crawford’s experience. Öztürk’s are equally impressive, including from the president of Tufts University. Both have prominent Jewish supporters.These cases are being tried in at least four courts: the U.S. District Court of Vermont, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the court of public opinion, and the hearts of the petitioners. The Trump administration is watching. Is the Bill of Rights one of the “things” they will “break fast?” Or will the people and the courts stop them?What are we Vermonters willing to allow within our borders? Will we permit an unidentified vehicle to whiz through the night with a shackled woman whose only “crime” is co-authoring a column? When a local resident attends his citizenship hearing, are we willing for him to be handcuffed and imprisoned based on the vaguest accusations? Surely not in the state of “Freedom and Unity.”No matter what our politics are, constitutional rights are the foundation of our democracy. That’s part of why the Hartland church was packed with people who want to help their neighbor Mohsen. Let us make such a public outcry that the administration must stop these outrages against our Constitution. Contact the governor and our legislators, respond to the press coverage, share concerns on social media, come to the courthouse, protest and organize to activate others; and contact the White House, Todd Lyons at ICE and Kristi Noem at Homeland Security.If you think they won’t listen, or doubt that justice is inevitable, speak up if only to let Rümeysa Öztürk and Mohsen Mahdawi know you care. In an interview with CBS News the day before his detention, Mahdawi said “I believe in the American people and their ability to see and to feel.”Beyond our concern for these two individuals, if we permit them to be treated this way, won’t American citizens be next? The Trump administration first echoed early 20th-century anti-immigrant hatred, deporting “the worst of the worst” alleged gang members. Now we are at the other end of the spectrum. RRümeysa Öztürk is among the Fulbright Scholars invited here from around the world because they have exceptional contributions to make. The testimony about peace advocate Mohsen Mahdawi is equally glowing.Notice Trump’s progression from deporting “gang members” to threatening writers, scholars and intellectuals. Now he says he’d “love to” ship “homegrown” prisoners to El Salvador, a country whose president says he is incapable of returning a prisoner who was sent there in error. All of these people, and we ourselves, have rights under the U.S. Constitution, as long as we are willing to defend them. James Baldwin wrote to an imprisoned friend, “We must fight for your life as though it were our own—which it is—and render impassable with our bodies the corridor to the gas chamber. For, if they take you in the morning, they will be coming for us that night.”Does history not tell us that any of us can be next, unless we protest right here, right now?Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mary Dingee Fillmore: The Constitution is on trial in Vermont right now.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 07:02:23.692946

Individual choices add up. And just as importantly, individual voices influence public will.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Daniel Wick: The climate crisis is here and Burlington cannot wait around.","This commentary is by Daniel Wick. He grew up in Burlington and is now a student at Syracuse University, studying for a degree in fashion design.For years, Burlington has taken pride in its status as one of America’s greenest cities. Being the first city in America to be powered by 100% renewable energy, as well as working toward becoming a net-zero energy city, we have been deemed a role model to other cities with similar climate goals. While it may seem like we’re living in a climate utopia, recent summers have told a different story. Being born and raised in Burlington, I remember summers that felt steady and familiar — long bike rides on the waterfront, quiet swims in a lake so clear you could see the stones beneath your feet, and the hum of cicadas rising with the heat. I remember spending entire days basking at the lake, never having to think twice about the quality of the water. Now, these memories are overshadowed by smoke-filled skies from Canadian wildfires, washed away by historic rates of flooding and clouded by persistent blooms of blue-green algae. The climate crisis isn’t on the horizon; it’s already here.Our efforts towards mitigating our own city’s contributions to climate change may be impressive, but they don’t grant us immunity to natural disasters.In fact, Burlington ranks the highest among Vermont cities for overall climate risk. Our proximity to water, older infrastructure, and seasonal weather extremes make us particularly vulnerable to flooding and other disruptions.People all over the state are still recuperating from the detrimental flooding. that has occurred over the past two years. If we don’t act now, disasters like these will continue to harm not just the people’s homes, farms, and businesses, but our economy as a whole and our ability to properly function as a state. So, where do we go from here?First, we need a shift in our tone. While, yes, a scarily disproportionate amount of people in our country (even our president) are in denial about the presence of a climate crisis, a comparable barrier to our progress in mitigating it is the negative trend of discouragement. Although many people are fired up to do their part, the severity and extent of climate change all too often leave people overwhelmed, confused or unsure of where to start.That is why it is so important that we speak with intent when discussing climate change in our day-to-day conversations. Instead of looking at the topic from the standpoint of doom and guilt, we need to focus our words more so on agency, opportunity and community. A call for action is imperative.Secondly, we need to veer away from the harmful myth that climate change is merely a federal or global issue. Especially given the current state of our federal government, it would be ill-advised to allow the higher-ups to dictate the future of our planet. While national and global action is essential, having a mindset of powerlessness at the individual level will do nothing but worsen the problem. Sitting and waiting around will never enact change.Yes, it’s true that major corporations and government entities are responsible for an overwhelming share of global emissions. This, however, should never excuse us from taking individual action.What you can do, right now Individual choices add up. And just as importantly, individual voices influence public will. Here are a few steps Burlington residents can take starting today: Drive less: bike, walk, carpool or ride the bus. Even cutting a few car trips a week can make a meaningful impact.
Compost and reduce food waste: Food waste is a major source of emissions. Burlington makes it so easy to compost — No Waste Compost’s service picks up your compost directly from your curb.
Shop secondhand: vintage clothing, used furniture, refurbished electronics, you name it. Shopping secondhand is one of the easiest, most impactful ways to reduce your personal environmental footprint. It keeps perfectly usable items out of landfills, conserves natural resources and reduces the demand for new manufacturing — all while saving you money and uncovering unique finds.
Support local businesses: Local businesses often source their goods from nearby, which cuts down on emissions from long-distance shipping and freight. When you buy Vermont-grown produce or handmade goods from a local artisan, you’re sidestepping the massive carbon costs tied to cross-country or international transportation of goods.
Support local energy and climate initiatives: Attend town meetings. Join climate working groups. Advocate for clean energy investment.
Talk about it: One of the most powerful things you can do is simply normalize climate action — at your workplace, in your family and in your neighborhood. Drill it into people’s minds that the future of our planet depends on us!Individual choices may seem small in the grand scheme, but when enough people continue to take initiative, they add up. More importantly, they create a culture of accountability, one that forces institutions to follow the lead of their communities.The road ahead may be uncertain, but our direction doesn’t have to be. Burlington has already proven it can lead as a city; now we as individuals must continue that momentum with urgency, accountability and hope.Change doesn’t happen overnight, and it doesn’t happen from the top down. It takes root in neighborhoods, in conversations and in conscious choices made day after day.No one is asking for perfection — only participation. Keep biking. Keep composting. Keep shopping secondhand. Keep supporting your neighbors and local businesses. Keep raising your voice.The climate crisis may already be reshaping the world we grew up in, but it doesn’t have to define the one we pass on. If we act with intention and heart, the Burlington of tomorrow can still hold the spirit of the summers we once knew.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Daniel Wick: The climate crisis is here and Burlington cannot wait around.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-30 07:02:23.692946

They turned down a contract last fall. They eventually ratified a new deal in March, lawmakers chose not to fund it in the budget. (Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Nearly 5,300 state government and community college employees in Washington won’t be getting a 3% pay raise in July when most other state workers will.
That’s because those members of the Washington Public Employees Association did not ratify a new two-year contract until April 3, long past a statutory deadline and too tardy to be cribbed into the next state budget.
“It came very, very late in the process and it would have been quite difficult to respond to,” said Sen. Derek Stanford, D-Bothell, one of the Democratic lawmakers who pieced together the final budget agreement. “We need these groups to get their work done by the deadline.”
Amanda Hacker, the association president, said not getting the cost-of-living adjustment this year means the workers will “fall even further behind not just the private sector, but other state employees.”
“We are devastated. This amounts to punishing our members for asserting their rights in the bargaining process,” she said. “We’re looking at all our options to mitigate the immediate harm to our members.”
Meanwhile, the budget does fund the first-ever collective bargaining agreements with legislative employees in the state House and Senate. They contain the pay hikes provided in agreements with other state worker unions.
It wasn’t a certainty, however. Two of the four affected employee units did not approve their contracts until December. Lawmakers had the entire session to write them into the final deal.
By law, public sector unions in Washington must approve a new contract by Oct. 1 to be considered by a governor for funding in the ensuing two-year budget.
The spending plan approved by the Legislature on Sunday funds multiple contracts containing general pay hikes of 3% on July 1, 2025 and 2% a year later. These agreements also raise the starting wage for state workers to $18 an hour.
Members of the Washington Public Employees Association not receiving those increases work at 14 community colleges and in nine state agencies. Among them are the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Revenue, the Liquor and Cannabis Board and Department of Agriculture. 
Their members overwhelmingly voted down a tentative agreement on Sept. 30 with the pay hikes. Association negotiators derided the proposal as a pay cut, saying it would not allow worker salaries to keep pace with rising costs. They initially sought a 30% hike.
Union leaders told employees then that rejecting the accord would put them in “uncharted territory.”
Hacker said they hoped to keep bargaining. But the Office of Financial Management, which represents the state, wouldn’t, she said. The union sued to try to force a resumption of talks. Negotiations restarted in December.
The two sides reached a tentative agreement in March and union members ratified it April 3. It has 3% and 2% increases, the same as the other contracts. 
The estimated cost was $55.8 million for the 2025-27 biennium, of which $18.1 million would come from the state general fund. The Office of Financial Management provided the figures to lawmakers in March.
Stanford said he would expect the state agency and union to request money next year to provide wage hikes to the affected employees.
Hacker said there may be other avenues to secure funding for the pay increases. If not, the union will seek to begin talks immediately on a contract to submit to lawmakers in 2026.
“We’re no way near done. Our members are mad. The budget isn’t signed,” Hacker said. 
Any agreement would need to be approved by the union by Oct. 1.
In the meantime, the agreements with legislative staff of the Republican and Democratic caucuses in the House and Senate will provide the same wage hikes offered to other state employee unions — 5% pay hikes spread over two fiscal years.
Legislative assistants in the GOP caucuses unanimously approved contract language by the Oct. 1 deadline. Democratic staff did not, overwhelmingly rejecting proposed contracts with their employers, which are the chief clerk of the House and secretary of the Senate.
Three months later, in late December, legislative assistants, policy analysts and communications staff in the House Democratic Caucus and legislative assistants in the Senate Democratic Caucus ratified their respective agreements. 
A 2022 law cleared the way for partisan legislative staff to unionize and negotiate terms and conditions for the workplace. 
Employees of the Democratic and Republican caucuses in each chamber had to be in separate units unless a majority of each caucus voted to be in the same unit. All four units negotiated collectively on economic issues, like wages and benefits, and separately on workplace-related issues.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1-scaled-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-30 07:02:23.692946

Deep reductions in spending on Medicaid and food programs for low-income families would have a crushing effect on Florida — from state government, which would have to absorb more of the financial burden; to health care providers who could see their reimbursement rates cut; to the 4.2 million Florida residents who rely on the health care safety net for some form of health care coverage.
Congressional Republicans are intent on deep cuts to Medicaid — $880 billion in the House plan over the next decade and $4 billion for the Senate. The money would extend President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts.
But with a recent poll showing no appetite across the political spectrum for cutting Medicaid to pay for tax cuts, Florida advocates hope to convince Congress to reconsider.
The uncertainty comes as Florida lawmakers remain at odds over a new state budget and whether to go forward with a substantial cut in the sales tax rate. Senate President Ben Albritton has said he is unwilling to go along with deep tax cuts for fear of substantial “shortfalls.” Florida contributes a significant portion of the taxes collected at the state level to pay its share of Medicaid.
Florida Policy Institute Chief Strategy and Development Officer Holly Bullard  appeared during a webinar along with Joan Alker, executive director and co-founder of the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy Center for Children and Families (CCF) and a research professor at the Georgetown McCourt School of Public Policy; Lynn Hearn, advocacy director, Florida Health Justice Project; and Asheena Moses, statewide outreach and advocacy manager, Florida Impact, to discuss the pending cuts and how they would undermine the state budget if enacted.
Alker shared statistics that underscore how large the Medicaid program is in Florida. In all, she said, Florida receives about $19.5 billion in federal funding for Medicaid, 44% of all federal funds that come into the state.
“That’s an important context, because Medicaid cuts, federal Medicaid cuts, will have a huge impact on the state’s budget — obviously, on Medicaid itself but more broadly on the state’s budget and ability to finance other priorities such as education, infrastructure, public health — whatever it is,” she said. 
In Florida, Medicaid pays for 58% of nursing home stays and 42% of births. Nearly 52% of Florida children living in small towns and rural areas are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Similar to Medicaid, the federal government helps pay the costs of the CHIP program.
“This is extremely meaningful coverage that is really providing just a safety net for so many people, so it covers our most vulnerable individuals at the most vulnerable stages of their lives. So obviously, these aren’t just statistics. They’re real-life people,” said Hearn, whose organization advocates for health care access for all and equity.

 ‘Polly’

Florida established its Medicaid program in 1970. As of February, the latest available data, the program covered 4.2 million people, mostly through Medicaid managed care plans.
The $38 billion program is one of the largest in the nation, but it’s conservative in its approach and who it covers.
“We are pretty frugal when it comes to per capita and per enrolled spending in the Medicaid program,” said Justin Senior, who served as secretary of the state Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) for former Gov. Rick Scott and the state’s Medicaid director before that. 
He is now CEO of the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, which represents some of the largest hospitals in the state, including Jackson Health System, Orlando Health, and Tampa General Hospital.
“If you’re looking for states that don’t spend a lot of money on Medicaid, then Florida has been an excellent steward of taxpayers’ dollars,” he said.
Indeed, Florida legislators maintain that the safety-net program should serve those who need assistance most, such as people with developmental and intellectual disabilities, including “Polly,” who lives in Jacksonville.
Polly’s sister Betsy Dobbins, participated in the webinar with Bullard and Alker to discuss the proposed Medicaid cuts. They would be devastating for Polly, who after nine years on a waiting list was enrolled in the Medicaid waiver program for people with developmental disabilities known as the iBudget program, Dobbins said.
Polly uses iBudget for home and community-based services that keep her living outside of an institution, and attends a day program at the local social services facility run by The Arc. She relies on Medicaid for traditional health care services such as doctor appointments, too.
“Medicaid cuts would be hugely detrimental for Polly in any shape or form,” Dobbins said. “Not just for Polly, but for us and for all of these people who are working every day to take care of people in these health care and systems of care for people like Polly.”










There are really huge cuts that could completely miss Florida and there are big cuts that could hit us.

Although Republicans in the House and Senate have decided upon deep cuts, the particulars remain unsettled. Without knowing those details, Senior said, it’s difficult to see how the reductions will land.
“There are really huge cuts that could completely miss Florida and there are big cuts that could hit us,” Senior said.
KFF analyzed potential repercussions for the states and found Florida would experience a $4 billion recurring reduction in federal Medicaid spending over the next decade if the full $880 billion House cut becomes law. The KFF analysis is illustrative and assumes the federal cuts are proportionally applied to states based on their share of federal spending, and not on policy decisions.
“In practice, cuts would almost certainly not be allocated proportionately, and some states would be disproportionately impacted depending on the specific policy proposals pursued. Without specific policies yet under consideration by Congress, this illustrative analysis is a way of understanding the magnitude of the potential Medicaid cuts,” the authors note.
One proposed reduction that wouldn’t harm Florida involves the federal Medicaid match for states that expanded the program to low-income working adults under the Affordable Care Act. The federal match for that population is 90% — more generous than the traditional Medicaid match which for Florida is roughly 58% (it’s higher for CHIP). That means the federal government pays 58 cents of every Medicaid dollar spent in Florida.
Another way to reduce federal spending is to crack down on so-called “health care provider taxes,” which the state uses as its required match to help fund the program. 
Nursing homes, hospitals, and intermediate care facilities for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities assess these “taxes” upon themselves, rather than run them through the state fiscal system. This allows the state to book lower social services spending while supplying cash for the federally mandated Medicaid match. The mechanism is common among the various states.
The Congressional Budget Office has argued that Congress could save hundreds of billions of dollars by altering or eliminating provider tax options. The discussions generally center around lowering the “safe harbor” that allows states to use hold-harmless arrangements when the provider taxes don’t exceed 6% of net revenue from treating patients.
Hold-harmless arrangements ensure that the taxes collected are  returned to providers in the form of higher Medicaid payments.
Hospitals’ provider taxes run well below that 6% safe harbor, so if Congress adjusts that slightly downward it shouldn’t beggar those providers, Senior said.
His association has been lobbying Congress, trying to ease any hit on Florida’s Medicaid program. So, too, has the Florida Health Care Association, which represents a large swath of Florida’s nursing homes.
“With over two-thirds of our residents relying on Medicaid to cover the cost of their long-term care, reductions to the provider assessment could limit options for our frail elders and their families,” FHCA spokesperson Kristen Knapp said in a written statement.
“We’re working with the American Health Care Association to help Congress understand that Medicaid is a key safety net for our most vulnerable and it must remain strong as our aging population continues to grow,” she said.
The first Trump administration tried to crack down on Medicaid provider taxes. Then–Florida Medicaid Director Beth Kidder wrote a letter opposing the move, saying it would “cripple” the state’s Medicaid program.
Senior, though, is a little more hopeful than Kidder.
“We got to see where it all lands. You could see a package of reductions that would impact Florida or you could see a package that wouldn’t have much of an impact on Florida or Florida hospitals at all,” he said.
Why now?
With some economists predicting a 60% chance of a recession during 2025, Alker also wants to know: Why now?
Medicaid is a counter-cyclical program, meaning enrollment increases during economic downturns. Congress, recognizing that, has generally increased federal matching funds during recessions, Alker noted.
“The fact that Congress would be contemplating one of the biggest cuts in Medicaid that we likely have ever seen at a time when, if the country is going into recession, normally Congress would be increasing Medicaid funding, I think, is a really important point.”
  Joan Alker executive director and co-founder of the Center for Children and Families and a research professor at the Georgetown McCourt School of Public Policy.
 Don’t forget about the food

Advocates also warned about reductions to SNAP, the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which serves 2.9 million people in Florida. Since the program’s inception, the benefits have always been federally funded, although the state has had to pay half the costs of administering the program.
As part of the budget process, the House agreed to trim $230 billion in agricultural spending. However, there are widespread doubts Congress would cut farm subsidies and will look to cut the SNAP program instead, said Bullard, of the Florida Policy Institute.
“We want to lift up that this additional care program that is also counter-cyclical that is also something that our communities rely on that it is under threat as well.”
Hearn says the federal government is considering requiring the states to help pay for the costs of the benefit.
“And states have never had to do this before, nor are they prepared or have had conversations to do so. And so, just straight math is pretty easy to understand what this would do to the states’ budgets,” Hearn said.
A 10% cost shift to the state would increase costs for Florida by $657 million annually, Hearn said.
Asheena Moses, outreach and advocacy manager for Florida Impact, said there’s a strong connection between good nutrition and good health. Florida Impact is a statewide organization dedicated to advancing health equity by eliminating hunger.
“If SNAP is provided to families and families are able to provide nutritious meals to their children, they are less likely to get sick and be dependent on Medicaid programs, Moses said. 
“SNAP also lifts families out of poverty. It frees up funding for them to get out of debt and it also frees up funding for them to establish themselves in a way that they can be self sufficient — like paying for trade programs or paying for different certifications so that they can get jobs where they make enough money to be lifted out of poverty and difficult situations,” she said.

Yet for over a decade, a little-known law has been quietly increasing your electric bill while stifling innovation in our energy infrastructure.
In 2012, Minnesota passed a “Right of First Refusal” law for electric transmission lines. While the Vikings stadium deal dominated legislative attention, 216B.246 passed unanimously in both chambers. This law gives incumbent utility companies the exclusive right to build new high-voltage transmission lines that connect to their existing infrastructure.
The consequences have been profound and costly for Minnesota ratepayers.
Before this law, Minnesota enjoyed electricity rates significantly lower than the national average — about 18% below in 2001 and still 13% lower in 2011.
Then came the ROFR law in 2012, and this advantage began eroding rapidly. By 2013, rates were only 6.5% below the national average. The downward trend continued until 2020, when rates were virtually identical to the national average — a mere 0.2% lower. While there have been slight improvements recently, Minnesota is nowhere near its former competitive advantage.
This isn’t just about losing an economic edge — it’s a failure to meet the state’s own legal requirements. Minnesota law explicitly mandates that electricity rates should be 5% below the national average. Current rates fail this standard, putting Minnesota in violation of its own energy policy goals.
The ROFR law effectively creates a monopoly, allowing incumbent utilities to build transmission projects without facing competition from potentially more efficient, innovative or cost-effective providers.
Research consistently shows that competitive bidding on transmission projects reduces costs by 20-30%. In the MISO region (which includes Minnesota), competitively bid projects have yielded overall cost savings of 37% for ratepayers. These aren’t small numbers considering the multi-billion-dollar scale of transmission infrastructure. For the average Minnesota family, this could mean significant relief on monthly electric bills.
The stated purpose of the ROFR law is often described as protecting consumers and incumbent utilities from “out-of-state competition.” Instead, it has shielded utilities from any competition, removing incentives to innovate, control costs, or improve efficiency. Under the current law, even if an incumbent utility decides not to build a needed transmission line, alternatives can only be considered after the incumbent formally declines — creating further delays and complications.
The timing for action is critical. Without competitive bidding, massive infrastructure investments will be built at monopoly prices, potentially driving electricity rates even further above the statutory requirement.
Currently, bills SF434 and HF2553 aim to repeal Minnesota’s ROFR law. This repeal represents a crucial opportunity to restore competition, reverse the trend of diminishing rate advantages, and deliver much-needed price relief to Minnesota consumers.
Critics may argue that changing the law will create uncertainty. But courts in other states have already shown the path forward. In Iowa, the Supreme Court characterized their ROFR as “crony capitalism” in 2023. Similarly, Texas courts ruled that ROFRs are “unconstitutional because they violate the dormant Commerce Clause.”
Despite these judicial setbacks, the utility industry continues to push for ROFR laws nationwide. Oklahoma has seen ROFR bills proposed every year for the past four years. Wisconsin is battling to prevent similar legislation. And in Iowa, despite court rulings, new bills have been proposed with the same misleading justifications used when Minnesota’s law was enacted.
The evidence is clear: Monopoly by statute doesn’t work. Competition drives innovation, efficiency, and ultimately, the price relief that Minnesota consumers need.
For a state that values innovation, fair competition, and consumer interests, Minnesota’s ROFR law is an anomaly that must be addressed. Since its enactment, Minnesotans have watched their electricity rate advantage disappear.
It’s time for Minnesota to repeal this costly monopoly protection and restore the competitive advantage it once enjoyed. The state’s energy future — and the relief on your electric bill — depends on it.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tariffphoto2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 08:08:49.147190

(From Holcomb's official Flickr)The Indiana Economic Development Foundation has poured more than $13 million into travel, administrative and other expenses across six years, according to audited financial reports released Thursday under Gov. Mike Braun’s orders.
The little-known foundation is charged with raising private funds to boost the controversial Indiana Economic Development Corp. But the nonprofit is on a spending freeze.
State freezes funding for economic development affiliate, promises audit

Indiana had a traditional commerce department until 2005. That’s when, under former Gov. Mitch Daniels, lawmakers created the IEDC: “a body politic and corporate, not a state agency but an independent instrumentality exercising essential public functions,” per Indiana Code. They allowed its board to create a subsidiary: the foundation.
“Everybody always thinks that the tax dollars are going in one direction: they’re going out to nonprofits to subsidize nonprofit activity,” said Indiana University Professor Beth Gazley, a nonprofit management specialist.
“But actually, there’s a lot of money coming back from nonprofits to subsidize government activities,” she continued, noting that the federal definition of a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit includes “lessening the burdens of government.”
The IEDC’s furtive efforts to secure water, land and more for a contentious technology park have made it plenty of enemies since 2022. But now, its problems go beyond public relations.
Braun said Thursday that he’s ordered a forensic audit and reported “impropriety, or even the appearance of it” to Indiana’s Office of Inspector General amid allegations of self-dealing and more, first reported by Indiana Legislative Insight.
And he’s taken aim at the foundation.
In an April 9 news release, his administration called out the foundation for not filing six years of required audited financial reports with the State Budget Committee. Two weeks later, the lapses were cured and the reports available online.
A spokesperson for the quasi-public agency didn’t immediately answer Capital Chronicle questions, including why those records weren’t submitted.
Reports reveal spending’s focus
The newly released reports show that the foundation spent $13.2 million from the 2019 through 2024 fiscal years, which begin July 1 and end June 30.
The bulk of that, $10.9 million, went to travel, meals and entertainment. Years worth of news releases indicate the foundation has paid for virtually all of the international economic development trips taken by prior governors.
The independent auditor used for the most recent three reports — Indianapolis’ Katz, Sapper & Miller — also included conferences in this category, while the previous one — Missouri’s former BKD — did not.
“Is that a lot of money to be spending on conferences, travel, meals and entertainment? That really depends on the programmatic goals of the organization, the mission of the organization,” Gazley said. “And only the board can decide: is that the best use of our funding?”


The IEDC and its foundation share the same staff and 12-member board.
Gazley also said it’s “best practice” to change auditors over time. Get too “close and clubby” and risk the auditor “not being honest anymore about the financial status of the organization,” she warned.
Another $1.8 million was logged for administrative expenses, plus more than $200,000 for sponsorships.
Nearly $300,000 was categorized as “other” spending. The foundation didn’t immediately answer a question about what kinds of expenditures would fit within this category.
Donor information remains largely under wraps
The reports also disclose about $11.7 million in donations. But they offer no clues as to the identity of those donors. Indiana Code forces the foundation to redact donor names out of public records if they request anonymity at any point in time.
Most do.
The groups behind 14 of 16 transactions from 2020 through 2022 were shielded from records obtained in 2023 by the Capital Chronicle. Two didn’t request anonymity: District of Columbia-based think tank The Urban Institute donated $5,000 in 2021, and the Battery Innovation Center in Newberry gave $12,000 in 2022. Between 2015 and 2025, the center nabbed six incentive contracts that total $18 million, according to the IEDC’s transparency portal.
At the time, spokeswoman Erin Sweitzer wrote that private donations “allow more flexibility in how we use the funds and how quickly we’re able to access them.”
For Gazley, that doesn’t add up.
“I don’t see how you can defend privacy as a programmatic priority, or a mission-related priority. You just can’t,” she said. “But privacy does make a lot of organizations more viable if their donors are concerned about having their (donation) choices on the front page of the newspaper.”
“The kinds of accountability tools that we have for the public with, if I ordered them in priority, transparency would be at the top of the list. And I think it should be at (the) top of everybody’s list,” she added later.
But there are indications of who other foundation givers may be — and evidence several have dealings with the IEDC. Organizations can donate money, sponsor events or provide in-kind services.

A webpage for the foundation identifies the state’s “big five” investor-owned utilities — AES Indiana, CenterPoint Energy, Duke Energy, Indiana Michigan Power and the Northern Indiana Public Service Company — as “contributors.”
AES logged $10 million in professional services contracts that expired in 2023 and about $2.8 million in incentive contracts from 2014, according to the portal, while Duke earned about $150 million in an incentive contract from 2010. Incentives are performance-based, so a recipient may not earn the full amount if its targets aren’t met.
Nine other organizations are dubbed “sponsors” on the webpage. They include Old National Bank, Pure Development, Rolls-Royce, Hoosier Energy, Solv Energy, Doral Renewables, railroad giant Norfolk Southern, workforce development consultant TPMA, and Indiana University’s Ventures startup affiliate.
Pure Development holds a $94.4 million contract for development work. Rolls-Royce received $21,000 after co-sponsoring a Northwest Stadium suite with IEDC for an Army-Navy football match in December and racked up 14 incentive contracts — worth $74.6 million — between 2011 and 2022.
Doral Renewables, meanwhile, is the recipient of two pending incentive contracts totaling $1.5 million. TPMA was recorded as having three service contracts — for almost $190,000 — expiring between 2019 and 2025, and two 2015 incentive contracts worth nearly $400,000.
There’s also more information on the way.
Though the foundation secured an exemption from the Internal Revenue Service in 2012 for future filings of the Form 990, Braun has directed it and other state-affiliated nonprofits to file them annually, regardless of any exemptions. The form describes funding sources and amounts, and how much has been spent on programming versus administrative expenses.
All required reports going back 10 years are due by the end of 2025 under his executive order. They must also be “clearly posted” online “for Hoosiers to read for themselves,” according to a news release.

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington State. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.


They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Ed Murray for New Jersey Monitor)Lawmakers like to tout New Jersey as the “state for second chances,” citing its expungement law as a crucial tool for helping people move on from their mistakes.
But should cops who commit serious crimes that they later get expunged get to hide their wrongdoing from the public they police?
That was the question before the New Jersey Supreme Court Tuesday, when justices heard arguments in the case of a Jersey City police lieutenant who got his felony charges expunged after authorities say he downed six to eight beers and then shot at his guests during a dispute at a party at his Sussex County home.
States Newsroom, the parent company of New Jersey Monitor, sued Jersey City in 2022 after officials there refused to release the police department’s internal affairs report on the August 2019 incident that led state troopers to charge Lt. Michael Timmins with terroristic threats and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes. County prosecutors allowed Timmins to complete a pretrial diversionary program that cleared the way for expungement, even though his offenses violated the Graves Act, a state law that requires mandatory prison sentences for some gun crimes.
City officials defended their refusal to disclose Timmins’ disciplinary file as necessary under the state’s expungement statute, which threatens violators who knowingly disclose expunged records with a $200 fine and disorderly conduct charge.
Internal affairs reports are not public records under New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act. But a state Supreme Court ruling from March 2022 requires police to release internal affairs reports under the common law right of access when the public’s interest in them outweighs an officer’s confidentiality concerns, noted attorney CJ Griffin, who represents the New Jersey Monitor.
The city’s denial also came before a judge approved Timmins’ expungement request, compounding officials’ error in their failure to disclose, Griffin added. That wrongly impeded the New Jersey Monitor from alerting the public about a problematic officer whose “sweetheart deal” to dodge discipline raises questions about police accountability in Jersey City, the state’s second-largest city, she said.
“The IA unit concluded that it was merely negligent behavior, and this officer received only a 90-day suspension and is still on this force despite his dangerous behavior that could have resulted in killing someone,” Griffin told justices Tuesday.
The city’s response to Timmins’ misconduct is even more of a matter of public concern because Jersey City’s longtime mayor, Steven Fulop, is now running for New Jersey governor, she added.
“Transparency is very important to the public, trusting the police. And the public often feels that police are given special treatment, that they cover up for each other, that the internal affairs unit doesn’t hold their fellow officers accountable. And I’ve personally seen that every time we come to this court and obtain a landmark decision that gives us transparency, then we see agencies finding a way to evade that transparency. So those things are all present in this case,” Griffin said.
Attorneys from the state attorney general’s and public defenders’ offices joined Griffin in arguing that such disclosure is warranted, though for slightly different reasons.
Viviana M. Hanley, representing the Attorney General’s Office, said such internal affairs records should be made public to protect the public’s trust in police accountability — as long as they’re redacted to hide things a judge has ordered expunged, such as the cop’s arrest, detention, trial, and offense.
Michael Noveck, from the Office of the Public Defender, echoed that sentiment but rejected the idea of redactions. Officers’ misconduct — including expunged crimes — serve as exculpatory and impeachment evidence that authorities are obligated to share with the juries that are tasked with weighing the credibility of cops who testify against criminal defendants, Noveck said. Details of Timmins’ arrest were revealed in just such a case.
Attorney Jeremy Jacobsen, representing Jersey City, countered that the state’s expungement statute contains no exceptions that allow expunged records to be disclosed to media outlets.
“We need to make sure that we are adhering to the plain language of the statute, because there’s a lot at risk here if we get it wrong,” Jacobsen said. “We’re exposing our employees to criminal penalties here.”
The New Jersey Monitor’s fight is a policy one that should be fought in the Statehouse, he added.
“If they’re looking for public policy changes, they’re in the wrong building. They should be lobbying the Legislature,” he said.
Democrat running for governor wants more transparency in Trenton — what about in his own backyard?

The Municipal Clerks’ Association of New Jersey backed Jacobsen, with attorney Michael S. Carucci telling the justices that clerks labor under “this heavy cloud” of risking a disorderly persons offense for wrongly releasing expunged records. Disclosure laws require public officials to reveal reasons for redactions, so clerks weighing whether to release information on expunged cases risk litigation either from requestors who get no answer when they challenge redactions or from officers who feel their expungements were wrongly revealed, he added.
“The cat would be out of the bag. The requester would know that something’s up here, that there is expunged information,” Carucci said.
Such concerns did give some justices pause.
“Under what authority can this court overrule the Legislature when it passes a law that says ‘X’ will not be disclosed?” Justice Rachel Wainer Apter asked Griffin.
Griffin underscored that New Jersey Monitor’s request for Timmins’ internal affairs report predated the expungement.
“The facts were all public when we filed the request and when we filed the lawsuit,” she said.
In further questioning over nearly three hours of arguments, some justices seemed to side with disclosure, possibly with redactions to protect information excluded under the expungement statute.
Internal affairs investigators weigh administrative violations, more so than crimes, and the expungement statute applies to criminal justice matters rather than workplace discipline, Wainer Apter noted.
“I’m just having trouble understanding why if a criminal proceeding — if the person happens to be charged with a crime, the entire existence of the IA investigation all of a sudden becomes expunged,” she said.
It’s unclear when the court will return a ruling.

(Getty Images)With the 2025 budget session now in the rear-view mirror, Hoosier veterans are taking note not only of what passed and what didn’t, but how it all unfolded.
This session brought minimal progress for Indiana’s veterans. Some long overdue improvements made it through, but far too many priorities were ignored, watered down, or outright rejected.
What we gained
One win was expanded life insurance for Indiana National Guard members. Lawmakers approved a long-overdue increase in coverage — from $8,000 to $20,000 — for those who die while serving on state active duty orders.
The General Assembly also modernized charitable gaming. Veteran service organizations can now use electronic pull-tabs and apply revenues more flexibly. This modernization was decades in the making.
Businesses assisting veterans with their benefits must now be accredited and required to inform veterans of the free services available to them.
The Indiana Code now recognizes the U.S. Space Force, U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps — making their income exempt from state tax.
These are meaningful steps, but they pale in comparison to the support veterans deserve and the issues left unaddressed.
What we lost or never gained
Despite its potential to save lives, especially for veterans with traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress, the proposed hyperbaric oxygen therapy program failed to advance.
And there is still no restoration of tuition remission for children of disabled veterans, a benefit stripped away in 2011 and not returned.
Once again, Indiana’s reserve forces were left behind, with no state-funded education support.
We stopped a House attempt to raid the Veterans Affairs Trust Fund of $1.25 Million annually for a state program only to see the Senate reinsert the same provision. The Military Family Relief Fund, funded by Hoosiers to support veterans in need, is being quietly siphoned off to fund state agency advertising. Up to 10% of the fund is taken each year, despite the agency already having a communications staff and outside marketing firm on payroll.
That same agency also blocked a bill that would have allowed disabled veterans to access hyperbaric oxygen therapy through the fund. Veterans were denied critical care and a bureaucracy won out. That’s not supporting veterans, that’s exploiting them.
Property taxes
In 1975, Indiana honored disabled veterans with a property tax deduction of $24,950—when the average home cost just $39,000. An additional $14,000 was granted for the totally disabled. Many paid little to no property taxes as a result. It was a tangible, targeted acknowledgment of their sacrifice.

Fast forward to 2025: In an attempt to address broader property tax issues, the General Assembly proposed folding veterans into a general tax credit system.
Under the original plan: all homeowners would get a $300 credit and disabled veterans would receive an additional $250.
Those over 62 or totally disabled would get another $150. However, those over 62 and totally disabled would be excluded from the senior credit entirely.
This was not a continuation of the original benefit, it was a replacement that undermined it. Veterans spoke out. The Indiana American Legion issued a call to action. The Military Veterans Coalition of Indiana mobilized. On the final day of session, lawmakers reversed course and reinstated the original property tax deduction for disabled veterans.
While that correction matters, it shouldn’t be viewed as a win. It was a fix for a mistake that should never have been made and it still leaves the deduction unchanged from 50 years ago. No adjustment for inflation. No reflection of today’s housing market. Just the bare minimum to maintain appearances.
Veteran benefits
Also in the final hours of session, lawmakers inserted language into a conference report that fundamentally alters who is eligible for benefits in Indiana throughout the Indiana code. Anywhere the law previously required an “Honorable Discharge,” it now reads “Anything Other Than Dishonorable.”
This opens the door to eligibility for those with bad conduct and other-than-honorable discharges. To manage this, the Indiana Veterans Commission is tasked with reviewing DD-214 discharge codes which the Department of Defense stopped publicly sharing in 2022. This is a bureaucratic workaround to a problem that shouldn’t exist. The longstanding definition of a veteran, one who earned benefits through honorable service is being rewritten without adequate oversight or public input. Benefits come with honorable service. Period. Rewriting that standard isn’t equity, it’s erasure.
This session proved that vigilance is necessary. When legislators tried to undermine or redirect hard-earned benefits, veterans stood up, spoke out, and pushed back. And we’re not done.
Hoosier veterans live to fight another day. And fight we will.

(Screenshot of Court of Appeals livestream)Do streaming services count as video service providers and should they be subject to franchise fees like traditional cable TV? Judges Melissa May, Elizabeth Tavitas and Paul Felix weighed the above question in a remote hearing held at Wabash College on Tuesday.
Also at question was whether lawmakers unconstitutionally intervened in 2023 to nullify a lawsuit filed by four Indiana cities seeking to recoup franchise fees from some streaming service providers.  
In August 2020, four cities sued a handful of streaming services seeking franchise fees equal to 5% of local gross revenue for using facilities in the public right-of-way, similar to how cable television stations operate. 
A 2006 law requires video service providers to be licensed with the state and pay quarterly franchise fees to cities and other governments. But the cities of Fishers, Indianapolis, Evansville and Valparaiso say that streaming giants like Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, DirectTV and Dish Network haven’t complied. 
Such companies depend on Internet services, specifically shared cables that are part of the greater utility framework accessed through public right-of-way. 
  Michael Limrick, a partner with Hoover Hull Turner LLP, argues on behalf of four cities before the Indiana Court of Appeals on April 29, 2025. (Screenshot of Court of Appeals livestream)
“I’m accessing the Hulu programming via the Internet, but I can only access that because the programming has traveled through the public right-of-way to get to my house,” argued attorney Michael Limrick on behalf of the cities. “… if I’m going to pull up programming on my phone that will have been broadcast to my phone from a tower that may be sitting in the public right-of-way.”
Broadcasting through satellite services, for example, wouldn’t be included under Indiana’s video service provider law, Limrick said. 
But, rather than letting such questions play out in the courts, the General Assembly intervened, tweaking the definition of video service providers in a way that killed the effort.
The original version of the bill that became House Enrolled Act 1454 didn’t include any mention of video service providers, but as the 2023 bill grew from 42 pages to 282 pages, it picked up provisions. The relevant addition explicitly said that video programming offered over the Internet isn’t considered to be a video service provider — and then backdated the language to 2006, when the franchise fees were established. 
On Tuesday, judges also wondered whether re-opening up the definition in a way that includes the Internet might capture other forms of video content, such as creators on YouTube and TikTok. 
“We have these YouTube producers that are making all of these videos … somebody like a Mr. Beast, who now has huge production abilities. He’s not just a guy with a cell phone anymore taking videos of the crazy things he’s doing,” said Felix. “It begins to blur the line as to what is video programming that’s similar to regular broadcast.” 
Limrick argued that accessing YouTube videos aren’t all fee based, though he acknowledged there’s a separate, paid service for watching live television and ad-free videos built into the platform. 
 The case for streaming services

Citing the new law, a trial court judge ruled in favor of the streaming services to dismiss the case and ruled that the additions were constitutional in June 2024. A story from the Northwest Indiana Times detailing the bill’s journey to become law reported that the author said the language came from a lobbyist affiliated with Dish Network. 
But the cities continued to argue that lawmakers overstepped by adding the video service provider language to a bill that initially sought to address certain Department of Local Government Finance concerns — in effect, creating “special” legislation.
 


				Attorney General Todd Rokita, arguing on behalf of the General Assembly, affirmed the trial court’s ruling on the constitutionality of the legislature’s actions in a December filing. However, should judges rule otherwise, he urged the appeals court to sever the specific portion of House Enrolled Act 1454 concerning video streaming providers from the rest of the law. 
“… but this remedy is unnecessary in this case because (House Enrolled Act) 1454 is constitutional,” he continued. “Therefore, this Court should affirm the order of dismissal.” 			



Peter E. Davis, arguing on behalf of Netflix and others, said it didn’t count as special legislation and simply clarified existing law — noting that it mirrors how other states have approached the issue. 
“The cities’ arguments today undermine the General Assembly’s ability to legislate, both for this case and for the future,” said Davis. “… The cities’ argument would make such amendments impossible, locking Indiana into taxes and fees passed in a different time, in a different day, with no ability to adjust.” 
  Peter E. Davis, an attorney with Latham & Watkins LLP, argues on behalf of streaming services before the Indiana Court of Appeals on April 29, 2025. (Screenshot from Indiana Court of Appeals livestream)
Davis said it was his understanding that Internet service providers don’t pay franchise fees either. Additionally, since the companies are “agnostic” about how users access their offerings — whether by phone, Internet or otherwise — he said it makes “very little sense to impose a fee” on streaming.
“What the Internet service provider is doing is very different than what a cable company is doing … they’re enabling access to all kinds of content. So it’s not just video, but it’s email. It’s information; it’s social media; it’s video games,” said Davis. “It doesn’t make any sense to impose franchise fees on just one piece of something that the Internet service provider — whose not even the streaming company here — is ultimately providing.”
He also pointed to a 2022 report from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission concluding that “streaming video is not treated as a traditional video provider and, therefore, is not required to obtain a state-issued franchise.”
However, in a rebuttal, Limrick argued against the notion that the legislature only wanted to regulate the companies installing wiring for the Internet in the public right-of-way. 
“It could do that; it hasn’t done that,” said Limrick. “What the act regulates are companies that transmit video programming through facilities located, at least in part, in the public right-of-way.
“… the act says nothing about who owns those facilities,” continued Limrick, referring to the 2006 law. 
Carving out streaming services who operate using the Internet, he said, would be special treatment. 
Felix noted a “tension” created by the arguments because any ruling would impact not only existing streaming services but companies yet to be created. The three judges didn’t indicate when to anticipate their ruling.

Program participants enroll in AmeriCorps and are paid an hourly wage for their work. (Photo courtesy of Western Dairyland EOC Inc.) A coalition of 25 states, including Wisconsin, sued the Trump administration Tuesday to block the cancellation of AmeriCorps programs across the country.
The cancellation has upended plans at more than two dozen organizations in Wisconsin that have engaged AmeriCorps members in community service work, and stranded scores of participants in the midst of one-year stints in the program.
“I was completely blindsided,” Parker Kuehni told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday. The University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate with a degree in global health was in his second year with AmeriCorps, working at a Madison free health clinic and preparing to start medical school in June when he learned Monday morning that the program was canceled.
Created by Congress in 1993 as the Corporation for National and Community Service, its official name, AmeriCorps has deployed community service workers across the country in the decades since. AmeriCorps members are usually recent college graduates who join the program for a year or two. They teach in schools, assist with disaster relief and take on a host of other roles. 
Wisconsin has 25 AmeriCorps programs that operate at more than 300 locations across the state, according to the office of Gov. Tony Evers. In Wisconsin, AmeriCorps operates through Serve Wisconsin, which administers its Wisconsin contracts and is housed in the Department of Administration.
On April 16, AmeriCorps placed about 75% of its employees on administrative leave with pay, the New York Times reported.
At 6:20 p.m. on Friday, April 25, Jeanne Duffy, the Serve Wisconsin executive director, received an email message that AmeriCorps grants and their recipients in Wisconsin were being terminated immediately “because it has been determined that the award no longer effectuates agency priorities.”
The form letter instructed recipients to notify all organizations and agencies with AmeriCorps-related projects. “You must immediately cease all award activities. This is a final agency action and is not administratively appealable,” the message said.
Lawsuit: Cancellation ‘usurps Congress’s power of the purse’
The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Maryland charges the Trump administration’s cancellation of the program “flouts Congress’s creation of AmeriCorps and assignment of agency duties; usurps Congress’s power of the purse and thereby violates the Constitution’s separation of powers; and arbitrarily and capriciously — without any reasoned analysis — vitiates the agency’s ability to function consistent with its statutory mission and purpose.”
The suit charges that the program’s abrupt end also violates federal law, which states AmeriCorps can make “significant changes to program requirements, service delivery or policy only through public notice and comment rulemaking.”
“The attempt to dismantle AmeriCorps is part of a pattern from the Trump administration of disrespect toward those who serve others,” Attorney General Josh Kaul said in a statement. “That approach is not just shameful — it’s misguided. AmeriCorps volunteers and projects help strengthen communities. AmeriCorps should be thanked for its work, not abruptly dismantled.”
Evers’ office telegraphed Wisconsin’s plan to join the lawsuit late Tuesday morning.
“Once again, the Trump Administration is trying to cut federal funding that Congress already approved and Wisconsin is counting on to help kids, families, and communities across our state — all so they can pay for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires,” Evers said in a statement. “These latest reckless Trump and Musk cuts will hurt Wisconsin’s kids who are homeless or who need tutors for math and reading, folks who are working to overcome addiction and substance use, stop work on conservation projects, as well as all of the dedicated public servants whose livelihoods are depending on this work.”
Tutoring programs, health care clinics
AmeriCorps’ cancellation affected organizations and agencies all across the state.
In Madison, the United Way of Dane County enlisted 27 AmeriCorps members in two tutoring programs — one in math for high school students and the other in reading and literacy for elementary school children.
AmeriCorps members were placed in schools to help identify students who would benefit from tutoring, United Way officials said. They also screened and conducted background checks for more than 175 community volunteer tutors as well as serving as tutors themselves. More than 1,000 children have received tutoring in the two programs this year.
“And these kids are able to accelerate their academic success, which puts them on track for [higher] graduation rates,” said United Way CEO Renee Moe. “So, this is a really huge loss for us.”
AmeriCorps members were “really key to having successful volunteers support students in literacy,” said Emily Greene, director of Schools of Hope, the elementary program.
In the high school program, Achievement Connections, members have supported and trained other high school students as peer tutors. That helps those students “be engaged in their school in a way that they otherwise wouldn’t be and also gain some skills,” said Karl Johnson, director of Achievement Connections.
“We find that those relationships . . . are some of our strongest when it’s students helping each other out, and our [AmeriCorps] members are a pretty key part of facilitating that,” Johnson said.
The Wisconsin Association of Free and Charitable Clinics has deployed 30 AmeriCorps members throughout Wisconsin this year.
Some assist clinics, local health departments or the state Department of Health Services in administrative tasks, writing grants, collecting and analyzing data and related work, said Domonique Coffee, the association’s AmeriCorps program manager. Others staff clinics in a public health role, taking a patient’s blood pressure or other vital signs, teaching patients about managing their diabetes or hypertension or providing other direct care, she said.
The program allowed “free and charitable clinics to increase their services and capacity for services . . . to those who are underinsured or uninsured,” Coffee said.
It has also helped prepare the AmeriCorps members as future health care providers — “the future physicians and public health leaders of our next generation,” she added.
Fostering skills for careers and life
Parker Kuehni had graduated with a degree in global public health two years ago and was preparing to go to medical school. But he knew he first wanted to get more experience in directly working with patients.
He volunteered as a barbershop health screener for the Perry Family Free Clinic, which serves uninsured, low-income Madison residents. Through the clinic he connected with AmeriCorps and then shifted to helping with patient coordination, communication and scheduling, discussing care plans with patients and managing referrals to specialists.
The experience “built my empathy for people,” he said. The experiences he had “will contribute to me being an overall better future physician.”
While the typical AmeriCorps participant is a college graduate, the Western Dairyland Economic Opportunity Council in Eau Claire took a different approach with the program.
Since the late 1990s Western Dairyland has operated Fresh Start, an education, skills and career program for young adults ages 18 to 25. Participants often have a sparse job history and might not have completed high school.
The program engages up to 15 participants in a year-long house-building project. “We provide them with life skills and job skills and technical education, allowing them to then leave the program and either go on to school or attain full-time employment,” said Dale Karls, Western Dairyland’s communications coordinator.
The participants themselves become AmeriCorps members and earn an hourly wage on the job. Some 600 young people have gone through the program over the last three decades, building 45 homes, Karls said.
All the organizations the Wisconsin Examiner contacted Tuesday said the news of AmeriCorps’ cancellation came too recently  for them to know what they will do if the program isn’t restored.
Coffee said the Wisconsin Free and Charitable Clinics Association is trying to support its AmeriCorps members, “helping them find their footing.”
At United Way of Dane County, “We’ve spoken to our school district partners,” said Moe, the agency’s CEO. “We have reaffirmed with them that tutoring continues to be an important strategy to help with academic success. And so right now we’re trying to be creative around how to best keep really effective tutoring programs going.”
“We’re hoping that the funding will be reinstated,” said Karls of Western Dairyland. In the meantime, he added, “We have a half-constructed house in Strum, Wisconsin. We have to find a way to finish that.”

Idaho, feds agree to waiver of 1995 settlement agreement on nuclear fuel storage

As part of Gov. Spencer Cox’s “Built Here: Nuclear Energy Summit,” which his office said brought together leaders from across the nuclear energy industry on Tuesday, Cox joined Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon in signing an MOU that calls for the three states to work together coordinating nuclear infrastructure, accelerating nuclear development, and advocating for “commonsense federal policies.”
“The West will lead the next chapter of energy abundance and American prosperity,” Cox said in a statement announcing the alliance. “Today, we brought together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to chart the course for nuclear energy. Our new compact strengthens our shared commitment to aggressively pursue more affordable, reliable energy across state lines.”
According to Cox’s office, the states agreed in the MOU to collaborate on:

Aligning energy policies to support innovation and private investment.
Coordinating the development of critical energy infrastructure.
Jointly navigating regulatory and environmental challenges.
Advocating for federal support of regional energy priorities.
Enhancing energy resilience and grid reliability.

 Utah, Idaho National Laboratory establish ‘formal, long-term collaboration’

The tri-state agreement comes the day after Utah officials and the Idaho National Laboratory — one of 17 national labs in the U.S. Department of Energy complex that’s focused on nuclear research — signed a memorandum of understanding Monday evening after ceremoniously signing a slate of energy bills Utah lawmakers passed earlier this year.
The MOU between Utah leaders and the Idaho National Laboratory establishes a “formal, long-term collaboration on advanced energy research, workforce development and technology deployment — particularly on nuclear innovation,” according to the governor’s office.

“This partnership will accelerate Utah’s efforts to become the nation’s nuclear hub,” Gov. Cox said in a prepared statement issued Monday evening. “By linking our universities, labs, and industry partners with the expertise of Idaho National Laboratory, we are strengthening our ability to serve Utahns with reliable and affordable energy.”
Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner, who signed the MOU, said he and other lab officials are “excited to partner with Utah to address urgent energy needs by focusing on advanced nuclear and energy innovation.”
“This partnership establishes a cooperative framework for scientific, technological and workforce development to help Utah realize an abundant, secure, resilient and competitive energy future,” he said.
The MOU, according to the Utah governor’s office, creates a “structural, interdisciplinary alliance” between Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory. It envisions Utah as establishing a new institute called the Advanced Nuclear Energy Institute as a “key coordinating hub” between the Idaho National Laboratory, Utah’s system of higher education, the Utah Office of Energy Development, and the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab.
“By linking the capabilities of INL with the talent and resources of Utah’s higher education institutions, this partnership positions Utah as a national leader in developing the next generation of clean, secure and resilient energy technologies,” the governor’s office said in Monday’s news release.
This new institute, state officials say, will enable Utah’s universities to collaborate with other organizations to pursue federal research grants.
“Beyond academic research, the focus is on applied innovation — ensuring resources are used effectively to develop commercially viable, scalable technologies,” the governor’s office said. “This approach will accelerate the deployment of real-world energy solutions and help build a broader, more robust nuclear energy ecosystem in Utah and the surrounding region.”
 How will the state of Utah and the INL work together?

Through the MOU, state leaders say Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory will work together to:

Accelerate development of “next-generation” nuclear technologies.
Enhance scientific research in energy sectors.
Strengthen cybersecurity and physical security for energy infrastructure.
Build up the workforce needed to meet demands of a future energy economy.

The Utah Legislature’s top Republican leaders applauded the move as crucial for Utah’s future.
“Affordable, reliable energy is the driving force behind Utah’s prosperity — powering everything from the lights in Utahns homes to the unstoppable growth of the state’s vibrant economy,” Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said in a prepared statement. “As energy demands increase and technologies rapidly evolve, we as a state are committed to staying ahead of the curve through strategic partnership that ensures both innovation and stability.”
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said Utah “is leading the way with smart, strategic investments in our energy future.”
“This partnership drives innovation and keeps energy reliable and affordable for Utah families and businesses,” Schultz said. “It’s about long-term solutions that protect our economy and strengthen our position as a national energy leader.”

But ultimately Allen’s story ended in tragedy, after Marko said Child Protective Services, or CPS, failed to act on multiple occasions.
“The warning bells had been going off for years, and nothing was done,” Marko told lawmakers, saying that when Allen was 2 months old, CPS was aware he had been beaten, sustaining a black eye and abrasions to his genitalia, and was living in a home with no beds.
“It was rat infested. The rats had actually eaten through the pack and play that him and his siblings had been left in and [the rats had] eaten holes in the pack and play,” Marko said.
In this instance, Allen and his siblings were removed from the home, but were later placed back with their mother, Marko said, adding that two months later Allen was found with burns on his hands when CPS came to the home again.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Marko is one of the attorneys working on a lawsuit filed a month ago against employees of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, Children’s Protective Services Division. It outlines the multiple interactions Allen had with CPS, with evidence reflecting that Allen was rendered blind and suffered from frequent vomiting due to frequent physical abuse.
“Defendants were entrusted with the duty of protecting this vulnerable child from harm and neglect and had the chance to intervene and diligently respond to the severity of the situation and the horrific nature of the allegations,” the lawsuit reads. “However, each time, Defendants left Chayce with or returned him soon after to his abusive mother.”
Residents of Michigan began to learn of the horrors Allen faced when law enforcement and other authorities discovered Allen’s body in a freezer during a wellness check in June of 2022. Law enforcement determined Allen had been dead for months and his mother, Azuradee France, 33, was sent to prison for second-degree murder.
The system needs to be fixed, Marko told lawmakers Tuesday.
“It’s hurting the people of the state of Michigan and for many there’s no justice… and the problem is that a lot of times, the state or the individuals who we entrust to protect these children don’t act and a lot of time they don’t do anything until it’s too late,” Marko said.
The state House Child Welfare System Committee has been looking into the state health department, where Child Protective Services is housed, for weeks, evaluating current policies within the department and hearing testimony from stakeholders. For the past two weeks, Members of the Office of the Auditor General have outlined areas of concern the office found in an audit in 2018 that it says persisted in a follow up evaluation in 2024, including what the office asserts are delays in CPS opening investigations that could lead to children being left in dangerous situations.
Even with Allen’s mother serving her sentence for her crimes, justice has not been served while the systems that were of the abuse and allowed it to continue go unchecked, chair of the committee Rep. Luke Meerman (R-Coopersville) said.
“Life is sacred and any life lost is a tragedy. When life is lost after CPS has become involved in a child’s care, it’s a blight on the state and the system responsible for that child’s care,” Meerman said.
It’s heartbreaking to see vulnerable adults and children continue to suffer after CPS or Adult Protective Services doesn’t intervene, Monroe County Sheriff Troy Goodnough told lawmakers.

Goodnough recalled details of the conditions two children in his jurisdiction have been living in since 2023, in which the family was found living in a tent during the winter both in 2023 and 2024, while the kids were covered in lice and hadn’t been to school in more than a year.
“I had two grown command officers come into my office saying we’ve got to do something, we’ve got to do something. They’ve not eaten. They’ve not bathed,” Goodnough said.
Despite multiple attempts to connect the family to CPS, Goodnough said his department has not heard from CPS on the case and has relied on a local church’s services to offer help to the family. It’s not sustainable for welfare services to ignore need in the state, Goodnough said, and something needs to change.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-29-at-4.34.08 PM-1024x579.png,,,2025-04-30 07:02:23.692946

Western tribal groups and environmentalists defend the recent ban on new Powder River Basin coal mining leases, but Trump and Wyoming covet a coal comeback.

On a cool morning in late February, Mark Fix was up before the sun to watch the Tongue River on his ranch in southeast Montana. He was concerned that a breaching ice dam could put his cattle and property in the path of rushing water carrying plates of ice the size of a dinner table.  
He was relieved to find that only his fencing and the riverbanks were damaged; his cattle were spooked but okay, he said. Across three decades of ranching on his property about 20 miles south of Miles City, Montana, Fix, who was born in Ekalaka, has grown accustomed to contending with threats from Mother Nature, but has also noticed them intensifying and accelerating.
“As I get older, it is harder to go through all of these unique climate change deals that we get hit with,” he said. About 10 years ago, a tornado ripped through Fix’s ranch, slashing through the roofs of his barn and home. He remembers winds reaching 100 miles per hour.
“I thought, ‘What the heck? We don’t have this kind of stuff in Montana.’”
In February, Northern Plains Resource Council, the Montana-based environmental organization Fix used to chair, joined other environmental groups and two tribes in a request filed with the U.S. District Court for Wyoming to allow them to join proceedings in a lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management over two resource management plans the agency issued last year. The lawsuit, however, wasn’t intended to fight the BLM’s plans, but to make sure the agency defends them.
The plans, one in its Buffalo, Wyoming office, the other in its Miles City, Montana office, directed the BLM to stop issuing new coal mining leases in the Powder River Basin, a mineral-rich formation straddling southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming.

The Northern Plains Resource Council was concerned that, with President Donald Trump back in the White House, the agency would not defend its resource management plans in court. It was joined by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, whose reservation lies atop the formation in southeast Montana, a group of environmental activists from the Navajo Nation, which holds mineral rights in the basin, and other environmental groups who shared that concern.
Then, in April, Trump signed an executive order aimed at rejuvenating U.S. coal, which has been hemorrhaging jobs and revenue for decades as mining has become more efficient, and utilities have switched to cheaper ways of generating electricity, like natural gas and, increasingly, even-cheaper wind and solar. Trump directed the Secretary of the Interior to prioritize coal leasing as “the primary land use for the public lands with coal resources,” required federal agencies to consider “revising or rescinding” federal actions that would transition the nation away from coal and signed a proclamation loosening air pollution restrictions for coal-fired power plants.
Coal mining appeared poised to make a comeback in the Powder River Basin.
A BLM spokesperson said in an email that the agency “is currently in the process of reviewing these resource management plans, as directed by relevant Executive and Secretarial orders,” and added in a separate email that “the BLM is committed to supporting the Trump administration’s prioritization of responsible energy development to make life more affordable for every American family while showing the world the power of America’s natural resources and innovation.”
Yet, burning coal is one of the most expensive ways of generating electricity, behind only nuclear energy and gas-fired “peaker plants,” according to one estimate.
“We’ll continue to try and defend these plans until, essentially, they no longer exist.”Melissa Hornbein, Western Environmental Law Center
The Trump administration is “seeking to undo [the two resource management plans] and they want to promulgate a new decision consistent” with Trump’s energy policy, said Melissa Hornbein, an attorney for the Western Environmental Law Center, which is representing several of the parties seeking to intervene in the Montana and Wyoming suit. Since Trump was sworn in in January, Hornbein said the federal government has been filing motions to stay cases that would require the Trump administration to defend policies enacted when Biden was president, which could happen in the effort to preserve the BLM’s Buffalo and Miles City resource management plans. 
“We’ll continue to try and defend these plans until, essentially, they no longer exist,” she said.
Wyoming is confident those plans will be replaced. In early March, state house lawmaker Scott Heiner, representing parts of Lincoln, Sweetwater and Uinta counties in southwest Wyoming, told Cowboy State Daily that Wyoming was beginning to study building a new “coal-fired plant” using $10 million in state-taxpayer dollars to help fund a yet-to-be-announced project.

“With the new administration, I think they will overturn that [resource management plan] in Buffalo,” the BLM field office that halted new coal leases in northeast Wyoming, “and I think there will be more opportunities to mine coal here in Wyoming,” he told Inside Climate News. Under Trump, Heiner sees “a chance to revitalize coal mining.”
The Powder River Basin, where mining companies report billions in annual revenue and hundreds of millions in profit, produces 41% of U.S. coal, according to Energy Information Administration data from 2022. For decades, while coal from the Powder River Basin was shipped across the U.S. as fuel for electricity plants, communities in Northeastern Wyoming benefited from the industry’s tax revenue. 
But, the tensions between coal’s local benefits and its costliness, dirtiness and production of greenhouse gases warming the climate means it faces an uncertain future, even under the auspices of a friendly Trump administration, leading some communities in the region to begin trying to diversify their economy beyond the thermal coal industry.
Still, for many on the ground, that future still includes mining coal.
Defending ‘good decisions’
Environmentalists and native groups who want to see the latest BLM resource management plans remain in place say that the environmental harms that come from mining and burning coal disqualify its continued extraction. 
“For over 100 years we’ve been affected by different types of resource extraction on our land,” said Robyn Jackson, executive director with Diné C.A.R.E, an environmental nonprofit located in the southwest’s four-corners region within the Navajo Nation. Jackson, who is Diné, the tribal name for Navajo people, said any benefits from mineral extraction — typically from the Navajo leasing land to companies — pale in comparison to “the cumulative impact of that to our air, our water, our land and the public health.”
Even though Jackson does not live near the Powder River Basin, she is worried about the Navajo footprint there. Navajo Transitional Energy Company, an energy company whose sole shareholder is the Navajo Nation, has three coal mines in the Powder River Basin, whose coal spreads below the Crow and Northern Cheyenne reservations in Montana. 
“​​We’re disappointed in the direction [NTEC is] taking of more fossil fuel development, of not limiting their carbon emissions — and especially with coal that does not seem to be a long-term source of revenue for our tribe” as demand for it continues to fall worldwide, Jackson said. “They need to be addressing the climate crisis, not emitting more carbon emissions, not emitting more greenhouse gases. And, really, they should be finding other sources of revenue that are going to be sustainable in the long term.”
The notion that one tribe could be detrimentally affecting another is part of the reason Diné C.A.R.E. has moved to defend the BLM’s decision to stop issuing future coal leases. NTEC’s operations in the basin are “exploitative towards other tribes and impacts their ancestral traditional lands, traditional cultural properties,” Jackson said.
The Northern Cheyenne, the Crow tribe and NTEC did not return interview requests.

Facing headwinds, Wyoming coal industry ‘cautiously optimistic’ about Trump administration 



Fix, the Montana rancher, is concerned that more coal mining will continue to worsen the effects of climate change, and he called the BLM’s decision to stop issuing new leases in the region “common sense” in a press release announcing the motion to intervene.
“This coal will probably never be developed because we’re going to renewables,” he said. “We got better ways to do things now than coal.”
While renewable energy has grown significantly in market share, natural gas has been the primary culprit for coal’s declining demand over the last decade.
If the Trump administration moves to stay the case or begins issuing new resource management plans in Miles City and Buffalo, a time-consuming endeavor, the environmental and tribal groups plan to continue fighting new coal mine leases.
“There were some good decisions that happened in the prior administration and we can’t let that go,” Jackson said.
A Mining Rebirth?
There are some in the region who hope to see coal mining continue, even if it’s never used to generate electricity. The current BLM management plans are “not good plans for us,” said Rusty Bell, director of Gillette’s office of economic transformation, who is working on diversifying the region’s economy. Bell said that Campbell County had received a grant from the Economic Development Administration under President Biden to build the Wyoming Innovation Center in Gillette, which researches ways to use coal for commercially viable products, like bricks, instead of using it as fuel to generate electricity. Ending mining in the Powder River Basin contradicts that effort, Bell said.
“Why would they, you know, allow us to do research on our resource, and then tell us we can’t use our resource?” asked Bell. “It doesn’t make sense.”
Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association, agreed with Bell. “We have to have access to our coal resource, and we have to have access to our resource far into the future,” he said.
Fix doesn’t want Powder River Basin coal mined for uses besides combustion. “A lot of our aquifers are in that coal,” he said. Mining removes water from the subsurface, limiting ranchers’ ability to water their cattle nearby. “It doesn’t matter what you develop it for, you still end up taking the water away.”
Deti estimated that current mining operations in the basin will cover the demand for its coal for the next 15 years, but almost all of that supply is already spoken for. New mining would pave the way for another coal plant to come online in Wyoming.
“It’s a pretty exciting time for the coal industry,” he said.
“Trump came in and gave carte blanche authority to the big coal corporations and said ‘the heck with all the little guys—all the guys working the land trying to make a living.’”Mark Fix, Montana rancher
Such a facility would be the first new coal-fired plant built in the U.S. in over a decade, and would be the first in Wyoming to include carbon capture, potentially increasing the cost to consumers, but providing a new, marketable resource — carbon dioxide.
“CO2 is valuable, and it can be used,” Deti said. He pointed to “enhanced oil recovery,” whereby a company injects CO2 underground to stimulate an oilfield’s production, as such an example.
Deti said he does not necessarily believe carbon dioxide is contributing to climate change, but if limiting CO2 in electricity production is where the market is heading, “there’s no reason you can’t do it” to continue digging up and burning coal, he said. 
Fix does not share Deti’s optimism. 
“Trump came in and gave carte blanche authority to the big coal corporations and said ‘the heck with all the little guys — all the guys working the land trying to make a living,’” Fix said. “Corporate America gets a bye, and the rest of us are going to have a hell of a time.”
He worries that more mining in the area will drive multi-generational ranchers off the land, but found some solace in the tricky economics of coal, which may keep mining companies from opening up new pits in the Powder River Basin. And he had a message for Trump and federal land managers who want more coal mining in the Powder River Basin. 
“Stop giving handouts to the corporate coal mines,” he said. “Don’t just take care of your rich friends. Take care of everyone.”

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)Department of Corrections Secretary Jared Hoy took questions from lawmakers on the Assembly Corrections Committee Tuesday, explaining the plan for Gov. Tony Evers’ about $500 million state budget request. 
Hoy previously defended the proposal to the Joint Finance Committee prior to which co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) had expressed concerns that the plan lacked detail.
About $325 million in Evers’ proposal would go to overhaul the state’s correctional facilities through a “domino” plan — starting with work to close Lincoln Hills School for Boys and Copper Lake School for Girls, which were initially supposed to close in 2021 under 2018 Act 185, and culminating in the closure of the Green Bay Correctional Institution. 
“There are a lot of issues with running facilities that are that old,” Hoy said about the Green Bay facility, which was built in 1898. It would cost about $6.3 million for the closure. “We shouldn’t be running prisons in that manner in 2025… We want to do more with our population than what those facilities can afford us to do.”
Under the plan, Waupun Correctional Institution would be closed temporarily for renovations, including replacing the existing cells with modern housing for 600 medium-security beds and establishing space for a “vocational village.” The work on Waupun would cost about $245.3 million and be ready to open in 2031.
“If we are going to keep Waupun open, we are going to completely flip the script. We are going to rewrite the narrative of Waupun,” Hoy said.
Hoy said that the idea wouldn’t be far from turning the Waupun facility into a “college campus” where inmates can receive vocational, career and technical education. 
“They’re living in community together. They’re going to school together. They’re studying in the evenings together, and it’s predicated on robust partnerships with the community so that we have manufacturers out in the community who come in to do the training on site,” Hoy said. 
Other infrastructure funding would include $130 million to complete construction of a Type 1 youth facility in Dane County, which would be necessary to close Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake schools, $9 million to convert Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake into a 500-bed facility for men, $8.8 million to convert Stanley Correctional Institution to a maximum-security institution and $56 million to expand Sanger B. Powers Correctional Center by 200 beds.
Committee Chair Rep. Dean Kaufert (R-Neenah) asked how DOC considered future budgets and whether there would be increases to the cost.
“It’s not the full cost of capital and programming for the future, so there’s a cost that is going to be harder to quantify when you build this, and you get it up and running,” Kaufert said.
Hoy said that closing Green Bay would actually represent a significant decrease in operating budget and updating Waupun would also lead to some decreases.
“Operating Waupun is quite cost prohibitive because [of] the number of staff that you need to run those aging facilities,” Hoy said. “Running a smaller facility at Waupun…requires less staffing, as well as shutting down Green Bay, your overall operating budget starts to offset [needing] more staff at Sanger Powers [Correctional Center]” to help with the additional beds.
Hoy also addressed some of the policy changes meant to address the growing prison population. Wisconsin’s prison population as of February was 23,074 and is expected to grow to 24,000 by the end of the biennium, despite the state only having capacity to house 17,638 people across its correctional facilities.
“About a third of our entire population is nonviolent in our prisons, and so we have existing programs that help people get the treatment, get the support and get them back out the door in a timely manner,” Hoy said. “One of the main mechanisms we have to do that at our disposal is the earned release program.” 
Evers’ plan would expand access to the state’s Earned Release Program to allow an additional 2,500 participants. The plan would expand access to workforce training and substance use treatment for people who have 48 months or less left in their sentences for nonviolent offenses  to support this. 
Rep. Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison) asked if the state is hitting a “tipping point” when it comes to its prison population. 
“Are we at the point of even thinking about sending people to other jails? Are we thinking about sending people out of state?” Stubbs asked. “Our incarceration numbers right now… are very high.” 
Hoys said that would be a “nuclear” option, given that it would take people away from their families and community. 
“I have no intention, no desire to send people out of state,” Hoys said, but added that “at some point our options are going to run out.” 
Hoys said DOC is leveraging jail contracts as much as it can and noted that one change that is being sought in the budget is an increase to the daily rate. Right now, he said the rate is capped at $60 a day and he wants that bumped to $80 to match the rate for federal inmates. 
“If I’m a sheriff and I’m looking at taking in-state guys versus federal guys or women for that matter, I’m going to choose the federal folks because the price tag [is] better,” Hoy said. “I want to be able to have that as a resource. Again, I’d like to keep everybody in our facilities as opposed to county jails, but that is a safety valve for us that we currently do utilize.” 
Kaufert, who was newly elected to his seat in November, noted that during his previous tenure in the state Legislature in the 1990s, lawmakers on the corrections committee toured facilities in other states where Wisconsin inmates were being held.
“I don’t want to make that mistake again,” Kaufert said. 
Rep. Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere) asked whether DOC would at least consider building a new facility to replace the Green Bay one. He added that he recently spoke to the Brown County sheriff, who said there are hundreds of people at home on ankle bracelets because there just isn’t enough space. 
“I want to commend the governor for acknowledging that that needs to go away — GBCI,” Franklin said. 
“We definitely did look… but to just replace Green Bay [maximum] facility — same size, same number of beds — you’re approaching a billion dollars, if not more,” Hoy said, adding that the state  also got an estimate of about $800 million for a smaller facility. 
“If I was looking across our population right now, and we were packed to the gills with violent offenders… I wouldn’t be saying, no, let’s not build anything. I’d be saying… we need to make sure our communities are safe and continue to house these people,” Hoy said. “But when I’m sitting on, you know, a third of 23,000 people that are non-violent… I believe it’s not only the right thing to do, but fiscally responsible to give those folks a chance in the community.” 
Rep. Jerry O’Connor (R-Fond Du Lac) asked how far up DOC is on Evers’ priority list. Noting the University of Wisconsin system budget and the public K-12 funding challenges, he said that everyone is seeking funding from the same pot of money. Wisconsin has a $4 billion budget surplus and Evers had suggested raising taxes on the wealthiest Wisconsinites. 
“I think we’re pretty close to the top, and I’m not just saying that because I’m the secretary of DOC. I mean I think it’s one of his biggest priorities,” Hoy said. 
Kaufert expressed interest in having more committee hearings with DOC about the plan. 
“There’s so many arms and legs on this that one impacts the other,” Kaufert said, adding that they could break it down to have more time to speak about all the pieces. He noted that if they are spending hundreds of millions and ending up with less beds, they better have “darn good answers” for taxpayers.

A modern Wyoming fable with a naked moral: Save all the parts.
The post A political conversation with a Mayan knife-fighter appeared first on WyoFile .","I bumped into my old friend Nicky Chiffon at the Clown’s Den south of Cheyenne the other night. We hadn’t seen each other in decades, so we had some catchin’ up to do. Back in the day, we stole horses and smuggled contraband together, so we had a bond.

Opinion

He is a strange cat, so I’ll have to explain Nicky to you. His ancestors were Mayan priests and priestesses, and they passed down to Nicky the secret rituals of human sacrifice as practiced in the Yucatan. When we first met, he was the reigning welterweight knife-fighting champion of the Caribbean.
Always a rabid Broncos fan, Nicky was heartbroken when John Elway retired, so he cloistered himself in a Maoist transgender nunnery in the Red Desert. He taught switchblade tactics to the sisters and dabbled in blackbone voodoo. He recently wore out his welcome and was 86ed from the convent for being “ideologically unsound,” hence our reunion.
We found a sticky little table in a dark corner of the strip joint and discussed the deconstructionist politics of 21st-century America as we sipped our Everclear smoothies. Nicky, an astute student of collapsed civilizations, waxed prophetic about the U. S. of A.
“You had it all, amigo. You built it up ‘til you were on top of the pyramid. And now you’re tearing it all down just because some weird rich guy is pissed off at everything. The feathered serpent god is not pleased, compadre.” Nicky sucked on his straw with hollowed cheeks, and added, “I see dark days ahead, if you don’t wake up pronto. Dark days.”
I looked nonplussed, so he continued. “Think about it, cabrón. You fought a revolution so common people could have power, and now you’re giving that power to wealthy corporations. Caramba! How stupid is that?”
That made me take a big slug from my own glass of Everclear.
“It took you 250 years to create all these magnificent democratic institutions,” he said, “and now you’re getting rid of them because they annoy the upper class. See what I mean?”
I asked Nicky for specific examples.
“Okay,” he said, rising to the task. “The U.S. is supposed to be a country that welcomes new ideas, right? Americans always say they support freedom of thought and expression.” I must have nodded in agreement, because he went on. “Then why are you allowing the government to ban books and accuse libraries of sedition, just because powerful oligarchs don’t like what’s written down? That don’t make no sense.”
I ordered another round as Nicky warmed to the subject.
“And you created the judicial branch so that you’d be governed by laws, not a king. But here you are, arresting judges just because they don’t toe a political line. What would your Founding Fathers think about that horseshit?”
Nicky’s brow sweated and veins throbbed at his temple when he said, “And you stand around like peasants when your president threatens to jail anyone who protests against him. It’s almost like you’re willing to pay extra for British tea these days.”
At that point, the jukebox began playing Dylan’s “The Times They Are A-Changin’” and the stripper slowly twirled around her pole.
“Listen, Nicky,” I said, “these are changing times. Don’t be so hard on us.”
“Times change, sí. But some things shouldn’t.” He regarded me with those obsidian Mayan eyes. “If you throw away everything that made you great, you discard your foundation. Then your civilization is built on quicksand or goat manure. If something needs fixed, then fix it. But the first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the parts.”
Nicky’s straw made a slurping sound as he sucked up the last of his hooch. He banged his fist on the table for more and said, “My grandpa taught me that rule. I bet yours did, too. If my ancestors, the Mayans, or even the Romans, or the Sumerians, had followed that rule, they’d still be around today. Don’t throw away the good stuff!”
We tried to drink the Clown’s Den dry that night, and in our younger days, we could have. But we have mellowed with age, Nicky Chiffon and I, so we stumbled out the door and parted with our secret handshake. Nicky limped off to his next adventure, while I stood gazing up into the dark American night.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Smart, progressive women pose a serious threat to MAGA supremacy. Just ask Elon Musk, who wasted millions of dollars in Wisconsin trying to win a seat on the state Supreme Court for MAGA candidate Brad Schimel, only to watch Susan Crawford clean Schimel’s clock.
From his first presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016, “Lock her up!” has been Donald Trump’s battle cry. Restoring the greatness of a white, male-dominated America apparently requires menacing displays of dominance over women in positions of authority. Who can forget Trump acting like a stalker, invading Clinton’s personal space and looming behind her during a 2016 debate?
On Friday, a few weeks after MAGA lost its bid to disempower the progressive female majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the Trump administration sent federal agents to arrest Hannah Dugan at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Trump’s attorney general and the man he chose to lead the FBI gleefully posted pictures of Dugan’s “perp walk” in handcuffs, crowing about this unprecedented assault on the dignity and authority of a judge and the sovereignty of local courts.
On Tuesday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended Dugan. “In order to uphold the public’s confidence in the courts of this state during the pendency of the criminal proceeding against Judge Dugan, we conclude, on our own motion, that it is in the public interest that she be temporarily relieved of her official duties,” the state’s highest court said in a two-page letter ordering Judge Dugan “temporarily prohibited from exercising the powers of a circuit court judge.”
It’s a perplexing decision. It didn’t arise from any complaint; the Court acted on its own. And Dugan had already been relieved of her duties while she focuses on her defense by the chief judge in Milwaukee, who assigned her calendar to other judges to cover.
Worse, the suspension gives the impression that the federal charges against Dugan are indeed serious. But that impression is not supported by the only evidence the government has produced.
The justification for Dugan’s arrest, laid out in a federal criminal complaint, is that she impeded federal law enforcement agents when she objected to ICE disrupting her court’s proceedings and ushered the man they came to arrest out a side door. The defendant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who was appearing before Dugan on a misdemeanor battery charge unrelated to his immigration status, exited into the public hallway where the agents were waiting for him. Then they followed him outside and made their arrest — unimpeded.
Fox News claimed Dugan concealed Flores-Ruiz in a jury room. But that assertion is contradicted by the sworn testimony in the government’s own criminal complaint. 
The complaint features breathlessly sexist descriptions of Dugan appearing “visibly angry” and “walking quickly,” as if that were evidence of wrongdoing. But any actual wrongdoing is hard to pinpoint.
“Whatever you think of the actual conduct the complaint alleges,” says Dean Strang, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and a long-time Wisconsin criminal defense lawyer, “there is a real question about whether there’s even arguably any federal crime here.” 
The government’s behavior, meanwhile, is “extraordinarily atypical,” for a nonviolent, nondrug charge involving someone who is not a flight risk, says Strang.
The handcuffs, the public arrest at Dugan’s workplace, the media circus — none of it was normal, or justified. Then Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel began posting pictures of Dugan in handcuffs on social media to brag about it.
“So what is it they are trying to do?” asks Strang. His conclusion: “Humiliate and terrify, not just her but every other judge in the country.”
The bigger issue here, beyond an unprecedented, public display of dominance and intimidation by the Trump administration, is that, in turning federal law enforcement into an arm of his personal, vengeance-themed reality show, Trump is running roughshod over the constitutional principle of federalism, which respects the sovereignty of the states, the integrity of the courts and public safety. Scaring defendants, witnesses and victims away from making court appearances makes it harder to administer justice and makes all of us less safe.
But you’d never know that to listen to Republican state officials, who are championing federal agents barging into courts, schools and churches, forgetting everything they ever said about local control and states’ rights. In a letter released Tuesday, Assembly Republicans led by Speaker Robin Vos sent a letter to Gov. Tony Evers, declaring “our caucus believes it is imperative that our laws reflect the need for local law enforcement to comply with these efforts.”
Republicans accuse Evers of issuing guidance to state officials that impedes federal ICE raids.
 “Unfortunately, recent events in Milwaukee have underscored the importance for our state to legislate and enforce compliance with federal immigration law,” their letter declares, citing Dugan’s arrest.
The Republicans demand that Evers rescind guidance telling state agencies that they need not answer questions, hand over files, or allow ICE to enter non-public areas without a warrant.
Capitulating to an administration that has admitted to deporting U.S. citizens and defied court orders to effect the return of a man it admits was mistakenly sent to a Salvadoran prison is a terrible idea. Big law firms that agreed to drop clients and offer free legal work to appease the Trump administration have eroded trust in the law. Authoritarian undermining of our legal system is a grave danger.
The least the most timid among us can do is insist that the federal government follow the law before caving in. That’s what Dugan did, when she asked if the agents who came to her courtroom to arrest Flores-Ruiz had a judicial warrant. They did not. Nor do they have proof that Dugan herself broke any laws.
The last thing we need right now is more capitulation to MAGA bullying. Stand strong.

Applicants for REAL IDs need to provide the Department of Finance and Administration with four different forms of identification:

A current driver’s license, state-issued ID, or school or work ID as proof of identity
A passport or birth certificate as proof of legal presence in the United States
A government-issued social security card
Two documents providing proof of address, such as utility bills or bank statements, issued within the last six months

The documents “all have to sync up,” Finance Secretary Jim Hudson said last week.
Transgender and nonbinary Arkansans might have changed their names or gender information on some but not all legal documents, and state policies have made it difficult for these groups of people to obtain documents that accurately reflect who they are, advocates say. Birth certificates can be legally altered, and until this year, the federal government allowed gender-neutral information on U.S. passports.
“The government has played politics with people’s lives and upended people’s ability to accurately and properly identify themselves,” said Holly Dickson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas. “This has created much chaos and turmoil for no good reason while making life harder and more unsafe for all of us.”
Last year, the ACLU of Arkansas led a lawsuit against the DFA’s decision to stop issuing gender-neutral driver’s licenses. The case was dropped after Arkansas officials permanently adopted the new policy, which prohibits the use of an “X” to indicate someone’s gender in place of “M” or “F.”
Arkansans urge state finance department not to reverse gender-neutral driver’s license policy

Several transgender and nonbinary Arkansans, including Maggs Gallup of Little Rock, urged the finance department to maintain the previous policy, which had been in place for 14 years. Gallup said in an interview Monday that they are putting off obtaining a REAL ID in case doing so requires the state to remove the X gender marker from their driver’s license.
Hudson told lawmakers that a driver’s license is “not a platform for speech” and “not a platform for personal identity.” Gallup disagreed, saying their gender-neutral ID is important to them and putting incorrect information on an ID is “a deeply incongruent thing to do.”
“In an ideal world, it would be great to have the state and officials recognize our gender,” Gallup said. “They don’t get to determine who we are, no matter what letters we put on our IDs.”
REAL IDs began with a law passed by Congress in 2005 as a response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Instituting REAL IDs statewide “will help fight terrorism and reduce identity fraud,” according to the finance department website.
The federal Transportation Security Administration accepts passports in place of REAL IDs as identification to board a flight. Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, a well-known transgender advocate who lives in Little Rock, said last week on Facebook that she was initially denied access to a flight because she has an X on her driver’s license, but she was allowed to board after displaying her passport containing a male gender marker.
Griffin-Gracy is 78 years old and gender-nonconforming, and she was present at the 1969 Stonewall riot between LGBTQ+ people and police in New York City. In her Facebook video, she expressed disbelief that her passport was accepted even though she did not appear masculine. She also said “we the people” should “stand up and fight” President Donald Trump’s administration, which does not recognize gender-neutral IDs.
Gallup said they are also concerned about potential limits on travel, both domestic and international, with or without a REAL ID. Their teenage child is old enough to learn to drive but is putting off obtaining a learner’s permit because of potential bureaucratic obstacles due to their gender-nonconforming identity, Gallup said.
Bill regulating transgender Arkansans’ bathroom use heads to House despite public pushback

“This is just one part of a larger, really complicated network of new rules and legislation that are challenging to navigate” for transgender and nonbinary Arkansans, Gallup said.
State lawmakers and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders approved a law this month that will allow Arkansans to sue for damages if they encounter someone in a bathroom, changing room, shelter or correctional facility who does not align with the “designated sex” of the space.
The state has also enacted laws in the past few years that ban transgender girls from playing girls’ sports, require public school students to use bathrooms that match their gender assigned at birth, regulate pronoun use in schools and allow doctors who provide transgender minors’ health care to be sued for medical malpractice.

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signs state’s largest income tax cut into law

The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”













It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state.


– David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst





Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 ‘Generational change’ to taxes

While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said. That includes Idaho.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Dominated by a series of tax cuts, Idaho Legislature adjourns 2025 legislative session

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville with attorney Ben Rose, left. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The trio charged in a Tennessee political corruption case shared text messages in early 2020 complaining about the state’s failure to pay a mysterious vendor for work on lawmakers’ constituent mailers, at one point cursing the administrator in charge of handling invoices.
One text message from former Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson to ex-Speaker of the House Glen Casada said, “Connie’s a bi—.” Casada responded, “Agreed!”
Smith, who pleaded guilty in the fraud and kickback case and is cooperating with federal prosecutors, was referring to now-retired Legislative Administration Director Connie Ridley, who handled payments for the state’s postage and printing program for lawmakers. Ridley held up payments because of problems with W-9 tax forms by the vendor, Phoenix Solutions, which was run by former legislative aide Cade Cothren, and Casada, testimony showed.
Smith testified she was “highly frustrated” because Ridley approved work without having the federal tax documents on hand. Eventually, Cothren sent the state a W-9 signed as “Matthew Phoenix,” one of the key documents prosecutors are using in the case to show deception by Smith, Casada and Cothren to direct business to Phoenix Solutions without state officials or lawmakers knowing who was behind the company.
Casada and Cothren had stepped down from their posts at different points in 2019 because of a racist and sexist texting scandal. Casada remained in the General Assembly but not as House speaker.

Another text displayed for the jury Tuesday showed the state had paid for work on a lawmaker’s constituent mailer but didn’t include taxes.
Smith and Cothren sent each other “incredulous” text messages and Smith added another one saying, “Quite the bullsh–.”
Smith, former chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, met with Ridley to speed up payments in February 2020 when the state owed Phoenix Solutions $34,000 for work on several Republican lawmakers’ constituent mailers, including now-former Rep. Patsy Hazlewood of Signal Mountain, Rep. Dan Howell of Cleveland, Rep. Esther Helton-Haynes of East Ridge, Rep. Dennis Powers of Jacksboro, Rep. Susan Lynn of Mt. Juliet, Rep. Bud Hulsey of Bristol, Rep. Chris Hurt of Halls, Rep. Andrew Farmer of Sevierville and Smith and Casada.
Ridley testified earlier this week she didn’t find out Phoenix Solutions was run by Cothren until May 2020 when federal authorities told her to continue processing the New Mexico-based company’s invoices.
Earlier Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson ruled that prosecutors can present evidence showing the trio wanted to expand from constituent mailers, which are paid for with tax money, to House Republican Caucus work. Defense attorneys argued that the prosecutors should be limited to evidence about the postage and printing program because it is outlined in the indictment, not an effort to tap into caucus funds.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Casada-4-29-25-004-1024x778.jpg,,,2025-04-30 06:06:12.368474

(Photo by ICE)Lawmakers in the North Carolina House voted Tuesday to expand requirements for county sheriffs to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a move that Republicans say closes “loopholes” in an immigration law passed last year.
The 2024 law required sheriffs to comply with ICE “detainers” — or requests to notify the agency before an undocumented immigrant is released from law enforcement’s custody, regardless of whether they are convicted.
House Bill 318 expands on that requirement, forcing sheriffs to contact ICE in cases where a person is charged with any felony, as well as high-level misdemeanors. And it requires the sheriffs to notify the agency when a detainer is about to expire.
The bill intends to root out “loopholes” that Republicans say several sheriffs have used to avoid complying with ICE — most prominently in Mecklenburg County, where the city of Charlotte is located.
“We’re closing loopholes because five or so sheriffs have refused to cooperate,” said Rep. Brian Echevarria (R-Cabarrus).
Democratic opponents to the bill called it a violation of due process.
“You cannot detain your way to public safety,” said Rep. Maria Cervania (D-Wake), who recounted Tuesday her experience of being stopped on the road by law enforcement and threatened with ICE detention, despite being born in the U.S.
The bill passed the House, 70-45. Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg), who cited an uptick in overdose deaths in the county, joined Republicans in supporting the measure.

(Photo: Getty Images)Let’s talk weed! You know, pot, grass, dope, herb, skunk, ganja, reefer, maryjane, cheeba. (Cheeba?) Always on brand, Republicans at the state capitol put the bulk of their energy during the session that just wrapped pursuing craven new ways to ravage immigrant families and bully non-straight-white people. But they did manage to spare some time for the subject of cannabis, resulting in adoption of a big clunker of a new wacky baccy regulatory scheme.
The cannabis state of play in Tennessee is strange and confusing, as those who produce or partake understand but others may not fully appreciate. Ours is among the minority of states where marijuana remains wholly illegal to cultivate, distribute, or possess, even for medical purposes, with criminal penalties for violations. And yet forms of cannabis that will get you plenty stoned are readily available in several forms for perfectly legal purchase and use.
The simple story of how this came to be: The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the definition of marijuana in federal law. Hemp plants are cannabis plants with very low concentrations of THC: under 0.3% means it’s “hemp” and it’s legal everywhere, while over 0.3% makes it “marijuana,” a controlled substance in federal law. And just as hemp as a plant isn’t illegal in legislatively pot-hostile places like Tennessee, neither are its constituent compounds, like the (very small amount of) THC it contains.
Hemp industry fears slate of restrictive bills could gut industry

That led enterprising ganjapreneurs to figure out how to extract THC from low-THC hemp and embed it in the kinds of cannabis products (like edible gummies and smokable concentrates) found in states with full legalization. To avoid getting too deep in the weeds (yes I went there and I’m not proud of it) I’m omitting details around THC variations THCa, delta 8. and delta 9). The point is you can buy a gummy with 10 mg of THC in Metropolis, Illinois where recreational marijuana is legal, or you can buy a 10 mg gummy in Nashville where it isn’t, and both will do the trick. The difference is that in Tennessee the ingredients will say “hemp-derived THC.”
The Tennessee Legislature waded into this free-for-all of stoner innovation two years ago with a bill regulating the production and distribution of “hemp-derived cannabinoids.” With bipartisan support, the 2023 measure created licensing, testing, labeling, and selling requirements for hemp-derived products, spelled out criminal offenses for violations, and put in place a tax on sales to fund enforcement. Sure sounds like regulation, right?
Yet just two years later GOP lawmakers said we have unregulated recreational pot, so they wrote this year’s big do-over bill adding new regulations, levying new taxes, and shifting enforcement of the whole shebang to a different part of state government. Most significantly, it narrows the definition of hemp-derived products in ways that may force the industry to abandon some offerings (until they figure out how to innovate around it).
In Senate committee testimony back in February, two hemp-related business owners said the bill will “wipe out” their industry. Looking at the specifics of the bill and the composition of their products I’d say “wipe out the industry” is a tad hyperbolic, but hempsters are not wrong to call the bill a recklessly crafted threat to a growing industry that contributes meaningfully to the state’s agricultural (and jamband) economy.
The backers of this year’s bill blended reefer madness tactics with puzzling non sequiturs to justify their crackdown. “I think the public does believe that small children should not be taking this,” Sen. Richard Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, freely associated with the committee last month. Apropos of who-the-hell-knows-what, Briggs lamented on the Senate floor ahead of final passage that the pot was much mellower at Woodstock compared to what you find now in Nashville. On the House side, sponsor Rep. William Lamberth, a Portland Republican,) declared that “what we do with these products can change lives for the better or worse significantly.” I have no idea what that means.

The arguments for keeping Tennessee in the column of retrograde states afraid of adult recreational pot may be murky, but there is clarity in public opinion on the other side. A Vanderbilt poll in late 2024 shows Tennessee voters favoring legalization for recreational use by almost two to one (a 63-36% margin), including majorities of both Republicans (53%) and Democrats (78%). Back in 2018 support for recreational access was just 37% in an MTSU poll, so Tennesseans have come a long way on this issue as they have watched other states legalize.
The Tennessee state house is practiced at legislating against majority preferences, a relevant option when an issue stretches tensions between individual rights and collective will. But legal pot is not that sort of issue—there are no relevant rights in play (other than the right to not consume cannabis, which needs no protection).
Tennessee is hardly the first state where elected lawmakers resist treating their adult citizens like adults on this issue. Of the more than two-dozen states that have legalized recreational weed, many got it done by going around their legislatures to legalize it through voter ballot initiative. There is little doubt that would work here as well — except for the pesky little fact that Tennessee’s constitution allows no citizen-activated ballot initiatives ever on any subject. So instead we’re stuck with a feckless legislature that chooses nanny-state provincialism over giving the people what they want. And what they want is to not have to drive to Metropolis, Illinois.

However, they’re noticeably absent throughout the Midwest. Local community leaders in Cleveland have called on the city to create an office of gun violence prevention, stating that a permanent investment in an office would make their work more effective.

In February, 10-year-old Lorenzo Roberson, dressed in a suit and tie, spoke passionately at a town hall meeting in Cleveland. He was there to address city leaders about how he and other kids feel about safety in their neighborhoods. Most importantly, though, he was there to remember his best friend, Kaden Coleman, who was shot and killed that same month as he sat in the backseat of a car in Mount Pleasant, eight miles south of downtown Cleveland.  
“I am Kaden because his spirit now lives within me. I am Kaden because I am 10 years old, too; I get good grades, too,” Lorenzo told a mix of residents and elected officials. “Will I have a chance to survive? Will my life be cut short, too?”
Then he posed a challenge to the audience: “Will the adults in this room make sure that I have a chance to grow?” 
His call for safety in the face of rising shooting rates among young people reflects the pervasive fear among people who live in Cleveland’s most turbulent neighborhoods, including Mount Pleasant, where Lorenzo lives. Despite a recent decline in shootings across the city, a handful of neighborhoods — Central, East Cleveland, Mount Pleasant and others  — experience disproportionate levels of violence. Homicide rates in those areas range from 25 to 57 per 100,000 residents compared to places that are as low as 0 to 15. All of the struggling neighborhoods are majority Black. 
To combat the burden of shootings on those communities, local leaders and activists have worked hard for decades to fill gaps, establishing intervention and prevention programs, doing outreach work among young people, and providing mental health support to those in need. Those methods seem to have contributed to the city’s overall decline, especially in the last few years. 
But people working to tackle gun crimes in Cleveland said local groups have fallen into silos as they each vie for funding, creating a competitive, uncoordinated response that they see as inadequate for addressing the shifting crisis. A localized Office of Gun Violence Prevention, they said, would help address that isolation — and curb shootings.
“We’ve seen how successful (these types of offices) have been in other cities. I think it would make a real difference,” said Laron Douglas, the executive director of Renounce Denounce, a community-based gang intervention program that works with kids in Cleveland.
Many cities across the country have created offices of gun violence prevention over the past several years. They coordinate local initiatives, fund programs, and help drive policy changes. Since President Donald Trump eliminated the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention in his first month in office, dozens of municipalities are proposing or creating their own, but local offices are notably scarce throughout the Midwest, where gun violence rates are higher than in some of the country’s largest cities. Several states in the region, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Wisconsin, have successfully established them; Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh is located, is one of the few counties to host one. 
“Having one dedicated gun violence prevention office will make us more intentional. The office would be able to call a family and deploy resources effectively,” said Myesha Watkins, who runs the Cleveland Peacemakers Alliance, an anti-violence group established in 2009 among a handful of still-active community groups. “There’s too many people who don’t know where to go for gun violence prevention.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe city has a variety of official violence prevention strategies, including the Neighborhood Safety Fund to invest in community violence prevention work; Cleveland Thrive, the city’s community-based violence intervention coalition; and the Mayor’s Office of Prevention, Intervention, and Opportunity, one of several offices addressing root causes of youth violence under the mayor’s “all-of-government” approach. Cleveland has also deployed a street outreach team from the Community Relations Board to do violence intervention work, and the Neighborhood Resources and Recreational Centers are involved with providing activity space for kids. 
Those efforts are helpful, but they’re not strategic enough, said City Council Member Richard Starr, who is a native of Central and represents several neighborhoods struggling with gun violence. “They don’t have a plan right now,” Starr said, noting the city’s handful of initiatives but lack of a concrete plan for tackling gun violence or measuring its trajectory. 
According to city data, Cleveland had a firearm death rate of 45 per 100,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year full data is available, an increase from 39 in 2022. In 2024, homicides declined to 113, from 156 in 2023, according to data from the city’s police department. Still, residents warn that the data doesn’t tell the full story. 
Data is “either going to create chaos or it’s going to create hope, and depending on the narrative, it can do either or it can do both,” Watkins said. “If we’re talking about our community members, they’ll see a post that homicides are down, but they’re not feeling that when they walk outside their homes.” 
Local leaders say the encouraging numbers shouldn’t dissuade engaged citizens from creating an office of violence prevention, especially when considering the areas most affected. Michael Houser, the Cuyahoga County Council Member for District 10, which includes some of Cleveland’s most gun violence-plagued neighborhoods, including East Cleveland, Cleveland Heights, and St. Clair Superior, has been pushing the county to build an office of violence prevention since his election last year, and hopes to work in partnership with Starr at the city-level to create one. 
The County Council is in talks to create one, but the question is how they’re going to fund it. “We find money to fund everything else,” Houser said. “So hopefully we will be able to find the funding for this very important initiative.” 
In Cleveland, Council Member Starr led the effort to declare gun violence a public health crisis, legislation which passed in the city council yesterday. Starr will now be able to use state and federal resources to fund an office. “You look at some of these other cities, they have plans and investment in how they’re going to curb violence. Cleveland is behind on that,” Starr said, pointing to Columbus, one of the few Midwest cities to have such an office.
Since its municipal office was created in 2023, Columbus has achieved what Starr and others hope to. They’ve taken a public health approach to gun violence, helped coordinate and strategize violence reduction programming between different local groups, and begun to measure and assess their progress (a report is coming in the next few months). 
“Columbus is flooded with (violence intervention groups) and we needed a way to streamline these groups to make sure they’re most effective and have access to funding,” said Rena Shak, the executive director of the Office of Violence Prevention in Columbus.  
That sort of strategizing is exactly what people want to see in Cleveland. 
“We have individuals and we have groups doing great work, but we need to find a way to bring people together,” said Michelle Bell, founder of M-PAC Cleveland, which provides resources to families and friends who’ve lost loved ones to gun violence. Bell remembers feeling like there was nowhere to turn after her son was shot and killed in 2019. “If people are saying we need this office, our officials and local leaders need to listen.”

Whether you’re running a small business, managing a classroom, serving in public office or raising a family, you’ve likely seen firsthand how quickly circumstances can change. At Idaho State University, we feel it too. But rather than retreat in the face of uncertainty, or freeze in place, we’re leaning in with courage, creativity and a deep sense of responsibility to the state of Idaho and its communities. 
Nowhere is that more evident than in ISU’s L.S. Skaggs College of Pharmacy, serving Idaho for over 100 years. 
Like many professional programs nationwide, market pressures in the pharmacy industry have caused enrollment declines over the past decade. For a state like Idaho, where access to health care is already strained, this is a serious concern. 
Many pharmacy programs in the U.S. have tried to just weather the storm, unwilling to respond or adapt. At ISU, forward-thinking administrators and faculty got to work. They asked hard questions, made tough decisions and reimagined what the future could look like. They pivoted. 
For the College of Pharmacy, their strategy in the face of enrollment changes was both simple and bold: tighten the belt, focus on excellence and stay true to our mission. The college began a multi-year “step-down” budget process to right-size operations while protecting core programs and positions. They eliminated vacancies through attrition, restructured contracts and found smart ways to reduce overhead and adjust student cohort sizes. Every decision was guided by a commitment to students, principles and patients, not bureaucracy or maintaining the status quo. 
And it’s working. Through disciplined planning, ISU’s College of Pharmacy is not only financially stable, but it’s innovating and thriving in a new environment while continuing to graduate skilled professionals. 
Take, for example, their expansion of clinical psychopharmacology. This master’s degree program trains licensed psychologists to prescribe medication safely and effectively, especially in underserved areas. Today, we have 22 students enrolled from across the country, and demand continues to grow. That’s a real impact, rooted in local need and national relevance. 
Or look at our hybrid delivery model. With campuses in Pocatello, Meridian and Anchorage, Alaska, in partnership with the University of Alaska Anchorage, our faculty teach and collaborate across thousands of miles, supporting students in rural communities and building tight-knit teams that defy geographic boundaries. They’ve turned a challenge into a strength.
What we’ve learned from ISU’s College of Pharmacy applies far beyond higher education. When circumstances shift, we can’t cling to the way things used to be. We need leaders at every level who are willing to adapt, focus on purpose and move forward with faith in the future. It also requires confidence in the mission and knowing what not to sacrifice or give up in pursuit of making a positive difference. 
At Idaho State University, our purpose is clear. We exist to serve Idaho. We prepare the next generation of pharmacists, nurses, teachers, engineers and business leaders while contributing to the creative arts and producing impactful research. We provide a return on investment that benefits every community, and we do this with fewer resources than most universities of our size. 
This year, as Idahoans consider the future of education and government, I hope our story adds something meaningful to the conversation. Higher education institutions can adapt; we can pivot while being true to the most important aspects of an educational mission. At our best, we are nimble, practical and deeply committed to solving real problems and contributing to society. 
We’re not perfect. But we’re listening. We’re learning. And we’re leading. 
In uncertain times, leadership isn’t about being the loudest voice in the room. It’s about showing up, making hard, but principled decisions, and exhibiting strength through resiliency. Because perseverance in tough times doesn’t just steady the ship, it charts a better, bolder course for the future.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.


Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)NEW ORLEANS – The City Council committee voted Monday to advance an ordinance that protects sex workers from prosecution and arrest when reporting a crime and to prevent admittance of condom possession as evidence for prostitution.
All four council members at Monday’s joint meeting of the Governmental Affairs and Community Development committees — Helena Moreno, J.P. Morrell, Lesli Harris and Freddie King — voted to recommend the ordinance to the full council for final passage.
The ordinance, which was introduced by Councilmembers Lesli Harris and Helena Moreno, was added to the council’s consent agenda for its May 8 regular meeting, where it is expected to pass. Consent agenda items typically pass without debate.
During Monday’s hearing, Moreno said the ordinance was drafted in consultation with the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office and the New Orleans Police Department. Neither agency responded to Verite News’ requests for comment on the proposal.
The ordinance would codify into city law an internal NOPD policy meant to encourage victims of violent crimes to cooperate with police investigations. Under the policy, victims and witnesses that police encounter during a criminal investigation cannot be arrested for sex work-related violations.
Prostitution arrests have already drastically decreased in the city over the past several years. But NOPD enforcement priorities can be changed more easily than laws. Natalie Rupp, the executive director of the Trans Income Project, said the ordinance will protect the trans and sex worker community over the long term.
“Currently, if you are a sex worker who is working and you say, ‘I was raped’ or ‘I was robbed,’ and you just try to describe the scenario, you can be arrested for prostitution,” Rupp said before the committee meeting.
The Trans Income Project held a series of community meetings last year with trans people. Rupp said attendees expressed deep concern about being profiled for being trans and arrested for prostitution. A large share of trans women report having worked in the sex industry at some point in their lives, making the ordinance a “gay-specific issue,” said Rupp.
Those worries prompted the push for the proposed ordinance. Rupp said sex workers have no access to protective services if crimes are committed against them, an issue the ordinance would help alleviate.
“It is our firm belief that regardless of what you do for a living, you deserve the right to report a crime that occurred to you,” Rupp said. “We don’t say that because you’re a barista and you handed someone coffee, well, then, ‘What did you expect? Of course, they beat you up and stole your money.’ Like that is just a no-brainer.”
But if it passes, the law would only apply to the NOPD.
As a municipal law, the proposal would carry no authority over other law enforcement agencies operating in the city under the state’s jurisdiction. That includes Troop NOLA, the permanent contingent of Louisiana State Police troopers deployed to New Orleans last year under orders from Gov. Jeff Landry — with enthusiastic support from New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell.
Moreno, the City Council’s vice president and a likely frontrunner in this fall’s mayoral election, did not respond to questions about how sex workers would be affected by the State Police presence in the city.
“I only have authority over local government,” Moreno wrote. “The ordinance as written can provide more clarity on how the state allows local municipalities discretion to handle certain offenses.”
Ordinance does not cover Troop NOLA
It’s not clear how Troop NOLA will respond to the ordinance should it pass. Asked whether Troop NOLA would follow the municipal code when policing in the city, State Police spokesperson Kate Stegall only noted that the troop follows only state law.
“Louisiana State Troopers are responsible for enforcing state laws across the state,” Stegall wrote in an email. “Local municipal ordinances are enforced by the police department within that specific jurisdiction.”
As Verite News reported last October, there is no formal public agreement between city and state governments about how Troop NOLA should be deployed.
Troop NOLA’s actions have sometimes been opposed to directives of local leadership, most notably in the days leading up to a series of Taylor Swift concerts at the Superdome last October, when state troopers abruptly cleared a number of homeless encampments over the objections of the city government. Troop NOLA has also come under fire for repeatedly engaging in high-speed chases for minor crimes, nonviolent crimes; a tactic NOPD can only use to pursue violent suspects under a long-running federal consent decree and departmental policy.
Still, city leaders such as Cantrell and NOPD Chief Anne Kirkpatrick have largely embraced the state’s policing efforts in the city.
And although the ordinance would prevent sex workers from being prosecuted by the local government, those arrested by the state will also be prosecuted by the state under state law. Last year, Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams inked an agreement with state Attorney General Liz Murrill that allows the Attorney General’s Office to prosecute people arrested in New Orleans by State Police troopers.
Neither Williams’ nor Murill’s offices responded to requests for comment on the proposed ordinance.
Under Louisiana state law, sex workers found guilty of prostitution could face fines and jail time. If someone has prior convictions, they can be imprisoned for at least four years and be fined between $500 to $4,000.
Preserving a ‘right to safe sex’
Attorney Lauren Hall, an attorney and co-founder of Below Sea Level Aid, drafted the language of the ordinance and said she wants to see a similar one passed at the state level, which would then protect sex workers across Louisiana.
“We’re not legalizing prostitution,” Hall said. “We’re just protecting sex workers who are victims of crimes, who seek medical treatment and who go to the police for help. It prevents them from being arrested based on prostitution, and it prevents them from being prosecuted based on this alone.”
The ordinance also includes what Hall called “a right to safe sex,” which means that police cannot use condoms as evidence for prostitution. A Human Rights Watch survey from 2013 found that 26% of sex workers in New Orleans who were interviewed were harassed by police for carrying condoms and that more than half of them were trans women. More than 50% of respondents said they carried fewer condoms in fear of getting in trouble with police.
Corinne Green, a board member of the Trans Income Project who worked on the ordinance, said community members commonly brought up fear of interacting with law enforcement in meetings. Green said that trans people are also afraid of being profiled as sex workers.
“Just simple possession of condoms as evidence of prostitution was a huge issue and really impacted people’s willingness to interact with law enforcement and also their experiences when they did,” Green said.
The ordinance drew inspiration from Louisiana’s revamped “Good Samaritan Law,” which protects people experiencing drug-related overdoses from arrest, prosecution and penalization, Green said.
Dozens of community members and organizers spoke in favor of the ordinance during public comment.
“Everyone has the right to protect themselves,” said Deon Haywood, the executive director of the nonprofit women’s rights group Women with a Vision, during public comment at the committee meeting. She has worked on behalf of sex workers for more than 35 years. “Every single person has a right to carry what they need to, and it should not be at the police discretion because someone is carrying condoms.”

Hepp pleaded no contest.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
In June, Hepp was charged in Maier’s death. Maier’s mother sued Wisconsin Department of Corrections Secretary Jared Hoy, Hepp and others Monday, seeking compensatory and punitive damages. 
The lawsuit alleges that the defendants’ “lack of accommodation, deliberate indifference, and negligence in ignoring his rapidly and obviously deteriorating physical and mental health while he was in their care” caused Maier’s death. 
In June, the Examiner reported that Hepp and eight members of his staff had been charged with crimes related to the treatment of people incarcerated in the prison. Six staff members were charged along with Hepp in the death of Maier, who authorities said died due to dehydration and malnutrition, the Examiner reported in June. Seven incarcerated people have died at WCI since 2023, the Associated Press reported. 
A statement in a criminal complaint said Hepp didn’t oversee his staff to make sure they followed all policies/procedures. 
“Randall Hepp did not follow through the requirements of his position required by law as the staff at WCI are poorly trained on many policies and procedures regarding missed meal(s), water restrictions, medication refusals, round checks, and more,” the complaint stated. 
DA, Maier lawsuit tell different stories about Hepp
Earlier in the case, Hepp was charged with felony misconduct in public office. Penalties for a Class I felony are a fine up to $10,000 or up to three and a half years’ imprisonment, or both.

Hepp was convicted of violating law governing state or county institutions. The Class C misdemeanor comes with a fine up to $500 and up to 30 days imprisonment, or both. Hepp was not sentenced to imprisonment.
The Associated Press reported that Dodge County Circuit Court Judge Martin De Vries cited Hepp’s service record, lack of a criminal record and “‘subpar employees’” who failed to follow policy. 
Dodge County District Attorney Andrea Will lowered the charge to a misdemeanor in exchange for a no contest plea, the AP reported. Will told De Vries that she lowered the charge because Hepp was well respected within the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and didn’t know guards weren’t following policy, according to the AP. 
De Vries said the criminal charge against Hepp was “‘to some extent…symbolic,” the Post-Crescent reported. 
According to the Associated Press, Maier’s mother, Jeannette Maier, called Hepp’s sentence a “‘slap on the wrist.’” She said her son had been treated worse than a caged animal.  
“Nothing can bring my son back but I like to think we as a society would at least learn something from this tragedy so it never happens to someone else’s son,” she said in a statement, according to the AP.  
The lawsuit from Jeannette Maier alleges Hepp was aware of a “systemic lapse in enforcement” of the hunger strike and water shut-off protocols. It alleges that Hepp did not take action to attempt to make sure that the protocols were followed. 
The lawsuit also says Hepp was deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk regarding the most at-risk incarcerated people in the restricted housing unit. 
The risk, as described by the lawsuit, was that they were not receiving the level of care and supervision needed in order to afford them adequate medical and mental health evaluation and treatment and did not have humane conditions of confinement.  
This risk was created by understaffing, low morale and lack of adequate training, the lawsuit alleges. 
Sheriff supports conviction
Dodge County Sheriff Dale Schmidt released a statement on Facebook in support of the settlement and conviction. 
“I can understand why some may feel additional sanctions are warranted, but our court system must be blind to ‘feelings’ and ‘agendas’ and decisions made solely on the facts of the case,” Schmidt said. 
Schmidt said that “investigating and arresting Randall Hepp was one of the most difficult cases I have been part of, leading to some of the most difficult decisions I have had to make during my time as sheriff.” He said Gov. Tony Evers and then-Department of Corrections Secretary Kevin Carr put Hepp in a very difficult position. 
“Don’t get me wrong, he was the warden and was by law administratively responsible for Waupun Correctional Institution, and as a result, two deaths that occurred,” Schmidt said. “While we explored it, no Wisconsin or federal law directly tied back to his bosses, who failed to provide adequate resources or leadership.”
A sentencing memorandum by an attorney for Hepp said the former warden “was chosen to run Waupun because of his history of building great work environments and teams, creating positive institution culture and improving operations.” 
According to the memorandum, “Waupun Correctional was known to be the most challenging institution for correctional officers to work.”
“This institution was in complete [dysfunction], there was an extreme understaffing of uniformed positions and no goal to improve the staffing,” the memorandum stated. “There was a historically high vacancy rate that existed over a lengthy period of time that required officers to work an extremely unheard-of number of forced shifts further aggravating an already difficult situation and burning out among staff members. This situation contributed to the staff’s concerning level of apathy, distraction and a desire to transfer to other institutions.”
The memorandum said Hepp “became the primary and recurring voice” for the need to improve staffing at Waupun.
“Unfortunately, his voice was not heard,” the memorandum stated. 
“Many pieces to this puzzle” have not yet gone through the criminal justice system, Schmidt said, since cases are still being processed through the courts. 
One former Waupun employee pleaded no contest in September and was fined $250. Charges were dismissed against another, and other cases are pending, the Associated Press reported.
The Wisconsin Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Hepp’s conviction on Tuesday afternoon.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)A statement that denies the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is compiling an autism registry, but says instead that it is creating a sweeping database of existing health records, has done little to quell fears among autism advocates.
Last week, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya announced that his office would draw on an unprecedented array of public and private records to establish a “disease registry” centralizing information on autistic people’s prescription drug use, insurance claims, Medicare and Medicaid records, genetic and lab tests and even data from smartwatches.
In response to the strong pushback that followed, the department attempted to walk back the announcement — and blame the media for the furor.
“The original narrative incorrectly suggested that HHS was creating an autism registry to track individuals using personal data,” the department said in a statement to The 74. “This is not accurate. The NIH is developing a secure data repository that will allow researchers to analyze large-scale, de-identified data. The director did not misspeak; rather, the term ‘registry’ was misused by the media, implying an unethical method of data collection.”
However, using video of the NIH announcement, the fact-checking site Snopes was able to establish that the original reporting was accurate.
Bhattacharya’s initiative followed a promise by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that by September, new research sponsored by his department would identify an environmental toxin responsible for what he called an autism epidemic. That theory contradicts mainstream science that links autism to genes and the increasing number of diagnoses to better testing — particularly in low-income households and among children of color.
Though many autistic children are able to prepare for college and a career when given the proper supports, “These are kids who will never pay taxes,” Kennedy said. “They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”
To head the study, Kennedy appointed a man cited by Maryland officials for practicing medicine without a license. David Geier was also found to have improperly prescribed puberty blockers for autistic children and administered a harmful drug used to treat lead poisoning that is not approved for use in the U.S.
Given Kennedy’s public proclamations, advocates said they would take a wait-and-see stance to the announcement that the new database would not contain a registry.
“This is positive news, but given this administration’s previous actions and comments, particularly those related to autism over the last several weeks, we are not assuming that there is no longer anything to worry about,” leaders of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network said in a statement. “Given everything this administration is saying and doing about autism, privacy and public health, we have every reason to distrust this initiative under current leadership at HHS.”

The word “registry” is particularly polarizing to disability advocates, who note that such lists — which still exist in some U.S. states — were used to identify autistic children who were killed in Nazi Germany’s experimental “euthanasia clinics,” as well as people to be sterilized and institutionalized in the United States.
“ ‘Registry’ and ‘data collection’ can mean many things,” the network said, adding that if advocates had been included in discussions about the proposed research, they could have asked for clarity: “Under previous administrations led by both Democrats and Republicans, we and other organizations had direct lines of communication with autism policy experts inside HHS.”
Several days before the NIH announcement was reported, four dozen organizations that advocate for autistic people issued a rare collective statement criticizing Kennedy’s repeated, disproven claims about a condition many scientists agree is a naturally occurring neurotype.
“We are deeply concerned by growing public rhetoric and policy decisions,” said the letter. “Claims that autism is ‘preventable’ [are] not supported by scientific consensus and perpetuate stigma. Language framing autism as a ‘chronic disease,’ a ‘childhood disease’ or ‘epidemic’ distorts public understanding and undermines respect for autistic people.”

Proposal to Create Federal Autism Registry Stokes Fear in Disability Advocates

 




Unknown is whether the NIH plan will indeed merge records that contain sensitive personal details with datasets that don’t include people’s identifying information. “HHS will … spend tens of millions of dollars linking existing federal databases,” the trade publication Behavioral Health Business reported, attributing the information to a department statement. “The National Institutes of Health (NIH) working to partner with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies to create ‘a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy.’ ”
In its statement to The 74, the department said the dataset being assembled “would be fully compliant with these laws and regulations to protect Americans’ sensitive health information.”
“Data science can advance our understanding of biomedical and behavioral phenomena and contribute to breakthroughs that improve health by mining large sources of data, such as databases and datasets, for information,” said the statement. “Researchers can use techniques like machine learning and AI in data science to help analyze data and make predictions about health outcomes and disease incidence.”
As of press time, more than 150 researchers belonging to the recently formed Coalition of Autism Scientists had signed a letter calling on HHS and NIH to observe rigorous standards. Kennedy’s controversial dismissal of mainstream beliefs that better diagnosis is a major factor behind the rise in autism rates, and his plans to find, within a few months, an environmental toxin that causes autism, have caused mistrust, they wrote.
“We were deeply troubled to hear [Kennedy] dismiss past research, downplay the causal role of genes and portray autistic people in ways that counter our experiences and demean their value to society,” the letter says.
Among other measures, researchers urged Kennedy to pre-register the protocol for any planned study. This voluntary practice — creating a time-stamped, public document outlining what the study will attempt to determine — is intended to counter what is sometimes referred to as “hypothesizing after results are known.” The scholars also want HHS’ researchers to share their data with independent analysts for verification.

To California Democratic state Sen. David Cortese, the idea of gaining Republican support for a bill to provide cash to certain residents would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.
But his proposed legislation to offer $1,000 per month to homeless youth has so far received bipartisan support in the state Senate.
“It’s being embraced,” said Cortese. “This was not even considered possible five years ago.”
Cortese is among more than 20 Democratic lawmakers from 17 states launching Legislators for a Guaranteed Income on Tuesday to advocate for programs that provide direct, regular cash payments to lower-income residents to help alleviate poverty. They join a network of more than 245 mayors and county officials who have pursued dozens of basic income pilot projects across the country.
The list includes Colorado officials: former Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, Boulder Mayor Aaron Brockett, Northglenn Mayor Meredith Leighty, former Grand Junction Mayor Anna Stout and former Erie Mayor Justin Brooks.

The LGI lawmakers want to see states play a larger role in guaranteed income programs, which aim to help residents in need by handing out no-strings-attached cash.
The concept of basic income programs took off following a 2019 experiment in Stockton, California. There, 125 individuals received $500 per month for two years, which researchers found improved their financial stability and health.
Michael Tubbs, the former Democratic mayor of Stockton and current executive chairman of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, said these kinds of efforts are more important now as economic uncertainty and high prices squeeze the most vulnerable people.
“The work around guaranteed income is moving from cities and counties to states,” he said. “We’re going to be organizing state officials across the country who see what we all see: that affordability is an issue, that the Trump tariffs and gross mismanagement of the economy has made the problem even worse.”
While the concept has gained traction across the country, Republican state lawmakers have pushed bills to ban basic income programs, arguing they disincentivize work.
Last year, then-state Sen. John Wiik sponsored successful legislation banning South Dakota localities from launching basic income programs. At the time, the Republican said he was worried about people growing dependent upon the government.
“So, if you get people addicted to just getting a check from the government, it’s going to be really hard to take that away,” he told Stateline.
The Denver Basic Income Project, which started in 2020, was the first and largest organization in the country to study the impact of direct cash assistance on people experiencing homelessness. It distributed more than $10.5 million to recipients, but Denver leaders withdrew support from the project last year after they said an analysis of the project “did not show a statistically significant difference in homelessness resolution between the groups that received large cash transfers and those who did not.”
Legislators for a Guaranteed Income says its 23 members have so far introduced 25 bills across 11 states.

Those include Cortese’s proposed legislation in California to create a new program to help homeless youth transition out of high school.
Eligible students would receive four monthly payments of $1,000 each beginning in May. That bill, expected to cost $40 million to $50 million, has passed through two state Senate committees.
Cortese previously advocated for a 2023 California program that was the nation’s first state-funded pilot of a basic income program targeting former foster youth. He pointed to research showing basic income programs supplement, rather than replace, the need for work. And he said growing these programs can eventually reduce costs for other social safety net programs.
“I’m so pleased to see the proliferation that we’ve seen so far,” he said. “I think that it will become ubiquitous as a way of doing things and that’s going to outlast me and my career.”
In Pennsylvania, Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta said he’s still exploring details on legislation for a basic income program there.
He said pilot projects across the country have proven that people pay rent, buy groceries and invest in small businesses when they have more financial freedom.
“So, this isn’t really some big experiment,” he said. “It is a proven way to reduce poverty, improve health care, boost our local economies and really get a real return on that investment.”
Kenyatta said so-called trickle-down policies that aim to boost business interests and high earners have failed many ordinary people.
“But basic income really flips that equation on its head,” he said. “It’s not about charity. It’s about power, and about giving people the power and the resources to breathe.”

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson | Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.











I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.

Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

This is especially timely in North Carolina, since there are two bills (Senate Bill 714 and House Bill 983) in the legislature aimed at deleting the current statute that allows and provides immunity for public school personnel who “intentionally inflict pain upon the body of a student as a form of punishment” up to the point that “a student requires care beyond first aid”. (Yes, that’s right, this grisly statute is still in place and yes, this is the twenty-first century.) 
Despite no organized opposition, neither bill is likely to get even a hearing in the legislature. If you’d like the back story, please read on.
Virtually all developed countries (and a host of developing countries) prohibit the use of corporal punishment in the public schools. An exception is the United States, which leaves the issue to the states. Currently, 33 states have statutes prohibiting the practice. You already know that North Carolina, along with the entire south, still sanctions violence against public school students.
Happily, there is a Tar Heel State anomaly: Taking advantage of permission granted by the state, all 115 local school districts prohibit the use of corporal punishment, and no student has been subject to the practice since 2018! This is essentially because more than 80 studies confirm that corporal punishment does not improve academic outcomes, but IS associated with negative effects on student educational and psychological development.
Given this situation, the logical question is why is the state legislature reluctant to even consider honoring local decision-making by prohibiting corporal punishment by statute? The reason is embedded in the legislative process. While surveys of legislators indicate overwhelming support for prohibiting the practice, the process allows just a few legislators to block any bill. 
For example, the House and Senate Rules Committees, through which all bills must go, each has hundreds of bills waiting for a hearing. By rule, a bill must pass at least one chamber by the self-imposed deadline of May 8. This means most bills will die on that day, simply because the committee chair refused to give a bill a hearing. This will almost certainly be the case with the corporal punishment bills.
It is generally thought that laws reflect the norms of a society. With regard to corporal punishment in the public schools of North Carolina, this is clearly not the case. It is comforting that all local school boards and administrations have taken steps to protect students. It is disconcerting, however, that the state legislature continues to tarnish our reputation by declining to remove a statute that no longer reflects who we are.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/American-History-1024x686.jpeg,,,2025-04-30 06:06:12.368474

(Mike Hawkins for KFF Health News)Adelaide Tovar, a University of Michigan scientist who researches genes related to diabetes, used to feel like an impostor in a laboratory. Tovar, 32, grew up poor and was the first in her family to graduate from high school. During her first year in college, she realized she didn’t know how to study.
But after years of studying biology and genetics, Tovar finally got proof that she belonged. Last fall, the National Institutes of Health awarded her a prestigious grant. It would fund her research and put her on track to be a university professor and eventually launch a laboratory of her own.
“I felt like receiving the award was a form of acceptance, like I had finally made it,” Tovar said. “But I think many of us now fear that this is going to poison the rest of our careers.”
Tovar is one of nearly 200 young scientists across the nation whose research and job prospects have been jeopardized by the sudden termination of the NIH’s MOSAIC grant program, one of many ended by sweeping cuts across the federal scientific agencies. The grant was created by the first Trump administration to foster a new generation of diverse scientists in biomedical research, then defunded in the second Trump administration’s ongoing purge of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.
In interviews with KFF Health News, Tovar and three other grant recipients worried that the loss of funding — coupled with President Donald Trump’s crusade against diversity programs — may transform a grant that was supposed to jump-start their careers into a blemish on their résumés that could cost them the jobs and funding that make their research possible.
“We might end up blacklisted by the NIH because of having this award — for who we are,” said Erica Rodriguez, 35, a grant recipient at Columbia University who conducts brain research that could lead to a better understanding of psychiatric disorders.
“Because not only is it for people with diverse backgrounds,” she said, “but it’s for people who advocate for other people with diverse backgrounds.”

The MOSAIC program — short for “Maximizing Opportunities for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers” — was created in 2019 to provide early-career support to promising scientists from “underrepresented backgrounds” with a long-term goal to “enhance diversity in the biomedical research workforce,” according to NIH grant documents.
The five-year grant was awarded to scientists who have finished their doctorates and work in research laboratories at universities across the country. In the first two years, scientists generally receive $100,000 to $150,000, which is largely used to pay their salaries.
By the third year, the scientists are expected to have been hired as a professor, likely at a different university, where the grant funding helps them launch their own research lab. In the final three years of the grant, funding increases to about $250,000 a year, which is used to buy supplies and hire other young scientists to work in the lab, completing the cycle.
MOSAIC awardees were chosen using a broad definition of diversity beyond race, gender, and disability. It includes those who grew up in poor households or rural areas or were raised by parents who do not have college degrees. Many of those chosen for the grant also have a history of supporting other budding scientists from underrepresented backgrounds.
MOSAIC funds research on cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, spinal cord injuries, cochlear implants, fentanyl overdoses, stroke recovery, neurodevelopmental disorders, and more.
But in recent weeks the NIH has notified most MOSAIC recipients that the program was “terminated” and their funding will end by this summer, regardless of the years left on their grant, according to NIH emails reviewed by KFF Health News. Other awardees have received no official notification and only learned through word of mouth that their funding was canceled.
Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, confirmed in an email statement to KFF Health News that MOSAIC had been defunded. She said the grants “no longer align” with agency priorities or the president’s executive orders “eliminating wasteful, ideologically driven DEI initiatives.”
Trump signed one of those orders on his first day back in the White House, instructing the entire federal government to end programs that promoted diversity, referring to them as “shameful,” “immoral,” and an “immense public waste.”
Diversity programs have been slashed across the government, including at the NIH and other HHS agencies, which have canceled hundreds of grants worth billions of dollars since March. On April 21, the NIH issued a notice that banned recipients from receiving grants if they have DEI programs and said the agency could “recover all funds” from those that do not comply.
“At HHS, we are dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science – not one driven by political ideology,” Rodriguez Feliciano said. “We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again.”
Many MOSAIC scientists are focused on chronic diseases. Tovar, for example, researches specific genes that make people more susceptible to diabetes, which affects about 38 million Americans.
“We have a lot of treatments for diabetes that are great for the people that they work for,” Tovar said. “In my research, I use genetics to help find better drug targets so we can find medicines for people who don’t already have therapies that work.”
In interviews, Tovar and the other MOSAIC recipients described how the sudden loss of funding will throw research and careers into upheaval: Some postdoctoral researchers may lose their current jobs when funding runs dry in months; awardees competing for professor jobs will lose research funding that made them stronger candidates; and those already hired will have less money for salaries and supplies in their research labs.
Ashley Albright, 32, who grew up poor in rural North Carolina, is now a scientist at the University of California-San Francisco, where she studies Stentor coeruleus, a large single-celled organism with regenerative abilities. She plans to start applying for professor jobs this fall.
Albright said MOSAIC funding would have given her a “better shot at my dream,” which was to give other scientists from diverse backgrounds opportunities to work in her research lab.
“I feel crushed,” she said. “I feel like someone is stepping on half of my life. … I’ve spent the last 10 years in grad school and my postdoc working toward this so I can do science, but also help other people do science.”
Hannah Grunwald, 33, a grant recipient at Harvard who studies eyeless cave fish to better understand complex genetic traits, said one of her worst fears was that universities won’t hire MOSAIC awardees at a time when the White House is ordering schools to abandon DEI programs and withholding billions from those that do not bend to the Trump agenda.
“There has been an enormous debate in our community about what we should say on our résumés,” Grunwald said. “I just don’t know if having my grant canceled because it had to do with diversity is going to limit my ability to get funding in the future.”

The termination of MOSAIC drew quick condemnation from several scientific organizations that receive grant funding to work closely with the awarded scientists, with some calling it “short-sighted” and “a significant step backward.”
Mary Munson, president of the American Society for Cell Biology, who has mentored awardees since MOSAIC began, became choked up and covered her face with her hands as she considered the possibility the grant could end up holding them back.
“Taking this grant away now does not take away the fact that they won this competitive award. It doesn’t take away that they are amazing scientists,” Munson said. “I hope that institutions will still see that nonetheless.”
Stefano Bertuzzi, CEO of the American Society for Microbiology, which also mentors grant awardees, said the mass termination of MOSAIC and other NIH grants may have a cumulative effect that will stifle scientific innovation for decades.
Bertuzzi, who immigrated from Italy in the ’90s because of America’s robust funding for science, said scientists will not stay in or flock to a nation where research funding vanishes on a political whim.
“We are going to be losing a full generation of scientists,” Bertuzzi said. “Other countries in the world will thrive.”

HopSkipDrive, a national ridesharing company focused on “safety, equity and care,” is expanding its supplemental school transportation services to Virginia Beach — aiming to help students with complex needs get to class while creating new job opportunities for local drivers.
The company’s network of “CareDrivers” — highly vetted caregivers trained to provide transportation in communities with unique challenges, such as students experiencing homelessness, in foster care or with disabilities — has already been operating in Northern and Central Virginia, and other parts of the country. 
“Transportation should never be a barrier that keeps the student from accessing their education, and we’re committed to removing those obstacles,” said Cindy Hamilton, a spokeswoman for HopSkipDrive. “We’re really committed to removing those obstacles, and we’re glad to be able to do so now in Virginia Beach.”
The company also announced in February that wheelchair-accessible vehicles would become available in Northern Virginia, with plans to expand that offering to other cities nationwide for the 2025-26 school year. 
School districts typically arrange the service directly through the company. 
Shortly after HopSkipDrive’s establishment in 2019, Virginia began seeing its list of bus drivers dwindle following the pandemic. Some of the reasons for the decline include low pay and an increase in driver retirements. The company also found that many drivers contracted COVID-19 or left for jobs in the private sector.
The company surveyed schools nationally about the bus driver shortage and found little improvement. About 91% of respondents reported the shortages had constrained their school transportation operations, an increase from the 88% in 2022.
According to the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE), the rate of unfilled bus drivers has decreased to 8.7% this school year, compared to 13.6% during the 2021-22 school year.
CareDrivers has also provided opportunities for people living in and around partnership schools. Drivers include parents, grandparents, nurses and former teachers, to name a few.
“Caregivers who tell us they choose to drive with HopSkipDrive do so because of the flexibility it offers and the value of helping kids – or anyone who needs a little extra care – get where they need to go,” Hamilton said. 
She said applicants go through a “rigorous” 15-point certification process before driving on the platform and can earn income while creating their own schedules. They also must comply with existing state and local laws and regulations, as well as the platform’s safety features and community guidelines.
“We have designed our platform to be easy to use, enabling CareDrivers in Virginia Beach and across the state to provide safe, reliable rides for students, schools, and families when it works for their schedules,” Hamilton said.
In Virginia, leaders have taken additional steps to help students get to and from school. 
Last month, Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed into law a proposal carried by Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, to create a two-year pilot program allowing school divisions to explore alternative transportation options. Schools could partner with nearby colleges or private companies to help transport students.
The legislation states that vehicles must comply with state and federal safety regulations and undergo regular inspections. School boards would also be required to hold a public hearing before adopting the program and must submit an annual report detailing ridership, costs, and bus routes to the Virginia Department of Education.
Austin told the Mercury the bill offers another option for schools in rural areas to cut costs while ensuring students are transported efficiently.
Last summer, the VDOE also amended its school bus specifications to state, “smaller capacity fleet vehicles are some options that can be used in conjunction with customary methods to provide a flexible, efficient, and comprehensive public school pupil transportation solution.”

Advocates point to the truly significant revenue they can generate for local governments. Opponents point to data centers’ enormous energy needs, climate impacts, water use and their capacity to diminish the quality of life for residents living nearby.
Will special rate classes protect Va. residents from the costs of serving data centers?

To weigh the costs and benefits of data centers and to set the ground rules for any potential data-center development, local governments should empower members of the public with all relevant information to foster a meaningful debate. We fear, however, that the widespread use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and a larger ethic of secrecy regarding data-center development curtails this discussion and, in so doing, impairs local democracy.
In order to understand how common NDAs are between local governments and data center companies, we submitted Freedom of Information Act requests to every Virginia locality we could identify with an existing, approved, or proposed data center. We found that the vast majority – 25 out of a total of 31 localities – have NDAs. We think that this could be an underestimate because some local governments may use definitions or maneuvers to avoid disclosing this information. For instance, one county reported that officials signed an NDA with a major tech firm, but they did not retain a copy for public record.
When we began our research, we naively assumed that NDAs were narrowly drawn guarantees that local governments would not share a company’s proprietary technology or cutting-edge trade secrets. But upon reading the documents, we found that they were written much more broadly, to prohibit sharing all “business plans” and/or “non-public information.” Such  broad categories could cover almost anything, including information that relates directly to community impacts. 
While these agreements acknowledge that a local government may be required to disclose information if requested by the public, they also often call on officials to share as little as legally possible, while giving the data center company advanced notice to intervene with its legal team if it so wishes before any information is shared. In this way, NDAs are written to privilege secrecy over transparency in data center development.
Data centers approved, solar farms rejected: What is going on in rural Virginia?

There is, of course, another perspective on this topic. Local officials might argue that the use of non-disclosure agreements is both lawful and routine in many types of economic development, not just for data centers. Our response is that just because a practice is currently legal, it doesn’t mean that it should remain that way. And even if local governments frequently join confidentiality agreements, it doesn’t mean that they are in the interest of local democracy. 
For example, when one local government released two NDAs to us, it asked that we keep the information as confidential as possible out of fear that it could jeopardize its data-center projects that were in the works, but not yet publicly announced. Why would sharing this information put the deals in jeopardy? If they are in the public interest, the projects should be able to withstand scrutiny even as they develop.
Here in our hometown of Fredericksburg, the city council recently passed zoning changes to create a technology overlay district for a new data center campus. But it did not give the public enough information to effectively participate in the conversation beforehand. The city did not announce the name of the data center company until the night of the city council’s vote. The city did not share the total number of data centers that would be included in the project until the day after the vote. Members of the public knew that the project would include several data centers, but many people – including us – were surprised to learn that the project will include eight to 12 new data center buildings.
Depending upon the kind of cooling system that a data center uses, its operation may require huge amounts of water, as much as several million gallons a day. But confidentiality agreements may prevent the public from fully understanding potential impacts to our rivers and water systems. This is clearly evident in a water service agreement between Spotsylvania County and Amazon for a new data center campus, which includes a confidentiality clause that states, “for the avoidance of doubt ADS [Amazon Data Service] water usage, sewage usage, and basis of design is considered Confidential Information.”
Data center water and wastewater use should not be confidential. The wellbeing of our rivers, streams and aquifers impacts us all. But this is not just about protecting the health of our environment; it’s also about protecting our democracy.
Local democracy means more than elections. It also requires properly informing the public, nurturing meaningful discussions, and giving community members an opportunity to influence decisions that will directly impact them. By withholding important and timely information, local governments and data center companies short-circuit debate in order to arrive at predetermined outcomes. 
Democracy – some say – dies in the dark. But that is exactly where many data center deals are born and live.

(Photo courtesy AmeriCorps)Maryland was one of the lead states in a coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia that sued the Trump administration Tuesday in an effort to block its push to “dismantle” AmeriCorps, the domestic volunteer service agency.
The suit said that within the past two weeks, agency officials, at the direction of Elon Musk’s DOGE Service,  put 85% of the administrative staff on leave as well as all of the members of the National Civilian Conservation Corp, who were told their service would be terminated.
Last Thursday, the agency began sending reduction-in-force notices to all the administrative staffers who were on leave, the lawsuit said, and after hours on Friday it began notifying states that nearly $400 million in AmeriCorps programs operating in their states was being immediately terminated. That cut would affect more than 1,000 AmeriCorps programs nationwide, according to a statement Tuesday from Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown.
He said that in Maryland, Brown said, AmeriCorps had 4,949 members and provided more than $21 million last year in federal funding and education awards last year, supporting 4,949 members serving across the state. He said the Governor’s Commission on Service and Volunteerism funded 25 service programs through Americorps for everything from working with refugees or elderly residents to being in Teach for America.
“In Maryland alone, programs that educate children, care for the elderly, and rebuild homes are being wiped out overnight. I will fight this brazen abuse of power in court and do everything in my power to restore these life-changing services,” Brown said in a prepared statement on the filing of the lawsuit.
As Trump hits 100 days, Brown among attorneys general battling him at every turn

AmeriCorps has its roots in the Great Society programs of the 1960s and took its current form in 1993, as the Corporation for National and Community Service. It is a public-private partnership, in which volunteers typically spend a year of service, during which they are paid a stipend to cover basic living expenses and can receive scholarship funding at the end of their service.
Until the cuts began earlier this month, CNCS had a staff of 700 and supported more than 200,000 members, the lawsuit said.
The suit said the White House does not have the authority to eliminate the AmeriCorps program, which was authorized and funded by Congress and can only be undone by lawmakers. The sudden, DOGE-inspired cuts were unlawful, arbitrary and capricious, failed to provide sufficient public notice, and exceeded presidential powers to intrude on congressional authority, the suit said.
“The Administration is free to ask Congress to abolish AmeriCorps, but it cannot simply terminate the agency’s functions by fiat or defund the agency in defiance of administrative procedures, Congressional appropriations, and the Constitutional separation of powers,” the suit said. “Accordingly, the Defendants’ actions should be declared unlawful and vacated.”
Those charges were echoed in an April 23 letter to President Donald Trump, led by Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and signed by 147 other members of Congress, including both of Maryland’s senators and four of its eigth House members: Democratic Reps. Johnny Olszewski Jr., Sarah Elfreth, Kweisi Mfume and Jamie Raskin.
The cuts to the program will “prevent the agency from continuing to deliver critical services, which include supporting veterans, fighting wildfires, tutoring in schools, combatting the fentanyl epidemic, and much more,” the letter said.
That was echoed by Gov. Wes Moore (D), who said in a statement Tuesday that the state “strongly supports the litigation to be filed by Attorney General Brown today to stand up for AmeriCorps.”
“If the federal administration wants to strengthen our country’s resolve, bridge divides, and usher in our next era of greatness, it should be expanding opportunities for Americans to serve one another,” Moore’s statement said.

The lawsuit is just the most recent of dozens filed by Democratic attorneys general against the Trump administration’s lightning-fast and deep cuts to federal programs and funding, many of which have been successful at reversing or stalling those cuts. Brown has joined more than two dozen such suits, on education cuts, worker firings, transgender rights and more, and this is the second on which he has been one of the lead plaintiffs.
The suit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for Maryland by Brown and the attorneys general of California, Colorado and Delaware. Also joining the suit were the attorneys general of Arizona, Connecticut, the District of Colombia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin, and the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/14992813330_91a8d676ef_o-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-30 05:04:43.869141

(Screenshot from presentation by John Culbertson, vice president of MSW Consultants)To get a better understanding of what’s in New Hampshire’s trash, workers hand-sorted more than 250 samples of garbage around the state and visually surveyed hundreds more.
Those findings will be detailed in a waste characterization study set to be released early next month, with a presentation Friday to the state’s Solid Waste Working Group offering a preview. John Culbertson, vice president of MSW Consultants, the Florida-based management consulting firm that completed the study, called it “a sort of Gallup poll of trash.”
The study focused on municipal solid waste — such as the trash residents bring to the curb — and construction and demolition debris. “Those are far and away the largest components of solid waste,” Culbertson said, with the two categories making up 952,699 annual tons, or around 87.5% of the state’s solid waste disposal, according to data cited in his presentation.
Combining the categories, the team found 41.5% of what was disposed of was not recyclable in New Hampshire. But the other trash included materials that were commonly targeted in recycling programs (14.6%), recyclable through special collection (11.5%), potentially recyclable (8.1%), and recyclable organics (24.3%), such as food waste.
The most common refuse found in municipal solid waste was unpackaged food waste (almost 12%), compostable paper (just under 8%), and packaged food waste (roughly 7%). 
“What I see is that a very significant amount of the material that we are throwing away in New Hampshire could be recycled or composted or otherwise better managed,” said Reagan Bissonnette, the executive director of the Northeast Resource Recovery Association, a recycling nonprofit, and a member of the working group.
Culbertson pointed out that recyclables sorted out of the waste were “highly contaminated” with liquid and grit, meaning some figures could be an “overstatement.” Like other statistical work, it comes with a margin of error. “Our results acknowledge that we just can’t ever get a perfect knowledge of what’s in your disposed waste stream,” he said, stressing the “nuance underneath just the reported, high-level numbers.”
This study didn’t deal with a major hot topic in the state’s waste policy discussions: the hundreds of thousands of tons of out-of-state waste that pour into New Hampshire landfills each year, which make up about half of what is dumped there. Nor did researchers venture beyond the state to analyze the composition of New Hampshire trash exports. Instead, it dealt with trash generated and deposited within the state’s borders. 
It offers insights into how the state can work to meet its diversion goals. New Hampshire has a statutory goal — but not a mandate — to reduce solid waste, in weight, by 25% by 2030 and 45% by 2050. These goals specifically target municipal solid waste and construction and demolition debris.
The preferred way to minimize that waste, as established in the state’s official waste management hierarchy, is to reduce it at its source. Then there’s recycling and reuse, composting, waste-to-energy, and incineration, in that order. Landfilling is the last resort. 
The state has taken some recent steps toward cutting down on food waste. In February, a law went into effect prohibiting “any person” generating one ton or more of food waste per week from disposing of that waste in a landfill or incinerating it, carving out exceptions if the person is farther than 20 miles from an alternative facility or if there isn’t ample capacity at such a facility. The state plans to use federal grant money for a food waste generator study to identify entities subject to the law. 
Food releases large amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, when dumped in landfills, something supporters of the new law hope it will address. 
However, food waste bans have often been ineffective in diverting waste from landfills and incinerators. Out of the first five states to implement one, only Massachusetts succeeded in reducing landfill waste, a paper published in Science in September found. Researchers pointed to frequent inspections, an easy-to-understand law with few exceptions, and a strong composting network as factors likely influencing the state’s success.
The waste characterization study found a significant amount of materials commonly targeted for recycling instead ending up in the state’s landfills. Bissonnette said education is key, and also pointed to the success of pay-as-you-throw programs that exist in some New Hampshire communities. Trash tonnage in Concord, for instance, has gone down by 40% since the program was implemented in 2009, according to the city. 
The reduction was “pretty much overnight,” Bissonnette said.
“It was so dramatic that city staff called around to other towns to make sure that they weren’t suddenly seeing a flood of trash coming from Concord,” Bissonnette said. “And, no, it really was that people were thinking twice before throwing something away. We saw recycling increase.”
There are opportunities to divert more construction and demolition debris, too. Major components of this waste included wood (29%) and shingles (14.4%), according to the presentation. 
In Littleton, Bissonnette’s organization worked on a pilot program with the town that allowed for items that would typically be discarded in a construction and demolition debris container to instead be set aside for others to take home and use. That included materials like clean wood, which others could take to burn or use as building materials, or things like doors and windows. 
“It was a really significant amount of material that just within, I think it was about a month-and-a-half pilot program, they were able to divert and keep out of the landfill,” Bissonnette said. “And in that case, it was getting reused instead of recycled, which is even better.”
The study was funded through Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling, or SWIFR, funds made available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Executive Council approved a $295,500 contract for the project in December 2023. 
“A lot of our neighboring states and others have had this information profile, and we felt it would be really important to use these federal funds to get our own data,” said Michael Wimsatt, director of the Department of Environmental Services’ waste management division, at the meeting. 
He added: “It’s not going to be apples-to-apples comparisons (to other states), but I think it’s really going to help us.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-29-at-1.07.18-PM-1024x506.png,,,2025-04-30 05:04:43.869141

The bill, however, includes a significant exception. House Bill 781 would allow local governments by “majority vote” to designate local government-owned property located within its jurisdiction to be used for a “continuous period of up to one year for public camping or sleeping purposes.” Local governments can renew the one-year period.
  Rep. Brian Biggs (Photo: NC General Assembly)
Rep. Brian Biggs (R-Randolph) said he sponsored the bill after leaders of local municipalities came to him looking for guidance in handling homelessness. Biggs insisted the bill doesn’t criminalize homelessness as some critics contend.
“It addresses the use of public property for camping and sleeping without prohibiting homelessness,” Biggs said. “It does create clear guidance. We need guidance.”
In addition to Biggs, HB 781 is cosponsored by GOP Reps. Neal Jackson, Jennifer Balkcom and Mike Schietzelt — who represent parts of Randolph, Moore, Henderson, and Wake counties.
Under the bill, counties or municipalities designating property for encampments must establish and maintain minimum standards and procedures designed to:

Ensure the safety and security of the designated property and the persons lodging or residing on the property.
Maintain sanitation, including, at a minimum, by providing access to clean and operable restrooms and running water.
Coordinate with the county health department to provide access to behavioral health services, which must include substance abuse and mental health treatment resources.
Prohibit illegal substance use and alcohol use on the designated property and enforce the prohibition against such use.

Several people signed up to speak against the bill. They were only given one minute each to speak.
Otto Harris, a pastor speaking on behalf of Ken Carter, bishop of the Western North Carolina Conference of the United Methodist Church, said HB 781 treads on the state’s most vulnerable citizens.
“How can we push down folks who are already down?” Carter asked. “Seems like it’s impossible, but this bill has figured it out.”
Harris said the bill will criminalize homelessness and place unhoused people in “harm’s way with potential penalties, fines, court dates, blemishes on their record.”
Chris Nobblitt, an organizer for Durham-based National Union of the Homeless, said the bill will lead to deaths if approved.

“This bill will kill the Hurricane Helene victims that have still not gotten help from  FEMA or the state,” Nobblitt said. “This bill will kill veterans that serve my country, please do not let this bill pass.”
Nobblitt compared “sanction encampments” to “concentration camps.”
“If you really wanted to help homeless people, then you would help to unlock the 27 empty homes for every homeless person. You would help us get Medicaid for every person,” Nobblitt said. “You would raise the minimum wage so we could afford the sky-high rent that the corporations in North Carolina are holding hostage.”
According to the N.C. Housing Coalition, there are 1.1 million families in North Carolina who are burdened by housing costs. The group’s annual County Profiles reported that 48% of renters and 19% of homeowners in North Carolina pay more than 30% of their income on housing. Families that spend more than 30% of income on housing are considered cost-burdened. In 2024, homelessness in North Carolina increased 19%, as the official count reached a total of 11,626 individuals experiencing homelessness.
Chris Sharp of the conservative, Texas-based Cicero Institute, spoke in support of the bill.
“This bill allows for local governments to establish sanctioned camping, camping areas that provide basic sanitation, access to mental health and substance abuse treatment, along with protection from gangs drug dealers, which often prey on these vulnerable individuals,” Sharp said. “HB 781 also provides for protection of individual property and small business property rights.”
Bill critics have said they believe Sharp’s group represents is behind HB 781.
“I’m also glad today that the Cicero Institute has finally revealed itself as the sponsor and lobbyist for this bill,” said Latonya Agard, executive director of the N.C. Coalition to End Homelessness.

Agard noted that the Cicero Institute was founded by billionaire venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale who she said has opposed Housing First policies that prioritizes getting people experiencing homelessness into permanent housing.
“They have provided the template for this bill in other states around the country as an opposition to Housing First, which is documented and clearly has evidence that it does work when it is funded properly,” Agard said. “This bill does not take into account the issue that there is not enough affordable housing as homelessness has increased, as the number of people who are unsheltered has increased, our affordable housing availability has decreased, and that is why we see so many people in this need.”
  Benjamin Horton (Photo: Veterans Services of the Carolinas)
Benjamin Horton, director of outreach at Veteran Services of the Carolinas, said he’s concerned about whether municipalities can keep veterans safe in such encampments. Horton also worries about being about to find veterans to provide services if the bill becomes law.
“We’re a very stubborn bunch,” the U.S. Navy veteran said. “You’re telling us where we camp, where we can’t camp. That’s going to make it harder on street outreach folks, mental health folks who are working with the VA for multiple services.”
Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) said the bill doesn’t solve the problem of homelessness. Lawmakers must address low wages, mental illness and other conditions that lead to homelessness, she said.
A person making minimum wage — $7.25 per hour — and working two, 40-hour a week jobs can’t afford to pay rent, Budd said.
“You do that for two jobs, you’re at $30,160 [a year], so when we talk about solutions for homeless people, we need to not just be talking about affordable housing,” Budd said.

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
Federal education cuts and Trump DEI demands leave states, teachers in limbo

In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
‘It’s the system that needs fixing’
Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed it into law Monday.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
Debate over holding back third graders roils state legislatures

The new law requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
Opposition to ‘science of reading’
Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.










A student's likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute


In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

Gov. Ned Lamont proposed using tens of millions of those dollars to fund social services, but in its proposed budget released last week, the Appropriations Committee said this money should come from the General Fund. Even so, some Democratic leaders say they would be open to Lamont having a role in how the settlement funds are used, a major reversal that would require changing state law.
Just a few years ago, Lamont backed a law that created the Connecticut Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee (OSAC) to designate how more than $600 million in opioid funds that are expected to come to the state over an 18-year period should be spent. The law was intended to prevent lawmakers and future governors from dipping into the money to fill budget gaps like they historically did with the tobacco settlements of the 1990s.
[RELATED: Lamont wants to dip into opioid settlement to fund social services]
Lamont’s proposed budget would require changing that law so the money could be used for things like cold weather emergency response and mobile crisis care, services that were previously funded by fees, taxes and federal funds. But in the Appropriations Committee’s proposed budget for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, legislators specified that the Opioid Settlement Fund is separate, and “expenditures must be approved by the Committee and used in accordance with the controlling judgment, consent decree, or settlement.”
Lawmakers recommended continuing these services but said that the money should come from the General Fund. In some cases, they also recommended less money for services.
In a statement through a spokesperson, Attorney General William Tong said he appreciates that the funds have been restored.
“We look forward to continuing discussions about how to fund the state’s priorities consistent with the settlement language and Connecticut’s opioid settlement statute, which requires opioid funding proposals to go through an application process,” the statement reads.
John Lally, a member of OSAC who lost his son to opioid use, said he was “really surprised” when he learned that Lamont had proposed using settlement funds. 
“It goes against what he agreed to in the beginning,” Lally said. 
Lally has spent many hours over the past two years on the committee. While he said it would be frustrating to see that time go to waste, “the bigger issue is what we owe the people of Connecticut who struggle with addiction and their families.” By going through the careful process that OSAC has set up, Lally believes, the funds will be spent “in a way that will honor them and the ones we’ve lost, like my son, in the best way we can.”
After Lally learned of Lamont’s proposal, he and other members of OSAC have been calling lawmakers for their support to ensure the funds would not be diverted.
“We’re willing to fight for what we believe is right,” he said.
But not everyone on OSAC seems to agree that the process is going well, or that Lamont should be kept out of decision-making.
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee and a member of OSAC, said that she doesn’t believe that the line items Lamont singled out to be funded by OSF were the right choice for how the money should be used, but she would be open to the governor and lawmakers weighing in on how that money is spent in the future if it’s carefully focused on opioid addiction and treatment.
“What we have going on right now is an overthought process (on OSAC), and I am well OK with thinking about things, but I think there has to be action along with thinking about things,” Osten said. 
Advocates have expressed frustration with the slow pace of OSAC’s decision-making and confusion over how recommendations for using the funds are being considered, especially considering the stakes of the opioid crisis. But in recent months, the group has picked up the pace: as of mid-April, the fund had received more than $158 million, of which about $93 million has already been allocated, according to Chris McClure, the chief of staff at the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, co-chair of the Public Health Committee and a member of OSAC, said that the committee should be in charge of making decisions about how the funds are used but agreed with Osten that there may be a middle ground that includes the committee while also allowing elected officials to have a say. 
“I think honoring the process is still worthwhile,” he said.

There are many factors that go into the overdose epidemic of opioids and other drugs that kill thousands of North Carolinians each year.
As a pair of law and medicine experts explained, however, in a recent NC Newsline op-ed, there are some increasingly successful strategies that deserve public support.
And topping the list is the urgent need for everyone – health care providers, law enforcement, elected officials – to recognize that substance use disorder – is just that: a medical disorder, not merely an addiction or personal weakness to be frowned upon.
Fortunately, polls show that an overwhelming majority of North Carolinians have come to understand this truth and strongly favor what experts describe as “a health-first approach” to the problem, that includes funding for non-judgmental, evidence-based treatment programs.
The bottom line: To his great credit, Governor Josh Stein has voiced strong support for committing the state to just such an approach and ending the stigma that too often attaches to substance use disorder. All state policymakers and providers should follow his lead.

The Senate Energy Committee vote was unanimous. With both chambers in session Wednesday, it’s likely lawmakers could sign off on the legislation and send it along to the governor.
The most substantive change had to do with the Public Utility Commission of Ohio clock — it moved from 320 days to 360. Lawmakers are putting a ceiling on PUCO deliberations because they want rate cases to move more quickly.

After Tuesday’s hearing, state Sen. Bill Reineke, R-Tiffin, connected the longer shot clock to broader changes in the ratemaking process. Utilities must come before the PUCO every three years, and they’ll be able to set rates in three-year increments with annual “true-ups” to reflect the companies’ actual balance sheet. Reineke explained the longer timeline will give regulators a bit of breathing room.
Final testimony
Before lawmakers put the bill to a vote, Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis made a final bid to remove a provision on consumer refunds. Under the changes, bill payers could receive refunds after the Supreme Court determines a charge was unwarranted, but any payments prior to that decision would be out of reach.
Willis explained her office in the middle of a case against Dayton-area AES Ohio which could yield more than $300 in refunds per customer.
“If HB 15 becomes law as written AES’s half a million consumers would lose that refund opportunity that has been in the making since 2019,” she said.
Ohio senators propose changes to harmonize House, Senate energy bills

The final version of the bill also left out a passage subjecting more power line projects to state oversight. Willis called that omission “disappointing.”
“No one is reviewing these projects,” she argued. “Not the Ohio Power Siting Board, not the PUCO and not (the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission). Ohio consumers, your constituents, pay 100% of those costs through transmission riders.”
Rebecca Mellino from the Nature Conservancy praised lawmakers for repealing a controversial coal subsidy approved as part of 2019’s HB 6 but argued “Ohio lags far behind neighboring states” when it comes to renewable energy. She suggested provisions encouraging brownfield redevelopment could offer an opportunity for renewable energy investment.
Bigger picture
The core incentive for new energy production is a reduction in tangible personal property taxes — levied on things like machinery and equipment. But while lawmakers attempt to boost energy production with a tax cut, they’re also trying to find reductions in property taxes.  Energy committee chairman, Sen. Brian Chavez, R-Marietta, insisted the reductions won’t undermine services.
“We’re not changing any taxes that are in effect right now,” he explained. “So any taxes from power plants that are in place will stay in place as they depreciate out — this is only on new generation.”
Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, argued the tax break is an important cue to companies. When lawmakers passed HB 6, he said, they subsidized coal and nuclear facilities.
“It was not just putting your thumb on the scale,” he said, “I mean, it wreaked havoc in natural gas generation.” With the current bill, lawmakers will remove the last of those subsidies.
“So we’ve sort of restored capitalism in the energy generation space,” Smith argued. “And by reducing the tangible personal property percentage, hopefully that sends a signal.”
Still, there’s little Ohio’s legislation can do to address lawmakers’ central concern about power demand outstripping supply. The 13-state power network PJM has a substantial backlog of power plants that want to connect to the grid, and large-scale consumers like data centers are pushing demand for power higher.
“That’s why we focused on behind the meter generation,” Chavez said, “so that any new industry that comes into Ohio is not adding additional strain on the existing grid.”
Behind the meter generation involves building a bespoke power plant directly connected to a given business.
“PJM is aware of the concerns that are out there. They’re hearing that from all 13 states,” Chavez added. “They are on our list. We’re going to go talk to them in the fall, and we’re going to have some frank conversations with them to see how we can partner to get through this.”

(Getty Images)There have been several new bills circulating in the New Hampshire Legislature regarding vaccines, among them is House Bill 679.
The bill, which passed the House in March and is now in the Senate, focuses on cutting the requirement for children to get vaccines that have not been shown to prevent transmission, or spread, of a disease. 
At first glance of this bill, one may reason: Why should they have to get a vaccine if it has not been shown to prevent disease spread? The truth is, while many immunizations do a great job at reducing spread of a disease through a population, that is not the only thing that they do. Not all vaccines prevent a person from contracting a disease. 
One of the major things vaccines do is prevent disease severity. A person who gets the influenza vaccine may still come down with the flu despite being vaccinated. However, they will be far less likely to develop severe influenza if they are vaccinated. 
In 2021, it was found that patients who were vaccinated against influenza had a 26% lower risk of ICU admission and 31% lower risk of death due to the influenza virus. Becoming vaccinated against the flu also prevents overall hospitalization rates, and in the 2019-2020 flu season, approximately 100,000 influenza-related hospitalizations were avoided due to the influenza vaccine. 
This is not only significantly beneficial for those who were vaccinated against the flu, but also for anyone else who needed a hospital bed for any reason during that flu season. Hospitals had more available space for all patients than they would have had if they were overrun by patients with influenza.
Most of the routine vaccines administered are to infants and school-aged children. This kind of legislation makes our schools less safe against preventable disease, putting students, teachers, staff, and families at risk, again not just for infection but serious infection requiring more intensive care. 
Many people are already aware of the recent measles outbreak in the U.S., which has now reached 30 states. Measles is a highly contagious virus that has been shown to manifest in 90% of close contacts of an infected patient. It typically starts with a fever as high or higher than 104 degrees, runny nose, cough, and conjunctivitis. 
After about a week, patients often develop the “classic” measles rash, which starts on the face and spreads down toward the rest of the body. In vaccinated patients, measles can be fairly mild. For unvaccinated children (i.e. school-aged children who did not get the vaccine or infants less than 1 year of age who are not yet old enough for the vaccine), measles often leads to further complications. 
The mild complications typically include ear infections and diarrhea. More severe complications include pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling in the brain), hospitalization (1 in 5 unvaccinated patients who contract measles require hospitalization), and death (1 to 3 in every 1,000 children with measles). 
Complications can often also occur in adults, and particularly in pregnant patients where they have higher rates of premature delivery and low birth weight. One complication that people generally are less familiar with is called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which occurs 7 to 10 years after a child has recovered from the measles infection, and is a fatal disease of the central nervous system.
For measles, a vaccination rate in a community needs to be at least 95% to have effective “herd immunity,” or essentially to prevent a measles outbreak. Last year (2023-2024 school year), New Hampshire kindergartners had a measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination rate of 89.2%, which despite sounding like quite a lot is not nearly enough to prevent spread. The state of Maine does not allow religious or personal exemptions to vaccines for schools, and their kindergartener MMR vaccination rate during the last school year was 97.2%.
As of April 24, there have already been 884 reported cases of measles in the United States. This is compared to the 285 cases reported in all of 2024, and the zero cases reported in 2000, when measles was considered fully eradicated from the U.S.
Polio, which is generally more severe in its complications and outcomes than measles, is another disease that has been eradicated from the U.S. due to immunization. By loosening the reins on vaccine requirements, we risk reintroducing our communities to these deadly and debilitating diseases.
Bad vaccination policies put New Hampshire residents at risk. As a state, we could put our country at risk. Immunizations save lives from preventable illnesses, and by declaring exemption or reducing vaccine requirements, we are not only allowing, but encouraging, the spread of disease. 
We must not allow our children to die from diseases that their ancestors fought so dearly to prevent.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/vaxnurse-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-30 05:04:43.869141

(Photo by Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds, and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”
Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky, and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
‘Generational change’ to taxes
While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
An uneven tax burden
Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco, and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

(Haines Eason)Like many, I’m grappling with the fallout from the presidential election. Life being life, the election result caps a tumultuous time for me. 
My father is dying from a three-plus-year battle with myeloma. My mother needed emergency surgery to correct a health issue that flared up due to the stress of trying to care for my father on her own. I now fly home from Lawrence to Charlottesville, Virginia, as often as I can. I’m from just outside C-Ville, as it’s dubbed locally, and I’m an only child. 
Add to all this that I’m father to two boys, 6 and 4, the oldest being autistic and also diagnosed with my ADHD. 
To stay sane, I meditate, lift weights, bike as often as I can, and try to stay off my phone.
And I used to garden.
One recent, chilly spring morning, I got a wild hair: I went looking for some ancient vegetable seeds from a dusty and cobwebbed corner of the garage. They were buried under long-unused root heating mats, dry and furry peat seed starting pucks and cups, and a menagerie of bird-feeding paraphernalia.
I brought the peat pucks outside to my boys, who were wreaking havoc in the backyard. We soaked them to prepare them for seeds while we selected several varieties of tomatoes to start. The seed packets were stamped with dates in years as far back as 2018, so we started something on the order of 30. I figured most would not germinate.
We now have 30 stubbornly healthy, 104-inch tomato starts. 
Let’s just say my family and neighbors have all been notified that they’ll not need to buy tomato plants for their gardens this year.
Why garden now?
My boys are just old enough to be told to stay out of the garden beds, and actually stay out of them. They’re self-directing more — they don’t need to be underfoot and don’t need to undo whatever chore I’m doing for their devilish entertainment. They’re (kind of) sleeping through the night. There’s now a little more room — mentally, spiritually.
There’s also a dark urgency. I’ve recently bought my family approximately a month’s worth of freeze-dried food, a 20-pound bag of rice, a few cans of propane and a 3,000-watt solar generator. 
Before I decided to detox from social media and the little bit of news that trickled to me through it, the phrase “we’re on our own” seemed to crop up frequently. In this second Trump era, that may be the truth.
Every day some new agency endures firings. The fallout? Benefits slashed, services cut, support and guidance denied.
If this country — if this society — is going to make it, we’re going to have to get off our phones and out into our yards and streets with our neighbors. This is where my tomato starts come in. Most will be given away — they’ll feed my community. Having a solar generator means at least one house on the block will be able to stay connected to weather reports and radio news.
Like every urban homesteader aiming to overdo it, we also hope to buy and raise some chickens soon.
That said, wait times at online hatcheries have been quite long this year with May or June deliveries for orders placed back in March. Missouri’s Cackle Hatchery reported customers lining up before they opened for business.
On the bright side, this means others are digging in — buying and raising chickens for eggs and meat. I hope those chicken-buyers are gardening, too. I hope they’re doing so with a mind to share the bounty.
With the way things are going, I don’t know that I’ll be able to track news of any gardening or urban-homesteading revolution. I have a sense it will be harder and harder to know what’s going on with any resistance before things get better.
All I can do is be present. My family doesn’t plan to flee to Canada or Europe. This is home. Lawrence is my town. This is where we fight.
If I helped to rekindle your spirit some, great. Here are some ideas on where you might start.
If you’re eager to come down from the clouds and find a local cause, your food bank likely needs your support. Thanks in part to Trump administration scrutiny and DOGE-related efforts, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently canceled shipments of fresh food to Kansas and Missouri pantries. There’s no clear sense of when or if deliveries will resume.
Local farms also need your support. If you’d like to source more of your food from nearby and invest in your community’s food supply chain, farm-to-table advocacy organization LocalHarvest hosts a Community Supported Agriculture page that can show you which farms in our area will sell to you directly.
If you don’t have access to a yard or other city-located greenspace, a community garden may be for you. The American Community Gardening Association hosts a Find a Garden | Share a Garden page, and there are numerous ones in Kansas.
Chicken-wise, you’ll be waiting if you want to raise them for meat or eggs. The good news is there are many quality hatcheries that will ship numerous breeds directly to you.
That said, there are scammers out there (yes, even for those just wanting to purchase baby chickens). This BackYard Chickens article offers solid advice on how to separate fraud farms from reputable operations.
Best of luck, whether you garden or raise chickens or subscribe to a CSA. I hope you find the community you need and the strength to carry on.

In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon tried to fire the Department of Justice prosecutor leading an investigation into the president’s involvement in wiretapping the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters.
Since then, the DOJ has generally been run as an impartial law enforcement agency, separated from the executive office and partisan politics.
Those guardrails are now being severely tested under the Trump administration.
In February 2025, seven DOJ attorneys resigned, rather than follow orders from Attorney General Pam Bondi to dismiss corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams. Adams was indicted in September 2024, during the Biden administration, for alleged bribery and campaign finance violations.
One DOJ prosecutor, Hagan Scotten, wrote in his Feb. 15 resignation letter that while he held no negative views of the Trump administration, he believed the dismissal request violated DOJ’s ethical standards.
Among more than a dozen DOJ attorneys who have recently been terminated, the DOJ fired Erez Reuveni, acting deputy chief of the department’s Office of Immigration Litigation, on April 15. Reuveni lost his job for speaking honestly to the court about the facts of an immigration case, instead of following political directives from Bondi and other superiors.
Reuveni was terminated for acknowledging in court on April 14 that the Department of Homeland Security had made an “administrative error” in deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, against court orders. DOJ leadership placed Reuveni on leave the very next day.
Bondi defended the decision, arguing that Reuveni had failed to “vigorously advocate” for the administration’s position.
I’m a legal ethics scholar, and I know that as more DOJ lawyers face choices between following political directives and upholding their profession’s ethical standards, they confront a critical question: To whom do they ultimately owe their loyalty?
Identifying the real client
All attorneys have core ethical obligations, including loyalty to clients, confidentiality and honesty to the courts. DOJ lawyers have additional professional obligations: They have a duty to seek justice, rather than merely win cases, as well as to protect constitutional rights even when inconvenient.
DOJ attorneys typically answer to multiple authorities, including the attorney general. But their highest loyalty belongs to the U.S. Constitution and justice itself.
The Supreme Court established in a 1935 case that DOJ attorneys have a special mission to ensure that “justice shall be done.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXDOJ attorneys reinforce their commitment to this mission by taking an oath to uphold the Constitution when they join the department. They also have training programs, internal guidelines and a long-standing institutional culture that emphasizes their unique responsibility to pursue justice, rather than simply win cases.
This creates a professional identity that goes beyond simply carrying out the wishes of political appointees.
Playing by stricter rules
All lawyers also follow special professional rules in order to receive and maintain a license to practice law. These professional rules are established by state bar associations and supreme courts as part of the state-based licensing system for attorneys.
But the more than 10,000 attorneys at the DOJ face even tougher standards.
The McDade Amendment, passed in 1998, requires federal government lawyers to follow both the ethics rules of the state where they are licensed to practice and federal regulations. This includes rules that prohibit DOJ attorneys from participating in cases where they have personal or political relationships with involved parties, for example.
This law also explicitly subjects federal prosecutors to state bar discipline. Such discipline could range from private reprimands to suspension or even permanent disbarment, effectively ending an attorney’s legal career.
This means DOJ lawyers might have to refuse a supervisor’s orders if those directives would violate professional conduct standards – even at the risk of their jobs.
This is what Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon wrote in a Feb. 12, 2025, letter to Bondi, explaining why she could not drop the charges against Adams. Sassoon instead resigned from her position at the DOJ.
“Because the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged, I cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations … because I do not see any good-faith basis for the proposed position, I cannot make such arguments consistent with my duty of candor,” Sassoon wrote.
As DOJ’s own guidance states, attorneys “must satisfy themselves that their behavior comports with the applicable rules of professional conduct” regardless of what their bosses say.
Post-Watergate principles under pressure
The president nominates the attorney general, who must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
That can create the perception and even the reality that the attorney general is indebted to, and loyal to, the president. To counter that, Attorney General Griffin Bell, in 1978, spelled out three principles established after Watergate to maintain a deliberate separation between the White House and the Justice Department.
First, Bell called for procedures to prevent personal or partisan interests from influencing legal judgments.
Second, Bell said that public confidence in the department’s objectivity is essential to democracy, with DOJ serving as the “acknowledged guardian and keeper of the law.”
Third, these principles ultimately depend on DOJ lawyers committed to good judgment and integrity, even under intense political pressure. These principles apply to all employees throughout the department – including the attorney general.
Recent ethics tests
These principles face a stark test in the current political climate.
The March 2025 firing of Elizabeth Oyer, a career pardon attorney with the Justice Department, raises questions about the boundaries between political directives and professional obligations.
Oyer was fired by Bondi shortly after declining to recommend the restoration of gun rights to actor Mel Gibson, a known Donald Trump supporter. Gibson lost his gun rights after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor domestic battery charge in 2011.
Oyer initially expressed concern to her superiors about restoring Gibson’s gun rights without a sufficient background investigation, particularly given Gibson’s history of domestic violence.
When Oyer later agreed to testify before Congress in a hearing about the White House’s handling of the Justice Department, the administration initially planned to send armed U.S. Marshals officers to deliver a warning letter to her home, saying that she could not disclose records about firearms rights to lawmakers.
Oyer was away from home when she received an urgent alert that the marshals were en route to her home, where her teenage child was alone. Oyer’s attorney described this plan as “both unprecedented and completely inappropriate.”
Officials called off the marshals only after Oyer confirmed receipt of the letter via email.
Why independence matters
In my research, I found that lawyers sometimes have lapses in judgment because of the “partisan kinship,” conscious or not, they develop with clients. This partisan kinship can lead attorneys to overlook serious red flags that outsiders would easily spot.
When lawyers become too politically aligned with clients – or their superiors – their judgment suffers. They miss ethical problems and legal flaws that would otherwise be obvious. Professional distance allows attorneys to provide the highest quality legal counsel, even if that means saying “no” to powerful people.
That’s why DOJ attorneys sometimes make decisions that frustrate political objectives. When they refuse to target political opponents, when they won’t let allies off easily, or when they disclose information their superiors wanted hidden, they’re not being insubordinate.

(Stock photo from Getty Images.)Ohio University will close the Pride Center, the Women’s Center and the Multicultural Center in response to a new higher education law banning diversity efforts that takes effect this summer, the university president announced Tuesday. 
OU will sunset the Division of Diversity and Inclusion — which includes those three centers — “over the next several weeks,” Ohio University President Lori Stewart Gonzalez said in a statement.

There is no definitive date for when the division or the centers will close, but the centers will not be open beyond when the law takes effect on June 23, according to university spokesperson Dan Pittman. 
“Work managed by the division that remains within the law will be moved to other areas of the university,” the university said. 
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced Senate Bill 1 at the end of January, it quickly passed both chambers and Gov. Mike DeWine signed it into law on March 28. Youngstown State University faculty are trying to get a referendum on the November ballot to block S.B. 1. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
The new law will also prohibit faculty strikes, regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things.  
“We must continue to ensure every person we invite to be a part of our university community finds their place here and develops connections,” Gonzalez said in her letter to the university. “Without forgetting that essential commitment, we must also follow the law.”
All employee positions within the Division of Diversity and Inclusion will be eliminated. The three centers have eight full-time staffers, according to their websites. The centers also have student workers. 
“Employees will continue in their current roles for the next several weeks and will be given the opportunity to interview for any open university position for which they apply and meet minimum qualifications,” Gonzalez said. 
Employees who don’t continue to work at OU will receive full separation benefits, according to the university. 
Support for the university’s Templeton, Urban, Appalachian, and Margaret Boyd Scholars programs will move under the Honors Tutorial College. 
Ohio University’s Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine’s Office of Inclusion will also close because of the new law. 
The university said it will be reaching out to students, faculty and staff for their input on inclusion and belonging moving forward. 
“I want to be clear that the task ahead for all of us is not to look for ways to recreate the same approaches under a different name,” Gonzalez said. “Rather, the charge is to invent something new that meets the moment and delivers results for our students.”
The Capital Journal previously reported on how OU student Audrey Ansel has been preparing for Ohio University’s Pride Center to likely close as a result of the law. 
This comes as Ohio’s public universities are in the midst of figuring out how the controversial law affects them. The University of Toledo recently announced they are suspending nine undergraduate programs in response to S.B. 1.

Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”














It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state.


– David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst






Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXHe said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 ‘Generational change’ to taxes

While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

(Rebecca S. Gratz for Nebraska Examiner)For 35 years, the Women’s Fund of Omaha has worked on issues foundational to achieving gender equity. We advocate for public policies that ensure all women and girls can reach their full potential. Our expertise in policy advocacy includes helping to pass legislation that supports survivors of sexual violence, provides pathways to economic security and creates solutions to problems set up by systems that were never meant for us. 
Unfortunately, very few bills prioritized and championed by legislators this session support women, especially ones like Legislative Bill 89 that claim in name but fail to make any real positive impact in our lives. This so-called “Stand With Women Act” would, if it becomes law, let politicians decide who is “male” and “female” and ban a very small number transgender people from certain bathrooms and sports teams. 
Help women’s lives
While some members of the Legislature spend a lot of time saying they “stand with women” and want to “protect women,” they fail to pass policies that provide us with paid leave when we are sick or caring for our young children and aging parents. They refuse to center our right to bodily autonomy and continue to restrict access to reproductive health care, inserting themselves into our most personal decisions and stripping us of our privacy. 
They attempt to overturn our vote to raise the minimum wage, which impacts our ability to pay rent or put food on our tables. They use the weight of the government to tell us what it means to be a woman, while we’ve been living our lives all these years experiencing the ramifications of their votes.
Nebraska lawmakers could be doing so much more to support women in our state and create meaningful change in our lives. But they will fail again if they use the limited days left of this session attempting to pass legislation like LB 89 while claiming to support us. The bill will not protect us. It will not improve our lives in any measurable way. We know who perpetuates gender-based violence in our communities, and we can clearly see who and what systems are impeding our progress. 
Actions, not words
For too long, lawmakers have attempted to distract and divide our energy. The Nebraska Legislature has pretended to care about us while taking away our rights or failing to pass the policies we need to support ourselves and our families, including those we voted for directly on the ballot.
To the women of Nebraska and our allies, it’s time to remember just what and who we are fighting for: equal pay for equal work, the ability to safely raise our families, the right to decide when and if to become a parent, the privacy to make our own medical decisions, fair workplaces and communities free from violence. 
To Nebraska lawmakers: We are at a critical point in our state’s history, and in our work to protect and advance gender equity. Are you ready to pass meaningful legislation that supports all women? We are beyond ready.

(Photo courtesy Lanny Hartmann)The little-known team of 18 Maryland Department of Agriculture inspectors that typically checks equipment such as gas pumps and grocery store scales for accuracy has a new target: electric vehicle chargers.
In recent weeks, the department has begun dispatching the “weights and measures” inspectors to public EV charging stations around the state for the first time, including some inspections that were in response to customer complaints, said Alison Wilkinson, the agency’s chief of weights and measures.
It might come as a relief for EV drivers, including Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks, who said he sometimes struggles to find reliable chargers for his state-issued electric car.
“It’s become more important, obviously, as I can’t get back from someplace, because I go to three different places, and I spend an hour sitting there … And it’s not charging,” Atticks said in a recent interview.
Wilkinson said the weights and measures team won’t police chargers for their “uptime,” or how often they work for motorists, instead making sure that each charger gives an accurate accounting of the electricity it is dispensing, and charges consumers accordingly.
But if an inspector visits an inoperable charger, Wilkinson said her agency would take action, notifying the operator and requiring fixes.
“We do not oversee uptime. That does not fall under Weights and Measures authority. However, under Weights and Measures authority, it does specify that the device owner is required by Maryland law to maintain their devices in an accurate working state for the consumer,” Wilkinson said.
Already, inspectors have temporarily shut down a “handful” of EV chargers for violations, Wilkinson said, mostly for illegally charging customers by the hour, rather than by kilowatt-hour, potentially penalizing customers for slower charging.
Moore issues executive order that could delay EV sales penalties

The inspection program comes as the electric vehicle industry faces an uncertain future, with the new presidential administration reneging on support for EVs and rescinding significant funding for charging infrastructure, including the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula program, which was expected to fund dozens of chargers along highways in Maryland.
“The industry as a whole is facing strong headwinds coming out of Washington, D.C., so it does pose a question for a state like Maryland that has bold EV goals,” said Josh Cohen, head of policy for SWTCH charging company. “Is now the time to impose unwieldy regulations on chargers while the industry is still just getting off the ground?”
But some legislators say the problem is significant enough to warrant inspections.
Aside from Tesla chargers, which have a reputation for reliability, “the record is not tremendous,” said state Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County). That frustrates existing EV drivers and could stymie future purchases, all while the state is trying to encourage EV purchases to meet climate goals, she said.
“The last thing we want is for people who have made the investment in an EV to throw up their hands and go back to a gas guzzler,” Hettleman said.
She introduced Senate Bill 913, that would have codified the Agriculture Department’s authority to inspect EV chargers and called on it to develop and enforce new reliability requirements for chargers, which would have to be operational about 97% of the time. The bill failed, in part because it had a high cost of implementation during an incredibly tight year for the state budget.
But the Agriculture Department determined that it could begin inspections without a new law, using its existing authority over weights and measures. That’s because the department follows a national weights and measures policy — the National Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook 44 — that has already been updated to include assessments for EV chargers.
Lanny Hartmann, a Maryland EV driver and blogger focused on charging, participated in a survey of charging infrastructure around the state in late 2024 and early 2025. It found that about half of the state’s chargers were owned by electric vehicle manufacturers Tesla and Rivian, and those ports were 99% operational.
But the remaining chargers were inoperable 31% of the time, Hartmann said in testimony on Hettleman’s bill. He said many of those chargers are funded by public dollars, or were installed by electric utilities using ratepayer funds, under a program run by the Maryland Public Service Commission that is currently under evaluation.
But Hartmann said he is “not convinced that the solution is to appoint the government as the EV charging station police.” He worries that if the state places new inspection costs on charging companies, that cost would be passed onto consumers.

“Every penny that the price goes up … adds up, and there’s already been a disturbing trend of the price of public charging creeping up,” Hartmann said.
The Agriculture Department in January began registering service technicians, who install, repair and calibrate EV chargers. The registration fee is $200 per agency, $50 per technician and an additional $25 for a required test.
The department will begin requiring registrations for every consumer-facing charging device next, Wilkinson said, with regulations being drafted now that could take effect this fall or winter. She said costs of the program will be covered by annual registration fees, which haven’t been determined yet. The cost per device will depend on “the amount of time and effort that would be put into it,” the number of workers needed and the overall cost of equipment for the program, Wilkinson said.
In order to conduct the inspections, the department still needs to purchase large testing equipment known as a standard. Each machine costs more than $100,000, and the department will also need vehicles to transport them, and training for staff, Wilkinson said.
She said the department will likely need two or three more staff members to handle the EV charger inspections. The state will be aiming to visit all Maryland chargers every few years.
Inspecting EV chargers could present challenges that inspecting gas pumps don’t, Wilkinson said. Unlike gas stations, some EV charging stations are inside parking garages, meaning inspectors might have to pay just to access them.
Then, they will need to pay for the power at each station — at a gas station, inspectors can just return any fuel they pump without incurring a charge, Wilkinson said.
And slower EV chargers might be in use for hours at a time, increasing the chances that inspectors would have to leave and return later for testing.
“We have a pretty good idea how we’re going to move forward, but there will still be some hurdles to address along the way, just as there is with any new emerging technology,” Wilkinson said.
Cohen, of SWTCH, said his company supports the meter accuracy rules, but that states must enforce those rules thoughtfully, or risk placing onerous requirements on a nascent industry. He added that he hasn’t seen much evidence that there are wide-scale problems with electric meter inaccuracy on chargers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“You could potentially have chargers being tagged by a field inspector as being out of service, just based on some network glitch that is able to be remotely fixed, and then require a field inspector to go back out again to retest it,” Cohen said. “It’s all needless delays and downtime for chargers that drivers are trying to charge at.”
In mid-April, Hartmann said he found a charger in Columbia blocked off by signs stating it had been “condemned” by the Agriculture Department. This week, the charger was still closed.
When it comes to EV charger reliability, Cohen said he sees a need for “more carrots and less sticks.” He thinks that charger manufacturers have an intrinsic motivation to keep their chargers running, and compete with titans like Tesla.
“I understand that legislators are responding to constituent frustration about some chargers that don’t provide the experience that we want them to,” Cohen said. “The industry itself is evolving, and competing to improve its products and services and address those concerns.”
State legislators said they plan to return to the drawing board next year — and they have a plan for trimming the bill’s fiscal note.
This year’s bill called for a website that would publish chargers’ functionality in real time, which added a $2 million cost to the bill’s fiscal note. Hettleman said that database was “aspirational,” and may not be included when the bill is revived for the next legislative session.
Del. Nick Allen (D- Baltimore County), who sponsored a companion bill to Hettleman’s in the House, said he’s optimistic that an amended bill would pass next session, particularly given the importance of EV adoption for the state’s climate goals.
“Right now, it’s kind of a Wild West,” Allen said. “If we want to reach our goals of so many zero-emission vehicles being sold in Maryland — if we want to reach all these ambitious climate and emissions related goals, we need to make sure that when people pull off to charge their EV they have the same confidence that they do pulling into a gas station.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54484999862_1c4a1bd3c9_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-30 03:59:39.449697

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The good news is that the state’s schools are not going to lose $418 million in federal funding they feared was lost last month when federal officials abruptly announced they were clawing back unspent pandemic recovery funds.
The bad news is that the state could still be out $232.1 million, the Maryland Board of Education was told Tuesday.
The confusion came after school officials received a letter last month from the U.S. Department of Education, informing states that the Trump administration would cancel Biden administration extensions that would have given schools until next year to spend down any remaining COVID-19 recovery funds.
That letter, from U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon, came in an email on Friday, March 28, at 5 p.m., which said the cancellation would take effect immediately. It said the federal department would consider reimbursing states, but only under narrow provisions.
“This took us off guard, needless to say at five o’clock on a Friday,” said Maryland State Superintendent Carey Wright. In the confusion, state officials estimated that as much as $418 million could be at stake for state schools.
Now, they say, the number is closer to $232.1 million.
Krishna Tullar, deputy state superintendent for the department’s Office of Finance and Operations, summarized from a chart that more than half of that amount, $144.9 million, comes from the third, and final, iteration of the American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief, or ARP ESSER, program.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The remaining $87.2 million came from earlier versions of ESSER and from other pandemic-response funds. It was slated for uses such as mental health services, professional development for teachers and for students experiencing homelessness, like residing in transitional housing.
Donna Gunning, assistant superintendent in the department’s division of financial planning, operations and strategy, said the federal government has not reimbursed the state for at least $127.5 million that has already been allocated. Another $104.6 million is money not reimbursed to the state’s local school systems.
Gunning said about $56.7 million of the school system money has been designated as “encumbered” and not spent by the school systems also called local education agencies, also known as LEAs.
Board President Joshua Michael summarized how local school districts will be affected if they are not reimbursed by the federal government for the millions they have spent.
“That could mean salaries for 2,000 teachers next year. It could mean 12,000 students in our pre-K program. We will have to come up with this money,” he said. “These are real dollars.”
Without schools being reimbursed, certain projects or educational programs must immediately stop. Board Vice President Monica Goldson said many local school systems “were counting on receiving that reimbursement in their FY ’26 budget.”
“And now they’ve been informed that they’re not. Then those cuts at the local level could be even more extreme than they are right now,” said Goldson, former CEO of Prince George’s County public schools. “I just want everybody to understand that we are falling off of the cliff quickly.”
Gunning said the state asked the federal department to reconsider its funding, but the only response received so far is that the reimbursement request for ESSER funding had to be resubmitted in another format.
Board member Rachel McCusker asked if there’s any indication when federal officials will inform the state of a decision.
“We are not aware of any state having received an approval since this decision,” Tullar said.
Because of the federal government’s decision, Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) joined other attorneys general in a lawsuit earlier this month against the federal agency to prevent it from arbitrarily changing its position so the states can continue to access the money that “provides essential support” for students.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Krishna-Tullar-4-29-2025-1024x774.jpg,,,2025-04-30 03:59:39.449697

Those were among the recommendations from the Task Force on Cell Phone Use in Schools, whose report was discussed Tuesday by the Maryland State Board of Education. The report suggests broad parameters — saying, for example, that restrictions should be most-stringent in lower grades, becoming more liberal as students age — but leaves the details to the state’s 24 school systems.
“So, our task force really wanted to create a guidance document and not a requirement that districts adopt certain aspects of a policy,” said Hannah Oakley, deputy director of the board and one of two facilitators on the task force. “We wanted to empower our districts to create these policies and not [create] a statewide mandate.”
At the beginning of the 2024-25 school year, school systems in the state had a range of cell phone policies, the one constant being that cell phones should be turned off during instructional time.
Cell phone use drew the attention of state lawmakers, who introduced a total of six separate bills on the topic during  this year’s General Assembly session, all of which would have required local school systems to have a cell phone policy in place.

All but one of the bills died in committee. The bill sponsored by Sen. Joanne C. Benson (D-Prince George’s) — which would have required the state Department of Education to develop guidelines for a policy “on student electronic devices during school hours” — made it to the House, which sent it back to the Senate with amendments on the last day of the legislative session, when time ran out on it.
The 17-member task force comprised of state officials, school superintendents, principals, teachers, parents and students did suggest a few requirements.
One would be for school districts to adopt a telehealth exception on cell phone use by middle and high school students with medical reasons that might require a phone, such as monitoring diabetes, or for those who have sensory or mental health needs. It recommended that those policies be in place in time for the 2025-26 school year.
In terms of student discipline, the task force said schools could follow a plan similar to one implemented in Montgomery County, which takes a graduated approach to responding to phone infractions.
The report also recommends school leaders could implement “phone-free initiatives,” incorporating a schoolwide campaign, for instance, for students to earn incentives by voluntarily turning off their phones and allowing school staff to put them away.
Cell phones as defined in the report would also include personal smart watches, headphones, laptops and tablets.
School board President Joshua Michael said he’s seeing young people wear Beats headphones “everywhere I go.”
The board took no action on the report Tuesday after a brief discussion. For the next step, Michael said the plan is for the board to turn any key recommendations into a resolution “that affirms the work of this report that we may consider as a board before moving into next school year.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2070585229-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 03:59:39.449697

(Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Energy)As CEO of BTS Software Solutions, a Maryland-based defense and intelligence technology firm, I frequently visit America’s leading defense tech hubs. Surprisingly, the most dynamic ecosystems aren’t always in Maryland or Northern Virginia but in fast-growing cities like Augusta, Georgia, and San Antonio and Austin, Texas.
In visiting these places, it is with an eye toward bringing best practices back to Maryland to accelerate our growth in a competitive national and international environment.
These cities not only have thriving commercial tech economies, but also host major federal technology centers. Augusta is home to the National Security Agency and the U.S. Army Cyber Command Center of Excellence. Austin houses the Army Futures Command headquarters and attracts artificial intelligence, robotics and cybersecurity firms. San Antonio, also an NSA hub, now boasts over 1,000 tech companies, including industry giants like Microsoft and Accenture.

It’s no coincidence that Texas ranks as the third-best business climate in the U.S., Georgia ranks fourth, and Maryland lags at 31st.
What sets these states apart is their commitment to policies that help technology firms grow. That’s why it’s alarming to see Maryland take the opposite approach by enacting a 3% sales tax on information technology and related services—the so-called Tech Tax.
While businesses understand the need for a balanced state budget, this tax directly undermines Maryland’s stated goal of leveraging our true strategic advantage – a world-class concentration of technology and cybersecurity firms. Maryland is home to over 3,300 federal contracting firms, with many ranging from traditional IT services to some of the most cutting-edge technologies in the world. Most operate as subcontractors to large businesses with prime contracts to the federal government. Because they provide services through another business, they will be directly impacted by the Tech Tax.
In a federal market where a 10% margin is considered strong, an additional 3% tax makes Maryland subcontractors less competitive, reducing their ability to reinvest, grow, and hire. This tax will not only stifle job creation but also drive firms to more business-friendly states.
Maryland’s technology companies don’t operate in isolation. They have options, and with the Tech Tax now law, recruiters from lower-cost, high-growth states will have an enticing pitch. Meanwhile, federal agencies, under increasing budget scrutiny, will look for lower-cost alternatives — putting Maryland firms at a clear disadvantage.
Over time, if Maryland firms consistently lose contracts due to higher costs, many will relocate to more dynamic states where business conditions are more favorable. This would be a devastating blow to our state’s economic future.
Gov. Wes Moore has rightly called Maryland’s technology sector a “lighthouse industry” that will guide our state’s economy forward. Yet, the Tech Tax threatens to extinguish that light, forcing federal subcontractors to move operations elsewhere.
As a longtime Marylander, I urge policymakers to reconsider the long-term consequences of these decisions. A tax that undermines our technology industry will hinder Maryland’s economic growth and cedes our competitive advantage to other states.

,California,2025-04-30 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,"When California politicians ignore policy risks, failure and scandal often result",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/california-politicians-ignore-policy-risks/,California lawmakers have a knack for instituting major programs without scrutinizing the potential downsides. A new proposal to create a state infrastructure financing board could become another example.,"California’s governors and legislators have a very bad habit of enacting major programs and projects without fully exploring their downside risks.
The most spectacular example occurred in 1996, when a Republican governor, Pete Wilson, and a Democrat-controlled Legislature decided to overhaul California’s electric power industry.
The legislation was hammered out in lengthy and secret negotiations that participants dubbed the “Steve Peace death march” for the state senator who ramrodded the effort. It was enacted with only cursory public input.
As a 2003 autopsy of the ensuing disaster chronicled, “The act was hailed as a historic reform that would reward consumers with lower prices, reinvigorate California’s then-flagging economy, and provide a model for other states. Six years later, the reforms lay in ruins, overwhelmed by electricity shortages and skyrocketing prices for wholesale power. The utilities were pushed to the brink of insolvency and are only slowly regaining their financial footing. The state became the buyer of last resort, draining the general fund and committing itself to spending $42 billion more on long-term power deals that stretch over the next ten years.”
Other examples of the bad habit abound, such as beginning construction of a bullet train linking the two halves of the state with only rudimentary assumptions of its costs, ridership and other important factors — a project that limps along nearly two decades later.
Two others are the immensely costly expansion of pension benefits for public employees a couple of decades ago, which has hammered local government budgets, and big increases in unemployment insurance benefits without increasing revenues, which resulted in a $20 billion debt to the federal government that is still growing.
That brings us to Senate Bill 769, which appears superficially to be a positive effort to expand infrastructure financing but could be another example of unanticipated consequences. The measure, introduced by Sen. Anna Caballero, a Merced Democrat, would create the Golden State Infrastructure Corporation, a state-owned nonprofit company that could borrow money or issue bonds and provide financing for public or private infrastructure projects.
State Treasurer Fiona Ma is the bill’s sponsor and would appoint the corporation’s top executive, who would answer to a five-member board of elected officials and governors’ appointees.
“By partnering public and private capital, SB 769 enables critical investments in climate resilience, water systems, energy infrastructure, housing and transportation, creating jobs and future-proofing California for generations to come,” Caballero’s office contends.

 Democrat, State Senate, District 14 (Merced)



“California can’t afford to wait for Washington, or for outdated financing systems to catch up with 21st-century needs,” she said in a statement. “SB 769 is about building a resilient, modern California by creating a smarter, more flexible way to fund infrastructure that protects our communities, creates good jobs and prepares us for the challenges ahead.”
There are aspects to the proposal that should be triggering alarm bells.
There is no limit on how much debt the corporation could incur. The state would also not be liable if its financial structure collapsed. The decisions on financing private projects could be made secretly because the corporation would be exempt from some open meeting and open records laws.
The danger here is that with a potentially unlimited amount of money to be handed out with no public input, the political figures on the corporate board could be swayed to play favorites for reasons disconnected from infrastructure improvement.
We’ve seen scandals of that sort elsewhere in state government, such as in the Coastal Commission’s land use decisions and the California Public Employment Retirement System’s investments.
Without better safeguards and more sunshine, this is another scandal waiting to happen.

Getty ImagesChildhood poverty doesn’t happen by accident – it is found at the intersection of poor public policy, generational poverty, and a lack of access to essential resources. 
And while childhood poverty can’t be solved by one policy or organization alone it can be made much worse by removing one. Head Start is one of the most effective anti-poverty programs we have in the United States. Cutting it would have devastating effects on families and communities for generations to come. 
At Helping Mamas, a baby supply bank, we see every day what happens when children and families get the support they need and what happens when they don’t.
Head Start is so much more than just a preschool program. It is a family-centered program where parents receive workforce development support, health education and parenting education. Children receive quality early learning instruction closing literacy and school readiness gaps. It is a lifeline where families feel safe, loved and seen. 
Like many learning environments, Head Start Programs are often the heart of a community. Through my work with Helping Mamas I see Head Start utilizing our resources for diapers, wipes, car seats and other essential items. They became a place of safety during Hurricane Helene. They partnered with us to make sure that families in rural areas had access to essential items at their most vulnerable moments.
Head Start mobilizes the community to volunteer with children and parents. I know that when parents engage with Head Start they are getting the tools and support they need to break the cycle of generational poverty.
And I have to ask, in a time where the U.S. is consistently falling behind the world in academic achievement – particularly in math where U.S. students currently rank 28th globally – why would we cut a program that has shown to increase a child’s academic success all the way through college? 
I believe that good public policy, when paired with adequate funding, has the power to transform lives. It always has. 
And when you combine that with strong community partnerships, you’re not just supporting individual children — you’re investing in our future workforce, the long-term health of our communities, and the strength of our economy. 
Nonprofits alone cannot and should not continue to be the public safety net for our children. Overcoming educational deficits and poverty takes a combined approach of nonprofits, communities and public policy. Remove even one piece of the foundation and the structure won’t hold – collapsing along with the futures of our children.
Every dollar invested in Head Start generates up to $9 in economic returns through increased earnings, reduced reliance on public assistance and lower involvement with the criminal justice system. It also increases parental employment and reduced child maltreatment rates. 
Head Start was created as part of our country’s War on Poverty – because early childhood education, health care, and family support are not luxuries – they are necessities. Cutting Head Start doesn’t just impact our classrooms today – it threatens the future of our workforce, our economy and our country’s ability to compete on the world stage. 
So I will ask again: Can we afford the cost of cutting Head Start Programs? I don’t think so. Our children don’t think so. And if our politicians are serious about creating a better future, they shouldn’t think so either.  
This is more than a budget item, it is the future of our children and our communities. Let’s send the message that we cannot keep trying to balance a budget on the backs of our youngest most vulnerable citizens.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-30 04:01:40+00:00,CT Mirror,Don’t ban challenges to sexually explicit materials targeting minors,Brian Gedicks,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/30/say-no-to-authoritarian-ban-on-challenges-to-sexually-explicit-materials-targeting-minors-in-our-libraries-brian/,Two bills this session would force libraries across CT to adopt policies that restrict challenges to sexually explicit materials aimed at children.,"We have a porn problem in our culture, and it can start with exposing kids to pervasively vulgar and sexually explicit books, comic books, and graphic novels. 
Yet two bills proposed by legislators this session would force libraries across Connecticut to adopt policies that restrict challenges to sexually explicit materials aimed at children (SB1271, HB7014). Proponents claim the mantle of protecting “Huckleberry Finn” from “book banning” when they are really implementing “1984.” A closer look at the bills reveals an authoritarian attempt to intimidate parents and eliminate a transparent, locally controlled process.

Brian Gedicks
Right now, in Connecticut, no parent can remove a book from the library. According to the American Library Association, in all of 2024, only 17 books were even challenged in Connecticut – a tiny fraction of a percent in a state with over 1,000 libraries holding millions of books. 
But with these bills, one librarian can exempt large categories of books from challenge (HB7014 lines 49-66; SB1271 lines 36, 42, 62, 65) and even prevent a challenge by a board of education (SB1271(1)(1), (3), (4); HB7014(1)(d)). They also exclude most of the community from making a challenge by virtue of their childless status or whether someone else has already challenged the book, even if it was years ago (SB1271 lines 14, 15, 17, 79, 84; HB 7014(1)(4)). This is unfair, discriminatory, and antidemocratic.
The legislation would also give librarians gratuitous legal immunity (SB1271 section 1(f), 2(f)) while creating a way for them to sue parents and students for “emotional distress” (SB1271 section 1(g), 2(g)). Librarians should be learning from parents, instead of getting rattled when challenged over sexually explicit materials aimed at kids, which they chose to place in the school library. 
Why are concerned parents being targeted for prosecution when some librarians have been caught watching child pornography, even in the library? The latest case of a child librarian being charged for child pornography in Connecticut was as recent as August 2024.
“Dive deeper with your finger or a butt plug! Just make sure any objects you put up there have a flared base; otherwise, your hungry heinie can gobble it up,” advises Let’s Talk About It: The Teen’s Guide to Sex, Relationships, and Being a Human, a sexually explicit and graphically illustrated book, found in some of Connecticut’s school libraries. “I’ve never seen these in the library” claims Sen. Bob Duff. But has he looked? A quick review of the website takebacktheclassroom.com, which lists many vulgar and sexually explicit books in Connecticut school libraries, with excerpts, would educate Senator Duff about what concerned parents already know confronts their children in the local school library.
Senator Duff claims these bills “create a process.” But one does not need a law to create a process. And the proposed new processes mandated by the bills are unfair. 
Setting aside whether you think a teen should be instructed to “pay for your porn,” shouldn’t all parents and members of the community be allowed to object? The bills permit exclusion of books from challenge based on the opinion of only one librarian. The librarians could classify “Let’s Talk About It” as “sexual health” material (HB7014 lines 61-63) or “appropriate” (SB1271 lines 36, 42-46, 62, 65-66) and exempt it from any book challenge by a community member or parent (HB7014 lines 49-50; SB1271 lines 36-37, 42-43). 
It is time for concerned parents and all those who share those concerns to step up and petition their legislators to oppose these two extremist and radical bills, SB1271 and HB7014.

It can save a lot of time, provide an infinite amount of research, chat with us when no one else wants to, create outlines, press releases, and ad copy. It can rewrite our emails, structure our resumes, and in the medical community, it can provide diagnoses in record time that may result in saving lives.
In education, students like it because they can finish a homework assignment or write an essay in minutes instead of hours. And for teachers, AI can generate lesson plans and rubrics, compose quizzes, design projects, and even grade student essays and exams. Those who use it say this gives them more time to be better teachers in the classroom and that the feedback AI provides can be very similar to comments they would make. I can see why using an AI program isn’t all that different from having a teaching assistant do one’s grading, and who wouldn’t love to have a TA?
But I have some concerns.

Patrice Hamilton
First, higher education is under a microscope right now, which isn’t a bad thing because we could certainly make improvements. However, with the Department of Education being dismantled, now more than ever our society needs to believe in the importance and relevance of a college degree. 
We’re all familiar with what happened when every child who played a sport went home from the end-of-the-season banquet with a trophy. It was a well-intentioned idea, but the concept backfired because many children didn’t value the awards they received. Even at a young age, they needed to feel that they earned that ribbon or statue. What happens when college degrees are seen as another form of participation trophies? If students can get AI to write their papers, complete their math homework, fill out their lab reports, and answer their exam questions, getting a degree won’t be that big of a deal. 
Graduates need to feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with sweat and sacrifice, and professionals looking to hire should see graduation as a significant achievement as well.
Second, most of us know that one problem steroids create in sports is that if some athletes use them, this increases pressure on other athletes to use them just to stay competitive. I worry about this when it comes to education. Many students want to do their own work, and if they use AI or sources on the internet, they use them to enhance learning rather than replace it, but how will their efforts stack up against content created by an algorithm? After all, those students are only human.
I spoke with a colleague who teaches math, and they told me about a math major who had taken all of their upper-level math classes in online asynchronous courses; however, when they applied for a tutoring job, they were unable to pass a basic algebra test.
When I attend conferences, I listen to advice about what instructors can do to rewrite their assignments to discourage AI use, and yes, we should do what we can. But this puts the burden on the teacher to keep revising assignments, which is not only time-consuming, but very difficult given the way AI keeps evolving and the amount of websites that host research papers and exams keeps increasing. Of course, we could use AI to revise our exams, but this all starts to feel a bit Orwellian: AI writes paper assignments and exam questions, AI is used to respond to those assignments and exams, AI grades those papers and exams—the only thing missing is human beings. Of course, if we do use AI to grade student work, we would have to inform them of that. How will this impact students and their motivation to turn in authentic work?
As a professor, it can be dispiriting to read a batch of student work, especially when I teach an online class. With asynchronous courses, the only way I get to know my students is through their writing because I don’t have the opportunity to meet them in a classroom. 
When reading discussion posts, I used to get a sense of their personalities by their word choices, their individual examples, and their unique perspectives. Each discussion post had a different voice. Sure, the writing was flawed at times, and yes, I used to complain about wordy sentences and vague statements, but I felt that I knew my students. I miss that now. 
The other day, a colleague said, “I asked my class to write a literary analysis, and many of them turned in nearly perfect papers, but when I asked them what literary analysis is, only one student could come up with an answer.” They supposedly had done literary analyses, but they didn’t know what they had done.
There’s no such thing as a free lunch, and someday I think we will pay a price for the steroid we call AI. Someone who graduates with a college degree shouldn’t have to worry about what impression their writing will make if they can’t get a fix from an AI program.
It’s tempting to get on the AI train and see where it takes us. After all, we can’t be afraid of technological innovations. Maybe it’s not important that tomorrow’s leaders know how to write or calculate answers to problems. Maybe all they need to know is how to craft good prompts and edit the results. But I think we all can agree that they do need to know how to think, and AI is eager to do that for them as well. Should everyone who uses AI review it for errors and accuracy? Sure. Will they? Sometimes.
Another concern is whether business executives will want to pay top salaries to employees who completed their classes with the help of AI. Will those high GPAs carry the weight they used to? We all are keenly aware that graduates need substantial salaries to pay off those student loans.
I’m not suggesting we get rid of AI because the benefits it offers are important, and much like social media, we can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube. We have to learn to manage both AI and social media so that they add to our lives without creating dependency. 
Artificial Intelligence needs to be regulated. We need to have clear identification of all AI created videos, text, images, and audio, and we need regulations that hold platforms responsible for hosting exams, student papers, and deepfakes. We need to require students to cite the AI they used just as they would any other human source, and we need better tools that spot AI plagiarism so that when we talk to students, we can refer to reliable evidence. 
Teachers are advised to use their intuition when it comes to student work, but this is very difficult because with programs like Grammarly, we may never get to know their authentic writing voices, and the last thing we want to do is falsely accuse a student. Many instructors have students do more of their work during class, which helps, but at the end of the day, some work has to be done outside of the classroom, and when teaching an online course, that solution is impossible to implement. 
I also think that college institutions need more limitations regarding the amount of classes a student can take online, and I would like to see more hybrid courses offered so that students are required to demonstrate their knowledge in front of an instructor once or twice during a semester. 
One major reason students choose asynchronous classes is because they offer flexibility, which is especially important to students who juggle their courses along with work and family responsibilities, but we can find a way to provide that convenience while also ensuring that students are learning what we think they are learning. I have heard that some math departments are leaning in this direction, and I hope that continues.
Social media companies like Meta and X are reducing fact-checking and putting the responsibility on the user to call out misinformation. We can’t rely on the gatekeepers of the past, which means we need a population who has information literacy skills, and we all have to protect ourselves from becoming intellectually lazy. 
People tell me that they frequently use AI at work—it saves employees time and the company money. I think that’s great, but education is a different matter. We are teaching students to not only accomplish a task, but to deepen their intellects. AI shouldn’t be a crutch and we shouldn’t let it become an addiction. I would rather read my students’ work, warts and all, then read some artificial concoction that is bulging with muscles but has no beating heart.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-30 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Banning books dissolves democracy,Mia Gorlick,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/30/banning-books-dissolves-democracy-mia/,"Ultimately, this is a matter of people, of personhood, and of the right to question and oppose, and learn and affect change.","Since July 2021, an estimated 15,940 book titles have been banned in public schools across America, in 43 states and 415 public school districts. During the 2023-2024 academic year alone, PEN America counted over 10,000 book bans in 29 states and 220 school districts. 
Seventy-eight percent of surveyed educators said that their “students read more when they have free choice in what to read, including access to banned books,” and 81% “feel that conversations around banned books and restrictions to book access harm students.”
The data speaks for itself. Book bans have become a core facet of contemporary American politics, and continue to more forcefully occupy our collective political conscience with each passing year. 
Such censorship is a federal overreach that actively breeds illiteracy, ignorance, and intolerance. Simultaneously, these restrictions deprive states, school districts, libraries, families, and individuals of their autonomy, choice, and freedom to educate and be educated. Without protected educational rights, there is no individual and collective progression or evolution, no ability to cultivate future generations, affect global change, or resist systems of oppression. Without education, the very seats in government that create and contest bills aimed at addressing these pressing issues will not be conscientiously filled, nor their obligations dutifully fulfilled.
In order to preserve liberty, support existing educational precedents, and generate new precedents that may lead to further reform and greater literary and scholastic protections, it is necessary that the state of Connecticut show its support of civil liberties and the fundamental right to read and read freely by passing H.B. 5508: An act concerning a freedom to read.
This bill would restore agency to the state of Connecticut and its local and regional boards of education in their ability to prescribe the materials accessible in school libraries. 
Other states have already started setting legislative precedents in opposition to censorship and infringement, including California with law AB-1078 (forbids the prohibition or denial of approval of the use of instructional materials, including those in school libraries, simply for containing information about diverse groups) and Illinois with HB 2789 which became Public Act 103-0100 (holds that the State’s policy is to support and safeguard the ability of libraries and library systems to obtain materials without external restrictions, and to protect libraries and related library systems from efforts to ban, remove, or otherwise limit access to books or other resources/materials).
Beyond this data, however, I find it even more important to return to the very heart of this issue: our humanity. Ultimately, this is a matter of people, of personhood, and of the right to question and oppose, and learn and affect change. 
I remember falling in love with reading in preschool. Having access to a wide and uninhibited range of literature has helped me develop a unique identity and thought process over the course of my lifetime. Volunteering at the preschool I attended as a young child, I have seen countless other children embark on this same process of self-discovery, using these scholastic spaces and materials to self-educate and explore the world around them. I now attend Yale, speaking and engaging in political discourse, realizing and exercising my political efficacy, innately aware that so much of this opportunity has been granted to me because of the skills I developed from an expansive, inclusive, and multi-faceted education.
Participation in and resolutions of sociopolitical issues such as these require critical thinking. Critical thinking is developed through an education that begins with access. If the literature in jeopardy provides us with the developmental and social tools to question their very place in our society, it is imperative that we consider what might occur – or perhaps what might cease – in their absence.  
Without access to these materials that are now in threat of extinction, we will not have the tools to generate such discourse.
Literacy grants us knowledge. Knowledge gives us power. Power vests the next generations with the capacity to affect positive change. Ensuring this legacy begins with providing and protecting the liberty and the resources that promote a global, holistic, inclusive, productive, and universally apt education.
Discourse surrounding such controversial issues might cease to exist if we do not safeguard access to the very knowledge that assists in our development into critical thinkers and global citizens. To eliminate certain perspectives, viewpoints, and media is to effectively eliminate the ethics and integrity of education. 
If you want to protect these fundamental educational rights within the state of Connecticut, I ask that you take positive action. Show your support for this bill that currently awaits passage in the Connecticut General Assembly. Contact your local representatives. Interact with your legislators. Support school districts, libraries, and other public educational institutions in their quest to provide unmitigated access to reading materials. 
Above all, recognize the power of your voice. All of the beloved heroes and villains and protagonists and side characters from your favorite books are beloved because they had a unique voice that inspired you. They are memorable and remarkable because of the impact they made and the imprint they left. They taught you to recognize and believe in your own voice.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Ahead of its vote on a bill to restrict political donations in state elections, members of the House’s multipartisan majority rejected a series of amendments that would have expanded the bill. 
Among the rejected proposals were ideas to require greater disclosure of donations funneled through so-called dark money groups enabled by the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision known as Citizens United. 
The rejected amendments, from Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, would have required prompt disclosure of donations to independent expenditure groups, required advertising disclosures, and sought to limit out-of-state contributions to groups backing ballot measures. Federal courts have struck down Alaska’s limits on out-of-state contributions to candidates.
Previous bills dealing with independent expenditures haven’t advanced to a floor vote, making the rejected amendments significant.
Inverting the usual pattern, Republican lawmakers proposed the restrictions, and they were defeated by the votes of independents and Democrats. 
Speaking on the House floor, McCabe called the lack of disclosure rules for third-party groups “a critical loophole” in state law.
Traditionally in Alaska, Republicans have supported actions to reduce limits on campaign contributions. The Republican Governors Association has repeatedly challenged disclosure rules imposed by voters in a 2020 ballot measure, and a Republican-backed lawsuit led to the elimination of Alaska’s campaign finance limits in 2022.
A ballot measure scheduled for Alaska’s 2026 elections would reimpose some limits, but if House Bill 16 becomes law, those limits would come into effect ahead of the election.
McCabe argued that HB 16 should be extended to cover independent expenditures, not just direct donations.
“Independent expenditure groups have become a big part of our political campaigns,” he said, speaking on one of his amendments.
Other lawmakers noted that most of the political mailers that filled Alaskans’ mailboxes last year were from independent expenditure groups, not politicians’ campaigns.
“Voters deserve to know who is funding the message,” McCabe said.
Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage and a sponsor of the ballot measure and HB 16, was among the lawmakers who voted against the dark-money amendments. 
“I think there is concern amongst the Alaskan public around both contribution limits and independent expenditure spending. However, the dire concern is really around the hole around campaign finance, and so to the maximum extent possible, my efforts were to try and keep the bill constrained to what was approved through the ballot measure, and to address the campaign  finance portion of this,” Schrage said.
Under the Alaska Constitution, a law can replace a ballot measure only if the underlying bill is “substantially similar” to the ballot measure.
In addition to the dark-money amendments, the House rejected a proposal to exempt most municipal elections from campaign-finance reporting requirements, and an amendment that would have prevented the recipients of state contracts — and their family members — from donating to political campaigns. 
That amendment was almost identical to a bill rejected by Hawaii’s Legislature on the same day that the Alaska House turned down the idea. Several states, including New Jersey, have so-called “pay for play” disclosure rules; the amendment proposed by Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, would have gone further by actually restricting donations.
Schrage said it went too far.
“With that specific amendment, I think my biggest concern was around the fact that family members would be prohibited from making donations to political campaigns,” Schrage said. “The courts have been pretty clear that we need to be careful about limiting people’s free speech, and thanks to Citizens United, political spending is considered free speech.”
In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission eliminated restrictions on spending by political groups unaffiliated with a particular politician. Since then, the amount of money spent by independent groups has significantly increased. So has the role of dark money contributions — money funneled through independent groups in order to conceal the identity of the donor.
A ballot measure approved by Alaska voters in 2020 requires independent groups to disclose the “true source” of their contributions, but that measure has exemptions: It doesn’t cover ballot measure groups, for example.

	Schrage said some of the rejected ideas could show up in separate legislation, but he wanted to keep HB 16 confined to the ballot measure that’s ready for a vote in 2026.
“There’s always this question of, how much do you try to do, and how much can you fit into a bill before it becomes too heavy and too controversial to make it through the process. There is a very strong desire from Alaskans to address our campaign contribution limits, and we have a very clear proposal before us. I wanted to move forward,” he said.

For many years, Eric Wunderlin’s health issues made it hard to find stable employment.
Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.

Using health programs to encourage work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women and disabled people.

Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.
The hunt for results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”

Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

Jan. 28, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s educational savings accounts designed to help pay for public or private college expenses could expand to cover private K-12 tuition, in line with federal law, beginning in 2029.
The proposed change from State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area was amended 32-11 Tuesday evening into Legislative Bill 647 after multiple hours of debate. At least 42 states already allow such savings accounts to cover tuition at K-12 private schools, which was first allowed in 2018 after passage of the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for up to $10,000 per beneficiary per year.
A 529 savings plan — in Nebraska, NEST 529 — offers tax breaks to encourage families or students to donate and allow the savings to grow tax-free. 
Multiple attempts to expand the accounts in Nebraska have stalled in recent years.
‘Great way to save’
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, who led LB 647 as chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, said he didn’t have the “foreknowledge” to use NEST 529 accounts for his children. But he “very gladly” started them for his grandchildren and suggested others do so.
“It’s a great way to save for college education, and with the implementation of this bill … those funds could also be used for primary education,” von Gillern said.

Von Gillern said that of the other states without expanded accounts — California, Oregon, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan and New York — it is “probably not a club that you would imagine Nebraska being in.”
“It sort of reminds me in grade school when they showed you pictures of five cats and a dog and said, ‘Which one doesn’t belong there?’” Sorrentino told von Gillern during the debate.
‘Subsidizing’ private school dollars
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln led opposition to Sorrentino’s measure, which he noted did not directly send public dollars to private schools. However, he and State Sen. Dunix Guereca of Omaha said it was in the same vein as the defeat of a private school voucher system last fall at the ballot box.
“We are indirectly subsidizing the tax deductions for money that goes to tuition for private K-12 education,” Dungan said of Sorrentino’s proposal, originally LB 131.

Guereca, who, along with Dungan, has been on the frontlines advocating against recent school choice proposals, said the November vote was about the “concept” of using public dollars for private schools. He said the tax breaks allowed under Sorrentino’s expanded measure could instead be used for a “plethora of other ideas,” particularly with the state’s projected budget shortfall.
“I’m afraid that if we do pass this measure then it’s a slippery slope to see more and more school privatization,” Guereca said.
Dungan raised concern that Sorrentino’s measure would not allow savings to cover K-12 public school expenses, such as for extracurriculars. Sorrentino said he was “fine” with including public schools but that doing so is not federally allowed.
Budget woes
The measure’s start date was pushed back to 2029 in part to push it beyond the state’s budget woes, not just for the next two fiscal years, at nearly $400 million in the hole with even the cuts proposed in the Appropriations Committee budget, but also following two years to mid-2028. The state would be about $700 million short of the mark future lawmakers would need to hit, based on current projections.
  State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area. Aug. 13, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Sorrentino’s measure could lead to new tax breaks of about $3-4 million each year, but he cautioned that the estimate is based on assumptions of 12,000 to 15,000 people opening new accounts and meeting the maximum $10,000 contributions to those accounts.
Of 49 state senators, he said each could come up with a different estimate. He said it could be as much as $5 million or as little as $500,000. He said he thought the number was likely closer to $3 million.
State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County said Sorrentino’s measures could alleviate public school overcrowding, possibly leading to overall cost savings to the state.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln differed from her progressive colleagues and voted for the bill, as did State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, a more moderate Democrat. State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, a Republican who has rebuffed past school choice proposals, voted against adding Sorrentino’s measure to LB 647. The other votes largely followed party lines.
Conrad said Sorrentino’s measure was “intellectually and practically and policy-based distinguishable from some of the prior measures that we have looked at.”
Said Conrad: “This measure doesn’t seem to really raise the exact kind of concerns about a dilution or diminution of public funds into private schools.”

(Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)Humanities Montana announced Tuesday it is receiving a grant of up to $250,000 from the Mellon Foundation following news its budget was slashed as part of recent federal budget cuts.
The contribution is made up of an immediate $200,000 and an additional $50,000 available in matching grants, according to a news release from Humanities Montana.
The money is part of a $15 million “emergency funding commitment” from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for all 56 states and jurisdictional councils of the Federation of State Humanities Councils, according to the news release.


Match the grant
Any donations received by Humanities Montana starting April 29, 2025, count towards the match, Humanities Montana said. Members of the public can donate to Humanities Montana by visiting www.humanitiesmontana.org.


Humanities Montana Executive Director Jill Baker said the organization is “deeply grateful and humbled” by the outpouring of support it has received in response to news early this month that its federal grant was being terminated.
“This significant investment from the Mellon Foundation is a powerful affirmation of the value of public humanities,” Baker said in a statement. “Investing in the public good, our communities, and our neighbors has always been a source of pride for Montanans. I remain hopeful that this tradition will hold.”
Humanities Montana supports arts and civics programs across the state. It passes on most of the money it receives to other organizations and arts projects, and last year, it said funding reached all 56 counties.
In the news release Tuesday, Humanities Montana said the money comes at a critical moment, when $65 million in federal support for state humanities councils has been eliminated as a result of federal cuts to the National Endowment for the Humanities.
However, Humanities Montana also said a nearly $500,000 shortfall remains.
“Additional support is necessary in order to continue providing a robust level of public humanities programming, which brings writers, poets, historians, scholars, artists, and performers to museums, community centers, parks, libraries, and educational institutions, including in public, private, and homeschool settings, across Big Sky Country,” the organization said in the news release.
On April 2, Humanities Montana received a letter from the acting chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities that said its grant was terminated “in its entirety” effective the same day, April 2.
The letter cited an executive order from the Trump administration to reduce “federal bureaucracy” and “safeguard the interests of the federal government, including its fiscal priorities.”
“The termination of your grant represents an urgent priority for the administration,” the letter said.
In the news release Tuesday, Humanities Montana said the loss totaled $725,000.
The funder and network of humanities councils praised the impact the arts have on communities in a separate news release Tuesday from the Mellon Foundation.
“The places where American communities come together to read, learn, and engage with the humanities’ vast and varied forms of knowledge and creativity are often those supported by these councils,” said Elizabeth Alexander, president of the Mellon Foundation, in a statement.
The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation describes itself as the nation’s largest supporter of the arts and humanities with a belief that the humanities and arts are essential to human understanding.
Federation of State Humanities Councils President Phoebe Stein said the support from the Mellon Foundation allows the Federation to preserve the network, along with the connections and understanding it fosters.
“This is more than a grant — it’s a lifeline for communities across the country who rely on their humanities councils’ programs and grants to fill critical needs and enrich their lives,” Stein said in a statement.

Woodside Energy Group said it has reached a final investment decision to proceed with the project in Calcasieu Parish formerly known as the Driftwood LNG Terminal. Woodside purchased Driftwood less than a year ago, betting on a project that has encountered several stops and starts since 2017, partly the result of volatility in the fossil fuels market. 
Plans include new production and processing facilities in Lake Charles that will create an estimated 16.5 million metric tons of LNG for the global fuels market.
Woodside announced later in the day it had reached a deal with BP to provide natural gas for its Louisiana facility, Reuters reported. Terms of the deal were not made public. 
Gov. Jeff Landry touted the Woodside commitment as the largest single foreign investment and greenfield project in Louisiana history. In doing so, the Republican governor invoked a slogan his Democratic predecessor, John Bel Edwards, frequently used.
“Our ‘all of the above’ approach to energy is working,” Landry said in a statement. “We have four active LNG terminals in Louisiana – more than any other state. With more than 30,000 miles of natural gas pipelines, it is clear that when it comes to LNG, Louisiana is the place to be. We are not only promising President Trump’s agenda, we are delivering it!”

Lengthy effort to remake Omaha’s Crossroads mall site hits ‘milestone’

It is part of the first phase of the overall redevelopment initiative. That first phase covers about one-third of The Crossroads site and also is to feature apartments, office space, shopping and parking. 
The broader site — about 42 acres — has been billed by developers and city officials as an $850 million-plus mixed-use campus buoyed by $105 million in city-approved public tax-increment financing.
Mayor Jean Stothert said in a statement Tuesday that the Gamescape center “will be part of the revival of this true crossroads of our city.”
Many have criticized the drawn-out redevelopment of the prominent corner of Nebraska’s largest city. Stothert said in the release that “we can all be confident in the construction timeline” and Woodbury’s record of development.
Woodbury officials, who took over the redevelopment of the site from a previous local team, said they consider the 72nd and Dodge Streets intersection among the best commercial real estate in the state.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan Tuesday due to the federal charges that allege she tried to help a man in her courtroom avoid arrest by federal immigration agents.
Dugan was arrested Friday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the Milwaukee County courthouse and has been charged with two federal criminal offenses, felony obstruction of a federal agency and a misdemeanor for concealing a person to help them avoid arrest. 
Earlier this month, ICE and other federal agents showed up outside her courtroom to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. The federal government alleges she helped Flores-Ruiz evade them by allowing him to exit using a side door without going past the agents. The agents then apprehended him outside the courthouse on foot.
The Court said in a two-page letter that it was in the public interest to relieve Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan of her duties. The letter stated that Dugan is temporarily banned from “exercising the powers of a circuit court judge” as of Tuesday.
“In the exercise of [the Supreme Court’s] constitutional authority and in order to uphold the public’s confidence in the courts of this state during the pendency of the criminal proceeding against Judge Dugan, we conclude, on our own motion, that it is in the public interest that she be temporarily relieved of her official duties,” the Court stated.
Dugan’s legal team said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that they “are disappointed that the Court acted in unilateral fashion. We continue to assert Judge Dugan’s innocence and look forward [to] her vindication in court.”

Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage, speaks to the Alaska House of Representatives on Friday, April 25, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Four years after a federal appeals court eliminated Alaska’s limits on political campaign contributions, the Alaska House of Representatives has taken a step toward reimposing them.
On Monday, the House voted 22-18 to approve House Bill 16, which mirrors the language of a ballot measure slated to go before voters in 2026.
Alaskans are expected to approve the upcoming measure by a wide margin, based on historical trends, but that approval would bring new limits into effect for the 2028 elections at the earliest. 
If the Legislature approves a substantially similar bill, it would allow limits for the 2026 election and remove the upcoming initiative from the ballot.
“This is something that Alaskans very clearly want,” said Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage and the sponsor of HB 16. Schrage is also a co-sponsor of the ballot measure.
HB 16 proposes to limit Alaskans to $2,000 in donations per candidate in each election cycle. For the governor’s race, where a lieutenant governor candidate and governor candidate run together on a single ticket, the limit would be $4,000. The limit for donations from one person to a political party or group would be $5,000.
If a group wants to donate to a candidate, the limit is $4,000, or $8,000 for the governor’s race.
Those limits would be adjusted for inflation every 10 years.
Alaska’s politicians have been able to collect unlimited amounts of campaign contributions since a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that found the state’s prior limits were unconstitutional. 
In 2021, a three-judge panel of the court ruled that a $500 annual limit — amounting to $1,000 over a two-year cycle — was too low. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a $1,075 limit set by Missouri in 1998 for a two-year cycle was constitutional; adjusted for inflation, that would be roughly $2,100 today.  
Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration declined to appeal the 2021 decision, and the Alaska Public Offices Commission implemented it starting with the 2022 election.
“This bill would allow us to reinstate those limits and again provide that protection to Alaskans — and frankly to us as elected officials — in helping to ensure that there is some faith and confidence among Alaskans in their elected officials, acting with integrity and not having undue influence on them by outsized donations,” Schrage said.
Each time ballot measures have proposed new limits for political donations, Alaskans have approved them by large margins. Public polling has shown continued large support for new restrictions.
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage, has been elected to the House four times and spoke in support of the bill.
“I can tell you that, to me, putting these contribution limits in place will help us do what we should be doing, and that is spending more time discussing and hearing from our constituents, learning about the needs and concerns of the voters that we will hopefully represent, and not thinking about the biggest check writers,” he said.
Voting against the bill were 18 members of the House’s Republican minority caucus. The only member of the caucus to vote in favor of it was Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna.
Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, spoke against the bill and urged lawmakers to reject it.
“I believe in Alaskans’ right to free speech, and the courts have ruled that political contributions are free speech,” she said. 
“We’ve gone through an entire election cycle without any limits, and I have not once heard on record any specific Alaskan contributions that have given the appearance or showed proof of corruption,” Vance said.
That matters because the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that limits on campaign donations are legal only if they are needed to avoid quid-pro-quo corruption or the appearance of corruption.
Schrage responded to Vance’s point by observing that the Alaska Department of Law has already reviewed the similar campaign-limits ballot measure for constitutionality and found no problems.
“It does not get certified unless the limits herein are viewed by our own administration as being constitutional,” he said. 
Schrage said that it’s clear by state history and opinion polling that Alaskans want to restrict campaign contributions, and that legislators should advance HB 16 to the governor’s desk.
“I would just encourage my colleagues here to vote yes on the bill,” he said, “and listen to their constituents who want to see us do something concrete to improve the trust in their elected officials and in their government.”

Taking the stage Tuesday evening, Trump wasted no time in continuing to push his disproven claim that the 2020 election had been stolen, telling the audience he’d actually won the state three times while recounting his past victories in Michigan despite losing the state to former President Joe Biden in 2020 by more than 154,000 votes.
Although several banners hung throughout the university’s sports and expo center, reflecting Trump’s campaign promises to bring back American jobs and usher in a “golden age” of American manufacturing, the President spent much of his speech talking about his administration’s efforts on immigration, criticizing his political opponents and recapping his work on other campaign promises.

However Trump told attendees to expect a surge in auto jobs, crediting his tax and tariff policies, though auto industry advocates have expressed concern about the policies.
In February, Ford CEO Jim Farley warned that Trump’s 25% tariff on goods imported from neighboring Mexico and Canada threatened to “blow a hole” in the U.S. auto industry, according to a report from Reuters. 
Sandy Baruah, president and CEO of the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce has also warned that the president’s tariffs would significantly harm Detroit-area businesses with 234,000 jobs in the region relying on trade and investment with Canada.
However, the President pointed to a recent executive order he’d signed offering automakers credits for up to 15% the value of vehicles assembled in the United States to offset the value of imported parts, saying the effort would help automakers bring factories back to the U.S. as quickly as possible. 
Glenn Stevens Jr., executive director of the auto industry advocacy group MichAuto, applauded the decision alongside another order making changes to how the levies would be enforced to prevent multiple tariffs from being charged on foreign-made vehicles.
“As MichAuto has advocated since these tariffs were first announced and communicated in our March 31 letter to the Trump administration, the automotive and mobility industry needs clear lines of sight on costs and reliable supply chains to remain globally competitive. Relief from these stacked duties would offer some of that much-needed clarity and help preserve the industry’s global competitiveness at a time of critical transition and investment,” Stevens said in a statement.
“MichAuto continues to believe that an ideal outcome is an accelerated renegotiation of the [United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement] to further position America and our North American strategic partners as strong competitors to China and its violations of intellectual property, over-capacity, and unfair trade practices,” he said.

Ahead of the rally, Trump touched down at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Twp., where he announced a new fighter mission of  21 F-15EX fighter jets to base at Selfridge. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called it a “huge bipartisan win for Michigan, decades in the making.”
Trump, with Whitmer at his side, announces new fighter wing for Michigan’s Selfridge air base 

“Since day one, I’ve been laser-focused on securing a new fighter mission at Selfridge and supporting the brave service members who step up for our communities every day,” Whitmer said in a statement. “I appreciate the President’s partnership on this new fighter mission that will protect jobs and show the world that Michigan is the best place to pioneer the next innovations in national defense.” 
Trump’s visit also follows the introduction of seven articles of impeachment from U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) who told the Michigan Advance Tuesday he wanted to introduce the resolution a day before the President comes to Michigan and “[Tells] us more lies about his 100 days of accomplishments.”
Thanedar’s office also unveiled four billboards in the Metro Detroit area calling for Trump’s impeachment ahead of the visit. 
“I had the television way down and I said to our great First Lady, ‘Listen, did I just hear is being impeached again?’ We’re getting good at this though,” said Trump, after mistakenly stating that Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.) was the one who brought the articles. 
Trump was impeached twice during his first administration, but was not convicted by the Senate in either case.
“They’ve gone totally crazy, these people. And you know what? They’ve totally lost their confidence.  They can’t even tell a lunatic like this dumb guy that said it. And then you have the other one that’s always with the cane. He’s always impeaching,” Trump said, referring to U.S. Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), who in February announced he would bring articles of impeachment against the president.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)One of the most cynical things Alaska legislators ever did — and that’s saying something — was vote to gut the 2002 minimum wage increase less than one year after passing it.  After trying to supplant a voter initiative approved for the 2002 election with weaker measures, Republican majorities finally took the advice of their own attorneys — that they could only moot the initiative with a bill virtually identical to the ballot measure — and passed such a bill, which included an annual cost of living adjustment and a provision requiring that the Alaska minimum wage would always be at least one dollar over the federal minimum.  Then-Speaker Pete Kott told the Daily News when the bill passed that it was preferable to letting the initiative pass since legislators wouldn’t have to wait two years to change it.  Less than a year later, they deleted the COLA and dollar-over-federal provisions.
In 2014, an initiative to raise the state minimum wage to what it would have been had the 2002 law remained intact, and restore the COLA and dollar-over-federal provisions, was approved.  Then-Speaker Mike Chenault, who had voted for both the 2002 law and the 2003 bill gutting it, tried to pull off the same cynical maneuver.  Chenault’s bill passed by one vote in the House, but Senate Republicans, to their credit, refused to play along and the initiative passed with a 70% vote.
Now Rep. Justin Ruffridge has reached into the old bag of tricks to try and gut the recently passed Ballot Measure 1 — approved with a 58% vote in November — before it even takes effect on July 1. Their HB 161 would exempt employers of less than 50 employees, and all seasonal employers, from the paid sick leave provisions of Ballot Measure 1.  
Under Alaska law, the Legislature can not repeal an initiative until two years after its adoption.  An initiative can be amended prior to two years, but the Alaska Supreme Court found in 1977 in Warren v. Thomas that the Legislature would exceed its power to amend “by passing an amendment which so vitiates the initiative as to constitute its repeal.” According to the Research and Analysis Section of the Alaska Department of Labor, 96% of Alaska’s private sector employers — the only employers subject to Ballot Measure 1 — employ fewer than 50 workers, and 43% of all private-sector workers in the state are employed by these employers.  The broad exemption for seasonal employers, regardless of size, would only increase the vitiating effect of HB 161 on the initiative and the clear intent expressed by the voters in passing it overwhelmingly.
Ballot Measure 1 was supported by a coalition of over 130 Alaska small businesses, employers who recognized the importance of providing a modest amount of paid sick leave to workers, for their well-being and productivity — and for the economic and physical health of our communities. No parent should have to decide between going to work or caring for a sick child.  Nor should they be forced to choose between losing a day’s pay or going to work sick and spreading illness to co-workers or customers.











We should protect our ability to enact needed legislation through initiatives, where the people themselves act as the Legislature.



	Seventeen states have paid sick leave laws, and none of the hysterical predictions of negative effects on their businesses or employment have come to pass.  Alaska used to be a leader in providing meaningful worker rights and protection.  Let’s at least be a follower now and afford our workers the same basic benefits enjoyed by millions of Americans in other states.
We should protect our ability to enact needed legislation through initiatives, where the people themselves act as the Legislature.  Our elected legislators should respect that process, but all too often, as in the case of HB 161, they do not.  We need to let them know that we didn’t elect them to thwart the will of the people, and that HB 161 is tantamount to a repeal of Ballot Measure 1 and should not pass.

Kim Reynolds in an effort to force the release of government records related to a decision to block The Satanic Temple of Iowa from staging an event at the Iowa State Capitol.
The lawsuit was docketed in Polk County District Court on Tuesday, four days after Reynolds sought a court injunction that would block the Des Moines Register from accessing an entirely different set of records. The Register is seeking documents pertaining to allegations about the finances of Lutheran Social Services and its affiliates, but the governor’s office has claimed the sought-after documents are covered by executive privilege and need not be disclosed.
The ACLU case also involves a claim of executive privilege by Reynolds’ office. The ACLU case stems from a June 2024 request by the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers for documents from the governor’s office that are related to the State of Iowa’s decision to cancel an Iowa Satanic Temple winter celebration in the rotunda of the Iowa State Capitol.

The governor’s office refused to produce all of the requested documents, citing executive privilege, even though, the ACLU argues, the documents in question are an executive agency report and documents related to media preparation.
Some relevant materials were turned over, but much was redacted, according to the ACLU.
“At present, this claimed ‘executive privilege’ has no limit unless one is self-imposed by the governor’s office,” the lawsuit states. “This would, contrary to the purposes, goals, and express language of Iowa’s Open Records Act, allow the governor’s office to reject the public interest in favor of free and open examination of public records solely because of the potential for inconvenience or embarrassment.”
In addition to Reynolds, the lawsuit names as a defendant Steven Blankinship, general counsel for governor.
The lawsuit seeks a court order declaring that Reynolds has violated the Iowa Open Records Law, an order enjoining the governor’s office from committing any future violations for one year, and an injunction requiring Reynolds to turn over the requested records.
The governor’s office has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, and her communications staff did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
It’s not the first time the ACLU and Reynolds have clashed over access to information. In 2023, the ACLU of Iowa successfully sued Reynolds’ office on behalf of Iowa Capital Dispatch and other media representatives and advocates for failing to respond in a timely fashion to journalists’ requests for information about the state’s response to COVID-19. The Iowa Supreme Court ultimately ruled against Reynolds, and her office was ordered to comply in a timely manner to public record requests from journalists.
The Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers, or IAF, is a public interest group based in central Iowa that focuses on secular governance, the importance of science, separation of church and state, and a transparent and responsive government.
Jason Benell, IAF’s president, said the organization “contends that it is in the interest of the public, regardless of their religious, economic, ethnic, or any other background, that our government be transparent and responsive to the needs of the governed… The governor’s office has repeatedly refused to respect the rights of Iowans by unjustly and flagrantly asserting executive privilege in order to avoid accountability in matters of public interest.”
Thomas Story, an ACLU of Iowa staff attorney, said the lawsuit is intended to challenge the governor’s claim of “an unprecedented ‘executive privilege’ to defy Iowa law. For more than half a century, the Iowa Open Records Act has ensured that the work of the state happens in the open. Now, the governor’s office has decided it alone gets to decide what the public sees. The Iowa Constitution does not give it this authority.”
Randy Evans, executive director of the Iowa Freedom of Information Council, said that as one of the plaintiffs in the 2023 lawsuit against Reynolds, the council is concerned that the refusal to turn over records concerning the planned Satanic Temple event at the Capitol was a “continuation of the governor’s desire to shield from public release documents that might cast her in a negative light.”
Evans said the “people of Iowa are entitled to evaluate their governor’s actions. That becomes difficult when the governor tries to hide behind what should be a very narrow interpretation of executive privilege.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A week after the House Committee on Judiciary struck down a proposal by the Rhode Island State Police to make it a misdemeanor for anyone under the age of 21 to gamble online, that very legislation is now headed to the chamber’s floor.
Without any debate, the committee on Tuesday reconsidered the bill to amend the state’s 2023 iGaming law and advanced it with a 10-5 vote. The legislation sponsored by Rep. Gregory Costantino, a Lincoln Democrat, would impose up to one year in prison and a $1,000 fine if anyone ages 18 to 20 bets or plays in the virtual casino. 
Bally’s Corp., which runs Rhode Island’s two casinos, manages the only iGaming app available in the state.
Fears that high-school aged kids would get hooked on iGaming led lawmakers to restrict access to anyone under 21 when state officials legalized online gaming in 2023.
Costantino’s proposal had been rejected by the committee 7-5 during its April 22 meeting amid concerns that it would criminalize an act 18-year olds are allowed to do in person or online when betting on sports. But under House rules, committee members can move to reconsider a vote as long as the bill is still in the legislative panel’s possession and the motion is made by someone who voted with the majority. 
In this case, the motion was made by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat who initially voted against the bill.
“Although it’s unusual for a bill to go up and down then come back, it’s not unheard of,” Knight told Rhode Island Current after the vote.
House committees reconsidered three bills in 2024, chamber spokesperson Larry Berman said in an email Tuesday. This year, five bills have been reconsidered among the 114 advanced to the House floor.
Berman said reconsiderations occur when new information emerges or if further clarification on a bill is needed. He added that at least two of the three committee members who missed the vote have indicated they would like the opportunity to participate.
Democrats David Bennet of Warwick and Matthew Dawson of East Providence voted in favor of Costantino’s bill. Rep. José Batista, a Providence Democrat, voted against the measure.
Asked why he made the motion and changed his vote, Knight said it was done to pass a piece of legislation “that would make everyone happy.” Also changing their votes were Reps. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat, and Rep. Marie Hopkins, a Warwick Republican.
“We’re looking for a way to get to a bill that wants to accomplish what it wants to policywise while addressing some of the objections,” Knight said. “All I can say is the bill is alive, it’s the subject of a lot of conversations and we’ll see what happens.”
Rep. Cherie Cruz, a Pawtucket Democrat, is certainly not happy that the bill is advancing to the floor without additional debate.
“I just wanted to ask a question,” she said in an interview. “And we usually can always ask a question on a bill.”

But the committee’s chairman, Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat who voted in favor of the bill, told Rhode Island Current that House rules prohibit testimony and debate on bills up for reconsideration.
Committee members can question witnesses who are there to provide clarification on the proposal. Craven indicated ahead of the meeting that a representative from the Rhode Island State Police may have wanted to have an additional chance to make the case for the legislation they are pushing.
A state trooper was present at Tuesday’s committee meeting, but did not speak.
Sgt. Ernest Adams, a detective for the State Police’s Gaming Enforcement Unit, testified at the bill’s initial hearing March 25 where he called the proposal “essential” for officers to enforce the mandated age of the iGaming law.
But Cruz told Rhode Island Current that gamers under 21 who are allowed to bet in person may not know they are breaking the law should they do it on their phones. 
“You could even be inside the casino and you’re violating the law,” Cruz said.
Joining Cruz against the proposal were Democrats Edith Ajello of Providence, Leonela Felix of Pawtucket and David Place, a Foster Republican. Cruz said the state should instead penalize minors with civil fines, much like it does for underage drinking and smoking. 
Knight disagreed.
“We’re not talking about cannabis, alcohol or tobacco,” he said. “We’re talking about gambling — it’s a different public policy question.”
An official floor vote has not been scheduled as of Tuesday evening.
Companion legislation is sponsored in the Senate by Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat. The Senate Committee on Gaming and Labor, which Ciccone chairs, held the bill for further study on March 26, as is standard procedure when legislation is first considered by a legislative panel.

Yet tensions linger in the State House’s upper chamber amid concerns over potential conflicts of interest with Lawson’s day job as head of the state teachers union and her surprising alliance with conservative Democratic Sen. Frank Ciccone.
Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, was elected as Senate majority leader during the party caucus, having teamed up with Lawson on a slate ticket confirmed last week. Both Lawson and Ciccone faced challenges from within their own party; Pearson, a Cumberland Democrat, also sought the president role, while Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat, was put up as an alternative to Ciccone for the majority leader role.
Nearly one-third of Democrats backed Pearson and an even higher share — 10 — threw their support behind DiMario during the party caucus Tuesday.
Addressing the chamber following the election, Lawson pledged to “work tirelessly” and with “utmost respect” for her fellow senators.
“Thank you, thank you, your trust in me means more than I can ever express,” Lawson said. “Serving as president of the Rhode Island Senate will truly be the honor of a lifetime.”
First elected in 2018, Lawson is a former high school history teacher. She has served as president of the National Education Association of Rhode Island since 2023 — the same year she became Senate majority whip following the death of former whip Maryellen Goodwin. Lawson ascended within the chamber again last year, when Ruggerio picked her as his second-in-command, replacing Pearson after a falling out between the two allies.

Conflicting interests 
Speaking to reporters after the votes, Lawson dismissed concerns about potential conflicts between her union job and the Senate leadership role. She noted she has sought advisory opinions from the state ethics panel previously regarding potential overlap, though none specific to her new role as Senate president.
As the chamber’s leader, Lawson now has outsized power to negotiate across the rotunda with the House and decide which bills advance to the Senate floor, setting the stage for conflicts on a host of education-related issues, said John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island.
Senate rank-and-file members can recuse themselves by not voting or leaving the dais or even the room when their jobs or personal relationships conflict with legislative business, Marion said in an interview Monday.
“The Senate president, the buck stops there,” Marion said. “It makes recusal an insufficient tool for dealing with potential conflicts of interest.”
Similarly, as president of the 12,000-member state teachers union, Lawson holds key decision-making power over its legislative agenda and policy priorities. Ruggerio, who worked as an administrator for a branch of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, stepped down from his union job when he was elected as Senate president in 2017. 
Sen. Ana Quezada, a Providence Democrat, questioned Lawson’s ability to fairly consider bills related to the state takeover of Providence Public Schools. Quezada backed Pearson for Senate president for this reason.

“My organization doesn’t represent Providence,” Lawson said, speaking to reporters after the vote. Providence teachers are represented instead by the Providence Teachers Union, a local of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals and the American Federation of Teachers.
Lawson pledged to continue her “due diligence” regarding potential conflicts of interest, which may include seeking a new advisory opinion from the Rhode Island Ethics Commission, though she did not commit either way.
With less than two months until the Rhode Island General Assembly concludes its 2025 session, Lawson’s immediate focus turns to the chamber’s legislative priorities. She stressed a variety of health care bills, including increasing reimbursement rates for primary care providers and a study panel considering a state medical school as two examples. She was noncommittal when asked about a state ban on assault-style weapons, despite being a co-sponsor on the Senate legislation.
“We’ll go through the process and see what happens,” she said.
Much like Ruggerio, who has long opposed state-level restrictions on guns, Ciccone said he would oppose the assault weapons ban as currently drafted. Ciccone is a licensed federal firearms dealer who sells guns out of the basement of his Silver Lake home; he also voted against the safe storage mandate signed into law in 2024.

‘Strong enough for two strong women’
Ciccone’s voting record on guns, along with reproductive rights and protections for the LGBTQ+ community, rankled progressive lawmakers and advocacy groups. Sen. Pamela Lauria, a Barrington Democrat, nominated DiMario as an alternative to Ciccone for majority leader during the party caucus Tuesday.
“We all deserve to vote for someone we believe in,” Lauria said, insisting the Senate was “strong enough for two strong women.”
DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat, lost the bid for second-in-command to Ciccone by 12 votes, with one abstention from Sen. Lammis Vargas, a Cranston Democrat. Most of DiMario’s supporters also backed Pearson for president, though some split their support between the competing sides.
Quezada backed Pearson for president but Ciccone for majority leader. In an interview, she cited Ciccone’s support for licenses for undocumented immigrants and labor protections as reasons why he secured her vote.
Sen. Jonathon Acosta, a Central Falls Democrat, also backed DiMario but abstained from choosing between Pearson and Lawson for president during the caucus. (He voted for Pearson during the floor vote, though). 
“I would much rather be spending time with my kids right now, grilling some food, smoking a joint and having a drink,” Acosta said. “On the days this job has felt like we’re doing something, it’s worth it. For the last year and a half, this job has felt like political theater.”

Drama descended upon the Senate early last year, after a private falling out between Ruggerio and Pearson became public. The conflict between the two occurred after Pearson visited Ruggerio at his home to discuss Ruggerio’s health and his ability to lead.
At the same time, Ruggerio confirmed his third diagnosis with cancer; his health struggles forced him to miss long stretches of the 2024 session and nearly all of the 2025 legislative session, as well as much of the door-to-door campaigning leading up to his reelection in November. 
Pearson unsuccessfully attempted to oust Ruggerio from the president seat during a caucus after the November election, airing tensions brewing for months between opposing factions of Senate Democrats. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Pearson said he felt vindicated in his prior insistence that Ruggerio’s illnesses had compromised his leadership, and in turn, the chamber’s function.

Vindicated
“My worst nightmare, what I was trying to prevent for this chamber, has played out exactly as I had a nightmare about it,” Pearson said.
He relayed a very different series of events than Ruggerio regarding the aftermath of their closed-door conversation last year. As Pearson tells it, when he went to the then-president with concerns about Ruggerio’s health, Ruggerio hugged him, and thanked him for his honesty. It was only after other senators got in Ruggerio’s ear, convincing him that Pearson’s concern was actually a power grab, that Ruggerio turned on Pearson, Pearson said.
Sen. Dawn Euer, a Newport Democrat, admitted during the floor session Tuesday that she believed the “rumors” spread about Pearson last year, but changed her mind after seeing Ruggerio’s health firsthand as former chair of the Senate Committee on Judiciary.
Euer alleged Pearson was “bullied” by other senators to advance their own interests.
“We need leadership that is going to tell the truth to members of this chamber, even when it’s hard,” Euer said.
While the battle between Pearson and Lawson for president was not a close vote, it could have been. Pearson alleged he had verbal support from nearly half of the chamber’s Senate Democrats even a day prior, including from Ciccone, who agreed to back Pearson as president if he was made majority leader.
Ciccone could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday night. 
In the frenzy of phone calls leading up to Tuesday’s leadership elections, one conversation never happened: between Pearson and Lawson. Pearson said his calls to Lawson went unanswered, noting that she has not responded to his calls or texts for a year.
Lawson walked away when asked by reporters about discussions with Pearson for a potential leadership slate.
The Senate will reconvene at 4 p.m. Wednesday; the only item on its agenda is a tribute to Ruggerio. 
A special election will be held later this year to fill the Senate District 4 seat spanning sections of Providence and North Providence held by Ruggerio since 1985; a date has not been determined.

Keith Stokes will take over the voluntary role of delivering lectures about Rhode Island’s past at special events and formal ceremonies, Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore announced Tuesday.
The state established the position in 2012. State law specifies that the historian laureate serves a five-year term. Stokes, a Newport resident, will serve through April 30, 2030.
Stokes will make his first appearance as historian laureate at the Rhode Island Independence Day event at the Rhode Island State House on Saturday, May 3. He said he was honored and humbled to be the state’s historian laureate.
“I am profoundly honored to be appointed as Rhode Island’s Historian Laureate,” Stokes wrote in a post on LinkedIn. “Historical interpretation has long served as a beacon of guidance, particularly during times of social, economic, and cultural transformation. My mission is to illuminate Rhode Island and America’s past in a way that inspires us all, nurturing a collective sense of identity and purpose.”
Stokes was chosen from a field of eight candidates who applied for the position after Patrick Conley, the first and only person to have been historian laureate, chose not to seek reappointment earlier this year. 
Other applicants included Steve Frias, a former Rhode Island Republican National Committeeman and member of the RI250 Commission; Allison Horrocks, a park ranger at the  Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park in Pawtucket who is also a podcast host and author; David Kohnen and associate professor at the. U.S. Naval War College in Newport; Scott Molloy, a former professor of labor and industrial relations at the University of Rhode Island; Michael Simpson, an adjunct professor at Johnson & Wales University who runs Hidden History Tours of Rhode Island as well as the On This Day in Rhode Island History account on X;  Maureen Taylor, a genealogist and nationally-renowened photo detective; and Catherine Zipf, executive director of the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society.
The Secretary of State’s announcement highlighted Stokes’ “passion for historical research” drawn from his African, Jewish, and Caribbean family roots. Stokes has appeared on C-SPAN, Fox’s Legends & Lies, and TED Talks. 
He serves as a consulting historian for the Rhode Island Black Heritage Society, was former state advisor for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. He also serves on the RI250 Commission.
Stokes was the lead researcher and author of the 2024 publication “A Matter of Truth,” which examined and documented the role of the state and city of Providence  in supporting a “separate and unequal” existence for people of color.
Stokes holds a master’s degree in social policy administration from the University of Chicago. Last May, he was named the as new associate director of the Rhode Island Department of Administration’s Division of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.
“Ensuring that Rhode Islanders learn about and continue to pass on our state’s history is one of my top priorities as Secretary of State,” Amore, a former history teacher, said in a statement. “I am confident that Keith’s rich background and breadth of experience in historical research, storytelling, and education will continue to be an incredible asset to our state in this role.”
From 2010 to 2012, Stokes served as the head of the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation – now Rhode Island Commerce Corporation. His tenure there occurred during the ill-fated 38 Studios deal that left the state on the hook for a $78 million loan guarantee after the company folded two years after relocating to the state. Stokes also served 15 years as executive director of the Newport County Chamber of Commerce. 
Stokes was named director of economic development for the city of Providence in October 2021 and served for over a year until Mayor Brett Smiley took office.

Data centers are driving near-term energy demand in the region, according to a new regional power forecast from the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. (Photo by Rian Dundon/Oregon Capital Chronicle)Demand for electricity in the Northwest could double by 2046, according to a new energy forecast from regional experts.
Over the next two decades, demand could increase by between 1.8% and 3.1% annually, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council heard Tuesday. The projected growth will come primarily from companies building more data centers in the region, more electric vehicles on roads, electrifying buildings, computer chip manufacturing and the production of “green hydrogen” created by running an electrical current through water to split the molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.
Council staff presented the 20-year forecast for electricity demand in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and western Montana Tuesday to the council’s eight, governor-appointed members. Each state’s governor gets to appoint two representatives.
“The data centers, naturally in our forecasts, are the very early load growth driver here. They’re the big driver of near term demand,” Steven Simmons, senior energy forecasting analyst, told the council. Energy demand from data centers and from all electric vehicles in the region are expected to be equal by 2046, and demand from EVs is likely to surpass data center demand after 2046, Simmons said.
Residential and commercial demand, which includes forecasted energy demand for electric vehicle charging at homes and buildings, but does not include data centers, is expected to grow more gradually. Demand for residential and commercial energy in Washington alone will equal the combined demand from those sectors in Oregon, Idaho and Montana during the next two decades.
The energy forecast, part of the council’s forthcoming 9th Northwest Regional Power Plan to manage demand, does not yet include some possible variables that could reduce future demand, such as improved energy efficiency in cars, buildings and some industries as a response to demand, as well as growing adoption of rooftop solar on residential and commercial buildings.
But rapidly growing demand now means electricity grids in the Northwest and across the U.S. are encountering transmission constraints, and scaling infrastructure to meet demand has been slow due to supply chain delays and issues, staff said.
 Data centers 

Council staff expect the biggest growth in data center and computer chip energy demand will occur in eastern Oregon, eastern Washington, and the Portland and Boise metro areas, based on historical trends and announced projects.
There are more than 100 data centers in Oregon, according to the company Data Center Map, and there are more than 5,000 data centers throughout the U.S. according to Statista — the most in any country.
Oregon’s data center market is the fifth largest in the nation, according to Chicago-based commercial real estate group Cushman & Wakefield. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and X, formerly named Twitter, have massive data centers in eastern Oregon as well as in The Dalles, Hillsboro and Prineville.
 What’s next

To develop its next power plan, the council will evaluate supply side resources, including the potential for more regional windfarms, utility-scale and small-scale solar installations, better battery storage and more geothermal and fracked gas sources, among other options.
The council has published regional power plans about every five years since 1983, to lay out how the region will maintain an affordable and adequate power supply. A draft of the plan, an update from the last one that was published in 2021, is expected to be ready for public review and input by July 2026 and would be finalized by late 2026, according to council spokesperson Peter Jensen.
The Northwest Power and Conservation Council was formed in 1981 following passage of the federal Northwest Power Act. That act directed the four states to work collaboratively on regional energy planning and to stop the decline of native Columbia Basin fish species that have suffered massive population losses over the last century, primarily from the development of hydroelectric dams in the region.
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek in February appointed two new Oregon representatives to the council: Margaret Hoffmann, of Bend, and Chuck Sams, of Pendleton. Hoffman is the former Oregon director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development program and energy adviser to former Oregon Govs. John Kitzhaber and Kate Brown.
Sams, former executive director of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, was most recently director of the National Park Service. Sams briefly served on the council in 2021 before he was appointed to run the Park Service.

CHATHAM — The driver of a vehicle involved in a deadly crash Monday at an after-school program formerly worked for the Illinois State Police, the agency investigating the crash.

The ISP identified the driver as Marianne Akers, 44, of Chatham. She worked at the ISP from June 2006 to August 2018, an ISP spokesman confirmed Tuesday.

The crash occurred at 3:20 p.m. Monday when Akers’ black Jeep left the road and traveled through a field, hitting the east side of a building that housed the YNOT, which stands for Youth Needing Other Things, an after-school camp in Chatham. The car drove through the building, striking several children and workers, before it exited the other side.

Those killed were Ainsley Johnson, 8; Kathryn Corley, 7; Alma Buhnerkempe, 7, all of Chatham, and Rylee Britton, 18, of Springfield, a counselor. All the victims died of blunt force trauma, according to Sangamon County Coroner Jim Allmon.

Six other children were hospitalized, one in critical condition.

The building that houses the after-school program has a gym on the bottom floor and play areas upstairs. Children often sat on the wall during playtime at the gym.

After crashing through the building, the SUV traveled across a basketball court then hit a light pole and a fence around a small park near the Chatham water tower.

Akers was the only one in the vehicle and was not injured, according to police. She was taken to a local hospital for evaluation.

The cause of the crash remains under investigation; toxicology reports are pending. Police said Monday it was not a targeted attack.

Akers is a current employee of the Illinois Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Business Services, according to an IDOT spokesman. She has been employed by the agency since November 2023.

She also is a former cafeteria employee of Glenwood High School in Chatham.

Sangamon County State’s Attorney John Milhiser said Tuesday that police have made no arrests.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the families impacted by this terrible tragedy,” Milhiser said.

Chatham, a close-knit community of 15,000 people, is about 2.8 miles from the state capital of Springfield. Chatham schools are closed for the rest of the week.

Gov. JB Pritzker commented on the tragedy late Monday.

“I am horrified and deeply saddened by the deaths of children and numerous injuries in Chatham this afternoon,” Pritzker said in a statement. “My heart is heavy for these families and the unimaginable grief they’re experiencing — something that no parent should ever have to endure.”

Studio M Dance Centre in Chatham where Ainsley Johnson danced posted a tribute on social media Tuesday.

“Ainsley was such a sweet and sassy dancer/tumbler at our Studio and Complex — bringing joy, passion, and lots of laughter to her peers in class and her dance teachers. Her spirit will always be a part of our dance family, and she will be deeply missed every single day,” the message said.

Britton was preparing to attend the University of Iowa to study English and secondary education. One of her fellow Glenwood High School students stated that she “was always kind to everyone.”

Community members shared several Facebook posts Monday urging residents to donate blood. By Tuesday morning, all of the time slots were booked until Friday. By Tuesday afternoon, Glenwood High School Student Council had raised over $100,000 for the victims’ families through a GoFundMe page.

Chatham Village President Dave Kimsey ordered all flags in Chatham to be flown at half-staff for the next week. A candlelight vigil was to be held Tuesday night at Village Square Park, and another will be held Wednesday night at Glenwood High School.

In a Facebook post Tuesday, SIU Medicine announced that counseling and trauma support for Chatham residents will be available at Chatham Presbyterian Church on Wednesday and Thursday.

(Maryland GovPics, CC BY 2.0 , via Wikimedia Commons)Union leaders are meeting in Hershey this week for the Pennsylvania Conference of Teamsters annual convention.
Some of Pennsylvania’s most powerful politicians, like Gov. Josh Shapiro, state House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) and U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District) have already appeared to voice their support.
Teamsters leaders at the gathering discussed their goals for the year, and broadly outlined strategies in areas from workplace organizing to making political endorsements.
But many who spoke had a particular target in their sights: Amazon.
The union has been at odds with the company for years over working conditions imposed on their drivers and warehouse staff. And they’ve fought Amazon’s decision to classify some workers as independent contractors, which lets the company off the hook for providing certain benefits, like health and insurance, and guarantees, like minimum wage.
The feud reached a boiling point during the last holiday season, when Teamsters struck at Amazon warehouse location across the country over the company’s refusal to bargain with the group. Teamsters also organized picket lines at several non-union locations in Pennsylvania.
But speakers at the Hershey conference said that action was just the opening salvo.
“This is the beginning of a war with Amazon,” said William Hamilton, president of the Pennsylvania Conference of Teamsters, which represents around 95,000 workers in warehouse, transport and other industries. “Amazon started the war on workers because they’ve continually attacked workers across this country and mistreated them. They created this environment of unsafe conditions, of low pay, of doing things to people that people on the outside would never even consider to be something an employer should be doing.
Amazon has come under scrutiny in the past for the low wages it pays its workers, as well as policies critics say have led to unsafe conditions. In particular, it’s been reported that Amazon aggressively tracks worker productivity, leading some drivers and warehouse staff to skip bathroom and food breaks.
Across the country, Teamsters have been leading an aggressive drive to organize the company’s workers, as well as raising awareness among lawmakers, regulators and media about poor working conditions.
Teamsters have also been fighting the company in court too. Last week, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled that Amazon had to come to the bargaining table with a local Teamsters chapter representing distribution center workers for the company in San Francisco.
That follows another victory last year when the NLRB sided with Teamsters, who were calling for  Amazon delivery drivers in Palmdale, California, to be classified as “joint employees” instead of independent contractors.

Despite the legal victories, Randy Korgan, the national director of the Teamsters’ Amazon division, said he believes the battle must be waged on the ground by workers, instead of focusing on courts and state capitols.
“It’s been multiple decades since that system has truly done what it’s supposed to do, which is protect workers in an expeditious way,” Korgan told attendees at the Pennsylvania conference. “What we’re doing is we’re building committees. We’re educating workers and we’re getting them to understand that you’re not going to get your employer to recognize anything until you shut it down.”
Korgan noted that the union organized nearly 10,000 Amazon workers in 2024 alone. He said that wasn’t done in a “traditional setting.” Instead he and others encouraged workers to stage walkouts and “take direct action.”
Liana Dalton, an organizer for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters’ Amazon division said that work needs to be continued in Pennsylvania, where she hopes to see more Amazon facilities and workers unionize, and build capacity for a potential strike. 
And she’s hopeful. She said she’s heard from many who were inspired by the strike last winter, some of whom went to New York to join a picket line. 
“We’ve gotta build this and we’ve gotta scale it, so that we shut down the entire market in these key regions,” Dalton said. 
Amazon also came up repeatedly in discussions of the union’s political goals.
Thomas Doyle, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters’ state program director, said the union is also pushing bills in state legislatures around the country in the hopes of passing laws to improve conditions for Amazon warehouse workers.

Doyle noted that warehouse workers at Amazon are injured at higher rates than many companies in the sector. And he cited the company’s policies when discussing a bill the union is pushing around the country
It would require warehouses to disclose productivity quotas to their workforce, a practice Doyle said that Amazon has not done in some circumstances, leading to workers rushing and increasing the potential for injury.
“In [typical] warehouses, we understand there are productivity quotas, but our workers are made aware of what they’re being measured against,” Doyle said. “This bill would mandate that a company has to make their workers aware of what they’re being measured against. So by eliminating that invisible clock, workers will be able to pace themself in a safer manner.”
Doyle said that bills accomplishing this have already passed in five states, California, New York, Minnesota, Washington and Oregon. And he’s hoping for progress in Pennsylvania as well.
Doyle also said the Teamsters advocacy arm will be pushing for other measures. Those would require human supervision in commercially used autonomous vehicles; require companies provide certain protections for workers exposed to extreme temperatures; and ban mandatory “captive audience meetings” discussing either religion or politics, which would be defined to include discussions of unionization. Such meetings are sometimes used by employers to disparage unionization efforts during work hours. 
Sam Gardner-Bird, the national political coordinator for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, also spoke to address the union’s donation strategy for its Political Action Committee.
He said that this year, the group would not automatically give a maximum-allowable donation — typically $5,000 — to candidates that have historically been allies of the Teamsters early in the election cycle. Instead, regardless of their history, a PAC donation will depend on how they vote and act.
“What we’ve seen a lot of times, with some of these long relationships. is that they get complacent,” Gardner-Bird said. “Sometimes, we need to remind them that we’re watching everything they do. And if they’re assuming that they’re gonna get the drive contribution, they’re never gonna change.”
The move is partly an effort to exert greater influence, and partly a practical matter.
“Every single drive dollar we have is a sacrifice made by a member,” Gardner-Bird said. “It’s taken off their paycheck and they choose to do that. So, we have to be good stewards of this money.”
Specifically, he said the change is, in part, a reaction to some longtime recipients of Teamsters PAC funding refusing to sign a letter backing UPS and Amazon workers’ right to strike.
“They should know better,” Gardner-Bird said. “Every letter they don’t sign, every initiative they don’t support, we’re watching that.”
Behind the speakers’ podium was a sign that urged a ‘yes’ vote on retention for Pennsylvania’s three liberal Supreme Court justices, who will be on the ballot in November.
Discussing the importance of Judicial races, Gardner-Bird pointed to the recent victory of a Teamsters-backed candidate for the state Supreme Court in Wisconsin, Susan Crawford
“These courts are important,” he said. “That court ruled that Amazon flex drivers are full time employees and not independent contractors. So we gotta take these races seriously across the board.”

Union leaders met in Hershey this week for the Pennsylvania Conference of Teamsters annual convention. 
Some of Pennsylvania’s most powerful politicians, like Gov. Josh Shapiro, state House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) and U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District) made appearances to support the trade union, which is one of the largest in the world and claims 1.3 million members in a wide variety of occupations.
Teamsters leaders at the gathering discussed their goals for the year, and broadly outlined strategies in areas from workplace organizing to making political endorsements.
But many who spoke had a particular target in their sights: Amazon.
The union has been at odds with the company for years over working conditions for Amazon drivers and warehouse staff. And they’ve fought Amazon’s decision to classify some workers, including drivers, as independent contractors. That classification lets the company off the hook for providing certain benefits, like health insurance, and guarantees, like minimum wage, the union argues.
Though Amazon says their “delivery service partners,” which the company describes as small and medium-sized businesses that they contract to run their delivery routes, “provide health care coverage that meets or exceeds federal standards for affordability and minimum value.”
For years, Teamsters have pushed to organize the company’s workforce. The union says it has organized 10,000 warehouse workers and drivers. That includes employees at a distribution center in New York that Teamsters say has over 5,000 employees and voted to join them in 2024. Amazon, however says they don’t recognize any unions at their facilities and that the Teamsters have never brought an election. Moreover, they say drivers, unionized or not, aren’t their employees.
The feud between the company and union reached a boiling point during the last holiday season, when Teamsters urged Amazon employees at numerous facilities to strike and formed picket lines at other facilities, including in Pennsylvania. The union said the picket was over the company’s refusal to bargain with the group.
Speakers at the Hershey conference said that action was just the opening salvo.
“This is the beginning of a war with Amazon,” said William Hamilton, president of the Pennsylvania Conference of Teamsters, which represents around 95,000 workers in warehouse, transport and other industries. “Amazon started the war on workers because they’ve continually attacked workers across this country and mistreated them. They created this environment of unsafe conditions, of low pay, of doing things to people that people on the outside would never even consider to be something an employer should be doing.”
Amazon has come under the scrutiny of lawmakers, regulators and advocacy groups in the past over allegations of creating unsafe and unsanitary work conditions. For example, The Guardian, The Intercept and other outlets have reported that Amazon’s aggressive tracking of worker productivity lead some drivers and warehouse staff to skip bathroom and food breaks.
Eileen Hards, a spokesperson for Amazon, said in an email that “Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting: safe and inclusive workplaces, competitive pay, health benefits on day one and opportunities for career growth.”
The company also said that employees are encouraged to take breaks when needed, and that their delivery app provides suggestions for places drivers can stop and use a restroom.
Hards added that Amazon workers can choose to join unions if they want, but that Teamsters’ efforts to unionize employees have been coercive.
“The truth is that the Teamsters have actively threatened, intimidated and attempted to coerce Amazon employees and third-party drivers to join them, which is illegal and is the subject of multiple pending unfair labor practice charges against the union,” Hards said.
Teamsters, on the other hand, say Amazon has fought their workers’ efforts to organize and join them.
And Teamsters have also been fighting the company through courts and regulators. Last week, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued a complaint saying that Amazon failed to come to the bargaining table with employees of a distribution center in San Francisco after more than 100 voted to join a Teamsters-affiliated union.
That follows another victory last year when NLRB prosecutors sided with Teamsters, who were calling for Amazon delivery drivers in Palmdale, California, to be classified as “joint employees” instead of independent contractors. The ruling is not final, and Amazon says it will be reviewed by an administrative law judge.
Still, Randy Korgan, the national director of the Teamsters’ Amazon division, said the battle must be waged on the ground by workers, instead of focusing on courts and state capitols.
“It’s been multiple decades since that system has truly done what it’s supposed to do, which is protect workers in an expeditious way,” Korgan told attendees at the Pennsylvania conference. “What we’re doing is we’re building committees. We’re educating workers and we’re getting them to understand that you’re not going to get your employer to recognize anything until you shut it down.”
Korgan claimed that the union organized nearly 10,000 Amazon workers in 2024 alone. He said that wasn’t done in a “traditional setting.” Instead he and others encouraged workers to stage walkouts and “take direct action.” That number includes drivers, who Amazon says are independent contractors. 
It’s a small fraction of the roughly 750,000 warehouse workers and 210,000 drivers an Amazon spokesperson estimated the company employs or contracts in the U.S.. But the company says it isn’t true.
“For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public – claiming that they represent ‘thousands of Amazon employees and drivers,’” Hards said. “They don’t, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative.”
Liana Dalton, an organizer for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters’ Amazon division said that organizing needs to be continued in Pennsylvania, where she hopes to see more Amazon facilities and drivers unionize, and build capacity for a potential strike. She said she’s heard from many who were inspired by the strike last winter, some of whom went to New York to join a picket line. 
“We’ve gotta build this and we’ve gotta scale it, so that we shut down the entire market in these key regions,” Dalton said. 
Amazon also came up repeatedly in discussions of the union’s political goals.
Thomas Doyle, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters’ state program director, said the union is also pushing bills in state legislatures around the country in the hopes of passing laws to improve conditions for Amazon warehouse workers.

Doyle said warehouse workers at Amazon are injured at higher rates than many companies in the sector. A bill the union is pushing around the country would require warehouses to disclose productivity quotas to their workforce. Doyle said that Amazon has not disclosed those in some circumstances, leading to workers rushing and increasing the potential for injury.
“In [typical] warehouses, we understand there are productivity quotas, but our workers are made aware of what they’re being measured against,” Doyle said. “This bill would mandate that a company has to make their workers aware of what they’re being measured against. So by eliminating that invisible clock, workers will be able to pace themself in a safer manner.”
Doyle said that bills requiring disclosure of productivity quotas  have already passed in five states: California, New York, Minnesota, Washington and Oregon. And he’s hoping  Pennsylvania will follow suit. 
Hards, the Amazon spokesperson, said in an email the data pointing to Amazon warehouses being more unsafe than others is misleading.
“Since 2019 our recordable incident and lost time rates have improved by 31% and 76.5% respectively in the United States and 34% and 65% globally,” she wrote. “But, we’re not satisfied and we won’t be until we’re best in class.”
The company also said that it does not implement productivity quotas for warehouse workers.
Doyle also said the Teamsters advocacy arm will be lobbying  for other legislation. Those would require human supervision in commercially used autonomous vehicles; require companies provide certain protections for workers exposed to extreme temperatures; and ban mandatory “captive audience meetings” discussing either religion or politics, which would be defined to include discussions of unionization. Such meetings are sometimes used by employers to disparage unionization efforts during work hours.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Amazon_warehouse_in_Maryland-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-30 20:04:12.706267

How large it ought to be or where are open questions, but a work group appointed to “reset” discussions on a new men’s prison agreed on that much Tuesday during the second of its four planned meetings.
State Attorney General Marty Jackley sat silent through more than four hours of testimony and public comment before asking his fellow members of “Project Prison Reset” to support a replacement for the penitentiary, the 144-year-old quartzite monolith in Sioux Falls known as “The Hill.”

By then, group members had reviewed a dozen potential sites for a new prison, submitted by landowners through a request for information. They’d also sat through presentations on mental health and occupational programming at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield, heard from city residents on the medium security facility’s value to the Bon Homme County city of 1,900, and had reassured those residents that it would remain a part of the Department of Corrections’ long-term facility plans regardless of what happens with the penitentiary.
With The Hill, Jackley said, the path forward is clear. It’s overcrowded, outdated and unsafe, he said, citing the case of a correctional officer killed by two inmates in 2011 as evidence of the dangers presented by the status quo.
“We can’t do nothing,” Jackley said. “We have to do something.”
Group agrees: New prison is necessary
The unanimous vote in favor of Jackley’s motion answers the first of three questions posed in the executive order from Gov. Larry Rhoden that created the group. At a special session in July, the group is meant to deliver recommendations on how large a prison is needed and where to put it, using the results of a consultant’s report on the state’s existing facilities as a guide.
Rhoden backed a plan to build an $825 million, 1,500-bed men’s facility on a controversial Lincoln County site during this year’s legislative session. The governor has called the penitentiary “gothic,” and said the site south of Sioux Falls that inspired an ongoing legal battle from neighbors was a “gift from God,” but was unable to sway lawmakers skeptical about the size, site and price tag.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen was appointed to lead Project Prison Reset after the legislative rebuffing. On Tuesday before the vote, Venhuizen said he agrees with Jackley on the need, but pointed out that the group’s schedule envisioned a review of the consultant’s report before answering any of the questions posed to it.
But “if you feel that we already know enough to answer the first question,” he said, “I think that is also very defensible.”
Just one work group member suggested otherwise.

Dell Rapids Republican Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, who announced a 2026 run for governor last week, tried unsuccessfully to convince the group to hold off on supporting a replacement. 
Hansen and his announced running mate, Canton Republican Rep. Karla Lems, were vocal opponents of the 1,500-bed plan that failed during the legislative session. Hansen pointed to a presentation on Springfield’s Governor’s House program from earlier in the afternoon. Inmates who build those affordable housing units are less likely to return to prison, the group learned. 
Why not explore options for reducing repeat offenses through programming before committing to new facilities, he asked?
“From everything that I’ve studied, we’re an outlier, and it’s really high,” Hansen said. “Before we go jumping into whether we need a new prison, I really think we should pause. Maybe it’s part of that report – I would presume it is – what are other states doing?”
But Rep. Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, said the needs are immediate. Even if the state were to keep The Hill, he said, “we’ve got 365 more people than we’re supposed to” in the building.
“Even if you disagree with a few of these members on the panel and say ‘I still think The Hill’s still viable,’ etcetera, we’ve still got to find room for 365 more people,” Karr said.
The penitentiary has some supporters. A former inmate who testified Tuesday said he spent time there and at the Federal Correctional Institution of Leavenworth in Kansas, a prison of similar vintage.
“The Hill is functional,” said Paul Cooper, who’s employed as a cook in Sioux Falls. “It’s clean, productive. I completely disagree with the fact that it needs to be rebuilt.”
Doug Weber, a former penitentiary warden who lobbied lawmakers to vote down the 1,500-bed proposal, told South Dakota Searchlight that The Hill is functional if maintained. Darin Young, the now-former warden who took the job upon Weber’s retirement, called the building “beautiful” in a recent interview with The Scouting Report podcast.
Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead offered a different take on Tuesday.
“I don’t need a consultant to tell me that place is a pit,” Milstead said. “I would not want my son or daughter working there.”
Hansen and Lems ultimately joined every other member of the task force in supporting Jackley’s motion.
Possible locations
Milstead spoke up in favor of consultation with neighbors during the earlier discussions on possible sites.
The state got 12 pitches from landowners for possible sites through its request for information. Four were outside of Sioux Falls, in Huron, Grant County (northeast of Watertown), Aberdeen and Mitchell.

Another eight were in the Sioux Falls area, including near the Lincoln County cities of Canton and Worthing and in the Sioux Falls development park that’s home to the city’s Amazon distribution center. The former Citibank campus just north of the current penitentiary was also offered up as an option, and multiple work group members toured that site recently.
Ryan Brunner, a policy adviser for Rhoden, presented the proposals on a spreadsheet and noted that some arrived as recently as Monday evening. The goal, he said, is to fill in the spreadsheet with details on each site’s cost, serviceability for utilities and other factors in the coming weeks.
“Is there some way you can put in there what the neighbors think?” Milstead said. “Some of these are in places where homes are going in nearby.”
Brunner said that will be a consideration for any site, as would issues like proximity to 100-year floodplains or interstates and workforce availability. The consultant hired to study the state’s needs can fully study three sites once the group narrows its options.
As far as public comments, Venhuizen said he doubts neighbors will be silent. Opposition from those who live near the initially proposed Lincoln County site – which is still on the table as an option for the work group – spoke up quickly.
“We put this list out yesterday,” Venhuizen said. “I’m sure we’ll know what the neighbors think in pretty short order.”

April 23, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen enacted a new burn ban Tuesday for central and western Nebraska through May 10 in response to continued “very dry” conditions.
The new executive order rescinds a previous mandate last week prohibiting permitted burns statewide through the end of the month. With the new order, burns are allowed in eastern Nebraska unless there is an active red flag warning issued by the National Weather Service for a specific area.
The initial burn ban came after a prescribed fire April 21 got out of control in the Plum Creek area near Johnstown in Brown County.

As of Tuesday afternoon, more than a week after the fire started, containment was up to 95%, according to the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency. Johnstown Fire as well as Nebraska Game and Parks were on scene for a couple of hot spots on the northern perimeter as needed.
The new burn ban runs south along U.S. Highway 81 from the South Dakota border to Highway 92. It then goes west to U.S. Highway 281 and runs south to the Kansas border.

(Google Maps)A trio of federal appellate judges on Tuesday left in place a lower court’s ruling temporarily blocking the removal of detainees held in Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act.
The two-page order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit denied an emergency motion for a stay filed by President Donald Trump’s administration last week. Trump has invoked the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act for just the fourth time in U.S. history in an attempt to expedite the removals of hundreds of people the administration claims are part of an “invasion” of the United States by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.
Citing the authority granted to it by the 1798 law, the administration sent 137 detainees to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador before multiple federal courts, including one in Colorado, ordered a halt to such removals over due process concerns. U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney’s temporary restraining order against the removal of any detainees from Colorado under the AEA is set to remain in effect until at least May 6.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Trump’s Department of Justice appealed Sweeney’s ruling to the 10th Circuit last week, asking the court to suspend the TRO pending appeal and arguing that it causes “irreparable harm” by “interfer(ing) with the President’s core authority to protect the nation.”
A panel of three appellate judges — Judges Harris L. Hartz, Gregory Alan Phillips and Joel M. Carson — bluntly dismissed that argument in Tuesday’s order denying the DOJ’s motion.
“Given the important unresolved issues under the Alien Enemies Act and the ruling of the United States Supreme Court that no one in that proceeding be removed under the AEA until further order of that Court … there is no realistic possibility that the government could remove any member of the class from this country before final expiration of the TRO on May 6, 2025,” the judges wrote. “Accordingly, the emergency motion for a stay is denied.”
The case, D.B.U. v. Trump, originated earlier this month as a petition for habeas corpus and proposed class action by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of two Venezuelan nationals held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora. The plaintiffs, who are identified by their initials, D.B.U. and R.M.M., say they have been falsely identified as Tren de Aragua members by the Trump administration and fear imminent deportation to the CECOT facility, criticized by human rights groups for its crowded and abusive conditions.
About 90% of the deportees sent to CECOT last month had no criminal record, according to Bloomberg. At least one, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members for other deportees say that they were falsely identified as TdA members because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team. Trump has openly floated plans to send American citizens to CECOT next.
Sweeney’s order required the Trump administration to provide at least 21 days’ notice, written in a language the individual understands, to any detainee designated for removal under the AEA. It also provisionally certified the class that the two plaintiffs seek to represent, blocking the removal of “all noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to” Trump’s March 14 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act. ACLU attorneys estimate that could apply to more than 100 detainees held at the Aurora detention center.
In U.S. District Court proceedings in the case, the DOJ argued in a Monday filing that Sweeney should decline to certify the case as a class action, claiming again that D.B.U. and R.M.M. are not targeted for AEA removals and haven’t shown they “are members of the class they seek to represent.”
But the ACLU has filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would extend and clarify the terms of Sweeney’s TRO for the plaintiffs and all members of the proposed class.
“Without an injunction, the government will be free to send hundreds more individuals, including Petitioners and class members, to the notorious Salvadoran prison where they may be held incommunicado for the rest of their lives,” ACLU attorneys wrote in an April 25 filing. “The harm is only magnified by the government’s position that mistakes cannot be remedied, and once an individual is in a foreign prison, they are stuck there.”

SPRINGFIELD – Advocates for after-school programs that provide tutoring, recreation and other services made their case again Tuesday for a $50 million state appropriation to restore programs in some schools where funding has run out and to expand them into more schools.

SPRINGFIELD – Advocates for after-school programs that provide tutoring, recreation and other services made their case again Tuesday for a $50 million state appropriation to restore programs in some schools where funding has run out and to expand them into more schools.

“There are decades of research that supports that after-school programs improve school day performance, grades and attendance, helps reduce violence, and also supports working class families,” Rep. Aaron Ortiz, D-Chicago, told a House budget committee Tuesday.

Ortiz is the lead sponsor of House Bill 3082, which calls for $50 million to be distributed by the Illinois State Board of Education through a competitive grant program to entities that seek to provide tutoring and other enrichment services in high-poverty schools, where 40% or more of the students come from low-income households.

That’s the same amount of money advocates asked for, and lawmakers provided, in the current fiscal year’s budget. But 10 months into the fiscal year, those advocates say that money still has not been distributed.

“What we've been hearing is that the governor's office has been waiting for legislative intent,” Susan Stanton, executive director of the advocacy group ACT Now, told the committee. “We've kind of heard things back and forth from both the governor's office and ISBE and legislators. And we've yet to get a clear answer on why the money wasn't released.”

The after-school programs have traditionally received federal funding through the Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program, which distributes money for programs in high-poverty areas throughout the country.

Stanton, whose organization represents more than 2,000 after-school programs, said that Illinois typically receives about $56 million a year through that program. But in 2023, she said, ISBE over-allocated the funds it had available. As a result, it was unable to renew some of the grants that were expiring or open a new competitive grant cycle that year, resulting in a large number of after-school programs losing their funding and going out of business.

“The large-scale rolling-off of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers grants has led to 27,000 students losing programs and 2,000 staff members losing their jobs,” Stanton said. “Funding appropriated by this committee and the General Assembly would provide a lifeline to these students and bring back stability to the communities that need it most in Illinois.”

She said even with full federal funding, there is more need for after-school programs in Illinois than those funds would cover, and the additional state funds would make after-school programming more accessible throughout the state.

Stanton said during an interview after Tuesday’s committee hearing that she remains hopeful the $50 million included in the current budget will eventually be distributed. In the meantime, she said, her organization is pushing for funding in next year’s budget.

The governor’s office has said previously that the money was included in this year’s appropriations bill without any clear instructions about how to distribute it and that the administration has been consulting with legislative leaders about what their specific intent was for the money.

“We understand the urgency surrounding after-school programming and remain committed to ensuring that these resources are allocated in a way that best serves students and families across Illinois,” Pritzker’s press secretary Alex Gough said in an email statement Tuesday. “Per the last budget agreement, we are awaiting direction from the General Assembly as to where this funding will be distributed.”

Tuesday’s hearing was a “subject matter” discussion only, meaning the committee took no formal action on the bill. A final decision about whether the state will again allocate money for after-school programs will be made when lawmakers pass the final omnibus appropriations bill at the end of May.

Shelley Moore Capito. (Getty Images)At least some workers at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health are getting back to work this week after federal cuts in early April took them off the job, according to a statement released Tuesday by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.
Those returning to work include some employees from the Coal Worker Health Surveillance Program and the Fire Fighters’ Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program. The total number of individuals who were granted reemployment has not been released. 
And those who are returning to work will, at this time, only be doing so temporarily. 
A Reduction In Force for the “vital” federal agency is still slated to go into effect in June and will impact these workers, according to a statement from the local chapter of the American Federation of Governmental Employees, a labor union representing the employees. 
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of AFGE Local 3430 in Morgantown, said in a news release that the union is “encouraged” by the decision to call crucial workers back to work.
“This action, though temporary, allows these dedicated professionals to return to their critical roles in advancing worker safety and health across the country,” Tinney-Zara said. “Their return means renewed momentum for life-saving research, outreach and interventions that protect workers in high-risk industries and help prevent illness, injury, and death on the job.”
Notably, Tinney-Zara continued, it seems only workers in the CWHSP and the FFFIPP — programs that are “currently in the media spotlight” — were included in the calls to return to work. That leaves numerous other programs and initiatives undertaken by NIOSH still inoperable after cuts from the new federal Department of Government Efficiency hit the agency in early April.
“These are undoubtedly vital initiatives, but they are only a portion of the comprehensive, nationwide worker protection mission NIOSH fulfills,” Tinney-Zara said. “From construction sites to health care facilities, from transportation hubs to agricultural fields, NIOSH’s work touches nearly every corner of the American labor force.”
The directive offering some people their jobs back came after Capito, earlier this month, wrote a letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging him to reconsider the cuts that cost at least 200 people their jobs — and, in turn, ended the programs they worked for — in the Morgantown NIOSH facility.
On Tuesday, Capito said in a statement that she was “encouraged that some NIOSH functions for coal miner and firefighter safety are slated to resume with some select staff returning to work this week.”
“But my understanding is that this is temporary so my focus will continue to be on working with [the federal Department of Health and Human Services] on permanently restoring these functions and personnel in the most efficient and effective manner,” Capito continued.
In her letter to Kennedy on April 21, Capito emphasized how critical Morgantown’s NIOSH facility and the workers within it were to combatting deadly black lung disease and protecting miners who are now being pushed, through initiatives by the Trump Administration, to mine more coal than any time in recent memory.
“The NIOSH Mining Program works to eliminate mining fatalities and injuries. Research in rock dust has resulted in safety changes to prevent explosions in underground mines …” Capito wrote. “NIOSH’s [CWHSP] studies respiratory disease and provides black lung screenings to coal miners. It is my understanding that the RIF impacted every employee in these important programs.” 
With work by the CWHSP halted since April 1, coal miners in central Appalachia have been without access to critical health services and surveillance, including free screenings for black lung and a program that allows them, once diagnosed with black lung, to request relocating to a different, less dusty portion of a mine in order to mitigate the worst developments of the deadly disease. 
Anyone requesting to relocate in a mine — a labor right afforded to miners through the Part 90 program — must have their black lung testing results evaluated and marked eligible by a NIOSH worker in order to be approved. 
But with DOGE’s cuts, those workers didn’t exist anymore.
The reduction in services for coal miners comes as a surge of black lung disease is hitting the workforce. It also hits as implementation of a federal rule that would limit miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust for the first time ever has been delayed.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners in central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
And the resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before. This is due to miners, because of a lack of easily accessible coal, being forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone than their predecessors in order to reach what little coal remains.
When the silica dust rule was slated to go into effect this month, the former secretary for the federal Department of Labor estimated that it could potentially save thousands of lives. 
Now, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the federal Mine Health and Safety Administration — the agency that would be in charge of enacting and enforcing the silica rule — is being temporarily headed by an attorney who worked with industry groups that lobbied against implementation of exposure limits for silica, which advocates and coal mining veterans have colored as being life saving if ever implemented.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.
Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) WARREN COUNTY — Tom Vilsack, former Iowa governor and the U.S. secretary of agriculture during the Obama and Biden administrations, spoke Tuesday with farmers and rural Iowans about his ideas to grow rural communities. 
In the pine-paneled Middleswart Lodge, looking out over Lake Ahquabi State Park, Vilsack explained policies he started, and hoped would continue, that make a farm — rather than a farmer — work harder.  
This means programs like the Climate Smart commodities program, which pays farmers a premium for using sustainable agriculture tools, or practices that make use of other farm products, like an anaerobic digester that turns animal waste into renewable energy and a check for the farmer
“You could combine the marketplace and the private sector and government to do right by the environment and to do right by the small and mid-sized (farms),” Vilsack said. “The farm would work harder, not the farmer.” 
Don and Mary Mitchell, Warren County farmers who attended the program, said they had “never thought” of some of the ideas Vilsack mentioned.
As farmers in their later years, the Mitchells said they wouldn’t implement those strategies today, but would have benefited from such options earlier in their lives. 
“We might have saved a lot of miles driving back and forth from our place to Des Moines,” Mary Mitchell said with a laugh. 
Don Mitchell was a farmer that had to “work harder” to keep his family afloat when the small family farm wasn’t enough. For him, that meant commuting to Des Moines for an off-farm job for many years. 
U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics show that the majority of farmers in the U.S. have off-farm income and small farms depend on non-farming income to survive.
Vilsack said he realized after his first stint as agriculture secretary that the system was set for farmers to either “get big or get out” which has led to a loss in the number of farms and dwindling rural communities.

Vilsack said he’s not “bashing the big guys” but said he wanted to try and find a way to make it so small and mid-sized farms could also make it. He said the same solutions would also create a circular, rather than extractive, ag economy and support rural communities. 
“So now you not only have more prosperous farms, you also have more jobs, you have more reasons for people to stay in that small town,” Vilsack said. 
Vilsack said some of these programs have been kept by the current administration though they might live under a different name. 
“There’s just an enormous opportunity here if our leaders understand that we need a creative option,” Vilsack said. “This is not a situation where it’s this as opposed to something — it’s this in addition to something.” 
The Trump administration has cancelled Biden-era ag programs like the partnerships for Climate Smart commodities and a program that allowed schools to purchase food from local farmers. Other programs, like the Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, have been restructured to better align with the Trump agenda. 
 Vilsack said there’s also an opportunity for the state, counties, cities, or philanthropic groups to step in when a federal program is cancelled.  Even if it doesn’t do as much as a federal program, it sends a message.
“The key here is to understand the significance of doing something, and then having the state officials understand and appreciate and communicate to federal officials,” Vilsack said. “That’s how you can change and impact and affect policy.”
While the event was the start of a series of forums organized by the Iowa Democratic Party to highlight its plans to “grow Iowa,” Vilsack said he spoke in his capacity as an Iowan, not a politician. 
“This is not about any political stance that I may have,” Vilsack said. “It is about my deep concern about our state and my deep, deep concern about the state of rural America.” 
Vilsack said he sees a way forward, and it might as well start in Iowa.
“It doesn’t necessarily have to cost a lot of money, but it is a partnership between the government, farmers, universities, food companies, energy companies, utilities, conservation groups, environmental groups — it can bring all of this together instead of this, us or them kind of thing that we’ve got going on.” 
Iowa Democrats plan to hold similar forums, with other speakers, in different areas of the state, but have not yet released a schedule.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The U.S. House of Representatives took the initial step on Tuesday to revoke a National Park Service rule that put restrictions on motorized vehicles in sections of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.
It’s the latest in nearly two decades of controversy and legal challenges involving off-roaders, environmental groups and the National Park Service in the 1.25-million acre recreation area that encompasses Lake Powell.   
Sponsored by Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy, the resolution would overturn a National Park Service rule finalized earlier this year that restricts off-highway vehicles, like dirtbikes or ATVs, from driving on a handful of roads in Glen Canyon. 
It’s a simple resolution, stating that the rule “shall have no force or effect.” It invokes the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to review and overturn federal rules. 
The resolution cleared the House on Tuesday. It will still require approval from the Senate.

The rule only covers about 25 roads that amount to 26 miles inside the recreation area, according to Maloy’s office, which is roughly 6% of all the roads inside Glen Canyon’s borders. And those roads would still be accessible by conventional vehicles, like trucks, SUVs or Jeeps — just ATVs, side-by-sides, dirtbikes and other off-highway vehicles would be restricted. 
Environmental groups say the rule is so niche that it’s a waste of Congress’ time. Plus, the small region covered by the rule is the recreation area’s most remote and pristine, and opening them up to smaller, more advanced vehicles risks further damage to the environment. 
“They’re just closed to vehicles that have the ability to travel off road and cause severe damage,” said Rep. Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, during the House floor debate on Tuesday. 
But Maloy, along with motorized recreation advocates, say those roads allow for greater access to adjacent federally-controlled public land. The federal government didn’t consult the state or locals before finalizing the rule, she said — and even though the scope of the rule is small, Maloy argued it could hurt local economies. 
“I’ve spent a lot of time on the ground in these areas with local elected officials,” she said Tuesday. “This goes in the wrong direction. Wayne and Garfield counties are counties that struggle in a state that otherwise thrives.”

Formed in 1972, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is a stretch of public land managed by the National Park Service that spills over into northern Arizona and borders multiple national parks and monuments, including Bears Ears, Capitol Reef and Canyonlands. The region sees millions of visitors each year, often drawn to Lake Powell, the country’s second-largest reservoir. In 2025, the National Park Service recorded more than 4.7 million recreation visits to Glen Canyon. 
For years, controversy has simmered in Glen Canyon over motorized access. In 2005, environmental groups sued the National Parks Service over its loose regulation of off-road vehicles. The service settled in 2008 and agreed to develop an off-road vehicle management plan. 
In 2021, the park service, under the first Trump administration, released a new plan opening up much of the recreation area to all kinds of motorized use. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance sued two years later, arguing the administration’s plan failed to take all of the environmental impacts into consideration — the National Park Service again settled, agreeing to close the Lake Powell shoreline to motorized use, unless water levels were “sustainable” and put restrictions on ATV and side-by-side use in certain areas. 
That rule was finalized in January, affecting a small portion of the recreation area. It would prevent off-road vehicles and ATVs on segments of the Poison Spring Loop and a section of the Flint Trail, remote and challenging, yet popular, motorized routes in the recreation area. About 4,930 acres of shoreline were also covered. 
Hanna Larsen, a staff attorney for the alliance, accused the House of undermining the park service and bowing to “extreme motorized recreation in some of the most remote and wild parts of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.” 
“Rather than protect America’s crown jewels, the House has made it much more likely that treasured places such as the Orange Cliffs, Gunsight Butte, and Canyonlands National Park’s Maze District will be permanently impaired by noisy, destructive off-highway vehicles,” Larsen said in a statement. 
Proponents of the resolution include local politicians and motorized advocacy groups like the Blue Ribbon Coalition, which appealed the rule. On Tuesday, the coalition’s executive director Ben Burr said the vote represents “a grand reopening of our public lands.”
“The trails in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area that were closed through a questionable legal settlement provide unique recreation access to the Poison Spring trails and to Lake Powell,” he said. “We look forward to the Senate passing its version of this resolution, so that the American people can continue enjoying these trails for generations to come.”

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama Senate committee Tuesday approved a bill that prohibits public libraries from presenting or sponsoring drag performances in the presence of minors without parental consent. 
As initially filed, HB 67, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, would have prohibited such performances in public libraries as well as K-12 schools. After concerns that the bill could impact school theater productions — with one high school switching a planned “Peter and the Starcatcher” production to avoid conflict with the potential bill  — the bill was amended to prohibit drag performances only in public libraries and libraries in public K-12 schools.
“What the amendment does is limit the effectiveness of this bill to where the problem is occurring … it just it talks about libraries instead of K-12 institutions, and I think that will solve, broadly, our theater program problems in all K-12 schools,” Sen. Chris Elliot, R-Josephine, the chair of the Senate County and Municipal Government Committee, which approved the bill. Elliott did not say where libraries are hosting drag performances.

Several people spoke against the bill in a public hearing and criticized its definition of drag performances as “a performance in which a performer exhibits a sex identity that is different from the sex assigned to the performer at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers.”
Opponents said that was an excessively broad definition. 
Zephyr Scalzetti, a transgender man from Huntsville, asked if the clothes he wears would be considered drag under the bill’s definition. Pointing to the “What is a Woman Act,” Scalzetti asked if he should wear a dress to his local library.
“Where is the line between what I’m wearing today and drag? Is my beard drag, since it’s a male physical marker, the very hair that grows out of my face? The answer to that question in this bill is left entirely up to libraries to determine individually,” Scalzetti said.
Opponents also raised potential legal challenges related to First Amendment rights and equal protection, with some arguing that similar laws have been deemed unconstitutional in the past.
“Whether you call this a drag ban, a crossdressing ban, a masquerade law or a three article rule, courts have ruled these laws unconstitutional for 50 years,” said Opelika resident Chris Hathcock.
Ted Halley, who said he “detransitioned” back to male after 12 years of identifying as a woman, claimed that “drag shows are grooming children to be transgender” and incentivize children to transition. Halley did not say whether a drag queen incentivized him to identify as a woman.
“Drag queen story hour, whether it’s in school, which I think you should put it back in, or a library, is very dangerous,” Halley claimed.
Detransition and regret are different concepts, a Harvard Medical School study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism suggests, which may overlap in some people, but they are “sometimes mistakenly viewed as synonymous.”
Sen. Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove, asked how consent would be obtained and in what situations it would be required. She said that she hosts events for seniors and her sorority in the Bessemer Public Library, and they may bring children with them to some events that could potentially be in conflict with the bill.
“It’s a public library. There can be minors, and a lot of my seniors take care of their grandchildren. They may bring them to the event with them,” Coleman said, adding that it’s the same case with some sorority events.
Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, said the legislation is a “cultural distraction” that distracts from more pressing concerns. He said that he is “absolutely concerned” with lawmakers not “paying attention to the fact that we are not living– we are not living in normal times.” He said that parents should be deciding what events their children attend.
“Here we are talking about what parents can decide and attempting to codify this into law. I am embarrassed by this … That is shameful. That is not what our government should be doing,” Hatcher said.
The bill goes to the full Senate for consideration.

The Crawford County Quorum Court voted unanimously Monday night at a special meeting to accept the library’s governing board’s offer to pay nearly $113,000, which U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks declared the defendants in the suit must pay.
Three mothers whose children are library patrons sued the Crawford County Library System in May 2023 over its segregation of children’s books with LGBTQ+ themes into “social sections.” This was a “compromise” in light of public outcry over the books being on the shelves at all, said Deidre Grzymala, the former library director who resigned in February 2023.
Plaintiffs Rebecka Virden, Nina Prater and Samantha Rowlett alleged in their suit that the “social sections” were based on “an extreme and malevolent view of the Bible” and violated the First Amendment.
The lawsuit’s five defendants are the county, the county judge, the quorum court, the library board and the library’s current director, Charlene McDonnough, who took over the role in January 2024.
U.S. District Judge P.K. Holmes ruled in the plaintiffs’ favor in September and ordered the library to return the segregated books to their original sections. The case was reassigned to Brooks in October.
The projected legal cost was around $118,000, but the cost was reduced by $5,000 after Brooks did not grant any motions from the plaintiffs or defendants after the ruling.
Crawford County and County Judge Chris Keith were also defendants in a separate lawsuit against the state over Act 372 of 2023, which would have given local elected officials the final say over whether to relocate challenged library materials some consider “obscene.” The 18 plaintiffs, including Crawford County Library patrons, cited county officials’ statements that Act 372 was a reason to maintain the “social sections.”
Brooks enjoined the challenged portions of Act 372, citing First Amendment violations, in December. The legal fees facing Crawford County defendants in both lawsuits now exceed $575,000, library board chairman Keith Pigg said.
Federal judge declares sections of Arkansas’ library obscenity law unconstitutional

 Ongoing conflict

Before Brooks’ April 16 order for the defendants to foot the bill for the Crawford County-specific lawsuit, the quorum court and the library board had already squabbled for months over whether the county or the library was responsible for the payment. Members of the library board appointed by the current quorum court supported paying the bill with library operating funds.
On Wednesday, the board voted 3-1 to authorize the payment with library funds as a gesture of “good will” toward the quorum court, which took the board up on the offer Monday.
Pigg did not vote on the motion, and he urged the quorum court on Monday not to approve it.
Pigg is the only current board member remaining from before Crawford County citizens began complaining to the quorum court about LGBTQ+ books in the library in late 2022. Jeffrey and Tammi Hamby of Van Buren co-wrote a December 2022 letter to Crawford County pastors, saying LGBTQ+ content within children’s reach is “grooming a generation of children to feel this is normal and an accepted way of life.”
Pigg reminded the quorum court Monday that, while a majority of the library board approved the $113,000 payment, the board did not approve the use of roughly $40,000 in library funds to pay Grzymala’s severance package after she resigned. Both state law and the state Constitution prohibit local elected officials from using library funds without the library board’s consent.
Pigg said the library system’s services would suffer if it were forced to pay the legal fees. 
In an interview Tuesday, McDonnough agreed, saying the library’s budget is “already set for 2025,” but that the system would likely have to reduce its hours at some branches and purchase fewer books in early 2026.

Another payment demand
At an April 18 library board meeting, member Tammi Hamby blamed the lawsuit on Grzymala and accused her of dishonesty. Grzymala’s attorney, Christopher Hooks, responded with an April 23 letter to the county seeking $100,000 in damages over the remarks. Hooks said Hamby violated the county’s “separation agreement” with Grzymala upon her resignation, which stated that Grzymala and the county would refrain from “criticizing, denigrating or disparaging each other.”
The quorum court appointed Hamby and two others to the library board in early 2023 to succeed three members who resigned en masse. All three board members now in those positions voted in favor of the library paying the legal fees stemmng from the lawsuit.
McDonnough told the Advocate in December that Crawford County residents had not been publicly decrying library content since Holmes’ September ruling against the county.
On Monday, some residents revived those complaints before the quorum court. Mike Rich blamed the lawsuit on “the LGBT group and their liberal allies” who “sued to force exposure” of objectionable content to minors.

Challenges to public library funding throughout Arkansas meet frustration, some resistance

 

“The library is now a compromised, dangerous institution,” Rich said.
Other citizens disputed this claim and urged the quorum court to reject the library board’s payment offer, saying the parties that lost the case should have to pay for it.
Rich said he hopes Crawford County will see a future ballot measure to defund the library. Several counties throughout the state have seen attempts to reduce the tax millage that funds their libraries, to varying degrees of success. Some of those counties have experienced public clashes over children’s access to LGBTQ+ books, including in Craighead County, which narrowly lost half its library tax funding in 2022.

Republican majorities in the state House and Senate held a vote on none of the three resolutions that would send the proposed standards back to the Oklahoma State Board of Education for further review. Agendas for Tuesday’s legislative proceedings didn’t include any of the resolutions.
That left less than the constitutionally required minimum time for the Legislature to pass a measure through both chambers before a deadline Thursday to take action on the standards. Lawmakers have had 30 legislative days to pass a resolution to accept, reject or amend the standards, but by taking no action, they allow the proposed draft to take effect as written.

Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, worked with Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, to file a resolution Thursday to reject the standards for social studies and science, but there wasn’t enough GOP support to pass it, Paxton’s spokesperson, Alex Gerszewski, said in a statement Tuesday. 
The Senate Republican Caucus discussed the matter in a private meeting with Walters.
“Following a lengthy conversation Monday, the caucus was not on board with rejecting the standards based on the process in which they were presented to the (state) board of education,” Gerszewski said.
Offices of the House speaker and the governor did not immediately return requests for comment.
House and Senate Democrats filed their own resolutions March 31 to reject the social studies standards.
Gov. Kevin Stitt and members of the state Board of Education have raised transparency concerns with the way state Superintendent Ryan Walters handled the adoption process.
Half of the state board said they were unaware of last-minute changes made to the social studies standards at the time they voted on them during a Feb. 27 meeting. 
Some of the changes include the addition of language stating there were “discrepancies” in 2020 election results including “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”

Walters and his staff made no mention during the Feb. 27 meeting of any significant differences from the original draft posted publicly in December. The Oklahoma State Department of Education didn’t share the updated version online until weeks after the board vote.
Board members received the final draft of the standards at 4 p.m. the day before a 9:30 a.m. meeting to vote on the proposal, according to email records from the state Education Department. One member, Ryan Deatherage, said before casting the only vote against the standards that he didn’t have enough time to read through the lengthy document.
Pugh’s resolution in the Senate, which seven House members co-signed, offered to send the standards back to the state board for “proper review and consideration” given the “magnitude of the decision,” doubts over transparency and an estimated $33 million price tag to implement them.
Academic standards are a list of topics and concepts that public schools must teach to students. They are reviewed and updated every six years.
State standards are typically developed with committees of Oklahoma educators and subject-matter experts. For the social studies standards, Walters also chose to involve national right-wing media personalities and conservative policy advocates in a leading review committee.
Walters said he decided to add new language to the standards after his administration received input from the public and from focus groups. He said the new content wasn’t intended to support or deny the results of the 2020 presidential election, but rather to encourage students to draw their own conclusions.

Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, called Walters’ new standards “dangerous for kids.” She said her Republican colleagues have failed to take the matter as seriously as they should by taking up neither resolution filed in the Senate to reject the standards.
“Our classrooms will be focused on these politicized measures that have been written by political hacks from outside of our state, and if we’re not concerned enough to put that on the agenda and take a vote on it, that deeply disturbs me about the business of the Senate,” Kirt told reporters Tuesday.
In response, Senate Democrats will “take time on bills” and slow down floor votes, she said. Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, began filibustering shortly before noon. Republicans quickly ended the floor session and called for a lunch recess.
House Minority Leader and candidate for governor Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, expressed similar outrage at the lack of action by Republican leadership. Political pressure from Walters, she said, mattered more than the “extremist political agenda” the standards will introduce into public schools.
“Because no action has been taken by Republican legislative leaders, the voices of Oklahomans — across the state and party lines — who have been urging us to disapprove these problematic, and costly, social studies standards have gone unheard,” Munson said in a statement.
Several local GOP party officials and far-right-wing groups, including Moms for Liberty Oklahoma, signed a letter to lawmakers supporting Walters’ proposal as “strong, conservative, pro-American standards.” The letter, dated Monday, urged legislators to oppose Pugh’s resolution to reject.
“We want to remind every legislator: In the last few election cycles, grassroots conservative organizations have flipped seats across Oklahoma by holding weak Republicans accountable,” the letter reads. “If you choose to side with the liberal media and make backroom deals with Democrats to block conservative reform, you will be next.”

The Missouri Senate on Tuesday night will start debating 13 spending bills to fund state government operations in the coming year. The bills would appropriate $49.4 billion — $1.5 billion more than the proposal approved in the Missouri House and $700 million less than proposed by Gov. Mike Kehoe in January.
The Senate plan includes several new big-ticket items added in committee work, including $300 million more for public schools through the foundation formula, $107 million more for child care subsidy payments and $92.7 million to pay a software firm that won a judgment over claims it was not paid for work it completed.
But the biggest source of new spending in the Senate budget plan is 169 line items for favored projects and programs. The $441 million in earmarks  — including $332.5 million in general revenue — range in size from $36,000 for the Kansas City Police Department to implement “crime prevention through environmental design training” to $37.9 million from federal funds for the Missouri Office of Refugee Administration, an independent office of the not-for-profit International Institute of St. Louis that was created in 2018.
The House had its own batch of earmarks, 105 in the operating budget plus 44 more in the capital appropriations bills, totaling $295 million. Of those, 57 — totaling $126.3 million, including $115 million in general revenue — were cut in the Senate. A dozen items were increased by a total of $7 million.
There are two earmarks especially important to the top budget writers in each chamber. 
Last year, lawmakers agreed to spend $8 million to renovate a historic footbridge on Jefferson Avenue in Springfield, in the district of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough, and $12.5 million to purchase 1,800 acres in McDonald County, in the district of House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton of Noel.
Then-Gov. Mike Parson approved the footbridge and vetoed the state park. Deaton put the park back into the budget at $19 million for 1,600 acres and cut funding for the footbridge. Hough cut the park funding and restored money for the footbridge.
The total of new earmarks from the two chambers, 318 so far, is the largest number of such items included in a budget plan as the state built an enormous budget surplus during Parson’s second term.
The number represents only new items not included in Kehoe’s budget that are identifiable for a single community or vendor. Many of the hundreds of earmarks added in the final years of Parson’s administration are not included in budget tracking by The Independent.
“We’ll just sit down with the guys in the House and see where their top top priorities are,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Springfield Republican, said when asked how many he expects to keep in the final budget. “I don’t put things in the budget on the Senate side that I don’t then go to conference and fight for.”
 House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, speaks March 3 during debate on the fiscal 2025 supplemental appropriations bill (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Deaton said he will be working toward a fixed total for spending and every item approved will have to stay within that amount.
“I’ve never known of a budget year where you end up where everybody’s universally well pleased and happy,” Deaton said. “So it’s not just a question of what we can do this year. We’ve got to make sure we’re thinking about next year and the trajectory of the state budget.”
After the Senate votes on the operating budget bills, the Senate Appropriations Committee must work on its version of the two capital spending bills, plus the bill reappropriating funds received from the American Rescue Plan Act.
Kehoe recommended $954 million for the capital bills and $2.7 billion for the reappropriation measure. The House boosted the capital bills to $1.03 billion and trimmed about $100 million from the reappropriation bill.
Lawmakers have until May 9 to finish work on the budget. 
 Revenue picture

The full list of earmarks added to the budget in either chamber, if approved for the final budget package, would cost $736.4 million, including $597.8 million in general revenue.
With a historically high fund balance — the general revenue fund balance on March 31 was $3.7 billion, with another $1.5 billion in funds that can be spent like general revenue — paying for those items is not a question.
But with the House pushing for a tax cut on capital gains income, revenues lagging behind estimates and uncertainty for federal matching funds in programs like Medicaid, the question is how long the surplus will last.
“Right now is the time to get it in, because I don’t think in the next few years we’re going to have the revenue or the federal dollars,” said state Rep. Adrian Plank, a Columbia Democrat who can claim credit for three earmarks in his district to help small towns with wastewater and flooding issues.
Kehoe proposed using almost $16 billion in general revenue in the coming year for operations and capital needs. The plan approved in the House uses $15.2 billion. The Senate operating budget calls for $15.7 billion in general revenue spending with the total for capital needs yet to be set.
All three versions of the budget would require a substantial amount of surplus funds to supplement current revenue. 
The consensus revenue estimate issued in December forecast that the state will take in $13.56 billion during the fiscal year that starts July 1. The estimate also forecast that revenues in the current year would be $13.35 billion.
Both predictions may be hard to meet. Through April 22, the last date available, state revenues are down 1.65% for the year, a trend that would realize only $13.2 billion in revenue and, based on the forecast growth rate, $13.4 billion in the coming fiscal year.
 State Rep. Del Taylor, a St. Louis Democrat, is surrounded by other members of the Democratic caucus as an April 3 news conference about the Missouri state budget (Rudi Keller/Missouri Indepenent).
State Sen. Adam Schnelting, a St. Charles Republican who saw a small tax cut bill he sponsored for National Guard soldiers balloon to a $1.7 billion general tax cut in a House committee, said the urge to cut taxes should be accompanied by reduced spending.
“There’s always so many different pet projects, and I know sometimes that there are legitimate needs and concerns, that’s part of the process,” Schnelting said. “But the bottom line is, we just have to start cutting. That’s what my own caucus has to understand — long term, we have to ensure that with our tax cuts, we also cut the size of government.”
If Missouri has a strong economy, revenues should allow for lawmakers to insert local priorities into the budget, said state Rep. Del Taylor, a St. Louis Democrat who sits on the House Budget Committee. Legislators are elected to take care of constituent needs, he said.
“That is the job of the House of Representatives, to bring forward those types of projects,” Taylor said.
Funding big items like the increase for the school foundation formula and earmark projects can be done responsibly, Hough said.
“We’re not spending everything we have in the bank waiting on the next round of income tax and corporate tax and everything else to come into the state coffers to make sure we’re OK for next year,” Hough said. “We’re still carrying over more money this fiscal year to next fiscal year than we ever used to when I was in the House.”
 Earmark transparency

Each earmark added to the budget is identifiable because it has language directing it to a particular place, usually defined by population or political status, or organization, using language that only identifies one possible recipient.
The footbridge, for example, is identified as being “approximately five hundred sixty-two feet long” and located in a city that can only be Springfield. The refugee support funding is intended for an “a non-profit organization established in 2018.”
And, with work, most can be assigned to a legislative district. But none are publicly identified with the name of the legislator requesting the funds, or if it is added at the urging of a state institution like a university or a lobbyist for a private concern.
For the most part, lawmakers like it that way.
“As a member of the minority party, oftentimes I get my things done when a member of the majority is willing to do it, or when the chairman is willing to do it himself,” said state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “And I know that sometimes there’s a motivation for Democrats to not have public wins.”
House Majority Leader Alex Riley, a Republican from Springfield, said lawmakers who secure money for local projects are rarely reluctant to make it known.
“What we see in practice is when you have members that bring home something for their district that they’re proud of, most of the time those members will talk about that publicly,” Riley said. “That’s not usually something that they hide from.”
In the House, a three-step budget process, with subcommittees making recommendations in specialized areas, followed by the full House Budget Committee and floor action, there is somewhat more transparency.
For example, Taylor asked for the three water projects, costing $1.9 million total in Plank’s district in a subcommittee meeting and said he was doing so on Plank’s behalf. The subcommittee recommendation was not adopted by the full committee, but they are included in the Senate budget plan.
Plank wasn’t aware that the $1 million for sewer upgrades in Harrisburg, the $500,000 for stormwater control in Sturgeon and $400,000 for a floodwall in Rocheport were in the Senate plan.
“I’ve got the most rural district of any Democrat in the state, so when they have issues, they can’t grow, and they have issues that we can solve that will make them grow,” Plank said. “At that point, it doesn’t matter what party you represent, it’s about supporting your communities.”
Both Sturgeon and Harrisburg are about the same size they were in 1980, while Rocheport has lost 25% of its population. During that time, Boone County has grown in population by more than 80%.
One of the few earmarks directly sponsored into the budget by a floor amendment would use $900,000 of general revenue for a road project at Missouri Route 185 and Strange Drive in Washington County. State Rep. Mike McGirl, a Republican from Potosi, had to first win a $900,000 cut to prescription costs in the Medicaid program to finance his road project.
It was cut in the Senate.
The location where the work will be done is a dangerous dip in the road, he said. And he hopes to get the money back from the conference committee.
“That’s not the final product yet,” McGirl said. “There’s going to have to be some negotiations in there.”
McGirl’s fight for his amendment is the exception. Most items added in the House, and all items added in the Senate, were done by committee chairmen fulfilling requests made to them in private.
During the session, their offices are generally the busiest with visitors seeking favors.
Hough said he sees no reason to change the system.
“Folks do a pretty good job of keeping tabs on what they’re following and what they’re trying to accomplish,” Hough said. “And for the most part, when this all gets done, they go and say, ‘look what I did.’”

Gretchen Whitmer speaks at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township, Michigan after President Donald Trump announced a new F-15 squadron would be based there. April 29, 2025 | CSPAN ScreenshotMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer joined President Donald Trump when he landed at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Macomb County Tuesday, where he announced 21 new F-15EX fighter aircraft to be based there, as well as new KC-46A refueling tankers that had been previously announced. 
Trump, who arrived in Michigan for an event at Macomb Community College to mark his first 100 days in office, was also joined by GOP Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall and U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth for the announcement.
“For generations, the men and women of Selfridge have always been here, and they’ve always been for us,” Trump said. “Whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, they’ve always been for us. They’ve been for America. And under the Trump administration, we’re going to be there for you.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Whitmer, who has drawn criticism from within her party for cooperating with Trump, said she hadn’t intended to speak at the event, but made brief remarks after being introduced by Trump.
“On behalf of all the military men and women who serve our country and serve so honorably on behalf of the state of Michigan, I am really damn happy we’re here to celebrate this recapitalization of Selfridge. It’s crucial for the Michigan economy. It’s crucial for the men and women here for our homeland security and our future,” Whitmer said.
In a later press release, Whitmer said the new fighter mission would grow Michigan’s economy while keeping expert talent including pilots and maintenance workers in the state and cement Michigan’s leadership in national security for decades to come.  
“This is a huge, bipartisan win for Michigan, decades in the making, that will grow our economy and make our country safer,” Whitmer said in the release. “Because of our tireless work with partners on the ground in Macomb County and on both sides of the aisle, the future of Selfridge is bright, lasting, and secure. I’ll keep working with anyone to get things done on the kitchen-table issues and make a real difference for Michigan families.” 
Trump thanked Whitmer for her efforts at keeping Selfridge open as an active duty base. 
“So I want to thank Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for bringing [Selfridge] to our attention,” Trump said. “I’m not supposed to do that. She’s a Democrat. They say, ‘Don’t do that. Don’t have her here.’ I said, no, she’s going to be here. She’s done a very good job, frankly, and she was very much involved with the Republicans. They worked together on saving it. And it was not easy. So I want to thank you very much, Gretchen. Good job.”
Earlier this month, Whitmer joined Trump in the Oval Office as an “honored” guest as he signed an executive order to address the issue of invasive Asian Carp in the Great Lakes, saying Whitmer is a “very good person” who has done “an excellent job” in Michigan.
The new F-15s at Selfridge will replace the aging A-10 Thunderbolt II squadron scheduled to be retired next year. Without a defined squadron, the base had faced possible closure, with an ensuing loss of jobs and economic development for the region. 
“It’s a key piece of our statewide defense strategy and foundational to Macomb’s and Southeast Michigan’s economy,” said U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Paul D. Rogers, adjutant general and director of the Michigan Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. 
“This new fighter mission prevents the loss of about $30 million in wages. We’re excited for the future at Selfridge and for the future missions that will unfold while employing this great multirole fighter,” Rogers said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-29-184914-1024x597.png,,,2025-04-29 19:08:18.492906

(Photo by Julia Shumway/Oregon Capital Chronicle)More than 25,000 children in Oregon and Washington will lose the child care and early education their families rely on if the Trump administration continues its attempts to dismantle Head Start, say northwest nonprofit organizations that signed onto a lawsuit against the administration.
For the past 60 years, the federal Head Start program has provided child care and early learning opportunities to low-income children, many of whom are from non-white families or speak languages other than English.
But since President Donald Trump returned to office, the U.S. Department of Health Human Services has informed Head Start agencies they can’t use any federal funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and abruptly closed half of its regional offices, including the Seattle office that supported programs in Washington and Oregon.
Earlier this month, the Associated Press obtained a memo from the federal Office of Management and Budget calling for eliminating the Head Start program, as well as programs for teen pregnancy and Lyme disease.
All of that led Family Forward Oregon and the Washington State Association of Head Start and Early Childhood Assistance and Education Program to join Head Start associations from Illinois, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and a parents group from Oakland, California, in suing the Health and Human Services Department, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other federal officials to prevent cuts.
“Over the last three months, Donald Trump has put a bullseye on the backs of 3- and 4-year-olds,” Joel Ryan, executive director of the Washington program, said during a Tuesday press call. “He’s done everything to disrupt, dismantle and eventually paralyze the Head Start program.”
In Washington, that included a Head Start agency shutting down temporarily earlier this month when it didn’t receive federal funding, depriving more than 400 families of child care and 70 workers of their jobs. That child care center in Sunnyside eventually reopened.
More than 14,300 Washington children and more than 12,000 Oregon children receive services through Head Start.
Candice Vickers, the executive director of Family Forward Oregon, is a Head Start alumna. Her nonprofit organization, with members including mothers, caregivers and child care providers, advocates for child care at the state Legislature and with the federal government.
In recent months, Vickers said she has heard from a single mom of three in Portland who expects to lose her job if she loses access to Head Start because she can’t afford child care on her own. From families in Corvallis who learned last week that their Early Head Start program, which serves infants, was shut down with no reopen date. And from a mother in rural Oregon who credited Head Start for helping her recover from addiction and teaching her daughter to love reading.
“Head Start is more than just a preschool program,” Vickers said. “It’s a lifeline for working parents. It provides kids with the tools they need to succeed in school. It offers meals, dental care, mental health support and resources for these important parents.”
Oregon already has a severe child care shortage: A report prepared for the state’s Early Learning Division in 2023 found that nearly all counties are child care deserts, with one slot for every three children who need care. Without access to regulated child care, parents may have to give up work or rely on an unstable patchwork of caregivers, and businesses have a harder time recruiting employees.
Losing Head Start would have ripple effects through the rest of the economy, Vickers said.
“Once you’re fired from your job for not having access to childcare, you’re not going to get that job back,” she said. “These things that are happening won’t be able to be fixed by changing our mind tomorrow.”
U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said cuts to Head Start threaten years of progress toward making child care more available and affordable to families. Murray, who chaired the Senate Appropriations Committee when Democrats last controlled the chamber, negotiated an additional $1 billion for child care and early education as part of a $1.2 trillion spending package last year. That included a $275 million increase for Head Start.
“A couple of billionaires with no idea about what they are doing came along and decided to take an ax to Head Start,” Murray said. “Talk about clueless. Talk about careless. Instead of giving our kids a head start, Trump and Musk want to give billionaires another tax break and give families the cold shoulder.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 22:49:02+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge Eliot Prescott selected as next CT Inspector General,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/judge-eliot-prescott-ct-inspector-general/,"Eliot Prescott, a judge for the CT Appellate Court, will be the next CT Inspector General, charged with investigating fatal police shootings.","Connecticut’s Criminal Justice Commission voted Tuesday to appoint Judge Eliot Prescott to be the state’s next inspector general, tasked with investigating when people die in custody and deciding if police officers should be criminally charged for killing people while in the line of duty.
The commission spent nearly all day Tuesday interviewing five finalists for the position before selecting Prescott for the job. 
Prescott, who is currently serving as a senior judge for the Connecticut Appellate Court, beat out an experienced field of candidates with extensive histories as prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges. 
The other four finalists who were interviewed included Leonard Crone, a defense attorney from Waterbury; State Superior Court Judge Kevin Randolph; Superior Court Judge Kevin Russo; and Herman Woodard Jr., a defense attorney from Windsor. 
The lengthy interview process is evidence of the weight placed on the inspector general’s office, which was created by state lawmakers in 2020 to make the process of investigating police shootings more transparent and independent.
Prescott called the 2020 bill that created the inspector general’s office a “critical and wise piece of legislation.”
But the questions posed by members of the criminal justice commission highlighted how difficult the job will be for Prescott as he takes over the role from Robert Devlin, who served as the first inspector general in the state’s history. 
Supreme Court Justice Andrew McDonald, who chairs the commission, warned each candidate that there were more than 20 pending investigations into police shootings and prison deaths that would need to be resolved by the next inspector general.

“If you take this role, you would essentially be jumping onto a moving train,” McDonald said. 
The commissioners also warned Prescott and the other finalists that the role of inspector general was a “difficult and thankless” position. 
The duties of the office often place the inspector general directly between law enforcement officers and the family members of people who are killed by police. 
After reviewing body camera footage and interviewing officers and other witnesses, the inspector general decides whether a police officer was justified in killing someone or whether they should be criminally charged for their actions.
Devlin, who will retire at the end of June, reviewed dozens of cases of police shootings and prison deaths during his tenure as inspector general, producing detailed reports about each case.

And he used his powers to bring criminal charges against one officer, State Trooper Brian North, who shot and killed 19-year-old Mubarak Soulemane in 2020. 
North was acquitted by a jury after a week-long criminal trial, but the case still created animosity toward the inspector general’s office from police officers and their unions. And that tension seems to have continued.
Scott Murphy, another member of the criminal justice commission, said one union official recently sent a letter to the commission raising concerns that the next inspector general would open “witch hunts” against police officers in the state. 
The commissioners asked Prescott whether he would be able to fairly perform the job while facing public pressure from both police and members of the community who believe individual officers should be charged for their actions.
They also peppered him with questions about whether he’d ever handled a trial where media was in the courtroom. They asked whether he believed in systemic racism. They probed what he would do in situations when police officers didn’t turn on their body cameras during a shooting. And they asked how he would build trust in communities with significant distrust in the legal and criminal justice systems
Prescott told the commission that he was ready to assume the role and all of the pressures that came with it. And he said his experience as a judge had prepared him to make difficult and, sometimes, unpopular decisions.
“I’ve made unpopular decisions on the bench,” said Prescott, who cited an court order in 2013 that released the 911 calls from the Sandy Hook school shooting.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0429_SR_InspectorGeneral_090-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 19:08:18.492906

(Elise Plunk, Louisiana Illuminator)Debate over local control and state regulation of emissions took on David vs. Goliath tones Tuesday at the State Capitol, where a legislative committee considered a raft of bills dealing with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS).
Some 30 CCS projects have been proposed for Louisiana that would pull carbon dioxide from industrial smokestacks and pipe it to locations where it can be stored underground. Ten carbon storage bills were on the House Committee on Natural Resources agenda. 
They included House Bill 4 by Rep. Chuck Owen, R-Rosepine, which would give all 64 parishes the right to vote on whether they would allow CCS projects within their boundaries. After hours of debate, the proposal failed in a 6-10 vote with bipartisan opposition and Republicans accounting for all the votes in favor. 
Three CCS projects are proposed for Allen and Vernon parishes within Owen’s district. In an interview after the vote, Owen said he believes the oil and gas industry is investing in the technology in response to so-called “legacy lawsuits” against their companies for damages to Louisiana’s coastal wetlands. 
A Plaquemines Parish jury awarded its local government $740 million in damages earlier this month in their lawsuit against Chevron. Freeport-McMoran reached a $100 million settlement with 12 parishes in 2019 in its legacy lawsuit. Several similar cases are pending in other parishes against Big Oil.  
“People like me – legislators and governors – created this mess, and it destroyed oil and gas,” Owen said. “It has forced oil and gas to be prostituted with (CCS).”
Support for carbon capture and sequestration in Louisiana does not fall along traditional political lines. Its proponents largely come from the oil and gas industry, who see the technology as a meaningful way to reduce the emissions tied to global warming. Opponents view the technology as an untested safety hazard and another way to promote more fossil fuel extraction. 
CCS detractors have advocated for more local control over storage projects and have butted heads with industry backers who warn that varying governing regulation among 64 parishes will have a chilling effect on economic development. 
Owen and Rep. Shane Mack, R-Livingston, argued that local control doesn’t necessarily end CCS projects but amplifies the voices of local communities.  
“Please don’t think Chuck is here trying to kill off carbon capture,” Owen told committee members. 
Rep. Danny McCormick, R-Oil City, framed his viewpoint on carbon capture with property rights in mind. He aired concerns over projects with underground storage that could expand past parish lines and noted that CO2 pipelines could have to cut through private land.
“Us here in Louisiana are pretty independent, you know, home of the free and of the brave. I think we should take into consideration private property rights,” McCormick said.
Industry representatives spoke in support of keeping carbon capture regulations minimal and managed on a statewide front, rather than allowing each parish and locality to establish its own rules.
Tommy Faucheux, Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association president, said CCS provides a “new opportunity” to “strengthen and expand” his industry in Louisiana. Interest in building such projects in Louisiana could cool at the thought of further regulation without consistency, he said.
The powerful Louisiana Association of Business and Industry also opposes House Bill 4, arguing it would add more red tape to industrial development. LABI president and CEO Will Green said there will be major economic consequences if locals are given power over whether CCS projects move forward.
“The last thing they need is more layers of government,” Green said, adding that more regulatory steps for CCS projects would be “harmful” to advancing the industry.
The state Department of Energy and Natural Resources expects to issue dozens of permits for the wells needed to store carbon dioxide underground starting later this year. Paige Carter, chief business development officer with Louisiana Economic Development, said changing the rules would not be fair to projects already in motion and cast Louisiana in a bad light to business. 
Other bills the committee considered included:
Senate Bill 73 by Sen. Mike Reese, R- Leesville, advanced without opposition. It would require the state conservation commissioner to follow CCS permitting rules similar to those in place for coastal restoration projects. Applications would give “substantial consideration” to public comment and local government input on whether a project takes place. 
 
House Bill 601 by Rep. Brett Geymann, R- Lake Charles, in a tie vote, did not advance from the committee. It would restrict the use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide storage pipelines. The principal allows a government or business entity to force the sale of private property for a use that’s considered to be for the greater good.
The House Committee on Natural Resources recessed so members could convene on the floor Tuesday afternoon. The meeting resumed after the full House adjourned, and this report will be updated with the outcome of other bills on the agenda.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250429_091231-1024x1024.jpg,,,2025-04-29 19:08:18.492906

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The state House narrowly passed an altered bill that requires school districts to implement “bell-to-bell” cellphone bans for the upcoming school year.
Senate Bill 139, which passed by a single vote, heads to Gov. Kevin Stitt for consideration. 
While it requires schools to ban cellphones and personal electronic devices like smart watches, tablets and smart glasses for one year, it allows districts to lift that ban in any subsequent years.
Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, said the version that heads to Stitt’s desk is different from the initial version passed by the House. The original version contained an opt out for districts that didn’t want to comply. The Senate version, which heads to Stitt’s desk, contains none.
He said the chambers compromised on a “try it before you buy it, type of policy.” Everyone will be required to try it for a year, but if a district finds the policy doesn’t work for them, and they would like students to have cellphones in class, then they can opt out moving forward, Caldwell said.
How districts implement the ban is up to them, he said.
Rep. Danny Williams, R-Seminole, said he liked the original House bill that would have allowed districts to opt out and provided local control.
“I’m not fond of the requirement because we talk a lot about local control, and it looks like we’re kind of creeping into no control on the first year of this,” he said. 
But Caldwell said the bill is consistent with other bills that the Legislature passed because it directs districts on what to do, but gives them flexibility on how to act within those parameters.
“Ultimately, I think where this goes back to is the total local control,” he said. “…After this year, (if) they’re the outlier, they’re the district that their education outcomes didn’t improve, their behavioral problems didn’t decrease, and the school board wants to take the step up and say, ‘No, we want cellphones back in our classes,’ they can do that.”
Caldwell said he hopes Stitt will sign the measure and “we’ll all celebrate next year when our kids can go to a distraction-free classroom.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM) A New Mexico district court judge on Tuesday found that the Public Education Department has not complied with previous orders in the Yazzie/Martinez education equity case and ordered the state to begin the process for creating a plan to rectify the situation.
Parties in the more than 10-year-old Yazzie/Martinez case returned to court  after plaintiffs filed a motion of non-compliance in September 2024, pointing to continued poor student outcomes, high turnover within the PED and high teacher vacancy rates.
First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson concurred and said the state needs a plan to ensure progress is made and tracked.
“A court-ordered plan would provide guidance to the Legislature and the executive branches of government, particularly when making difficult budgetary decisions that need to survive political and economic shifts,” Wilson said during the hearing.
Plaintiffs’ legal counsel had proposed appointing the Legislative Education Study Committee to lead the development of the plan because the department has permanent staff and access to educational research. However, Wilson said because the LESC is not party to the case, he does not have the authority to direct them to create a plan. Instead, PED is tasked with developing a plan and LESC can provide input. 
Wilson gave the PED until July 1 to identify an “outside expert and consultant to assist” in developing the plan and to file a status report with the court. The state then has until Oct. 1 to develop a draft report and file another status report with the state, “taking into consideration all of the components and elements raised by the plaintiffs in their briefing.” Wilson said the final plan must be completed by Nov. 3 and filed for the court’s review. 
The plaintiffs outlined a proposed plan with nine goals to address the needs of Native American students, low income students, English language learners and students with disabilities. 
A PED spokesperson told Source NM that the department welcomes Wilson’s decision. According to court documents, the PED did not object to creating a plan, but objected to the LESC taking the lead in the process.
“Improving student outcomes is central to our mission and this plan will support lasting improvements to our educational system,” the PED told Source in a written statement. The department also said the state has “substantially increased funding” and the department has made “significant steps” to improve student outcomes and teacher recruitment.
Melissa Candelaria, education director for the NM Center on Law and Poverty, which represents the plaintiffs, said plaintiffs still see the court’s decision as a “victory” because LESC will still be involved. She said the plaintiffs will be involved as well, because Wilson ordered that stakeholders be consulted.
She said the plaintiffs will need continued support “as we go forward in holding the state accountable in implementmenting the plan and ensuring that the voices are at the table in the development of the plan, as the court said just a little while ago,” Candelaria said during a news conference following the court’s decision.
Wilhelmina Yazzie (Diné), one of the original plaintiffs, was emotional following the court’s decision. 
“I think it’s about time, and I really am staying positive. As I mentioned, my boys were young when we started this, now they’re young adults,” Yazzie told Source NM.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that the current measles outbreak marks the second highest annual case count in 25 years, and more than 80% of the nearly 900 current cases are associated with the “ongoing outbreak in close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage” in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.
Overall, 96% of the cases have been among people confirmed as unvaccinated, or with unknown vaccination records.
As of Tuesday, New Mexico had 66 cases, with no new ones reported yet this week. Most of the state’s cases are in Lea County, just across the state line from Gaines County, Texas, where the outbreak began in mid-February.
From Feb. 1 to April 25, 20,304 New Mexicans received a dose of the measles vaccine statewide, nearly double the 10,860 people over the same time last year, according to the New Mexico Department of Health. The national vaccination rate has slipped from 90.8% for one dose of measles, mumps and rubella, below the 95% threshold to prevent outbreaks from spreading.
In 2000, after decades of vaccination, the CDC declared measles eliminated in the U.S., but if current vaccination rates continue, or decline further, measles may become commonplace again, according to research co-authored by Dr. Nathan Lo, an infectious diseases physician-scientist at Stanford University.
“It was striking for us, just seeing how much the U.S. was at this tipping point for measles, where small declines in vaccination can put us very certainly on the path for measles returning,” Lo told Source NM in a phone call. “But also, small increases in vaccines can push us back into safe territory.”
In research published in the academic journal JAMA last week, Lo and other researchers at Stanford used mathematical models to estimate how four serious diseases eliminated by vaccines in the U.S. (measles, rubella, polio and diphtheria) might reemerge based on vaccination rates. The models run thousands of simulations, projecting what the changes look like in the next 25 years.
A 10% decrease in people choosing to vaccinate could spur an estimated 11 million measles cases over 25 years in the U.S.
Even at the current levels of vaccination, measles could reestablish itself in the U.S. with hundreds of thousands of cases over 25 years.
“We’re still very likely on the path toward measles return, but it won’t happen for sometime,” Lo said, estimating that reemergence is about 20 years away.
The state with the highest risk of measles: Texas. This is in part due to declines in vaccination rates, but also due to its large cities with international travel and demographic features, such as the age of the population.
As for New Mexico, Lo said: “One of the risks is being next to Texas, I think that’s been made clear.”
Prevalent measles infections would mean preventable illness-related deaths, often in children, and long-term injuries such as brain damage, he said.
“There’s a number of rare but real neurologic complications that happen from measles; some of which are universally fatal and many of which lead to lifelong-disability,” he said. “Those are the really unfathomable types of outcomes we hope don’t come to pass.”
For the other childhood diseases to reemerge, there would need to be a significant drop in vaccination rates, such as a 30% to 40% decline, he said.
That’s unlikely to happen without big policy shifts from the federal government, Lo said, such as changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, reducing potency of vaccines or revoking vaccines’ uses.
“Suddenly, those scenarios of vaccine decline suggest that even rubella, polio and their really awful clinical complications such as babies born with birth defects and people living with lifelong paralysis or even dying, becomes much more of a risk,” Lo said.
Lo said he hopes that not just policy makers, but parents and people considering getting a vaccine hear about the research.
“A small fraction of the population can really make a difference here,” he said.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) The revised revenue forecast legislators have been waiting for to help drive policy and funding decisions isn’t providing much more clarity than before. It also means legislators still have a relatively small amount of money to work with this session. 
Maine’s Revenue Forecasting Committee only made minor changes to its predictions for state revenue for the next several years. However, the lack of serious revisions was not due to what’s known but rather what’s not: uncertainty with federal funding and the economy, specifically impacts from tariffs.
While the committee’s report is not due until Thursday, it previewed the reforecasting for the Legislature’s Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee on Tuesday, whose members’ questioned whether the uncertainty was inherently negative.
“At this point, the risk really is primarily on the downside,” said State Economist Amanda Rector, who chairs the Revenue Forecasting Committee, implying that revenue is more likely to see losses than gains. 
However, she noted that it’s possible the economic outlook could be resolved in a way that ultimately boosts consumer and business confidence. 
While stating the revenue prediction is the best the committee could do based on the current economic forecast, Rector acknowledged, “I would say that certainly it’s not the highest level of confidence probably in a forecast they’ve ever done.”
By the numbers 
With all of that uncertainty in mind, the state is still expected to bring in roughly $11.2 million in the next biennium, 2026 and 2027. 
After factoring in the updated revenue forecast and laws enacted so far this session, the state is now expected to end fiscal year 2027 with $125,278,261, according to Christopher Nolan, director of the nonpartisan Office of Fiscal and Program Review. 
That’s essentially the pot lawmakers now have left to fund legislation, though taxes and other revenue generating options are also being considered. 
In March, Democrats pushed through a roughly $11.3 million, two-year budget plan without Republican support after Senate Republicans refused to back a change package for the current fiscal year to address the immediate funding deficit for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, unless it included structural reform to the program.
At the time that budget passed, the state had expected to be left with about $127 million at the end of fiscal year 2027. The lower figure that Nolan shared is largely due to the cost — about $3.2 million — associated with a law passed earlier this month that aims to address the limited availability of indigent defense in the state. 
The two-year budget passed so far only continued baseline spending and funded the emergency measures initially attempted in the change package, so Democrats said it was only “part one.” 
That budget also did not fund another expected shortfall for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, which Democrats said was intentionally left out while they waited for the updated projections and any changes coming from Washington, D.C.. 
Republicans have argued that Democrats passed an unbalanced budget because it didn’t include that or any of the policy changes legislators may be looking to adopt in a “part two” budget.

Gov. Janet Mills proposed some tax increases and program cuts for the next biennium and those recommendations appear to remain the same for this next budget, as Mills’ press secretary Ben Goodman said on Tuesday, “We are not anticipating the release of any new budget proposal.”
Earlier Tuesday during a press conference, Senate Republican Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) said what the minority party in Maine is able to get into the state budget may also depend on what’s ultimately included in the congressional budget. 
Stewart and his caucus will continue to call for structural reform to MaineCare. In particular, legislative Republicans want the state to request a waiver to institute work requirements for able-bodied, childless adults to access Medicaid, a restriction the federal government is also weighing. 
“Clearly, legislative Democrats don’t want to move on any of those issues,” Stewart said, “but they might be forced to.”
 ‘Considerable uncertainty’
The phrase “considerable uncertainty” came up in the committee’s deliberations time and time again, said Megan Bailey, senior economic analyst in the Maine Office of the State Economist, during the latest revenue forecasting committee meeting on Monday. 
This phrase was uttered when it came to economic policy, government spending, consumer sentiment, geopolitical tensions and consumer sentiment, Bailey said. 
The commission also made a specific assumption about Maine likely being at a greater risk from federal funding uncertainty, given that it’s already faced what’s widely considered retribution from the Trump administration over the state’s protections for transgender people, as well as tariff policy changes, given that Canada is Maine’s largest trading partner and that the state relies on Canadian tourism.  
“Until there is better knowledge about how some of these federal policies and changes will settle out, they didn’t see much of a compelling reason to change much of their forecast,” Bailey said, noting in that way the commission followed the lead taken by the Federal Reserve and Federal Open Market Committee.










Until there is better knowledge about how some of these federal policies and changes will settle out, they didn’t see much of a compelling reason to change much of their forecast.


– Megan Bailey, senior economic analyst in the Maine Office of the State Economist


If conditions change “enough to warrant a revised forecast,” Bailey said the commission is discussing the possibility of revising projections ahead of its next scheduled update on Nov. 1.
Members of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee pressed Rector Tuesday on what specific conditions would warrant an earlier revision. Rector said there would need to be “pretty significant evidence” that economic conditions or revenue positions were sufficiently different from the existing forecasts and, specifically, reliable data for them to base any such changes on. 
“This is, in some ways, similar to the early stages of the pandemic,” Rector said, “where things were changing very, very rapidly, but at that point, there was no evidence to sort of say, ‘Ah, this is how we need to update the forecast,’ so the commission had to wait long enough to get some data to look at before they came back.” 
In other ways, this moment is markedly different from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The two-year budget was ‘not the last word.’ Here’s what comes next.

Forecasting Committee member Michael Allen, who is associate commissioner of tax policy for the state, said the Federal Reserve played a significant role in mitigating the economic downturn then. But in a “normal” recession, it takes time for people to feel the effects. It took almost a year for anyone to really feel the impacts of the Great Recession around 2008, Allen said as an example. 
“If there’s a problem, it’s probably something that’s slowly building,” Allen said. “I think all of this reflects the fact that, at the moment, the information coming in is still pretty good.” 
As Rector noted earlier, a lot of the uncertainty hinges on frayed consumer confidence, while fears of tariffs and spending cuts have yet to show up in the numbers. 
Inflation growth has remained somewhat elevated and the commission is expecting more upward pressure from tariffs. 
Annual inflation according to the Consumer Price Index was 3% in 2024, which was slightly higher than the commission’s forecast of 2.7%. Because of that, as well as the expected impact of tariffs, it increased its inflation predictions for the 2025 fiscal year from 2.4% to 3.2% and 2026 from 2.3% to 2.8%. 
The commission left its inflation prediction for 2027 unchanged at 2.2% and slightly decreased its predictions for 2028 and 2029, both from 2.2% to 2.1%. 
The commission also updated its predictions for two components of personal income, reducing the forecasted growth for “dividends, interest, and rent” as well as nonfarm property income, because growth for both in 2024 was smaller than expected. 
Aside from federal uncertainty, the commission noted some of the continued pressures on the state level, including a tight labor market, aging workforce, strained housing market and climate-related disruptions starting to impact the hospitality industry.

(Photo illustration by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Former Indiana Congressional candidate Gabriel “Gabe” Whitley was sentenced to three months in federal prison Tuesday after he admittedly falsified campaign finance records and lying about raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions ahead of the May 2024 primary.
The sentence followed a plea deal agreement offered by the U.S. attorney’s office earlier this year.
Judge James Sweeney, who serves on the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, said at the Tuesday hearing in Indianapolis that the “fairly short” imposed sentence took into account Whitley’s lack of criminal history, in addition to his “troubled, traumatic childhood” and multiple, ongoing mental health challenges.
But Whitley’s campaign crime “is a serious offense” and involved “multiple layers of fabrication,” Sweeney said.
“The power of trust that we, the American people, put in the political process and in our representatives — the public needs to trust the system, at least,” the judge said. “We need to have confidence in the process and the integrity of the system, even if the political candidate doesn’t have that same integrity.”

Whitley claimed in the courtroom that he did not know his campaign finance fillings were fraudulent. But the judge said his sentence — less than the six month-maximum which could have been imposed — took into account that Whitley “clearly knew there was something not proper.”
Sweeney emphasized, too, that serving some prison time “will help deter others” who are running for political office from committing similar campaign crimes.
Questions about Whitley’s campaign finances were first reported by the Indiana Capital Chronicle early last year. 
Whitley admitted that he lied to the FEC in three separate reports about hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from supporters and loans from himself. 
Specifically, Whitley admitted that in October 2023, he falsely claimed that 67 people — whose biographical details he made up — had contributed approximately $222,690 to his Honest Gabe for Congress, according to federal protestors.
In January 2024, Whitley again falsely reported contributions from individuals “whose biographical details he fabricated,” prosecutors said. He did the same in April 2024, falsifying a $100,000 loan to his campaign.
Federal judge hears both sides
In addition to prison time, Whitley’s sentence included a $100 fine, a $100 fee for special assessments and a year of supervised probation following his release.
Sweeney further recommended that Whitley complete substance abuse treatment — citing a positive drug test for marijuana in late January — plus a mental health evaluation and treatment, as well as vocational training.  
In remarks provided during the two-hour hearing, Whitley asked the court for “leniency” and indicated that he has “no intentions of returning to politics.”
“I am embarrassed to be here today,” he said in a prepared statement. “I take full responsibility for my crimes, and I deeply regret the harm caused by my actions.”
“This prosecution has been embarrassing … and I know this will always follow me,” Whitley continued, referring to news articles and social media posts about his case “that future employers can look up” online. 










He deprived the electorate of what they value most — and why these rules exist — and that’s transparency.


– Federal prosecutor Nicole Lockhart


Still, the former candidate pointed a finger at a former employer “that taught me to lie about my filings … but later I learned it was not correct.” Whitley did not name the company when asked by the judge. Whitley’s court-appointed attorney, Gwendolyn Beitz, said the employer’s name was previously provided to the prosecution team.
Whitley repeatedly referenced his autism and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnoses, which he said contribute to his “hot head” and “impulsive tendencies.” 
“I don’t intend to come across the way people look at me,” he added.
But prosecutor Nicole Lockhart maintained that “this was not an impulsive crime.” She said Whitley’s fraudulent filings “happened multiple times, over multiple months, in multiple reports.” 
“He deprived the electorate of what they value most — and why these rules exist — and that’s transparency,” Lockhart said. 
Indiana congressional candidate faces campaign finance scrutiny

She additionally pointed to two recent lawsuits lodged by Whitley, one against the FBI Indianapolis Field Office and the federal agent who investigated the case; and the other against the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana and the U.S. Department of Justice.
The lawsuits, which have since been dismissed, were filed by Whitley after his February plea hearing and alleged that his admissions of guilt had been coerced, and that he was being “maliciously prosecute(s) … without probable cause, motivated by a conflict of interest and political bias.”
Prosecutors said those “incendiary” complaints — along with other lawsuits in Marion County Superior Court — showed that Whitley “has continued to demonstrate an utter lack of respect for the judiciary.” 
In one motion filed in Marion County, for example, Whitley stated that the African American judge presiding over his case, got his “law license from a Cracker Jack box because they don’t give monkeys real law license [sic].” 
U.S. attorneys held that “such conduct from an individual who had pleaded guilty to a criminal offense only several weeks before reflects a lack of seriousness in engaging with the judicial process and suggests that a probationary sentence would be an insufficient deterrent.”
Defending her client, Beitz contended that Whitley’s speech — while detestable — is protected under the First Amendment.
Earlier allegations brought up in court
But a turning point in the hearing appeared to come when Sweeney questioned Whitley directly about campaign finance concerns predating his federal case. The judge specifically cited reporting by The Evansville Courier & Press in 2021 about Whitley’s campaign documents filed during his short-lived Evansville mayoral campaign.
The paper reported Whitley’s fundraising reports filed with the state in 2021 and 2022 raised questions that he may have violated Indiana election law by documenting he raised thousands of dollars in campaign cash from people who denied giving him donations.
Whitley said he hired an unnamed political consulting firm to solicit contributions via email on his behalf. He reported no such expenditures on his 2021 and 2022 campaign finance filings, though.

Sweeney pressed Whitley about earlier suspicions of fraud and asked whether he had filed the false federal reports before or after the state-level allegations surfaced.
Whitley told the judge he was never aware of problems with his campaign filings and emphasized that Indiana’s Election Division dismissed related complaints.
Even so, Sweeney said that was no excuse for later, fraudulent filings during Whitley’s congressional race, and argued that the former candidate “should have been on notice” as far back as 2021.
Complaints alleging Whitley’s excessive federal campaign contributions and fraudulent financial reporting were sent to the Federal Election Commission (FEc) and the Indiana Election Division in February 2024 by Gabrielle Kendall, wife of WIBC radio host Rob Kendall. At the time, Whitley told the Indiana Capital Chronicle the accusations were “absurd.”
When asked by the Capital Chronicle if the contested donors are real, Whitley said “there’s no more comment I’m going to say on that,” Whitley said. “We’ve been in compliance with the FEC. We talked with them. We have a good relationship with them.”
Later, in August 2024, Whitley was arrested in a separate case for alleged online threats and harassment he made against Indianapolis-based political commentator Abdul-Hakim Shabazz. That case is still pending in Marion County Superior Court, with a jury trial scheduled for mid-July.

Nucor, which markets itself as the largest producer and recycler of steel in North America, is hosting Vance on Thursday. During the visit, Vance is expected to promote the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s second term and what the administration is calling a “manufacturing renaissance.”
He will be joined by the Environmental Protection Agency Chief Lee Zeldin.
Trump’s plan for the supposed renaissance has centered around imposing tariffs — taxes paid by the importing company or buyer to the government that issued them, in this case the U.S. The president’s 25% tariffs on foreign steel shipped into the country went into effect last month.
Nucor, which is headquartered in Charlotte and employs some 1,000 people at its Lowcountry plant, did not respond to the SC Daily Gazette’s request for comment. But the company has been a supporter of Trump’s tariffs from the get-go, telling multiple national media outlets the president’s trade policy will bring a revival in American made goods.
“It’s not a free trade, it’s fair-trade and creating a level playing field, I believe these tariffs are going to do that,” Nucor CEO Leon Topalian said during a February CNBC interview.
The company says it currently produces roughly a quarter of all raw steel refined in the U.S.
Meanwhile other industries, such as South Carolina’s multibillion-dollar automobile sector, have worried about the potential negative impact of tariffs.
John McGrath, the recently elected head of the Berkeley County GOP said the visit “highlights the vital role Berkeley County plays in American manufacturing.”
“I’m proud to welcome him and appreciate his focus on the hardworking people who power our local economy,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/VanceConvention-scaled-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-29 19:08:18.492906

This year, Senate Democrats stopped streaming their weekly meetings for logistical reasons, according to leadership. The Senate Republicans have never posted recordings of theirs.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerYou may have noticed, though probably not: the House streams its party caucuses, but the Senate doesn’t.That’s a change this year. What happens in weekly lunch-hour caucus meetings? The parties discuss their priorities for the week and strategize. Sometimes things get feisty, either internally or lashing out across the aisle. Once or twice a session, it can make the news, but mostly, it’s mundane. Why the change? Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast, the majority leader, assured me it’s not that interesting, and she’s heard no complaints about the switch.  “I made the call that, you know, if the press is there, great, they’re welcome to report out what’s said. But the actual burden of video taping, it is a new one,” she said, “and not one that I felt like we had the staff capacity to maintain in a way that was quality.”Last year, Senate Dems streamed weekly from the legislative lounge. Now, they’re stationed in the Pavilion, Room 267.And the Republicans? They’ve never streamed. Minority Leader Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, said he has no intention of changing that. Nor would he share where the GOP meets, except to say it was outside the Statehouse.“If a reporter made a request to attend an off-site meeting, I would relay that request to the caucus,” he said, asking me if I was making such a request. For the moment, my answer was no. I did, though, stroll over to the Dems meeting. Senators walked in lunch in tow, still muttering about this morning’s floor session.The spiciest chatter concerned the $77 million Gov. Phil Scott and many lawmakers want to use to buy down property taxes this year. Some Democrats, including Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, argue a chunk of that money should be saved for the future, else lawmakers create a funding cliff that spikes property tax rates next year. “I just think that we, collectively as a caucus, should have talked about this,” Hardy said of the buy down money and the party’s budget priorities. Those present said that how to use the $77 million remains an open question for the Finance Committee to solve. But Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, cautioned his colleagues about saving money for next year. Doing so, he warned, could make the Senate look like it was raising property taxes more than the House and governor. “It’s not an academic discussion,” he said, “This is very much a live political discussion, and we are in a very weak position if we decide we’re going for higher tax rates.”—Ethan WeinsteinIn the knowThe Senate voted Tuesday to condemn “the manner and circumstances” of the arrest of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist and yearslong Upper Valley resident, by federal immigration agents in Colchester earlier this month.   Senators advanced a resolution about Mahdawi’s arrest on a 24-5 vote, with the “nays” all coming from among the chamber’s 13 Republicans. The measure, S.R.13, also called for Mahdawi — who’s been detained for more than two weeks at Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town — to be “immediately released” as his case proceeds in federal court, adding that he also should “be afforded due process.”The vote comes a day before a hearing is scheduled in Mahdawi’s case when a judge in Burlington could rule on whether the federal government must release him. The Senate resolution is slated for a final vote Wednesday, and is expected to pass. Its lead sponsor, Windsor County Democratic Sen. Becca White, was with Mahdawi in Colchester shortly before he was arrested by masked, armed agents at an appointment for U.S. citizenship.Read more about the floor debate on the Senate measure here.— Shaun RobinsonOn the moveThe House on Tuesday approved an amended version of S.36, a Senate bill that was originally largely focused on addressing increasing the length of stay at residential treatment facilities that the state’s Medicaid program would pay for someone with a co-occuring substance use and mental health disorders. The bill the House passed continues to require that the length of stay covered shall be what is prescribed by a health care provider employed by the residential facility. It also repealed a sunset on when a person deemed incapacitated through intoxication or withdrawal can be kept overnight in a state prison for their own safety. The House version continues with both actions, but also requires additional reporting from the state Department of Health and Mental Health on their efforts to expand the overnight space available outside of prisons — now called “public inebriate” beds. It also changes the term to “persons who are incapacitated.” The amended version now also asks the Agency of Human Services to present proposals by the end of the year for reforming how the Human Services Board — which oversees appeals regarding eligibility for a variety of support programs including, Medicaid and housing and food assistance — operates to ensure consistent and respectful treatment of people who come before it. The amended version will now return to the Senate for its consideration.— Kristen FountainVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: In the Senate, weekly party meetings aren’t posted for all to see.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/kesha-ram-hinsdale-1-20250225.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 19:08:18.492906

The Cornhusker State is the only one that sends inheritance tax revenue exclusively to counties, with much of it used to fund bridges and roads.","State Sen. Robert Clements of Elmwood asks a question during a hearing on Oct. 27, 2023, in Lincoln. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A proposal to decrease Nebraska’s inheritance tax advanced Tuesday with a 27-10 vote. 
Nebraska is just one of six states that still has an inheritance tax. The Cornhusker State is the only one that sends inheritance tax revenue exclusively to counties, with much of it used to fund bridges and roads.
Elmwood State Sen. Robert Clements’ proposal would lower the inheritance tax rate to 1% for children and 3% for distant relatives and non-relatives, but would not eliminate the tax. It would replace lost county revenue by increasing county fees, adding to the costs of motor vehicle inspections and marriage licenses. 
The proposal also would cost the state $3 million a year in projected revenue over the next two fiscal years, as it would increase the county’s share of the state’s insurance premium tax, at a time when the state budget shortfall continues to grow.
Fee increases
It would increase fees on property and asset seizures to cover personal debts, advertising for delinquent properties, a higher tax on renewable energy generation, and it would eliminate some business tax breaks.
Clements said his proposal, Legislative Bill 468, would help attract people to move to Nebraska and make the inheritance tax rate fairer. The Nebraska Association of County Officials, which backs the Clements bill, estimates the proposal could increase county revenues by roughly $8.9 million.
Currently, Nebraska imposes a 1% tax on inheritances exceeding $100,000 for children, parents, and siblings. Higher tax rates are charged to more distant relatives — 11% for aunts and uncles and nieces and nephews after a $40,000 exemption. Non-relatives would have to pay 15% after a $25,000 exemption. 
Nebraska Taxpayers for Freedom and the Nebraska Republican Party testified in support of the bill during its hearing in February, saying it would end the state’s “outlier” status in imposing an inheritance tax and stop wealthy residents from moving away to avoid the tax. 
“Nebraska is losing retirees faster than we are gaining population from other states,” Clements said. “Our inheritance tax contributes to this migration. I believe we can do better as a state in this area and give people more reasons to stay in our state.”
Paying the costs
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln said the debate on the inheritance tax continued the theme of the state “balancing budgets on the backs of everyday hard-working Nebraskans.”
  State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, center. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Lincoln State Sen. Eliot Bostar filed two failed amendments: One would have eliminated the inheritance tax without replacing the revenue, and another would have let counties increase local sales taxes to make up the lost revenue. Bostar said that when he started in the Legislature, he had a misunderstanding about who paid the tax. 
“There are a lot of fairly trivial things that if you have enough resources, you can do in order to avoid paying this tax,” Bostar said. “So that leaves everyone in the middle.” 
Lincoln State Sen. Jane Raybould also had a failed amendment that would have tweaked the tax rates of the new proposal. She emphasized the “unintended consequences.” Lawmakers have expressed concerns in the past that eliminating the inheritance tax could lead to higher property taxes but said Clements’ proposal strikes a “nice balance” of helping replace the lost revenue.  
“I don’t think there’s any perfect way to reimburse, dollar for dollar, the counties for any lost revenues resulting from the changes proposed in the inheritance tax,” Syracuse’s Sen. Bob Hallstrom said. 
Hunting a balanced approach
But Hallstrom praised the Clements proposal’s balance. Lawmakers on both sides of ​​the aisle raised issues about the increase in other fees and taxes to make up for lost county revenue. A few Democratic-aligned lawmakers expressed concerns about the measure’s proposed increase in the nameplate capacity tax on renewable energy sources and its impact on school revenue.
  State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
LB 468 would nearly double the nameplate capacity tax from $3,518 per megawatt of electricity generated to $6,560 per megawatt. 
“I think that I would say it’s pretty hard to be doubling this [Nameplate Capacity] tax to me,” Omaha Sen. Margo Juarez said. 
Some Republican-aligned lawmakers expressed worries over the elimination of some business incentives and the tax exemption for data center equipment. The bill also would do away with tax breaks in the ImagiNE Act for data centers and modernizing large businesses.
Clements said school revenue wouldn’t be negatively affected because of the increase in fees. 
Nebraska’s budget shortfall, at least in part, is due to tax cuts that lawmakers passed in recent years. Throughout the session, lawmakers have proposed scaling back various tax incentive programs, reducing the state’s school retirement contributions by $80 million, and increasing taxes on nicotine pouches. 
Clements said he would propose amendments to address lawmakers’ concerns about where the inheritance tax replacement revenue comes from. He said he wants to eliminate the tax next year. 
“Just because he’s been committed to the issue for many years,” said Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln said of Clements’ proposal, “it doesn’t mean that this proposal results in good policy.”

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)MIAMI — An irritated federal judge said Tuesday that she found it “problematic” and offensive that Florida’s attorney general called illegitimate and unlawful her order temporarily blocking an immigration law that led to the arrest of a U.S. citizen.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams grilled attorneys representing Attorney General James Uthmeier during a hearing here. At issue was an April 23 letter Uthmeier sent to law enforcement declaring that he couldn’t stop them from enforcing a law that makes it a first-degree misdemeanor to illegally enter the state as an “unauthorized alien” and adds heightened penalties for re-entry.
“Do I need to put a ribbon on it?” Williams asked, referring to what more she could do to make her order legitimate.
The temporary restraining order barring the state from enforcing the law was to expire Tuesday, but Williams said she hoped to rule before midnight on whether to extend the suspension for the remainder of the litigation.
‘Surprised and shocked’
The Florida Immigrant Coalition and The Farmworker Association of Florida sued the state over the constitutionality of the law, which Gov. Ron DeSantis signed on Feb. 13, which led to Williams’ emergency block on the law on April 4.
However, law enforcement continued arrests after Williams’ order, with a Florida Highway Patrol trooper arresting Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen born in Georgia, in Leon County on April 16. The 20-year-old stayed in the Leon County Jail for more than 24 hours.
  Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier via his office
“It is my view that no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes your agencies from continuing to enforce Florida’s new illegal entry and reentry laws,” Uthmeier wrote on April 23 to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, FHP, sheriffs, and police officers.
No arrests under the suspended law have taken place since Williams further clarified on April 18 that her order applied to law enforcement, said Jeffrey DeSousa, an attorney for the defendants.
Defendants in the suit, including Uthmeier and Florida’s state attorneys, have taken the position that law enforcement isn’t bound by the judge’s order because they’re not named defendants in the suit.
Before calling the order illegitimate, Uthmeier sent a letter on April 18, at the direction of Williams, to law enforcement stating that they shouldn’t make arrests under the temporarily blocked law.
“Color me surprised and shocked,” Williams said, asking what had happened in the five days between the letters.
DeSousa said the state didn’t view the April 23 letter as an invitation for law enforcement to disobey the order. Williams disagreed.
Social media posts prompt skepticism from judge
But Uthmeier’s actions in two months in office, flexing his power over agencies and local elected officials, could derail the argument that he can’t discipline law enforcement or direct them to do anything. DeSantis appointed Uthemeier, his former chief of staff, as attorney general in February.
Williams called out social media posts from Uthmeier stating that he had directed FDLE and FHP to monitor protests at Tesla dealerships and FDLE and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to execute a search warrant at a Panama City Beach aquarium.
The judge also brought up letters Uthmeier sent threatening with removal from office the Fort Myers City Council and Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer if their municipalities didn’t allow their police to partake in immigration enforcement.
“I don’t see how you can escape all the statements he has made,” Williams said.
Who’s law enforcement listening to?
Aside from discussion regarding Uthmeier’s actions, Williams raised concerns about due process, saying that further arrests under the law would lead to people spending days in jail under charges a prosecutor couldn’t move forward with.
Lopez-Gomez had to remain in jail despite the lack of probable cause for his arrest because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had requested that the jail hold him for 48 hours.
Despite expressing her irritation with Uthmeier, Williams said she wouldn’t make him sit for a deposition, a request plaintiffs’ attorneys said they were considering as the suit goes on.
The same day Uthmeier sent his letter saying he wouldn’t stand in the way of arrests, State Attorney Jack Campbell warned law enforcement to follow Williams’ order.
“This is not optional, and the Court has the ability to hold each of us in contempt for not following her direction,” Campbell, of Florida’s 2nd Judicial District, wrote.
Additionally, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, a member of the State Immigration Enforcement Council established earlier this year, said he and his deputies would listen only to the judge.
“I don’t think it changes anything,” Gualtieri said of Uthmeier’s first letter during a phone interview with Florida Phoenix. “We take our direction on something like that from the judge, not from anybody else.”
The parties agreed to meet again on May 29.

‘You just can’t walk up to people with brown skin and say give me your papers,’ a federal judge told Border Patrol attorneys at a hearing challenging recent immigration sweeps. 


A federal court on Tuesday issued a preliminary injunction forbidding the Border Patrol from conducting warrantless immigration stops throughout a wide swath of California. 
The ruling came in response to an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit filed after the El Centro Border Patrol traveled to Kern County to conduct a three-day sweep in January, detaining day laborers, farm workers and others in a Home Depot parking lot, outside a convenience store and along a highway between orchards.  
The ruling prohibits Border Patrol agents from taking similar actions, restricting them from stopping people unless they have a reasonable suspicion that the person is in violation of U.S. immigration law. It also bars agents from carrying out warrantless arrests unless they have probable cause that the person is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. 
“You just can’t walk up to people with brown skin and say, ‘Give me your papers,’” said U.S. District Court Judge Jennifer L. Thurston said during a Monday hearing in Fresno that featured moments of heated exchange between government attorneys and the judge.
The ACLU filed suit on behalf of United Farm Workers, arguing that the stops violated the Fourth Amendment. The judge has not decided on the totality of the case, but on Tuesday granted the ACLU’s motion to stop the Border Patrol from conducting similar operations while the case moved through the courts. 
“I think that it’s pretty clear that half of a century of really established law is being upheld. It’s unfortunate that this is a cause for celebration. It’s not legal to snatch people off the street for looking like farm workers or day laborers,” said Elizabeth Strater, vice president of United Farm Workers. 
California Attorney General Rob Bonta agreed. “That’s existing law, and the judge’s order reflects existing law.” 
“You can’t just indiscriminately stop people and search them without any appropriate reasonable suspicion or probable cause or without a warrant,” Bonta said at a news conference in San Diego on Monday about conditions in ICE detention. “So, it sounds like the judge had seen enough and wanted to issue an order. “
The injunction is in effect in the jurisdiction of California’s Eastern District, which spans the Central Valley from Redding to Bakersfield. 
After the January sweep, the man who led it, Chief Patrol Agent Gregory Bovino, said his agents specifically targeted people with criminal and immigration histories. However, a CalMatters investigation revealed that the Border Patrol had no criminal or immigration history on 77 of the 78 people it arrested.


The court also ordered the Border Patrol to document every stop and provide reports within 60 days. During oral arguments on Monday, the government attorney said doing so would be burdensome to Border Patrol agents. Judge Thurston rebuked the government, saying: “They have to make a report for every arrest, not sure what the burden is.” 
According to sworn declarations filed in court by those detained, Border Patrol agents slashed tires, yanked people out of trucks, threw people to the ground, and called farmworkers “Mexican bitches.”
Border Patrol attorneys characterized those examples as actions of individual agents, and not reflective of a policy from the agency. 
Thurston disagreed. “The evidence is that this was wide scale” and not limited to individual agents, she said.
Border Patrol agents receive new training
Border Patrol attorneys didn’t offer evidence of their own to dispute the evidence presented by the ACLU, including stopping people based on their race and warrantless arrests. They tried to persuade Thurston that the order would not be necessary because the agency is already taking steps to retrain its officers. In a previous court filing, government attorneys said Border Patrol had issued guidance to retrain the El Center sector’s 900 agents on the Fourth Amendment in order to prevent warrantless arrests. 
At Monday’s hearing, Thurston questioned why guidance would even be necessary since agents are trained on the Fourth Amendment in the academy. 
Government attorneys told the judge 270 agents have received the training. Thurston asked for details on how the training was being carried out. “Shift by shift?” she said. But government attorneys said they did not know. 
The packed courtroom was contentious at times. U.S. Department of Justice attorney Olga Y. Kuchins argued that the Border Patrol’s sweep in Kern County, known as “Operation Return to Sender” wasn’t standard policy. “This two-day operation does not a policy make,” she said. 
Thurston asked how many days were needed for an operation to be taken as policy, and on what authority the government was relying on to establish this operation could not be interpreted as part of Border Patrol policy. 
“Do you know of that authority?” Thurston said.
“I don’t know of that authority,” Kuchins said. 
The injunction also compels the El Centro Sector to provide proof within 90 days, and every 30 days thereafter, that agents involved in these operations have been trained on these rules. 
“This ruling is a powerful recognition that what happened in Kern County and surrounding area in January was illegal,” said Bree Bernwanger, ACLU senior staff attorney. 
She called it a “powerful reminder that law enforcement agents – including immigration – cannot stop you, detain you because of the color of your skin.”
Another immigration sweep
Even after government attorneys pledged to retrain agents on the Constitution, El Centro sector traveled more than 200 miles north to Pomona last week and rounded up day laborers outside a Home Depot, an action reminiscent of the Kern County raid. 
Witnesses say federal agents arrived in unmarked vehicles around 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, and quickly surrounded the Home Depot parking lot on South Towne Avenue. 
“When they saw that a critical mass was gathered, they executed the raid,” said Alexis Teodoro, a Worker Rights Director with the Pomona Economic Opportunity Center. 
According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, agents arrested 10 and placed them into removal proceedings. No other agencies were involved, said Michael Scappechio, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Advocates are adamant that more than 20 people were initially taken into custody, based on piecing together the accounts of different witnesses about what happened. 
Federal officials defended their actions, saying agents were initially targeting a single individual with an active arrest warrant. During the operation, nine other people were also taken into custody. Some of those detained had prior charges, including child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon, immigration violations, and DUI, said Hilton Beckham, the assistant commissioner for CBP’s office of public affairs.
Jesus Domingo Ross, 38, was standing on a street corner near the Home Depot in Pomona last week when, he said, agents appeared from all sides, grabbed him and threw him to the ground. 
“I panicked,” he said, describing the moment he realized he was in custody of U.S. immigration authorities. “Just with everything you’re seeing on the news right now, I really panicked because we didn’t know what was going to happen.” 
He spoke to CalMatters on Saturday night during visiting hours at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico, where he is now being held. 
“I’m trying to keep my confidence in God to carry me through this,” he said quietly.

(Photo provided by Humanities North Dakota)Humanities North Dakota has received $300,000 in private donations to keep its doors open after it learned earlier this month all its federal funding had been terminated.
That figure includes $200,000 from the New York-based Mellon Foundation, which on Tuesday pledged $15 million to a total of 56 humanities councils around the country. The other $100,000 came from other donors, according to Executive Director Brenna Gerhardt.
The money will help keep the organization afloat after its grant money was abruptly pulled by the federal government. But it only replaces a portion of the cut funding.
“The Mellon Foundation’s support is both a lifeline and a vote of confidence,” Gerhardt said in a Tuesday statement announcing the award.
In addition, Humanities North Dakota can receive up to $50,000 in matching funds from the Mellon Foundation with the help of local donors. The Mellon Foundation will double any contributions to Humanities North Dakota made after Tuesday. Donations can be made on the Humanities North Dakota website.
“At stake are both the operational integrity of organizations like museums, libraries, historical societies in every single state, as well as the mechanisms to participate in the cultural dynamism and exchange that is a fundamental part of American civic life,” Elizabeth Alexander, the Mellon Foundation’s president, said in a Tuesday announcement. 
Alexander said that even though the donation won’t cover all of the lost funding, she hopes the money will help councils get by.
Humanities North Dakota in limbo after loss of federal funding

Humanities North Dakota, which provides public education in areas including history, civics and the arts, has historically relied on funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities to cover operational costs. 
The nonprofit on April 2 received a letter from the federal agency that stated a $900,000 grant it received for the 2025 fiscal year had been terminated. Humanities North Dakota, which has four full-time and two part-time staff, had yet to spend more than $600,000 of the grant.
The National Endowment for the Humanities, which provides funding to humanities organizations across the country, is “repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda,” Acting Chairman Michael McDonald wrote in the letter.
The letter cites a Feb. 19 executive order by President Donald Trump which the White House says will streamline federal bureaucracy.
A total of $65 million in grant money awarded to 56 humanities councils serving U.S. states, territories and Washington, D.C., was terminated. 
In response to the funding cuts, Humanities North Dakota is launching a new initiative to share online programming with other humanities councils, Gerhardt said.
Called “The Study,” the effort is intended to help out councils that don’t have the funding to continue providing programming without the federal money. 
Humanities councils that join The Study will get access to livestreamed programs, a repository of recorded events and other content.

Humanities North Dakota is in a unique position to help other councils since it’s consistently held events online since the coronavirus pandemic, said Gerhardt.
“We’re the only one with the infrastructure to pivot this quickly,” she said. The hope is that North Dakota and other states begin collaborating and pooling resources so all Americans have access to humanities programming, she added.
Five other states have already joined the initiative — Washington, Iowa, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Montana, according to Gerhardt.
Humanities North Dakota will still provide the same programs moving forward, though the current plan is to cut the number of events by about half, Gerhardt said. The nonprofit’s programs, which include online classes, book talks, lectures and more, reached an estimated 24,000 people last year.
Congress created the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1965 and appropriates money for grants to humanities councils across the U.S.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A New Jersey state prison that houses young men had expired fire extinguishers, caked-on grime in the showers, and filthy, understaffed kitchens where water riddled with garbage and food scraps pooled on the floor, according to a new report a state watchdog released Tuesday.
State Corrections Ombudsperson Terry Schuster and his staff also found that most of those incarcerated at the Garden State Youth Correctional Facility in Burlington County had no pillows and were double-bunked in cells designed for single occupancy.
Many reported they lived without essential items like a towel, bedding, or change of clothes and sometimes encountered rodents and insects. Incarcerated people did not receive drinks with lunch or dinner during sultry summer months when temperatures on housing units sometimes topped 90 degrees, inspectors found.

Staff from the ombudsperson’s office, who inspect state prisons and advocate for improvements, visited the Garden State Youth facility several times between last July and March, interviewed staff and people incarcerated there, and reviewed records to draft the report released Tuesday.
The prison, which opened in 1967, houses more than 1,000 young men generally in their early 20s and most of whom are serving short sentences of a few years. Many were not engaged in meaningful work, rehabilitative programs, or school, inspectors found.
Schuster and his staff reported that Department of Corrections officials have since fixed some of the problems they brought to the state’s attention in the report, including replacing the fire extinguishers, ordering 1,200 pillows, improving shower ventilation, cleaning kitchens, and serving juice with meals. A larger capital construction project to renovate kitchen space was funded, with planning now underway.
“The Office would like to add to the chorus of voices calling for additional capital improvement funds to repair, replace, and maintain the infrastructure at Garden State Youth Correctional Facility, and applauds the Department for continuing to seek the funding it needs to provide a habitable and structurally sound facility,” the report says.
Schuster and his staff made several recommendations for further improvements, calling on the department to develop a strategic plan to limit double-bunking in small cells, regularly inventory cells for their maintenance needs and missing essential items, routinely audit food services, and establish incentives to increase work and school participation.
A Department of Corrections spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

(Courtesy of the Library of Congress)Montanans are still liable for damages they cause during a duel, at least as far as the state’s archaic legal code goes.
Of course, the actual act of standing at 10 paces and killing someone, even if mutually consensual, remains a criminal offense.
But the Montana Senate on Friday voted down a bill that sought to remove a statute requiring an individual to “provide for the maintenance of the spouse and minor children” of their opponent, and pay all of their debts.
House Bill 247, brought by Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, was billed as a simple code cleanup bill requested by the lieutenant governor’s office. 
In the first hearing on the legislation in January, Lt. Gov. Kristen Juras said that due to the illegality of killing another individual, the 1895 statute needed to be removed because “it implies that dueling is legal. It is not.”
The bill passed the House, 84-16.
But the Senate had a different view, with several senators taking great pleasure in the idea of keeping hypothetical duels in Montana statute. 
“Dueling is not specifically illegal in Montana. It’s against public policy because it’s against public policy to kill people,” Sen Andrea Olsen, D-Missoula, said on the Senate Floor. “…I do think if you’re willing to kill somebody over an issue, you should be willing to die over it. And I even think it’s a great thing if you’re willing to compensate the family for the damages you’ve caused. That’s what this statue is, it’s the remedies for dueling.”
Olsen said that the only reason given in committee for removing the statute was that it was considered “code clutter.”
“This is at least code clutter that brings a smile to everybody’s face. It actually hearkens back to the past in a way that is very interesting,” she had said during committee. 
Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, said the statute was one that gave him peace of mind. 
Laying out a scenario where in order to defend his honor, he challenged Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, to a duel, Zolnikov said he would likely lose that fight. 
But, “he’s now responsible for making sure my child and spouse are taken care of. And I like that in law,” Zolnikov said. 
Hertz said it would “be my honor,” to take care of the remaining Zolnikovs, if he won such a duel.
Before the Senate voted down the bill, 16-34, Sen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell, reminded his colleagues that anybody challenged in a duel has the right to designate the weapons and conditions of the face-off. 
“I suggest they do as Abraham Lincoln did,” Fuller said. “Cow pies at 10 paces.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duel-etching.jpg,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, listens during the governor's State of the State Address in the House chamber of the state Capitol on Feb. 3. (Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — House lawmakers overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would have required schools to add an extra instructional day for every $25 million more the Legislature appropriates to common education.
Supporters of Senate Bill 409 said that having students in the classroom for an extra day would help improve lagging student outcomes by providing additional face-to-face instruction time, and give taxpayers and lawmakers something concrete to show for their extra investment. 
A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers panned the idea, questioning how much benefit an extra instructional day would provide relative to its cost. They also questioned how far a $25 million investment would go amid soaring costs related to maintaining school property, inflation and the growing list of unfunded legislative mandates. 
Rep. Danny Sterling, R-Tecumseh, said requiring schools to add an additional day solely because they received a level of new funding does “nothing but make a mockery of the public education system.” 
He said lawmakers would be wasting taxpayer money on a strategy that has no valid data indicating it will produce benefits.
Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, the House author of the measure, said lawmakers in the past four years have put more money into Oklahoma schools than ever before, but outcomes have not kept up. In fact, he said, they’ve gotten worse.
He said he hopes something like this will reverse the trend.
“If our teachers spending more time in front of our students isn’t helpful, isn’t impactful for the outcomes in their education, then man, we’ve got to have some other conversations because something must be wrong with the system somewhere,” he said.
Caldwell said most data will show that probably the single greatest determining factor in a child’s education is a quality teacher.
“So it just stands to my simple brain that if we give that teacher another day or two or five or 10, that’s going to be better for the child,” he said. “And when the senator, (Adam Pugh, R-Edmond), asked me to run this bill, I just never thought that I’m going to have to really fight to say teachers in front of our kids for an additional day that that’s actually a good thing. I felt like that was pretty universal.”
He said one extra day isn’t going to “drastically change the trajectory” of poor academic outcomes, but maybe it will get the state a step closer.
“We get asked every single year to invest more money in our schools, simply just giving it there and hoping that we get something out of it hasn’t seemed to be working,” he said.
Caldwell said taxpayers have a right to expect a return on their investment.
Rep. Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City, said the concern is that one extra day isn’t going to move the needle and spending legislative time fighting over adding a single day is distracting from bigger priorities.
“We could be spending today on curriculum,” he said. “We could be spending today on reining in the state superintendent, but we’re instead spending it on this one piece of legislation that might add an extra day and cost extra money.
Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, said he’s concerned about the impact of inflation and the growth of expenses on schools. He said property and casualty insurance is increasing in cost. Student enrollment is growing as are the number of programs and tests lawmakers are asking districts to implement.
“What does this bill do about those kinds of increases in expenses that might eat up to $25 million?” he asked.
House lawmakers voted 22-63 to reject the bill.

According to the state's top education official, some Mass. schools have reported ""extended absences"" for students as a result of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement.
The post Tutwiler: Immigration chill leading to “extended absences” appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","SOME MASSACHUSETTS schools have reported “extended absences” for students as a result of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement, according to the state’s top education official.Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler on Tuesday devoted a portion of his regular report to the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education to recent clashes between Massachusetts elected officials and the federal government, including on K-12 school funding.Although he did not offer specific data about a rise in students missing school, Tutwiler said some areas have seen a rise in absences amid reported concerns about immigration crackdowns.“Federal actions around immigration are also a concern for many of our school communities, in some cases, resulting in extended absences for students,” he said. “We are working with the attorney general’s office and the state Office for Refugees and Immigrants to keep districts updated on policy changes that can impact immigrant status.”Some districts, like Lynn, reported significant increases in student absences early in President Donald Trump’s second term, according to CBS News. Sen. Brendan Crighton of Lynn spoke Monday about a Lynn high school student who was detained by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and moved to Maine in January. Though the student was released, Crighton said fear of a similar situation exists throughout the city’s schools.Tutwiler also recounted the Trump administration’s move to rescind $106 million in federal funding from K-12 schools in Massachusetts, which Attorney General Andrea Campbell challenged in a lawsuit alongside more than a dozen other states.Campbell joined another case last week over the U.S. Department of Education’s threat to withhold dollars from state and local agencies over diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in schools.“We continue to push back against harmful federal funding cuts and policy changes that threaten the stability of our local school districts and well-being of our students and educators and here in Massachusetts,” Tutwiler said. “We’ve said this before: We’ll stay true to our department’s educational vision of all students being known, valued and having the support that they need to succeed.”The post Tutwiler: Immigration chill leading to “extended absences” appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tutwiler.webp?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

Becca White, D-Windsor, right, on Tuesday, April 15. Photo by Shaun Robinson/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — The Vermont Senate voted Tuesday to condemn “the manner and circumstances” of the arrest of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist and yearslong Upper Valley resident, by federal immigration agents in Colchester earlier this month.   Senators advanced a resolution about Mahdawi’s arrest on a 24-5 vote, with the “nays” all coming from among the chamber’s 13 Republicans. The measure, S.R.13, also called for Mahdawi — who’s been detained for more than two weeks at Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town — to be “immediately released” as his case proceeds in federal court, adding that he also should “be afforded due process.”The vote comes a day before a hearing is scheduled in Mahdawi’s case when a judge in Burlington could rule on whether the federal government must release him. The Senate resolution is slated for a final vote Wednesday, and is expected to pass. Its lead sponsor, Windsor County Democratic Sen. Becca White, was with Mahdawi in Colchester shortly before he was arrested by masked, armed agents at an appointment for U.S. citizenship.“This is an issue about which the Vermont Senate has a direct tie,” said the chamber’s President Pro Tempore, Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, on the floor. “We have a witness,” Baruth continued, who “has helped us to see the urgency of this moment.” The Vermont House approved a similar statement criticizing Mahdawi’s detention last week. That measure, H.R.8, passed on a voice vote, so individual members’ decisions aren’t on the record — though a number of “nays” were audible around the chamber.Attorneys for the Columbia University student, who is a lawful U.S. resident, argued last week in court that the federal government illegally targeted him for his pro-Palestinian speech at campus protests and that he shouldn’t have been detained. President Donald Trump’s administration, meanwhile, has said that Mahdawi should be removed from the country because his presence “would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest,” according to court filings.READ MORE

Several Vermont senators who voted against the resolution Tuesday made remarks on the floor opposing it. Sen. David Weeks, R-Rutland, said he had spoken with a “law enforcement specialist” who reviewed the details of Mahdawi’s arrest, and Weeks thinks that, while “absolutely unusual,” it was “in keeping with law enforcement procedures.”Baruth responded on the floor that while he understood there are situations where police operate with anonymity, he thinks Mahdawi’s detention deserves to be called out because it’s part of a larger pattern of similar arrests of students in recent weeks.Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex, then told his colleagues he did not “think that there was much to talk about” regarding whether Mahdawi’s arrest was carried out lawfully, considering also, he said, “the amount of illegal immigration that was perpetrated by the previous administration,” referring to former President Joe Biden.In addition to Ingalls and Weeks, Sen. Terry Williams, also a Rutland Republican; Sen. Steve Heffernan, R-Addison; and Sen. Robert Norris, R-Franklin, voted against the measure. Sen. Larry Hart, R-Orange, wasn’t on the Senate floor for the vote.During Mahdawi’s appointment earlier this month, which was at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Colchester, the student affirmed his commitment to “defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign, and domestic,” according to court filings submitted by his attorneys.But afterward, an immigration official told Mahdawi he needed to “‘check’ on some information,” and “ICE agents, masked and visibly armed, entered the interview room and shackled” Mahdawi, court filings state.The federal officers ushered Mahdawi into a vehicle and attempted to get him on a plane en route to Louisiana, his lawyers have said. But Mahdawi’s attorneys quickly filed a lawsuit, and a judge issued a temporary order to keep him in Vermont.Mahdawi, who grew up in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, told NPR in an interview the outlet published Tuesday that he arrived at the appointment thinking it would be his final step to becoming a citizen after spending 10 years in the U.S.“I am centered internally. I am at peace,” he told the outlet, speaking at the prison in St. Albans Town. “While I still know deeply that this is a level of injustice that I am facing, I have faith. I have faith that justice will prevail.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Senate votes to condemn Mohsen Mahdawi’s arrest by immigration agents.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/baruth-hinsdale-white-senate-immigration-ICE-MOU-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

(Courtesy of the Utah Senate)Utah state leaders are taking the next steps in their efforts to make Utah a major nuclear energy development hub and a “national leader” in developing next-generation energy technology, reaching beyond state lines to do it.
It starts with Utah signing two memorandums of understanding with Idaho and Wyoming as part of a strategy to fire up innovation and collaboration in the region.
As part of Gov. Spencer Cox’s “Built Here: Nuclear Energy Summit,” which his office said brought together leaders from across the nuclear energy industry on Tuesday, Cox joined Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon in signing an MOU that calls for the three states to work together coordinating nuclear infrastructure, accelerating nuclear development, and advocating for “commonsense federal policies.”
“The West will lead the next chapter of energy abundance and American prosperity,” Cox said in a statement announcing the alliance. “Today, we brought together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to chart the course for nuclear energy. Our new compact strengthens our shared commitment to aggressively pursue more affordable, reliable energy across state lines.”
According to Cox’s office, the states agreed in the MOU to collaborate on:

Aligning energy policies to support innovation and private investment.
Coordinating the development of critical energy infrastructure.
Jointly navigating regulatory and environmental challenges.
Advocating for federal support of regional energy priorities.
Enhancing energy resilience and grid reliability.
Expanding workforce development efforts to support the growing energy sector.
Ensuring continued delivery of affordable energy to residents. 

The tri-state agreement comes the day after Utah officials and the Idaho National Laboratory — one of 17 national labs in the U.S. Department of Energy complex that’s focused on nuclear research — signed a memorandum of understanding Monday evening after ceremoniously signing a slate of energy bills Utah lawmakers passed earlier this year. 
The MOU between Utah leaders and the Idaho National Laboratory establishes a “formal, long-term collaboration on advanced energy research, workforce development and technology deployment — particularly on nuclear innovation,” according to the governor’s office. 
“This partnership will accelerate Utah’s efforts to become the nation’s nuclear hub,” Gov. Spencer Cox said in a prepared statement issued Monday evening. “By linking our universities, labs, and industry partners with the expertise of Idaho National Laboratory, we are strengthening our ability to serve Utahns with reliable and affordable energy.”
Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner, who signed the MOU, said he and other lab officials are “excited to partner with Utah to address urgent energy needs by focusing on advanced nuclear and energy innovation.” 
Glowing pains: Developing nuclear power could cost Utah tens of billions

“This partnership establishes a cooperative framework for scientific, technological and workforce development to help Utah realize an abundant, secure, resilient and competitive energy future,” he said. 
The MOU, according to the governor’s office, creates a “structural, interdisciplinary alliance” between Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory. It envisions Utah as establishing a new institute called the Advanced Nuclear Energy Institute as a “key coordinating hub” between the Idaho National Laboratory, Utah’s system of higher education, the Utah Office of Energy Development, and the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab. 
“By linking the capabilities of INL with the talent and resources of Utah’s higher education institutions, this partnership positions Utah as a national leader in developing the next generation of clean, secure and resilient energy technologies,” the governor’s office said in Monday’s news release. 
This new institute, state officials say, will enable Utah’s universities to collaborate with other organizations to pursue federal research grants. 
“Beyond academic research, the focus is on applied innovation — ensuring resources are used effectively to develop commercially viable, scalable technologies,” the governor’s office said. “This approach will accelerate the deployment of real-world energy solutions and help build a broader, more robust nuclear energy ecosystem in Utah and the surrounding region.”
With more local input, Legislature signs on to the beginning of Utah’s nuclear future

Through the MOU, state leaders say Utah and the Idaho National Laboratory will work together to: 

Accelerate development of “next-generation” nuclear technologies.
Enhance scientific research in energy sectors.
Strengthen cybersecurity and physical security for energy infrastructure.
Build up the workforce needed to meet demands of a future energy economy.

The Utah Legislature’s top Republican leaders both applauded the move as crucial for Utah’s future. 
“Affordable, reliable energy is the driving force behind Utah’s prosperity — powering everything from the lights in Utahns homes to the unstoppable growth of the state’s vibrant economy,” Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said in a prepared statement. “As energy demands increase and technologies rapidly evolve, we as a state are committed to staying ahead of the curve through strategic partnership that ensures both innovation and stability.”
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said Utah “is leading the way with smart, strategic investments in our energy future.” 
“This partnership drives innovation and keeps energy reliable and affordable for Utah families and businesses,” Schultz said. “It’s about long-term solutions that protect our economy and strengthen our position as a national energy leader.”

According to the complaint, “at the behest of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency,” AmeriCorps leadership placed all members serving in the National Civilian Community Corps on leave and told them their participation in the program would end on April 30; placed 85% of its staff on administrative leave and subsequently sent them reduction in force notices. Leadership then began notifying State Service Commissions, which distribute AmeriCorps grants, that $400 million worth of AmeriCorps programs were immediately terminated.
“AmeriCorps is a vital public service program in our country, and its sudden dismantling is not only reckless—it’s unlawful,” Torrez said in a statement. “Here in New Mexico, these cuts will hurt students, families, and underserved communities who rely on AmeriCorps-supported programs for education, housing, and critical community services. I’m proud to stand with my colleagues to defend this agency and protect the federal commitment to service, equity, and local resilience.”
According to a news release, New Mexico on April 25 received notice from the federal government of termination of its AmeriCorps grant programs, which support volunteer and service effort. The more than $2 million in AmeriCorps grants will impact a variety of programs in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Taos and Ruidoso, as well as programs serving rural, tribal and underserved populations across the state. The funding went to programs that include: “culturally responsive education, after-school and youth mentoring programs, special education services, teacher preparation, environmental conservation, and housing and support for at-risk and homeless youth.”
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), described as the first AmeriCorps member to serve in the U.S. Senate, said in a statement that AmeriCorps participants “do critical work in New Mexico, connecting veterans to services, helping fight the opioid epidemic, helping older adults age with dignity, and rebuilding communities after disasters. I will not stand idly by as Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and DOGE dismantle these programs in order to line the pockets of billionaires.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)The head of Maine’s child welfare agency shared a small but significant milestone with lawmakers on Tuesday: Over April school vacation last week, no child in state custody stayed in hotels or hospital emergency departments.
“I’m hopeful we are seeing some baby steps toward less children and less time being spent in hotels,” said Bobbi Johnson, director of the Office of Child and Family Services, told members of the Health and Human Services Committee during a briefing Tuesday.
Children in custody are placed in hotels and hospitals for a variety of reasons, including if the department is unable to place them with a resource family. The practice puts a significant strain on children and frontline workers, who have to work additional hours to supervise them in those settings.
Although the school vacation week was a bright spot, there were four children back in hotels or emergency departments as of Monday, Johnson said. 
As the agency continues to implement policy changes and recommendations to improve the system that was under scrutiny by the legislative watchdog last session, Johnson updated lawmakers on staff vacancies, another ongoing challenge for the department, in particular in the Lewiston office.
Two of the children back in hotels are based in the agency’s Lewiston district, which has seen particular difficulty with staff retention recently, Johnson said. 
Of the 56 caseworker vacancies across the state, 27 of them are in the Lewiston office, Johnson said. She noted that children in this district have been staying in those alternative settings for extended periods of time, putting even more strain on the limited staff.
As of March, the agency had almost 200 people approved to be “community sitters,” who are able to supervise the children at hotels and emergency departments in place of caseworkers. Johnson said those individuals covered more than 1,500 shifts last year for a total of 6,275 hours. Comparatively, OCFS staff covered more than 6,200 shifts totaling nearly 25,000 hours. 
Staff have told the agency that the workload and overtime required to supervise children in those settings are the biggest factors in the high turnover in the Lewiston district. While vacancies in that district had gone down, Johnson said they are trending up again. She attributed this to a variety of factors, but noted that the district has the highest number of kids in care. 
Since the Lewiston district covers a large geographic area in central Maine, Johnson said the agency is opening an office in the Farmington area with the hope of attracting new case worker candidates. Those positions have been posted, she said. 
Johnson also said the agency has been meeting with resource parents and other stakeholders about short-term homes and other potential supports for the children who would otherwise be housed in alternative settings. She described the first meeting, which was held in the Downeast region, as hopeful and optimistic. The next meeting is scheduled to take place in the Lewiston district. 
Johnson also said the agency is working on a strategic plan to incorporate the suggestions from the lawmakers with state and federal goals that is expected to be complete in the coming months. 
During the presentation, lawmakers also raised the issue of potential cuts in the next federal budget impacting Maine’s child welfare agency.
Rep. Michele Meyer (D-Eliot), who co-chairs the committee, said the potential for “deeply devastating” funding cuts from the federal government to social safety net programs and domestic violence resource centers weighs heavily on her. She said such reductions could have real impacts on the safety and wellbeing of children in Maine. 
Johnson said she’s communicated with the Maine Child Welfare Action Network about how to collaborate and be proactive if those cuts come to fruition.

Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) speaks at the Michigan Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on PreK-12. April 29, 2025 | ScreenshotMichigan Senate Democrats put forward a more than $1 billion funding increase for the state’s public schools Tuesday, with an emphasis on lowering elementary schools’ class sizes.
The plan, introduced by state Sen. Darrin Camilleri , would raise per-pupil funding by $400, from $9,608 to $10,008, with districts required to use 50% of that increase to boost teacher pay. It would also include $2.5 billion in investments for student mental health, a continuation of the program providing free breakfast and lunch for every Michigan public school student, and upgrades for school building infrastructure, including “clean and functional” HVAC systems. 
Camilleri, a former teacher and chair of the Senate PreK-12 Appropriations Subcommittee, said the budget proposal reflects their responsibility to provide students with a safe and supportive high-quality education.
“By investing in mental health resources, modernizing our school facilities, and helping students focus in school through free school meals, we are setting up every child for success. We’re also making critical investments to ensure teachers are paid fairly and classrooms remain small, so that every student gets the attention and support they need to thrive,” Camilleri (D-Trenton) said in a press release.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The plan would increase the School Aid Fund budget by 5%, from the nearly $20.8 billion in Fiscal Year 2025, which ends on Sept. 30, to just over $21.8 billion for the FY26 budget. 
Among the new provisions is $400 million for districts to reduce class sizes in kindergarten through third grade classrooms, which would be paired with a $65 million competitive grant program to do the same.
The budget proposal passed the appropriations subcommittee Tuesday on a party-line 6-1 vote, with majority Democrats in favor. The lone no vote was from the only Republican present, Sen. Thomas Albert who asked why $232 million in incentives for implementation of best practices at low performing schools that had been proposed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in her executive budget recommendation was missing from this plan.
“I actually took that as a positive step to trying to right some of the ways we’ve been approaching education in the state,” Albert (R-Lowell) said.
Camilleri said Democrats remained open to that in budget negotiations, but they believe there is a greater priority for those funds to assist at-risk students.
“We know that many of these school districts that do need additional supports, they need it because they’re dealing with high concentrations of poverty for their student population,” Camilleri responded. “And so investing an additional $258 million in those programs gives school districts the flexibility that they need to lower class sizes, to pay teachers better, and to hopefully invest in those interventions with at-risk funding that we do think can fix some of these systemic educational challenges that our kids face.”
That focus was cheered by Peter Spadafore, executive director of the Michigan Alliance for Student Opportunity, which called the Senate education budget proposal a “significant step forward” in serving at-risk students.
“We are especially encouraged by the proposed 25% increase in the Opportunity Index, which would direct an additional $250 million to schools serving students with the greatest needs. Building upon previous investments, this targeted support will help ensure more equitable opportunities for students across Michigan,” Spadafore said.
The Senate education budget plan sets up a confrontation with the GOP-controlled state House, which has proposed a road funding plan removing the 6% sales tax on gas and instead increasing the motor fuel tax by 20 cents which would be wholly dedicated to funding road upkeep. Currently the motor fuel tax is 31 cents per gallon.
Because more than $700 million a year derived from the gas sales tax goes to the School Aid Fund, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) proposed to replace that lost revenue from the state’s general fund, an idea House Minority Leader Rep. Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) likened to “robbing Peter to pay Paul.”
While Democrats hope to have a state budget plan for schools in place by July 1, which is the start of the fiscal year for most school districts, House Republicans have already passed a $20 billion stopgap spending plan to maintain government services in the event of a government shutdown. That would occur if a state budget is not in place by Oct. 1, the start of the state’s fiscal year.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-29-173224-1024x509.png,,,2025-04-29 18:11:29.530364

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Meet Grace and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Democrats are slamming policy proposals the Trump administration is reportedly considering that aim to raise birth rates in the United States and encourage women to have children, arguing they should instead enact paid leave and expand the current child tax credit to better support mothers and families.
The debates over family policy come as congressional Republicans hammer out a tax and spending cut bill that could significantly reduce funding for policies and programs focused on supporting women and families.
On Tuesday, the House Democratic Women’s Caucus sent a letter to Trump, shared first with The 19th, expressing their “outrage” that the White House is weighing policy proposals to raise birth rates while implementing sweeping cuts to federal employees and programs that focus on researching fertility and maternal health.
“We write not only as lawmakers, but also as women and mothers who have lived these struggles,” said the letter, signed by Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández of New Mexico, the caucus’ chair, and 38 other House Democratic women lawmakers.
“Many of us have raised children while working full-time, struggled to find and afford child care, navigated high-risk pregnancies, and fought for paid leave and affordable health care,” the letter said. “If you are serious about supporting women and families, we urge you to rescind these proposals and invest in policies that actually meet the needs of women and working families.”
The New York Times reported last week that White House aides have fielded proposals aimed at increasing birth rates and encouraging women to have children. They’ve included reserving a portion of government-sponsored academic scholarships like the Fulbright, which is already selective, for married people and parents; giving a $5,000 “baby bonus” to new mothers; and allocating more government funding for menstrual cycle education and classes. In their letter, the Democratic Women’s Caucus members said “the reported proposals are not only ineffective and out of step with reality, but they also fail to seriously address the challenges of motherhood.”
Social conservatives and Trump have been engaged in a long-standing, if transactional, alliance to limit abortion and promote an ideal of a heterosexual nuclear family. In Trump’s first campaign for the presidency, he promised to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who would vote to end a federal right to abortion.
After the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision in 2022, ending federal abortion rights and sending decisions about it to the states, social conservative activists have turned their focus to limiting the availability of medication abortion and increasing birth rates.
Trump has called himself “the fertilization president” and pledged to make in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment more affordable on the campaign trail, despite some anti-abortion groups’ opposition to IVF. So-called pronatalists, who believe that falling birth rates pose an existential threat to American society, have gotten the ear of the White House. One of the most visible pronatalists is billionaire Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and someone who has fathered over a dozen children and is also a prominent Trump ally.
Trump has told reporters that he thought the baby bonus, which would have to be funded by an act of Congress, was “a good idea.” But Democrats and family policy advocates have panned the proposal as insufficient to support families given the high costs of raising a child.
Republicans also generally oppose increasing spending on social programs. The United States remains one of the only wealthy nations without universal paid leave, and many parents struggle to afford child care. Republicans’ sprawling tax and spending cut agenda could bring cuts to programs including Medicaid, federal food assistance and Head Start, which provides early education services to low-income children. It’s unclear whether the bill will permanently increase the current child tax credit, which was temporarily expanded during the pandemic and has bipartisan support.
“It is estimated parents spend over $20,000 in the first year of a baby’s life,” the letter said. “A $5,000 baby bonus could help families—but mothers deserve support to care for their families, not pressure to grow them.”
Prominent pronatalist advocates Simone and Malcolm Collins have also pitched the White House on bestowing a “National Medal of Motherhood” to women who have six or more children, The Times reported, drawing comparisons to similar medals given out to mothers of multiple children in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia under Joseph Stalin. The Democratic Women’s Caucus letter charged that the idea “is taken directly out of the playbook of authoritarian regimes designed to control women and restrict how families live — it’s appalling.”
Instead, Democratic women said, the Trump administration should support establishing paid leave, making child care more affordable, investing in women’s health research and expanding the child tax credit.
“We are committed to building a country where every woman and every family has the freedom —and the resources—to decide if, when, and how to grow their family,” the letter said. “Women are not mere vessels for childbirth as contemplated in The Handmaid’s Tale.”

Karla Rose Hanson, D-Fargo. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota officials on Tuesday described new legislation as improving “off-ramps” from the criminal justice system, with one of the off-ramps coming before offenders get into the court system. 
“We know that people who get into the criminal justice system tend to stay there,” said Tom Erhardt, director for parole and probation within the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. He said by improving the off-ramps, it will reduce the number of crime victims, reduce the number of repeat offenders and save the state money. 
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Tuesday had a signing ceremony for three criminal justice reform bills, trying to keep people out of the court system, making it easier for them to comply with probation and helping former inmates integrate into society.  
The bills were based in part on a study conducted after the 2023 legislative session and a collaboration with the corrections department and the Department of Health and Human Services.

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)
“Given the volume of support from prosecutors, public safety officers, community partners and several state agencies throughout the legislative process, it’s clear that these policies move our criminal justice system in the right direction,” said Rep. Lawrence Klemin, R-Bismarck, the sponsor of the three bills. 
Erhardt said he thinks House Bill 1425, which focuses on diversion and deflection, has the potential to be the most impactful. 
It provides $1 million for a pilot program in three counties to be selected by the corrections department. The county state’s attorney would be able to develop a program focused on keeping people out of jail, using tools such as mental health and substance abuse services. Law enforcement could be part of the deflection process. 
The counties will report back on the pilot program before the start of the 2027 legislative session. 
The bill includes $750,000 through the Department of Health and Human Services for mental health services. 
“We have crisis centers around the state, through our human service centers, where someone can come in and get withdrawal management or detox or get assessed for mental health, they may never have to go to the jail,” said Pam Sagness, executive director of the behavioral health division of HHS. 
House Bill 1417 would eliminate fees for people on supervised release. Not paying those fees can lead to a return to jail. The fees are also seen as a burden for low-income people. 
The corrections department bills about $6 million in supervision fees per biennium with a collection rate of around 25% or $1.5 million.  
Legislative Management may also do a study of court fines and fees before the next legislative session. 
Trio of bills addresses justice reform, crowded North Dakota jails 

The third bill, House Bill 1549, would create a grant program for local jails for programs that help people adjust after being released from jail, referred to as reentry. 
“Most jails don’t have anything set up for reentry,” Colby Braun, director of the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said after the ceremony. “When you’re done, the clothes you came in with, that’s pretty much what you leave with.” 
The corrections department would assist with getting a driver’s license or identification card and getting Medicaid or other assistance through the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The grants from the corrections department would help local jails set up a reentry program.
“So this is really focusing on those local jails to say, ‘Hey, if you guys want to build something up, we’ve got some dollars,’” Braun said. 
The bill also creates a task force to study housing issues for people leaving jail and a possible study of criminal record sealing and expungement. 
The diversion and deflection bill will take effect July 1; the other bills will take effect Aug. 1.

Traci Koster on the House floor on April 29, 2025.The Florida Legislature is sending Gov. Ron DeSantis a bill that would remove the barrier that has kept dozens of wrongfully incarcerated people from receiving the financial compensation that they were entitled to over the past two decades.
That’s because, after several unsuccessful attempts, the House on Tuesday unanimously passed a measure (SB 130) amending a 2008 state law that was designed to provide financial compensation for individuals wrongfully convicted of a crime. The measure previously passed unanimously in the Senate as well.
That 2008 legislation called for eligible exonerees to receive $50,000 for each year they were wrongfully incarcerated, capped at $2 million. However, since its passage, only a handful of exonerees have actually received such compensation, due to a “clean hands” provision barring compensation for people with earlier, unrelated, felonies — the only such restriction of its type in the country.
“Since almost 20 years ago enacting our wrongful incarceration compensation statute, we have 19 exonerees in our state who have lost over 306 years of their freedom, because we as the state of Florida put them in prison,” said Tampa Bay Republican Rep. Traci Koster, who has sponsored this same bill ever since she was elected to the House in 2020.
Koster’s bill (sponsored in the Senate by Northeast Florida Republican Jennifer Bradley) would remove that clean-hands provision. It would extend the filing deadline for those who have been exonerated from 90 days to two years, and allow a wrongfully incarcerated person both to bring a civil lawsuit and file for compensation under the 2008 law.
However, a claimant would have to repay the state if he or she receives monetary awards both through a compensation claim and a civil lawsuit.
In presenting the bill, Koster said she believes  Florida had one of the strongest criminal justice systems “in the world.”
“But just because we have one of the best systems in the world, doesn’t mean it’s perfect,” she added. “And even the best sometimes don’t get it right.”
In making a moral case for the legislation, Volusia County Republican Webster Barnaby cited the case of Joseph in the Bible and former South African President Nelson Mandela as individuals wrongfully incarcerated.
“There are people are wrongfully incarcerated,” he said. “And it’s our job as legislators to be truthful for those poor victims, because that’s what they are, victims, who were wrongfully incarcerated. It’s important for us to see people as people.”
“I’ve been here seven years and I’ve watched people come trying to get compensation, and it’s been a very, very difficult task,” said Tampa Democratic Rep. Dianne Hart. “When we incarcerate somebody for 35 or 40 years of their life, there is no compensation that can compensate for the time that they have spent for being incarcerated.”
91 people
Since 1989, 91 people in Florida have been exonerated or released from incarceration as a result of post-conviction DNA testing, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. That includes Robert DuBoise, who served 37 years on rape and murder charges but was exonerated in 2020 by the Conviction Review Unit of the Hillsborough County State Attorney’s Office after DNA evidence testing excluded him as the perpetrator.
However, the clean-hands provision of state law precluded him from being eligible for compensation because of two nonviolent property felony crimes which resulted in probation when he was a teenager. He ended up suing the city of Tampa in federal court in 2021 and, ultimately, the city council approved a $14 million settlement for him in 2024.

(Courtesy of Courtnie Washington)A state grand jury has decided not to indict the Jersey City police officer who shot and killed a man in psychiatric crisis in 2023, the state Attorney General’s Office announced Tuesday.
Andrew Washington, 52, died on Aug. 27, 2023, after authorities sent police to his home in riot gear who pounded on his door, broke it down after a brief standoff, and then shot him with a gun and Taser when he rushed out the door armed with a knife. Washington’s family had called a mental-health hotline for help.
The police’s response flouted departmental de-escalation protocols and violated Washington’s civil rights, his family said in a wrongful death lawsuit they filed last year.
Grand jurors voted Monday not to criminally charge Officer Stephen Gigante, the “trained negotiator” who fired the fatal shots, after reviewing a 911 call, body-worn camera footage, witness interviews, photographs, ballistics reports, and autopsy results, the Attorney General’s Office said.
Washington had several mental health disabilities, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and bouts of psychosis that involved auditory hallucinations, his family said in their lawsuit, which remains ongoing. They called a mental health hotline because they wanted him to go to the hospital, they said.
Responding officers reported that Washington, communicating through his closed door, referred to a “suicide mission” and seeing ghosts, refused to talk with EMTs, and then went silent altogether, spurring supervisors’ decision to breach the door, according to the Attorney General’s Office. When the officers did, Washington ran at them with a 13-inch knife, the office said.
Attorney Amelia Green, who represents Washington’s family, said they were disappointed by the grand jury’s decision. But the decision does not exonerate the officers, Green added.
“We will prove these officers violated Drew’s constitutional rights in multiple ways when they shot and killed him when he was in the midst of a mental health episode,” Green said in a statement. “Drew’s death is the result of ongoing systemic failures by the Jersey City Police Department in its interactions with those with mental health disabilities. The grand jury’s decision only makes the family’s civil rights lawsuit all the more important in holding the Jersey City Police Department accountable for Drew’s death.”
Washington’s slaying came just five months after Paterson police gunned down community activist Najee Seabrooks after a similar standoff in March 2023. That incident drove the state to take over the Paterson police force. A grand jury decided in March not to indict two officers for Seabrooks’ death.
Both deaths and resulting community protests prompted state Attorney General Matt Platkin to amend the statewide use-of-force policy in encounters involving people in mental crisis and expand a statewide program that pairs police with trained mental health professionals to handle such calls.

(Screenshot courtesy of C-Span)A federal bill that would require social media platforms to remove falsified intimate images and so-called “revenge porn,” which a South Carolina state legislator has been pushing for, advanced to the president’s desk Monday.
State Rep. Brandon Guffey has repeatedly called on Congress to pass legislation protecting children online after his 17-year-old son, Gavin Guffey, died by suicide three years ago while being extorted with intimate photos he had shared by direct message on Instagram.
Guffey, R-Rock Hill, recounted the story of his son’s suicide to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year during a general discussion about protections for children online. The bill passed the House with a vote of 409-2 on Monday.
SC House passes bill requiring parental consent for social media

Every South Carolina representative in Congress voted for the bill, which will go to President Donald Trump for his signature.
“I think that’s a big first step,” Guffey told the SC Daily Gazette.
The bill, dubbed the TAKE IT DOWN Act, is among several for which Guffey has been advocating. Another federal proposal that would make social media platforms legally responsible for protecting children on their apps and websites from sexual exploitation has yet to get a vote in either chamber.
The passage of the first proposal could lead to others, Guffey said.
“Hopefully it’ll begin that snowball,” Guffey said.
In recent years, the state has put in place some of its own protections for children online. Gavin’s Law, named after Guffey’s son, passed in 2023, banning sexual extortion, also known as “sextortion.”

(Photo courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.



Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

,DC,2025-04-29 20:59:50+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House GOP starts reconciliation work with increase for border security,"Ariana Figueroa, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-starts-reconciliation-work-increase-border-security,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans on Tuesday kicked off their work to build consensus on “one big, beautiful bill,” to fund President Donald Trump 's priorities, including a major funding boost for immigration enforcement and border security. After returning from a two-week recess, House lawmakers started debating and amending the various sections of the bill with markups in the Armed Services, Education and Workforce, and Homeland Security committees.Congressional Republicans are using reconciliation — a special procedure that skirts the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — to put together one bill to fulfill the White House’s priorities on border security, tax cuts, energy policy and defense.The Homeland panel’s bill, which would increase funding for border security by $70 billion, aligns with Trump’s second-term agenda, which has centered on an immigration crackdown.The Homeland Security portion of the reconciliation package recommends $46.5 billion to construct a barrier along U.S. borders and $5 billion for Customs and Border Protection facilities, including $4.1 billion to hire 3,000 Border Patrol agents and 5,000 CBP officers. It would also set aside $2 billion for retention and signing bonuses for CBP staff.  “It is critical that the Republican majority do what the people elected us to do, approve funds for effective border security and enforcement measures,” House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green of Tennessee said.The bill also includes $2.7 billion in technology surveillance along U.S. borders and roughly $1 billion for inspection technology at ports of entry. The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, said Democrats were unified in their opposition to the proposal. He argued that roughly $70 billion in funding would only aid the Trump administration in its plans of mass deportation and not address border security.“House Republican leadership is putting lipstick on this pig of a reconciliation package by pretending it’s about border security,” Thompson said.Votes on all three committees' bills, and amendments mostly from Democrats raising objections to the package, were expected late Tuesday or after midnight Wednesday. The committees are not expected to adopt any of the Democratic amendments.Summer floor votesSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Tuesday he expects the House will spend the rest of this week and next week debating the 11 different bills in committee before rolling them all into one reconciliation package.The full House will debate and vote to approve the legislation before Memorial Day, under the current timeline.“I don’t know how long the Senate is going to take to do their piece,” Johnson said. “But I was very encouraged after the meeting yesterday, frankly. Leader (John) Thune and Sen. (Mike) Crapo are on point. The Senate Republicans have been working very hard together.”Thune, of South Dakota, is the Senate majority leader and Crapo, of Idaho, chairs the tax-writing Finance Committee.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the administration would like the package to clear Congress before the Fourth of July, though Johnson said he “hopes” to finalize a deal before that deadline.Thune said later Tuesday that the reconciliation package’s final look will be decided by what policies have the votes to get through each chamber.“Ultimately, what gets included in a reconciliation bill will be determined by what there are 218 votes for in the House and 51, or 50, votes for in the United States Senate,” Thune said.Democrats object to deportationsDemocrats on the Homeland Security panel introduced amendments to signal their opposition to the administration's deportation agenda.Louisiana Rep. Troy Carter was one of several Democrats to sharply criticize the recent deportation of three U.S. citizen children to Honduras during the Homeland Security Committee’s markup.He noted that one of the children removed with his mother to Honduras, is a 4-year-old battling Stage 4 cancer.“This is not border security,” Carter said. “This is state-sanctioned trauma.Democrats introduced amendments to bar federal funds being used to detain immigrants at a foreign prison, following an agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador to detain more than 300 men in a notorious mega-prison. Experts have raised concerns the agreement could violate a law against funding foreign governments engaged in human rights abuses.“This is not an idle possibility,"" Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island said.He pointed out that Trump asked El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele to consider taking “homegrown” criminals, meaning U.S. citizens.“This is insane,” Magaziner said. “It is outrageous and every American should be terrified by this prospect.”Several other Democrats introduced amendments related to the Trump administration’s use of the prison in El Salvador.Boost for PentagonThe House Armed Services Committee portion of the reconciliation package would bolster defense spending by $150 billion over the next decade.That funding would be divvied up between numerous national security priorities, including $25 billion for Trump’s goal of having a countrywide missile defense system, similar to Israel's Iron Dome.The defense bill would appropriate $34 billion for shipbuilding and the maritime industrial base, $21 billion for munitions purchases, $14 billion for “initiatives to scale production of game changing new technology,” $13 billion for nuclear deterrence and $12 billion to enhance military readiness, according to a GOP summary of that bill. Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., said at the beginning of his committee's markup that the bill would make a “generational investment in our national security.”“It is clear we are no longer deterring our adversaries,” Rogers said. “The threats we face today from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea and others, are much more serious and challenging than we have ever faced before.”Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, ranking member on the panel, said there’s “no question that the Department of Defense has needs and there's also no question that we as a country face threats.”But Smith criticized Republicans for moving the defense funding boost within the massive reconciliation package, which will increase the deficit.“We’re, once again, saying to the American people, ‘This is important but not important enough to actually pay for it.’ So the budget itself is a huge problem,” Smith said. “And you really can’t support the additional $150 billion for defense if you don’t support the overall reconciliation bill because that’s what this is. And the overall reconciliation bill, I firmly believe, is a disaster for this country.”Smith criticized Republicans for proposing additional dollars for the Pentagon while it is run by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is under investigation for sending information about a bombing campaign in Yemen to a group chat that inadvertently included a journalist and a different group chat that included his wife, brother and others.“They have not even begun to prove that there is a chance in hell that they will spend this money intelligently, efficiently and effectively,” Smith said. “Secretary Hegseth has proven himself to be completely incapable of doing the job of secretary of Defense.”Cuts for Pell grantsThe Education and Workforce Committee’s markup fell along similar partisan lines, with GOP lawmakers lauding the bill and Democrats rejecting Republicans’ plans seeking to overhaul federal spending.Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., said the legislation would cut $330 billion in federal spending over the next decade by reshaping federal student loan programs and Pell grants for low-income students, among several other changes.“Dumping more federal money into a broken system doesn’t mean that system will work,” Walberg said. “In fact, government spending on higher education has reached record highs, yet millions of students benefiting from those funds will ultimately end up with a degree that doesn’t pay off or fail to finish school altogether.”The GOP bill, he said, would “bring much-needed reform in three key areas: simplified loan repayment, streamlined student loan options, and accountability for students and taxpayers.”Walberg scolded former President Joe Biden for not working with Congress to overhaul federal grant and loan programs for higher education, saying the former administration “was determined to keep pouring taxpayer funds into the abyss in a futile attempt to keep up with the unacceptable and unaccountable institutional prices.”Virginia Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member, said that Congress should look at ways to make college more affordable through reforms, but said the GOP bill “misses the mark.”“This current reconciliation plan would increase costs for colleges and students. It would limit students access to quality programs, which would then reduce their likelihood of finding a rewarding or successful career,” Scott said. “And then take the so-called savings to pay for more tax cuts for the wealthy and the well-connected.”Republicans “limiting the students' access to Pell grants and federal loans,” he said, could increase the number of people who have to rely on “predatory, private loans” to pay for college.“Put bluntly: The Republican plan will limit how much money middle- and low-income students can borrow from the federal government,” Scott said. “As a result, limiting the federal student aid that students can receive means that millions of students will not be able to access federal assistance that they need to complete their degrees. Moreover, this bill will force student borrowers into unaffordable repayment plans.”",,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 20:58:48+00:00,CT Mirror,"After 100 days of Trump, CT Democrats know where they stand",Mark Pazniokas and Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/trump-first-100-days-ct-lawmakers/,CT Democrats say President Trump’s performance is actually worse than his dismal polling reflects. Republicans say it’s too early to judge.,"In Connecticut, Democrats lined up Tuesday to say President Donald J. Trump’s performance actually is worse than his dismal polling reflects, while Republicans say it is too early to judge one of the most consequential starts to a new administration since Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s first 100 days in 1933.
Gov. Ned Lamont contrasted FDR’s efforts to calm a nation rocked by the Great Depression with Trump’s destabilization of a solid economy with a trade war on America’s closest allies, unpredictable shifts on tariffs and the threat of deep federal budget cuts and layoffs.
“People are scared. People are holding back. We’re going the wrong way, driving the economy into a ditch, as opposed to ‘The only thing you have the fear is fear itself.’ You might as well say, ‘If you’re scared today, just wait ’til tomorrow,’” Lamont said.
A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that twice as many people gave Trump a failing grade of F as gave him an A, and a Gallup assessment of first 100 days polling going back to Harry Truman found Trump’s approval rating was 42%. Only Trump’s first-term mark of 41% was lower.
Lamont spoke outside the state Capitol, joined by the Democratic state chair, Roberto Alves, and Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas, Comptroller Sean Scanlon, Treasurer Erick Russell and Attorney General William Tong.
Republicans, mindful that Trump has lost badly in Connecticut in each of his three runs for the White House, staged no similar event in Hartford, though the state GOP chair, Ben Proto, and House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, offered varying degrees of praise, or at least calls for patience, when called for comment.
“I start with promises made, promise kept,” Proto said. “That’s one of the biggest problems the Democrats have: They are going to have to start keeping promises.”
In Proto’s view, Trump has accomplished what he promised: controlling the southern border and taking steps to deport migrants in the U.S. without legal status, especially those implicated in crimes.
“I think there is good and bad with President Trump,” Candelora said. “He certainly controlled the border crossing. He is trying to address the immigration crisis, trying to reposition our manufacturing bases in the country with his tariffs. I think it’s too early to say whether he is successful. I think he is taking a path that brings a lot of anxiety.”
Candelora said he was not supportive of the president’s calls for the impeachment of judges who have issued adverse rulings in challenges to executive orders and expressed a wariness about Trump’s withholding federal funding from universities that have displeased him.
But Candelora said he resented the challenges from Democrats for Republicans to stand up to the president, saying they are “gaslighting” Republicans with exaggerated claims of how the initial cuts have impacted federal services or its aid to state governments.
“I have an assessment of the first 100 days of the Connecticut Democrats, and that is they have completely lost their minds, and they wouldn’t know the truth if it hit them in the face,” Candelora said.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, held a press conference Tuesday to criticize Lamont for agreeing to a deal that will remove Connecticut State Colleges and Universities Chancellor Terrence Cheng from his leadership post but allow him to collect his base annual salary of $442,187 until his contract expires next year.
Harding offered no assessment of Trump, but he had plenty to say about Lamont tolerating Cheng’s controversial wining and dining expenses. The governor should have pressed the Board of Regents to fire Cheng for cause, he said.
“We’re focusing on the things that we actually can control here in the state,” Harding said. “The governor can do something about this. The governor can turn around and tell the Board of Regents, ‘No, do not offer an extension on this contract. We’re going to fire this individual.’”
Scanlon, the Democratic comptroller whose office audited Cheng at Lamont’s request, said Harding should be able to comment directly on Trump, who is provoking a constitutional crisis with his use of executive powers, even when contradicted by federal law.
“I think it’s important that we talk about that. It’s not apples for apples. Here we are acting on this situation,” Scanlon said of Cheng. “That situation has been dealt with. The governor asked me to do an audit of that gentleman, and that audit, I think, bore out as to why they decided not to re-up his contract with them.”
In Washington, Republicans praised the president.
House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana said he spoke twice with Trump ahead of the president’s big speech Tuesday night in Michigan to celebrate his first 100 days. Johnson argued Republicans’ electoral wins gave them the leverage and authority to reshape parts of the federal government and the ways in which they are trying to address inflation and immigration.
“We got a mandate to do exactly what we’re doing right now. We have not wasted a moment,” Johnson said at the Republican National Committee’s headquarters that sits a few blocks away from the U.S. Capitol.
He acknowledged some of the challenges facing the administration when pressed about the recent drops in Trump’s approval rating. Johnson believes there will be an eventual payoff of Trump’s tit-for-tat tariff policies that have led to market volatility.
“There’s been a little question and concern about the rocky start — some of the stock market, some of the tariff policy and all that,” Johnson said. “But right now, even today, people are beginning to see the dust settle on that. They understand there was a master strategy behind this, and they’re seeing the results.”
While the strategy may be a slower burn, Republicans believe Americans will see the promised results when they hash out and pass their major tax package, which is currently still in the beginning stages. They are promising relief for families and entertaining proposals like no taxes on tips. But they will also need to reckon with not further driving up the deficit and making enough spending cuts that could possibly lead to disruptions in some programs.
Johnson and his leadership team also took some shots at the Democratic Party, which had initially struggled to respond to Trump amid an onslaught of executive orders. Some Democrats, like U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, have openly criticized the party for not addressing the concerns of working families. Republicans believe they are still operating without a message.
“They don’t have any message. They don’t have any clear leader. They don’t have a clear vision. They don’t know what to do. Their platform has been repudiated, and they’re turning on themselves,” Johnson said, noting that one of the vice chairs of the Democratic National Committee will fund primary challenges against some incumbents in safe blue seats. 
Republicans call it obstruction. Democrats see it as a renewed resistance movement.
And Democrats argue they have now found their footing since Trump took office in January.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., sees a big change in the energy over the past 100 days. The mood was “despairing and despondent” at earlier town halls, but he said things feel differently whether it was at his weekend town hall in Middletown or at an event in Michigan.
“People are ready to go on offense. We need to do more than just attack Trump,” Blumenthal said Tuesday from Washington. “What I saw in the town halls and the reaction from people generally is disgust and anger.”
Members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation have held town halls and events over the past few months to hear out constituents. And in other states and districts that aren’t getting facetime with their members, Murphy, who has become one of Democrats’ go-to messengers, has sought to fill in the gaps and hold town halls in red states with his colleagues.
Connecticut, like every other state, has grappled with swift changes coming out of the White House — and the occasional walkback of some policies. Within a week of Trump taking office, his administration planned to pause all federal grants and loans. That was ultimately reversed, though the short-lived policy had a lingering effect and caused delays for some sectors.
Since then, other federal funding streams have started to see cuts or completely disappear, whether for food banks, public health agencies or universities. That has led Tong to join multiple lawsuits looking to block a number of those actions.
Cuts to federal funding mean states like Connecticut will likely need to fill in the gaps if programs and services are at risk.
“Gov. Lamont and the legislature have planned pretty meticulously and budgeted carefully, and now Trump is pulling the rug out from under all the states that have tried to forecast and plan responsibly like Connecticut,” Blumenthal said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7408-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

Under the bill, general university funding for the University of Iowa would stay at almost $223.5 million, Iowa State University funding would remain at more than $178.4 million and funding for the University of Northern Iowa would remain at almost $101.9 million.
While neither the University of Iowa or Iowa State University requested any general funding increases, the University of Northern Iowa asked for an additional $2.5 million for the upcoming year, which was not reflected in the bill.

Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, said Tuesday during a subcommittee meeting on the bill that data from the board of regents shows around 66% of the higher education system budget is driven by tuition, with less than 30% made up of state appropriations.
“I’m very concerned about the level funding for both our community colleges and our regent universities,” Winckler said. “That would mean, as costs are going up for the provision of education, that tuition will go up, and in many cases, that is very difficult for families.”
Public education is incredibly important, she said, and when the Legislature keeps funding flat for state universities and community colleges — especially with national challenges all colleges must weather — the students and families paying to attend them feel the hurt of rising costs.
Funding for community colleges is listed at close to $235.9 million, the same as last year. Katrina Holck, representing Community Colleges for Iowa, said many community colleges are concerned  about the proposed funding as well.
Lobbyists expressed general support for the legislation during the meeting, including proposed funding of $10 million for a health care professional incentive program and more than $2.3 million for the therapeutic classroom incentive fund for school districts.
Representatives of Des Moines University said in the past, the private college and the UI have been allocated funds for a loan program to either keep alumni practicing in Iowa or bring professionals back to the state to work, and expressed their wish to see it continue.
“The loan program has been really helpful for our alumni to stay here and practice or come back and practice in rural areas,” said Joseph Jones, chief of staff in the president’s office at DMU.
Other funds left out of the legislation mentioned by commenters included the Iowa Tuition Grant program, $14 million for paraeducators and other civil work personnel and a $335,000 ask for a dyslexia endorsement tuition reimbursement program.
Subcommittee chair Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, said in total, the bill allocates more than $1 billion from the state general fund for fiscal year 2026, an increase of more than $7 million from last year, as well as about $33.7 million from other funds.
Sen. Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, had no comments but joined Green in signing the legislation forward. It will head to the full Senate Appropriations Committee for further review.
Green praised Gov. Kim Reynolds for urging the Legislature to allocate $1 million to the UI for cancer research, as well as the health care professional incentive program. In speaking with his constituents about actions taken last year to increase starting teacher pay, Green said it has really helped rural teachers and schools, and similar efforts should continue.
“This year, when I have gone out and I’ve talked to the communities, it resonates with a lot of people that we need to maybe expand our rural teacher loan incentives,” Green said. “That’s something that I would like to continue to pursue in the future, for me personally.”

Patrick Morrisey signed a pair of education bills that will ban the use of cellphones in classrooms and require teachers to display “In God We Trust” in schools. 
Students, Republican lawmakers and others joined the governor at Lincoln Middle School in Shinnston, West Virginia, on Tuesday for a bill signing ceremony.
Morrisey prioritized banning cellphones in schools, mentioning it in his State of the State address. It was the only piece of education legislation that the governor requested in his first legislative session.
“I think this is going to make a significant difference for our teachers and students,” Morrisey said. “We know that the use of personal electronic devices in the classroom increases distractions, academic misconduct and bullying and, overall, it creates a negative learning environment.”
Morrisey also mentioned that the bill would help curtail students’ addiction to cellphones that could harm their mental health. 
House Bill 2003, which overwhelmingly passed the House of Delegates and Senate, prohibits students from using a personal electronic device during instructional time. County boards of education are required to create and adopt a policy that includes whether cellphones are permitted on school grounds and what the consequence would be for students who violate the policy. 
If a county board decides that cellphones will be permitted on school property, students may be required to store the devices in containers or pouches provided by the county board, according to the bill. 
  Sen . Jay Taylor, R-Taylor
“The kids throughout the state had influence on this bill and helped work it. That’s incredible,” said Sen. Jay Taylor, R-Taylor. “Don’t take this as, ‘We don’t want you to use cellphones.’ We want you to learn to use them responsibly.”
Morrisey also signed Senate Bill 280, which requires public schools and higher education institutions to display a durable poster or framed copy of the United States motto, “In God We Trust.”
Sen. Mike Azinger, R-Wood, has sponsored the measure for three years.
“First of all I want to give honor to God for this bill. It tells Americans and kids … what our U.S. motto is,” Azinger said. “If America stays with that motto in our hearts and West Virginia stays with that motto in our hearts, we’ll be OK.”
  Sen. Mike Azinger, R-Wood
The display must contain a representation of the United States flag centered under the national motto and cannot have any other words or images.
It didn’t come with funding for schools to purchase the signage, but schools can accept private donations for the now-required display. 
“We have to ensure that we’re teaching kids about the founding principals of our country — a true and accurate retailing of civics and American life and history,” Morrisey said.
Morrisey noted the state’s near-bottom ranking in student academic performance and teacher pay.
“We’re not going to get where we need to be without having every West Virginia child having the ability to access a top-notch education system,” he said.  
Session ends without teacher pay raises
During his State of the State address, Morrisey called for teacher pay raises as West Virginia’s public school teachers are the least paid in the nation. But the governor didn’t request a bill to implement a pay increase. 
A bill sponsored by Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, sought to implement “locality pay” for teachers. It would have determined their potential raise by the median home prices in their county. The bill failed to make it to the full Senate for consideration.
Morrisey already signed lawmakers’ high-profile education measure that will give elementary teachers more authority to remove disruptive or violent students from their classroom. The measure is in response to West Virginia teachers’ call for help in addressing an uptick in elementary students’ violent and dangerous behavior that has resulted in teacher injuries and learning disruptions. 
The bill also mandates that school mental health professionals assess removed students to see what could be causing the behavior. 
Additionally, Morrisey signed lawmakers’ budget that includes $97 million in funding for the state’s education voucher program, the Hope Scholarship, that has a quickly-accelerating price tag. Lawmakers have already raised concerns about how the state will afford the program next year with its estimated price tag of $300 million. 
Morrisey has until the end of day Wednesday to sign the remaining bills.

The House passed House Resolution 34, which is in support of Montana beef producers, while down the hall, the Senate moved House Resolution 52 forward, which continues the discussion of a checkoff, or marketing and education program, for Treasure State cattle products.
HJ 34 was brought by Rep. Randyn Gregg, R-White Sulphur Springs, while HJ 52 was sponsored by Rep. Eric Tilleman, R-Cascade.
“I moo that this bill do pass,” Gregg said on the House floor.
His wasn’t the only bit of humor, as Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings, asked Rep. Bob Carter, a Missoula Democrat and a vice chair of the House Agriculture committee, about the bill.
“I just wanted to ask,” Zolnikov said. “Are you ‘mooved’ by this bill?”
The resolution calls for sustainable beef production and encourages state and federal governments “to prioritize policies that ensure fair market conditions,” and remove regulatory burdens.
The resolution also “strongly opposes” lab-grown meat, which the Montana Legislature voted to ban earlier this session with House Bill 401, currently on the governor’s desk.
As of January 2025, there were 1.2 million beef cows in Montana and, additionally, about 1 million calves in the state. Agriculture in Montana is a $6.5 billion industry. 
Tilleman’s bill would study ways to grow that, following up on a somewhat controversial checkoff marketing legislation, HB 119, that was tabled in the Senate Agriculture fCommittee earlier this session. The bill would have created the Montana Cattle Committee and asked about 9,600 beef producers across the state, through a vote, whether or not they wanted to be taxed per head of cattle for the program.
“We decided to do a study bill to where we can get it ironed out, make it work for everybody,” Tilleman told the Daily Montanan. “Because we know our beef in Montana is some of the best, and everybody keeps buying.”
That idea was based on the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee, which was established in 1967 to promote Treasure State versions of those products. That committee works with the Wheat Marketing Center in Portland, Oregon, Tilleman said.
“They’ll actually take our wheat from Montana,” Tilleman said. “And they design special dishes for each of the different countries to try to show that our wheat is the best.”
If the Montana Cattle Committee is created in a future session, that’s the direction Tilleman hopes it goes. HJ 52 will also target educational opportunities. 
Tilleman is the Office of Public Instruction’s agricultural education specialist and sees it first hand. In Kalispell, for example, there’s six agriculture teachers with around 600 students. Tilleman said about two-thirds of schools in the state have some sort of agricultural education.
“There’s a big push in our area for that,” Tilleman said.
Several bills have touched on livestock this session, including increased financial protections for goat and bison producers. 
House Bill 356, which is on its way to the governor’s desk, added black bears to a predation list. It allows livestock producers, through the Livestock Loss Board, to receive compensation for animals killed by black bears. The list was previously grizzly bears, mountain lions and wolves.
“We have a lot of good bills that we’re trying to kind of rectify some of our code and try to actually help mitigate livestock loss,” Tilleman said. “And that was the big ones I was pushing, is being able to use those dollars to help mitigate a little more and doing that education.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/52100786614_9103ba001a_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Getty Images)On April 28, the president issued an executive order titled “Protecting American Communities from Criminal Aliens.” The order on its face is a screed against so-called sanctuary cities. It directs the attorney general to compile a list of sanctuary jurisdictions around the U.S. and, among other things, threatens to withhold federal funding from them. To me, an attorney in a city with a long, proud history of welcoming and protecting people from all over the world, the executive order reads like a temper tantrum. 
There isn’t a universal definition for a sanctuary city. The term refers to a non-federal jurisdiction — it could be a state, a county, or a city or town — that has laws in place that limit its government’s cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Communities choose these policies for a variety of reasons: to build trust and cooperation between officials and non-citizens; to maintain discretion of how to allocate limited law enforcement resources for public safety; and because they don’t want to be in the business of hunting down their neighbors for deportation.
Trump administration officials assert that sanctuary policies make our communities less safe. They point to highly publicized murders of American citizens at the hands of non-citizens and they allege the presence of transnational criminal organizations and terrorists in our communities. But research bears out that places with sanctuary policies have lower crime rates than places without them. Sanctuary policies encourage participation in community policing by all members of the community and engagement with social services and community and economic development initiatives that mitigate poverty.
The most recent executive order asserts that sanctuary policies are  “lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law and the Federal Government’s obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the United States.” The Trump administration may feel that way — so many of its recent executive orders are more about feelings than what is actually legal — but courts have consistently held otherwise. 
Sanctuary policies do not explicitly interfere with immigration enforcement. They do not impede the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to arrest, detain and deport non-citizens and they do not shield or harbor those individuals from law enforcement. Refusing to cooperate within this legal framework does not prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other federal agencies from doing their job; it just says: We’re not going to use our resources to do this job for you. 
This distinction is important because it is constitutionally protected. The 10th amendment has what’s called the “anti-commandeering” doctrine. What that means is that the federal government cannot conscript states and local governments to enforce federal laws. Courts have long held that sanctuary policies are protected by the 10th amendment. 
This is why the Trump administration is attempting to use withholding of federal funds to compel jurisdictions with sanctuary policies to comply and cooperate. It’s not unlike the threats to withhold federal funding from universities who are unwilling to bend the knee to the administration. But, with respect to sanctuary cities, this issue was litigated during the first Trump administration and a federal judge ruled against withholding funds saying: “Federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the President disapproves.” That same judge granted an injunction on April 24 against the Trump administration’s attempt to withhold funds from sanctuary cities.  
This explains the tantrum. Kinder people can call it political theater but it is just a tantrum. We are starting to see a pattern of the president lashing out at people, companies, universities, states, or even countries that don’t immediately bend the knee to his demands. Mass deportation is a marquis issue for the second Trump administration and whether threatening sanctuary jurisdictions, denying due process or ignoring court orders, officials are having to result in increasingly illegal strategies to implement it. As desperation grows, the administration is escalating baseless propaganda about non-citizens being heinous criminals or terrorists. Sanctuary jurisdictions have a legally protected right to stand up and say, ‘we don’t buy it.’ Sanctuary jurisdictions know what healthy and safe communities look like, which is why voters support the policies. 
There are challenges ahead for our leaders. In our sanctuary communities, we need to lean into the instincts that told us we will never be safer by throwing our neighbors under the bus and stand up with other cities against these threats. We know we are always stronger together, that’s why we passed sanctuary policies in the first place. And the law is on our side. We refuse to cooperate with the federal government’s orders to help detain and deport our neighbors and we must also refuse to back down as the threats escalate — no matter how angry it makes our tantrum-throwing president.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-924927966-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)The Florida House has passed a measure (SB 118) that bans local governments in the state from interfering with any plans to construct a presidential library in Florida.
The motivation for the legislation comes from Florida Republicans who want to ease the pathway for a library for Donald Trump to be built in the Sunshine State.
“As the home to the 45th and 47th president of the United States, there is a high likelihood that President Trump will select Florida to be the site of his presidential library,” Central Florida Republican Jason Brodeur told the Senate Committee on Community Affairs back in February when he first introduced the measure.
“In anticipation of Florida’s first presidential library, we should roll out the welcome mat and offer the president maximum flexibility to construct this historic landmark here in Florida.”
In the House vote on Tuesday, two Democrats were dismissive.
“Please just vote on this bill. That is my debate,” said Orlando Democrat Anna Eskamani succinctly. 
The other Democrat who spoke out, Jacksonville Rep. Angie Nixon, blasted the entire notion, saying that there was “irony” in what the GOP-controlled chamber was doing.
“If we are going to support bringing this library here, we should support returning citizens all across the board, and not attack returning citizens, especially when they want to do things like vote, because we have one of the biggest returning citizens a/k/a felons in the administration right now,” she said referring to Trump being found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments in May 2024 in a New York courtroom.
Nixon’s comment about returning citizens was a reference to the 2018 constitutional amendment which legalized felons in Florida who had completed their sentence to be able to vote. However, an implementing bill in the following legislative session significantly narrowed the number of felons who can actually vote.
Not all Democrats were that critical, as five of them joined all Republicans in supporting the measure (the final vote was 89-20).
Associates of Trump have been looking  at several South Florida universities as possible locations for a presidential library, including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University, the Associated Press reported last month.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-2148912235-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Not without conflict, the Florida Senate took up 189 of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointees for boards and commissions across the state and approved all of them. 
Among the confirmations was former House Speaker Paul Renner to the State University System Board of Governors, former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez as chair of Space Florida, and former Sen. Rob Bradley to the St. Johns River Water Management District board. 
Two appointees, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Chair Rodney Barreto and Board of Education member Daniel Foganholi, received pushback but ultimately were confirmed. 
Senators approved Foganholi by a three-vote margin, 20-17. 
Foganholi has been appointed to four positions by DeSantis, including two times to the Broward School District board. In November, he ran to keep his spot on that board and lost, receiving 20% of the vote. 
New Board of Education member thanks God, DeSantis for fourth appointment

After the loss, DeSantis appointed him to the state board. 
“The people of Broward County did not trust Mr. Foganholi to represent them and he should not be rewarded for his failure to win the confidence of his community with a higher appointment to the State Board of Education,” Sen. Tina Polsky said on the floor.
Foganholi, a first-generation American born to parents who came to the United States from Brazil, is a member of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, to which DeSantis appointed him.
Miami New Times reported in August that Foganholi used to be a rapper. He told the outlet that he is proud of his music venture, but not of the music itself, which includes him “spitting bars about everything from getting women to getting high,” according to the New Times. 
Foganholi appeared in a music video that includes a depiction of him robbing a convenience store with a gun, the outlet reported, and published a screenshot of the YouTube video. The video linked in the article has since been deleted.
Polsky brought his rap career up on the floor.
“This is not the influence we need on our State Board of Education. We owe our children better,” Polsky said. 
Foganholi wrote an op-ed in support of gun open carry on campus following the shooting at Florida State University that killed two and injured six. 
“At FSU, the shooter used his mother’s legally-owned service weapon,” Foganholi wrote in The Spectator. “No law could have stopped him. But, had even one trained professor, staff member or responsible student been armed, this tragedy might have ended differently.”
He went on to write a similar sentiment about the 2017 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Polsky, who represents Parkland, site of the high school, said Foganholi misrepresented what happened that day in his op-ed, adding that he is “either so ignorant on our state’s tragedies or so willing to deliberately misrepresent them to promote his own agenda.”
“The students of Florida, of Parkland, and now of Florida State, continue to come to us, asking us to listen and prioritize their safety,” Polsky said. “How do we justify them appointing someone with such a poor understanding of safety on the Board of Education.”
More money more problems
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith requested that Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Chair Rodney Barreto be removed from the consent list. 
Barreto, a Coral Gables resident, has been appointed to the commission by three different governors — Jeb Bush, Charlie Crist, and DeSantis. Barreto is a millionaire who owns property in four states and chaired the Miami Super Bowl Host Committee three times.
Smith said his and other senators’ email inboxes “have been blown up” by constituents concerned about Barreto.
During his Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources confirmation hearing earlier this year, Barreto was asked about submerged land he owns at Singer Island and the potential sale of the environmentally sensitive land.
“I’m not in the business of buying land and giving it to people,” he said at the time when asked about the sale. “I’m in the business of making money.”
Smith recalled that testimony on the Senate floor Tuesday.
“Of course, there’s nothing wrong with making money. It’s not a crime or a bad thing. It’s what makes our capitalist economic system work. But he didn’t strike me as an environmental advocate, certainly not someone who should be the chair of the Florida Wildlife Commission.
“In my opinion, Mr. Barreto’s personal financial and development interests directly conflict with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s mission,” Smith said.
But Sens. Ana Maria Rodriguez and Bryan Avila defended Barreto.
“I know that there’s a lot of noise and I think it’s important for us to sometimes put the noise aside and look at the accomplishments and look at the individual who has been leading the effort not just on Biscayne Bay not just on the Everglades but on preserving a lot of land in our state for conservation,” Avila said.
The Senate voted 31-7 to confirm Barreto.
Not everyone confirmed
The Senate did not vote on all of DeSantis appointees. 
Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris or Department of Children and Families Secretary Taylor Hatch were not confirmed. The Florida Phoenix was the first to report that the Senate wouldn’t confirm them. Both Harris and Hatch testified during the House of Representatives investigation into a $10 million payment to the Hope Florida Foundation by health care giant Centene. The payment was part of a Medicaid overpayment settlement Centene reached with the state.
One University of West Florida trustee, Adam Kissel, was rejected in committee.
If the governor wants Harris, Hatch, or Kissel to continue to serve, he must reappoint them to that post within days of the end of session. They can continue to serve until the next legislative session. Appointees who fail to win confirmation a second time must leave their positions.
Two other gubernatorial appointees to the UWF board resigned after senators showed hesitancy about DeSantis’ desired conservative makeover of the Pensacola institution. 
New process
The process the Senate followed for confirmations this year and next was outlined in a memo by Senate Ethics and Committee Chair Don Gaetz, himself a former Senate president, and committee vice chair Mack Bernard, a Democrat.
The memo explains that every gubernatorial appointee will be considered by their substantive committee as well as the Ethics and Elections Committee.

Members of the House are aiming to add North Carolina to the list of states in which consumers can limit this kind of online shadowing and prevent their personal information from being sold for targeted ads or data mining. 
House Bill 462 would allow consumers to confirm whether companies, called “controllers” in the bill, have their personal data. Consumers would be able to obtain their data, have it corrected, or have it deleted. Companies would have to tell consumers what third parties have their personal information. 
Consumers would be able to say they don’t want their personal data sold, and to opt out of targeted advertising. 
“For any company that is housing and keeping anyone’s data, they would have to be able to provide access to this data, even telling North Carolinians how their data is being used,” Rep. Terry Brown (D-Mecklenburg) told a House Judiciary committee. Brown is the lead sponsor of the bipartisan bill.
Nothing in the bill conflicts with federal law, he said.

Some social media companies would be required to have people younger than 18 obtain express consent from a parent or guardian before they can set up accounts. 
The bill excludes some companies from the age requirement, including “a social media company that allows a user to generate short video clips of dancing, voice overs, or other acts of entertainment in which the primary purpose is not educational or informative,” “a media company that exclusively offers interactive gaming, virtual gaming, or an online service,” and companies that provide information through subscriptions and whose primary purpose is not social interaction.
Since 2018, 19 states have passed data privacy laws, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals. North Carolina is one of a dozen states where legislators are actively considering such bills, according to the association. 
The bill won unanimous committee approval on Tuesday. 
The privacy measure is important now that consumer data is more readily available, Brown said after the committee meeting. 
“We’ve all seen the targeted advertisements. They’re getting more and more pervasive and invasive. So, I want to do what we can to mitigate some of that,” he said. 
Brown told the committee that he’d worked on the bill with the Bankers Association and the Healthcare Association and was in continuing talks with the Retail Merchants Association and individual companies. 
The industry input won’t weaken the bill, Brown said later. 
“My intent is to keep the teeth in this bill and to make sure that we’re protecting North Carolinians first and foremost,” he said.  “But with any bill that I put forward, I want to make sure that I’m talking to the folks that are going to be impacted by it. And where we can reach a compromise, I’m always happy to do so.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cybersecurity-laptop.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

Melanie Stansbury (D-NM) on Tuesday chastised the United States Forest Service for refusing to publicly detail how staffing and other cuts could affect the federal response to wildfires expected soon in New Mexico and elsewhere. 
Stansbury directed her comments to Forest Service Associate Deputy Chief Ellen Shultzabarger, during the latter’s testimony to the U.S. House Federal Lands Subcommittee, on which Stansbury and fellow New Mexico Democrat Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández serve. Shultzaberger was there speaking in favor of a pair of bills that would allow specific, small pieces of federal forest land to be returned to states and cities, when questions from committee Democrats steered the conversation toward the upcoming wildfire season. 
“We are continuing to hire to have that goal of 11,300 operational firefighters, and we feel that we’ll be ready for the fire season,” Shultzabarger said. 
“With all due respect,” Stansbury responded, “I’ve been on the ground for the last couple of months, and Forest Service employees are terrified they’re going to lose their jobs, people are leaving in large numbers and thousands of people have been fired and not rehired. So while I appreciate that that is the company line here in this hearing, and I understand the position that you’re in, it’s just factually untrue. We are not prepared for this fire season.”
‘Stonewalling’: Forest Service mum on firings during wildfire briefing for congressional staff

Dozens of probationary Forest Service employees across New Mexico were fired or resigned since President Donald Trump took office. While judicial orders required the Trump administration to rehire those employees, many who tried to return were simply placed on paid administrative leave. 
While Forest Service officials have stressed that the mass firings were not aimed at employees whose sole job is dealing with wildfire, some outside estimates suggest three-quarters of those fired had “red cards,” meaning they could be called to help suppress a wildfire if one breaks out. A Colorado Democrat on the committee, Joe Neguse, estimated that 3,000 red card holders were fired. 
Meanwhile, Forest Service employees are awaiting the results of a “reduction-in-force” restructuring process that could take out another chunk of employees who are not on probationary status.

Asked about Stansbury’s comments after the meeting, Shultzabarger did not answer, instead deferring to Forest Service spokesperson Kyle Earnest, who did not provide further comment. 
Source New Mexico caught up with Stansbury after the hearing in Washington and asked her about the upcoming wildfire season, which forecasts predict could be dire and federal stonewalling on what used to be basic information. 
The following conversation took place during a short walk from the Capitol and has been edited for clarity and concision.
Source: Do you have any sense at all of what we could be looking at with reduction in force in New Mexico forests, in terms of employees lost?
MS: We have not received any specific plans. The New Mexico national forests have been heavily impacted by all the mass firings that have happened. The probationary firing that happened at the beginning of the DOGE effort resulted in dozens and dozens, both senior and junior, Forest Service employees, receiving notice that they’ve been fired. A lot of senior Forest Service officials did take the initial deferred departure offer, and we know that there is a RIF restructuring that is coming, but there’s been nothing released publicly, and there’s been nothing released internally. 
And so when I was home in New Mexico last week, during my town halls, I had Forest Service employees actually come to my town halls and speak to me privately about what’s happening. There’s a complete culture of fear. Nobody has any idea what’s going on. A lot of people are afraid they’re going to lose their jobs. …We’ve been heavily and disproportionately impacted. So we don’t have specific numbers, but we know that the entire workforce is in chaos and struggling right now.
Do you know the status of the interagency wildfire dispatch centers, including the one that’s in the Cibola National Forest office, which is on the DOGE termination list?
I don’t have any specific details. I mean, one of the things that I think has been really troubling about this entire DOGE exercise is that they claim that they’re doing it with transparency, and yet they refuse to come testify in front of Congress. They don’t even send political appointees to testify. Today, they sent a career staffer rather than a political appointee. And they transmit no information to congressional offices. And, you know, I say this all the time, but this is not normal. 
Heinrich gets ‘assurances’ that NM fire dispatch centers won’t close, but waiting on official word

In past administrations, regardless of what side of the aisle you are on, it has always been the norm and the practice that if you’re going to make a major change to a district, you notify the congressional offices, you notify the local officials, you notify towns and counties in the state, because all of them are impacted, and there’s zero communication at all between the administration DOG and local authorities, so we have no idea what they’re doing.
Do you think we’ll learn more in the president’s budget to be released this week about how those cuts will affect the New Mexico forests?
I don’t know. The word on the street is that the budget that will be transmitted this week is what they’re calling a skinny budget. So it will say, you know, [the] Forest Service’s budget is XYZ. It’s cut by XYZ amount and these programs, but I doubt it’ll have the level of detail that you see in a more fully fledged budget, where it describes in detail what their plans are. 
We ran into New Mexico State Forester Laura McCarthy near the Capitol, who told us she was here ‘lobbying’ but would not say for what bill or issue. Do you know?
She’s here? Wow, OK, I’m going to text her. I’m very good friends with Laura. My background is in water resources management, and she and I collaborated a lot on forest and water management in previous lives. So no, I don’t know what she’s up to here. But what I can say in general is that both states and tribes have been heavily impacted by the funding freezes. In fact, just yesterday, Mescalero Apache had a huge forest greenhouse project that had been on hold since the beginning of the Trump administration because they had frozen a [Bureau of Indian Affairs] grant they had received, and it was critical to growing seedlings for reforestation after these big fires, and they just found out yesterday that it had gotten unfrozen. 
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

So my guess is that the states and tribes and local authorities are trying to track down grants and federal funding. I think folks are very, very concerned about the upcoming fire season, as I mentioned in the hearing. We have the lowest snow pack in recorded history. And the thing to understand about that is it means that both the river is drying up already, which is unseasonably early, but it also means soil moisture and vegetation moisture is very low, which means basically the entire state’s a tinder box for the fire season. So if and when fires hit us, we’re at a very, very, extremely high risk for a really catastrophic fire season. And as you know, our communities are still reeling and recovering from the last major fires, and we can’t do it without support from the Forest Service, FEMA and these programs that they’re talking about cutting. It’s a bad situation.
The Cibola Forest has recently listed a couple of uranium mines near Mount Taylor as priority projects. Do you think those uranium mines could become operational?
Well, this administration is absolutely moving forward with stripping away protections for permitting and for national forests. They just issued guidance last week that would reduce all federal permitting to 28 days. In the case of, for example, Mount Taylor — which is not only set aside as national tourist land, but it’s also a sacred site for the pueblos and tribes of New Mexico — you can’t do an environmental and cultural review in 28 days. That’s just going to result in lawsuits. I believe that the administration is going to do everything it can to green-light mining and extractive activities on sensitive lands, and we will fight them every step of the way.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9579-1024x752.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Heritage Farm | Courtesy photo) A bill approved by Gov. Patrick Morrisey this week will allow the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources to issue permits to people to rehabilitate sick and injured wildlife. Morrisey signed House Bill 2836 on Monday. 
Rebecca Perry Franks, director of animal care and education at Heritage Farm and Museum in Huntington, helped champion the bill through the legislative session. 
A Huntington native, Franks said she fell in love with caring for sick and injured wildlife while interning at the Ohio Wildlife Center during college. She’s certified through the International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council but hasn’t been able to do that work since she returned to her home state. That made her start looking into how to change state law to make it legal for professionals here, she said.  
“It’s not something that everybody should be trying to do,” Franks said. “It takes training and careful consideration to make sure everybody is healthy, both people and animals throughout the process, but I truly believe that it has been hugely beneficial for the native wildlife of our surrounding states, and will be for ours as well.”
Under current West Virginia law, possession of wildlife outside of hunting season is illegal, said deputy DNR director Wendy Greene. The exceptions are avian centers, which are licensed by the federal government. 
Franks also runs a nonprofit wildlife hotline that takes questions from people who come across wild animals that are in danger or in need. Last year she fielded more than 270 calls between April and August, she said. 
“It continues to be very frustrating to have to tell everybody ‘hey, it’s currently illegal in this state to rehabilitate wildlife. All I can tell you to do is how to help keep it comfortable in its wild environment,’” Franks said. “Obviously that’s not the answer people like to hear. They want to be able to help. And a lot of people were taking matters into their own hands, against professional advice.” 
The bill authorizes the DNR to establish rules for the wildlife rehabilitation permit program.  While the bill is effective July 10, Greene said the DNR will have to establish rules and have them approved by the Legislature before it can accept applications. That won’t happen immediately, she said. 
“We won’t have anything definitive in place for several months,” Greene said. “…the law is passed, but it doesn’t mean folks can go out right now and grab up wildlife.”
The wildlife would be required to be returned to the wild unless it’s permanently impaired, the bill says. 
Heritage Farm currently has a nature center that educates visitors on native wildlife and domestic livestock. Once the application process is open, Franks hopes to be permitted to do wildlife rehabilitation and release as a part of her work there. 
“We’re an Appalachian history museum,” she said. “We celebrate natural history and cultural history, and why not help preserve our native wildlife as a part of that mission?”
The bill was sponsored by Del. Matthew Rohrbach, R-Cabell, who said the bill is a good way to help wildlife and, in the case of Heritage Farm, educate children who visit the Huntington attraction. 
“I think we all hope that it will help injured wildlife and also increase awareness of veterinary sciences,” Rohrbach said. “I could see a young child, perhaps visiting Heritage Farm, for instance, although it could be just as easily the [Oglebay] Good Zoo in Wheeling or other places, but seeing some of this being carried out, and then a young girl or young boy might get interested in veterinary science, go to veterinary school because of their exposure to something like this.”
The DNR intends to make the requirements the same as those of the International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council, Greene said. 
According to the bill, permits are prohibited for people who have been convicted of charges related to wildlife, animal cruelty or animal welfare. 
A fiscal note says the new program will cost the DNR about $92,000 per year. The division plans to assign a wildlife biologist and a secretary to work the program during half their time. The money for the program will be reallocated from other parts of the agency, the fiscal note says. Greene said the number is purely an estimate. 
“We have no idea how many people want to apply, how many people will be qualified,” she said. “We anticipate part of the application process being our biologist will go out to inspect facilities. So we were just guessing at how many we would have to process and inspect. It could be lower, it could be higher.”
Greene said the new law puts West Virginia in line with other Appalachian states that allow wildlife rehabilitation. 
“We were the only state in Appalachia that didn’t have a rehabilitation program for wildlife,” Greene said. “I think that, as an agency, we will be focused on rule development. We’ll be focused on making sure we’re still able to effectively control disease management. That would be one of our bigger concerns.”
Specifically, the DNR is concerned about chronic wasting disease, a fatal contagious disease in deer. She said the statute will allow the agency the authority needed to control the disease.
“I don’t know what that’s going to look like exactly,” she said. “My biologists — and I’m not a biologist, so I’m not going to speak for them — but they are currently working and looking at what we would need to do, whether that’s to control movement of different wildlife from different locations, or education. We’ll just have to see where we go with that.”

House File 299 was passed by the Senate 32-16. The bill requires all Iowa K-12 schools, as well as child care centers, community colleges, universities under the Iowa Board of Regents as well as private universities using the tuition grant program, to include information on exemptions when communicating with students and families about vaccine requirements. For child care facilities and K-12 schools, information on vaccine requirement exemptions must also be published on their website and be included in student registration documents.
Republicans who spoke in support of the measure said it was needed because there were some reports of school staff falsely claiming that vaccines were required — with no exceptions — for students to be able to attend school.
Sen. Dennis Guth, R-Klemme, shared a story from a mother who spoke on the bill during a subcommittee meeting. He said the woman claimed that while she was registering her child for an exemption to vaccine requirements, she witnessed another parent being told they needed to get vaccinations despite expressing they did not want to vaccine their child.

“The first mother came and said, ‘There are exemptions, you know, you don’t have to do that,’ and the school official said, ‘I’m sorry, no shots, no school,'” Guth said. “That’s just not the truth. We have a law in Iowa, and this will help make sure that that law is upheld.”
Iowa law requires students to receive vaccinations to enroll in schools, including receiving the polio, measles, hepatitis B, varicella and meningococcal vaccines while in the K-12 school system. However, families have the ability to opt out from these requirements if vaccinating their child “conflicts with a genuine and sincere religious belief.” The law does not require families to obtain a waiver or specify their religion to claim the exemption.
Medical exemptions can also be granted by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner who finds a required vaccination would be harmful to the health and well-being of the child or a member of their family.
While exemptions exist, Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Cedar Rapids, said the bill “risks sending a mixed message about the importance of the safety of vaccines” by emphasizing vaccine exemptions, potentially putting students in danger by diminishing herd immunity.
“The implications of this legislation could undermine public health efforts and lead to increased vaccine hesitancy, weakening our state and threatening our children,” Donahue said. “To be clear, vaccinations are safe. And this bill is particularly troubling when a resurgence of preventable diseases in areas with low vaccine rates is happening. Right now, we see measles popping up in multiple states.”
As of April 24, there have been a total of 884 confirmed measles cases in 29 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The largest outbreak has been in Texas, where two unvaccinated children died from the disease. Though no cases have been reported in Iowa since 2019, according to state public health officials, the neighboring states of Illinois and Minnesota have reported confirmed measles cases in 2025.
Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner also emphasized the efficacy of the measles vaccine in the wake of the recent outbreak and deaths from the disease.
“I’m left wondering how many have looked at the numbers of graves of young children in cemeteries prior to the advent of these vaccines, or looked into the long-term effects of measles on the immune system,” Weiner said. “… It is preventable, completely preventable through vaccination, and that is the most effective way to protect individuals and communities from measles.”
Having a wide majority of a people vaccinated — 95% — is needed to provide overall community protection from measles, according to medical professionals, especially for those who cannot get vaccinated because of issues like age or other health problems. Weiner said the bill will allow families to “feel free and are actually encouraged to opt out of life-saving vaccines,” which will put others at risk.
“This is unnecessary and in my view, irresponsible,” Weiner said. “We have a duty to Iowans. We should be informing the public about the safety, efficacy and importance of the measles and other vaccinations, and working to keep kids healthy and Iowans healthy.”
But Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, said the measure is not taking a stance on vaccines. He called the bill “an honesty bill,” because it is requiring schools share accurate information on vaccination requirements — and the fact that parents can seek exemptions.
“What’s troubling to me is a handful of schools in the state that decide it’s okay to lie to parents, that if you don’t receive shots then you can’t send your kids to school,” Green said. “That is a lie, and our parents in the state of Iowa deserve better. And so that’s what this bill ensures. It ensures an honest conversation between the taxpayers, the parents and the schools.”
The bill, which the Iowa House passed in March, goes to Gov. Kim Reynolds for final approval.

(Photo courtesy of Madison Public Library)The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI) received $1.6 million in grants from the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to support library operations and programming last week, though uncertainty remains for the program. 
Wisconsin libraries rely on funding provided by the federal government through the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) Grants to States Program, but that program has been in danger since President Donald Trump signed an executive order to downsize and begin the process of eliminating the agency. DPI and libraries throughout the state have warned that eliminating the funding would be a blow to statewide support for library programs as the grants fund staff for programs including the interlibrary loan system and other grants.
The notification message from IMLS to DPI stated that the partial payment is for the time period through April 2025. It also notified the state agency that “any additional amounts are subject to the availability of funds, IMLS discretion and other actions” and that “should those conditions be met, IMLS anticipates issuing supplemental awards and will send the allotment table at that time.”
“At this time, the DPI has not received a final allotment table indicating the amount of funding Wisconsin will receive,” the DPI stated in an update to libraries Tuesday afternoon. “This is not the typical fashion in which these funds are granted to states, but receiving a partial award provides some stability and relief in the short term.” 
The uncertainties for federal funding will still have some impact on the services that DPI carries out. Typically, the DPI Library Services office opens grant subawards, which are grants funded by federal funds and administered by the state agency, to library systems in Wisconsin in July. That won’t happen this year due to the uncertainty surrounding the amount and timing of future Grants to States funds.
“The DPI will prioritize the Library Services salaries and the tools necessary to do their jobs with this partial allotment,” DPI said in the email. The Library Services team is made up of about 20 people with 16 of the positions funded with federal dollars. “The team will reassess the viability of providing subawards once more is known about the future of IMLS and LSTA funding.” 
The amount that the state received is about half of the $3.23 million that Wisconsin received for the Grants to States Program received in 2024. 
Ben Miller, DPI library services director, had previously told the Examiner that the expected payment would serve as the next milestone for the state agency. There was uncertainty surrounding whether the payment would be sent given the gutting of staff for the IMLS office and the fact that other grants for libraries and museums have already been cut. Wisconsin is part of a multi-state lawsuit challenging the cuts to IMLS.
Miller had said that even if the agency received the payment, it will likely be cautious in proceeding with certain actions as the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018, the federal law that the grant program relies on, is up for renewal this fall. 
DPI spokesperson Chris Bucher said in an email to the Examiner that the state agency is “encouraged” by the first payment and is “optimistic given the IMLS note about issuing the supplemental awards.” 
“Our top priority remains being [of] service to Wisconsin kids and communities,” Bucher said. 
DPI also it would continue to provide updates to libraries as the situation evolves and thanked the library community for “sharing your stories, working with elected officials, and remaining steadfast in the incredible services you provide every day.” Libraries across the state have been working to inform the public about the potential cuts and to advocate for the federal funding with lawmakers. 
“Keep being loud and proud about the meaningful work happening in your libraries and communities,” DPI wrote.

Photo by Patrick McCaffrey via Wikimedia CommonsA federal judge has signed off on the sale of Burke Mountain Resort for $11.5 million, releasing the Northeast Kingdom ski mountain from nearly a decade of federal receivership. Judge Darrin P. Gayles issued an order Thursday in U.S. District Court in Miami formally approving the sale of Burke Mountain to Bear Den Partners LLC, a consortium of entities with longstanding ties to the ski resort. “A private sale to the Buyer is the only current viable alternative for preserving and capturing the value of the Assets for the benefit of the receivership estate,” Gayles wrote in the court order.The ski area’s buyer is a group that includes Burke Mountain Academy, a world-class ski racing school located in Burke, and the Graham family, who briefly owned the resort in the early 2000s. The group has pledged to put around $30 million into the resort to fund significant upgrades to its lift infrastructure and the hotel at the base of the mountain. Melissa Gullotti, a spokesperson for Bear Den Partners, said that pending a few administrative details being resolved, the group expects to formally close the deal in early May. The decision comes just days after Michael Goldberg, the lawyer overseeing the resort’s receivership, asked Gayles to approve the deal, writing at the time that the agreement was “in the best interest of the investors, the employees and the Burke ski community.”Gayles appointed Goldberg receiver of Burke Mountain Resort and Jay Peak, another Northeast Kingdom ski area, in 2016, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought a civil suit against Ariel Quiros, the former owner of both properties, and Bill Stenger, former CEO of Jay Peak. The two men were accused of defrauding investors participating in the federal EB-5 visa program in what has since become the largest fraud case in Vermont history. READ MORE

About $60 million of that went to defrauded investors, though it only covered an average of 22% of their losses. In court filings, Goldberg has suggested that much of the proceeds from the sale of Burke Mountain Resort would similarly go toward making the investors whole, although it’s unclear how much they would receive. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal judge approves $11.5 million sale of Burke Mountain Resort.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Burke-Mountain-Ski-Resort-Vermont.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

On April 28, 2022, the Ole Miss baseball Rebels had won 23 games and lost 17 overall. They were 6-12 in the Southeastern Conference. The various Internet message boards were filled with posts calling for head baseball coach Mike Bianco’s dismissal. Yes, and two months later, Bianco and his Rebels won the College World Series.

Rick Cleveland
Contrast that with this: On April 28 of this year, Mississippi State’s Diamond Dogs had a 25-19 record overall, 7-14 in the SEC. The various Internets boards were filled with posts calling for head coach Chris Lemonis to be fired. He was.
In both those situations, the Mississippi teams were six games over the .500 mark overall. In both those situations, the teams had lost twice as many SEC games as they had won. Ole Miss stayed the course, and it paid off, remarkably so. In sharp contrast, Mississippi State pulled the trigger, and we shall see what happens next.
Another big difference in the two situations: Bianco had never won a national championship in his previous 20 years at Ole Miss. Lemonis won the first national championship in State history just four years ago.
You ask me, that national championship, not even four years ago, should have earned Lemonis, at the very least, the right to finish out this season. I don’t see anything to be gained with firing the man with three weeks remaining in the regular season. Most NCAA Tournament projections have Mississippi State listed as one of the first four teams out. The Bulldogs are ranked 45th in RPI against the nation’s 13th most difficult schedule. They are on the NCAA Tournament bubble, just as Ole Miss was three seasons ago.
This is not to say I believe that Lemonis, given the opportunity, would have done what Bianco did three years ago, But it is certainly within the realm of possibility. We’ve seen it happen. In baseball, more than any other sport, teams run hot and cold. State could have gotten hot, gotten on a roll in May and June and at least made it to the College World Series. It happens for someone nearly every year in college baseball. For that matter, it could still happen for State this year with interim head coach Justin Parker calling the shots.
And I know what many of those calling for the dismissal of Lemonis will say. They’ll say that in firing Lemonis now, State can get a head start on hiring a new coach to turn the program around. Not so. Any coach that the Bulldogs would hire is still coaching a team and will be coaching a team through at least May. 
Traditionally, Mississippi State baseball is one of the nation’s top programs. State baseball facilities are second to none. Fan support is among the nation’s best. 
But it is not, as athletic director Zac Selmon put it “the premier program in college baseball.” It is much more accurate to say State’s is a really good program in the premier conference in college baseball.
LSU, Texas, and Arkansas, all teams in the same conference, have similar fan support, terrific facilities and have enjoyed much more on-the-field success. Tennessee has improved dramatically. Ole Miss, Alabama, Auburn, Georgia, Texas A & M have made huge strides in facilities, fan support and baseball emphasis. 
And here’s the deal: Tradition, facilities and fan support, while still important, all have become secondary issues when it comes to ingredients for success in college athletics. You know what really matters most? NIL and the ability to attract players in the transfer portal, that’s what. This is no longer amateur sports. It’s pay-for-play. It’s professional sports in every respect.
The first question recruits ask: What can you pay me? The first question any prospective coach will ask Mississippi State: How much money will I get to pay players? In Monday’s press release announcing the dismissal of Lemonis, Selmon was quoted as saying State’s baseball “NIL offerings” are second to none. There’s no way of knowing for sure, but I have heard otherwise from numerous sources.
 I hate that we have reached this point in college athletics, but we most assuredly have. I also hate that Lemonis, a good man and a good coach, doesn’t get the chance to finish the season. I thought he had earned that.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/07084848/AP_443445095797.jpg,,,2025-04-29 17:10:12.616239

(Courtesy of Idaho National Laboratory)Officials with the state of Idaho and the U.S. Department of Energy have agreed to a waiver of the state’s 1995 nuclear waste settlement agreement, the two sides announced Tuesday.
The new waiver will allow for the shipment of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho for the purposes of conducting research at Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho, officials said.
The waiver specifically allows for a high burnout nuclear fuel cask from the North Anna Power Station, a commercial nuclear power plant located in Virginia, to be sent to Idaho National Laboratory for research, according to a press release issued Tuesday.

The waiver was necessary because the 1995 settlement agreement called for limiting shipments of, and removing certain types of, spent nuclear fuel in Idaho.
“The collaborative effort between the state of Idaho, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Idaho National Laboratory showcases our commitment to advancing nuclear energy research while upholding the goals of the 1995 Settlement Agreement,” Little said in a written statement.
“We are proud to support innovation in nuclear energy that will support national security and energy independence into the future.”
Research at INL to support licensing for extended storage of spent fuel at nuclear power plants
Idaho National Laboratory, or INL, is one of 17 Department of Energy national labs, and it employs or contacts with about 6,400 researchers and support staff.
Much of the nuclear research and energy research conducted by Idaho National Laboratory occurs at a vast research complex referred to as “the site” that is located in the eastern Idaho desert, between the town of Arco and Idaho Falls.
“Idaho National Laboratory is DOE’s lead lab for nuclear energy research and development, and it is critical that we continue to grow this research capacity and maintain American competitiveness,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a written statement. “This agreement between the State of Idaho and DOE ensures the lab can continue its cutting-edge research to advance nuclear technology, helping to meet President Trump’s commitment to unleash American energy dominance.”
In today’s press release, state and federal officials said the research will provide data to support licensing for the extended storage of spent fuel at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states.
“As the nation’s center for nuclear energy research and development, we look forward to utilizing our unique facilities and expertise to support this critical national need,” Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner said in a written statement. “We are thankful to the Department of Energy and the state of Idaho for entrusting us with the safe and secure execution of our vital mission.”
1995 settlement agreement came after environmental, health concerns from disposal of nuclear waste in Idaho
As part of the new waiver, Idaho National Laboratory will also be allowed to safely manage small amounts of spent nuclear fuel from domestic university reactors. Without the waiver, some U.S. universities could have been forced to shut down their research reactors due to limits on spent fuel storage, officials said.
Signed in October 1995 by then-Gov. Phil Batt, the 1995 settlement agreement resolved a lawsuit filed by the state amid public concern about environmental and health resulting from disposal of nuclear waste in Idaho. The lawsuit was filed in order to keep Idaho from becoming a dumping ground for the country’s spent nuclear fuel, according to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality.

How’s that for regressive? 
Employment Security Department numbers show that middle- and upper-income people use paid leave far more than those with lower incomes. In fact, people making $60 or more an hour used the fund nearly twice as much as the lowest wage earners in fiscal year 2024. Meanwhile, full-time workers of all incomes already lose hundreds of dollars a year to this tax. (Calculate your losses here: https://paidleave.wa.gov/estimate-your-paid-leave-payments/.)  
The Paid Family and Medical Leave program is no safety net. It makes most workers less able to pay for the life needs they do have. The Legislature should have considered ending it this year.
Instead, lawmakers considered Senate Bill 5292, which in the end proposed taxing workers up to $2 of every $100 in earnings in the coming years for a benefit many will never see. That new, higher rate would’ve been more than double the current tax. The bill died, but the proposal could still be considered again next session. That’s likely because the funding now available for the program doesn’t cover its costs.
The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee said that administrative costs and benefits exceeded revenue for the paid-leave program in two of its first four years. And in 2023, the program got a $200 million bailout from the state’s general fund to deal with higher-than-expected claims. The fix was temporary, however. A state consultant forecasts that the program will likely see negative net income again in three of the next five years. 
That’s not hard to understand. People like it when other taxpayers help pay for their life wants and needs — especially when a portion of their wages has contributed to a pool of money during their working years.
Already burdensome
This year, the tax for the program is already 92 cents on every $100 a worker earns — up to the 2025 Social Security cap of $176,100. That’s more than twice the amount when the tax began in 2019 at 40 cents per $100 of earnings. (Employees pay about 72% of this tax. Employers contribute about 28% on behalf of their employees. That’s money that then can’t go toward increased worker pay or other benefits.)
The most recent version of Senate Bill 5292 outlined increases in the 1.2% Paid Family and Medical Leave tax rate cap. The bill called for raising it to 1.4% in 2027 and 2028, 1.6% in 2029 and 2030, 1.8% in 2031 and 2032, and 2% for 2033 and subsequent years.
While some supporters of this harmful worker tax brag that thousands have been helped by it, they fail to mention that millions of workers have not. And for some of those workers, making ends meet is more difficult because of it. The paid-leave tax penalty state lawmakers have placed on workers puts self-sufficiency further out of reach for some Washingtonians and should end. 
Federal law already allows workers 12 weeks of job-protected, unpaid family leave. It doesn’t pay people not to work while taxing those who do work but don’t have the luxury of taking weeks off, even with paid leave.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/taxes-coins-blocks-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 16:09:17.570475

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Analysis of potential congressional cuts to Medicaid indicated Kansas’ loss of nearly $350 million in the first year and more than $3 billion over 10 years could shrink coverage for vulnerable populations, escalate family medical debt and raise the risk of hospital closures.
Reductions in federal financing of Medicaid could lead to downsizing by 5% to 15% the number of Medicaid enrollees in Kansas and trigger a decline of 22% in Medicaid funding to hospitals in the state. Kansas has two-dozen rural hospitals at risk of immediate closure. Shrinking federal funding to Medicaid could add to the burden of uncompensated patient care and threaten hospitals operating on narrow margins.
The findings were in a report released Tuesday by REACH Healthcare Foundation and United Methodist Health Ministry Fund, both health-related philanthropies serving Kansans. The report incorporated analysis from Manatt Health, which provides strategic, policy and legal advisory services in the health care industry.
Impetus for the projections was upcoming debate in Congress on a goal of cutting $880 billion in federal spending on Medicaid in the next decade.
“The data is clear and deeply concerning,” said David Jordan, president and CEO of United Methodist Health Ministry Fund. “We will all pay the price – higher costs, increases in local taxes and less access to care – to offset these cuts. It’s critical that lawmakers, health care providers, advocates and the people of Kansas recognize the consequences before it’s too late.”
United Methodist Health Ministry Fund is a statewide foundation that has worked since 1986 to improve the health of Kansans.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program offering health coverage to lower-income Kansas children, seniors, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Medicaid enrolls 366,000 Kansans, including 31% of the state’s children. Medicaid supports four of seven nursing home residents in Kansas as well as one in four working-age adults in the state who have a disability, the report said.
There is interest among congressional Republicans in adopting a national work requirement for recipients of Medicaid. The Kansas Medicaid program, known as KanCare, doesn’t extend coverage to working-age adults regardless of income unless the recipient was a parent, caregiver or a person with a disability.
“Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds in Kansas and any cuts to the program will have severe economic and health impacts felt in every corner of the state,” said Brenda Sharpe, president and CEO of REACH Healthcare Foundation.
REACH is a charitable organization striving to improve access to quality, affordable care for uninsured and medically underserved residents of Johnson, Wyandotte and Allen counties in Kansas and Jackson, Cass and Lafayette counties in Missouri.
Manatt Health relied on computer modeling to produce one-year and 10-year projections for Medicaid based on the idea of reducing federal expenditures by $880 billion within a decade. The work by Manatt Health was released before Congress completed work on spending adjustments, but the assessment aligned with policy parameters, options and effective dates outlined by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Medicaid-cut-report-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-29 16:09:17.570475

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)A coalition of Colorado’s Republican members of Congress, Republican state lawmakers, county sheriffs and the Colorado State Shooting Association want U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the constitutionality of nearly 20 state gun laws they say infringe on Second Amendment rights.
In a letter sent Monday, the group asked Bondi to take up the review using the Second Amendment Enforcement Task Force her office established in early April.
“Over the past few years, the State of Colorado and some of its larger cities and political subdivisions have, through a progression of increasingly oppressive and burdensome statutes and ordinances, engaged in a systemic and unrelenting campaign designed to restrict, impair, impede and ultimately extinguish Coloradans’ right to bear arms in violation of our Constitution,” the letter reads.
House Republicans sent a similar request to Bondi’s office a few weeks ago, but now more people are on board, including the state Senate Republican caucus, Colorado’s four Republican members of Congress, and 14 county sheriffs. The Colorado State Shooting Association is the state branch of the National Rifle Association.

They urged Bondi to investigate Colorado’s “anti-Second Amendment agenda” and identify “federal remedies” including litigation. They also want an assessment of how the laws impact “law-abiding citizens” and rural residents, hunters, people in poverty and people who rely on guns for self defense.
The letter mentions laws including the state’s high capacity ammunition law, “red flag” law, waiting period requirement, minimum age requirement and expanded training for concealed carry permits. The majority of the laws called out in the letter were passed in the last three years.
It also highlights Senate Bill 25-3, signed into law earlier this month, that sets training requirements to purchase most semiautomatic firearms with detachable magazines. The law is set to go into effect in August 2026. It passed the Legislature with entirely Democratic support.
The letter says that the new law fails to meet the “constitutional benchmarks” set by a series of gun-related U.S. Supreme Court cases. Throughout the lawmaking process, however, bill sponsors asserted that they believe it would stand up to a legal challenge. Colorado joins states including California, Washington and Oregon that require training to buy certain guns.
“I think this bill will make Colorado’s communities safer and prevent accidents as well as reduce gun violence, ultimately saving lives while protecting our Second Amendment rights,” Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said as he signed SB-3.
In a statement, Attorney General Phil Weiser said SB-3 was “commonsense.”
“Colorado communities — from Aurora and Colorado Springs to Boulder and Littleton — have been devastated by gun violence. While each mass killing brings unique pain and trauma, they all have one thing in common: weapons that are more suited for war than for self-defense or hunting,” he said in an email. “I will continue to go to court to defend Colorado and our laws whenever they are attacked by the gun lobby or Washington, DC.”
It is likely SB-3 will face litigation from gun-rights groups.
The federal task force is composed of Bondi, the yet-to-be-confirmed associate attorney general, and representatives from the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division and Civil Rights Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It has not yet met.

School district officials, educators did not keep information from high schooler’s parents or violate mother’s religious rights, federal judge concludes.
The post Judge: Rock Springs school didn’t violate parental rights in transgender pronoun case appeared first on WyoFile .","Sweetwater County educators did not keep information from the parents of a Rock Springs high school student who asked to be called by a preferred name and pronouns, a federal judge ruled Monday.
U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl reached that conclusion en route to dismissing a lawsuit brought by the child’s parents, who had alleged the district violated their rights by deliberately concealing information about their child’s name and pronoun choices. The student’s mother, a public school teacher in Sweetwater County, further alleged that her First Amendment religious rights were violated by district policies that direct staff about how to handle students’ preferred names and pronouns.
Skavdahl rebuffed both allegations, agreeing with Sweetwater County School District 1 lawyers that the case should be decided in the educators’ favor before it reached a jury.
“The undisputed facts establish that Defendants did not withhold or knowingly misrepresent any information regarding the Student from or to Plaintiff, and thus did not interfere with this right,” Skavdahl wrote. “Neither did Defendants’ conduct burden Plaintiff’s First Amendment right to freely exercise her religious beliefs as a parent or unconstitutionally interfere with her right to freely exercise her religious beliefs as a teacher.”
The student’s parents, Ashley and Sean Willey, sued Sweetwater County School District 1 leaders and educators in April 2023. They asked the court to bar the district from using any names or pronouns other than the ones their teenager was given at birth without prior written consent. 
Ashley Willey also asked the court to block the district from forcing her, as a teacher, to use her students’ preferred pronouns or names. Willey did not use students’ preferred pronouns and names as a teacher, and she testified she was never disciplined or retaliated against for her decision, according to Skavdahl’s ruling.
The Willey family filed the lawsuit amid rising concerns, often expressed by conservative-leaning parents, that schools were influencing student decisions about gender identity. That spurred efforts to ban or limit access to certain LGBTQ+ books at school and public libraries in Wyoming. State lawmakers also brought measures designed to prevent school districts and public employees from being required to use preferred pronouns and names, while requiring schools to provide parents with more information about their children. A school district pronoun bill died in the state Senate while the state-employee focused legislation became law without Gov. Mark Gordon’s signature.

Earlier this year, Wyoming’s schools superintendent, Megan Degenfelder, also pushed for a requirement that schools receive parental consent before using a child’s preferred name or pronouns.
Parental rights, district obligations
In the Willeys’ lawsuit, the parents alleged their child asked teachers and staff at Black Butte High School in Rock Springs to be called by a male name and pronouns starting in the 2021-22 school year. They accused the district of keeping that development from them by continuing to use the child’s gender assigned at birth in their presence, while using the teen’s preferred name and pronouns in school. 
During depositions, three school staff members testified they used the student’s preferred name and pronouns during the 2021-22 school year. Another teacher did so in an email exchange during the 2022-23 school year.
The Willeys asserted that the district should have proactively informed them about their child’s change in name and pronouns because parents have a right to make decisions about their children’s well-being, including their physical and mental health. 
But Skavdahl noted that such a stance would be impractical, as there are a “laundry list of circumstances that could affect a child’s ‘well-being’ even in the slightest that would require constant, detailed information sharing from the school, with constitutional consequences.”
The judge agreed that parents have a right to know about their child’s gender identity choices if parents seek that information from schools. But he drew a distinction between a district knowingly keeping that information from a parent and a district that provides such information only when asked.
“The Court does not think the information can properly be deemed ‘withheld’ to infringe on parental rights unless a parent inquired into or sought the information and it was intentionally concealed or they were lied to,” Skavdahl wrote. “Otherwise, an infinite amount of information would be deemed ‘withheld’ by schools on a daily basis in violation of parental rights.”
“The District and its staff members merely respected the Student’s voluntary choice to be referred to by preferred name and pronouns,” the judge wrote later in the opinion. “Neither the District nor its staff members required the Student go by preferred name or pronouns nor did they ‘discourage students from discussing their gender identities with their parents.’”
Moreover, the school district shared information with the parents about their child’s preferred name and pronouns when that information was sought, the judge noted.
Skavdahl also rejected the Willeys’ arguments that educators facilitated the student’s gender transition socially, and thus, invalidated the parents’ right to make medical decisions for their teen.
“Plaintiff offers no evidence that the school provided any type of ‘medical transition’ or even ‘facilitated’ the Student’s ‘social transitioning,’” Skavdahl wrote. “Defendants were not involved in changing the Student’s clothing or hairstyle. Plaintiff did not set forth any facts that staff members even encouraged or suggested the Student engage in such behaviors, but simply that staff members passively respected the Student’s request to be referred to by preferred name and pronouns.”
Freedom of religion
Skavdahl also denied Ashley Willey’s claims that the district violated her freedom of religion, both as a parent and as a teacher. She had argued the district’s failure to inform her about her child’s gender identity changes interfered with her religious beliefs because it kept her from information she needed to counsel her child.
But that reasoning would create an obligation on the part of the district to foster the exercise of Willey’s religious beliefs, the judge wrote.
To conclude that the District’s failure to act in accordance with Plaintiff’s religious beliefs is a constitutional violation would turn the First Amendment on its head.”Judge scott skavdahl
“Plaintiff’s allegations, more plainly, are that the District staff members’ use, at the Student’s request, of preferred name and pronouns were counter to Plaintiff’s own religious beliefs,” he wrote. “However, a person’s constitutional right to freely exercise their own religious beliefs does not require that the state also exercise those same religious beliefs … To conclude that the District’s failure to act in accordance with Plaintiff’s religious beliefs is a constitutional violation would turn the First Amendment on its head.”
As to Wiley’s assertions that being required to follow the district’s policies concerning preferred pronouns and names violated her religious rights, Skavdahl was unswayed. Those policies were “neutral laws of general applicability,” they don’t raise concerns about the free exercise of religion and must only be “rationally related to a legitimate government interest” to be considered constitutional. That interest, Skavdahl wrote, involved promoting an educational environment that’s both respectful and without discrimination.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The rate at which South Carolina women died because of pregnancy complications spiked in 2021, following years of decline, according to an analysis of the most recent data released Tuesday.
More rural health care, group doctor’s appointments and telehealth could help reduce the number of health issues women experience during and after pregnancy, suggests a report by the South Carolina Institute of Medicine and Public Health.
Better and more accessible health care could have prevented nearly 90% of pregnancy-related deaths in 2021, the latest year evaluated, the report found.
“We know that we have an infant and maternal mortality crisis in our state,” said Lisa Waddell, chair of the taskforce that wrote the report. “Moms are dying unnecessarily. Infants continue to die and don’t survive until their first year of life. And there are things that we can do.”
Maternal mortality
In 2021, 47 of every 100,000 live births in the state resulted in the mother’s deaths before, during or after delivery, according to a state committee’s analysis. The data consistently lags about three years.
For Black women, that ratio was nearly 72 for every 100,000 births. For white women, it was about 37.
That’s an increase from 2020, when the statewide maternal mortality rate was 32 for every 100,000 births. While maternal mortality rates for Black mothers steadily increased for at least four years, the rate for white mothers dropped from 2018 to 2020 before spiking again in 2021, according to committee data.
The exact reasons why are not clear because so many factors play into maternal mortality, said Maya Pack, executive director of the Institute of Medicine and Public Health. But it seems like spikes in COVID-19, which complicated risk factors already associated with pregnancy, contributed to the increase, Waddell said.
Between 2018 and 2021, the No. 1 cause of maternal deaths was infection, specifically from COVID-19, according to the report. Despite emerging in 2020, COVID-19 accounted for nearly 14% of deaths for pregnant women and new mothers during those four years, the report found.
With the virus being less of a concern, the hope is that the ratio of maternal deaths caused by COVID-19 infections has decreased in recent years, Waddell said.
Even in that case, though, the maternal mortality rate remains much higher than it should be, Pack said. For years, the state has consistently scored among the worst in the country for maternal and infant health.
“The persistence of this problem is really troubling,” Pack said.
Part of the problem is that pregnancy often exacerbates a woman’s existing health issues. For instance, if a woman has diabetes before becoming pregnant, as about one-third of people in the state do, that can cause life-threatening issues during pregnancy, according to the report.
“If we could promote healthier lifestyles and healthier communities throughout our state at all times, the women who are going to become pregnant are going to be more likely to be healthy and therefore have a healthier pregnancy and have a healthier baby,” Pack said.
Women in rural areas, where health care is less accessible, are especially at risk, the report found.
Some women must travel upwards of an hour to reach the closest birthing hospital or obstetrician and gynecologist. Since 2012, 13 labor and delivery units have closed in the state, and about one quarter of hospitals don’t offer obstetric care, according to the report.
“The farther a woman travels to their birthing hospital, the greater the risk of maternal morbidity outcomes,” the report states.
Women in rural areas are also less likely to have health insurance and to be able to afford prenatal and postpartum care. That translates to less revenue for the medical services that do exist in rural areas, causing fewer to locate there and worsening the problem, according to the report.
Health issues for rural women often come at a high cost to the state. Rural women are more likely to use Medicaid to pay for health care services, with the state-funded health insurance covering 71% of rural deliveries compared to 60% statewide, according to the report.
Increased Medicaid costs for maternal health, especially for emergency services on which women in rural areas often rely, amounted to about $357 million in 2019, according to the report.
“This is a great state to live in, but we need to ensure that our mothers are safe, that our infants are surviving,” Waddell said. “Anything less than that is not OK.”
Solutions
Some solutions are already in place to help pregnant women and new mothers access health care.
In January, the state Medicaid agency received a $17 million grant, to be handed out over the coming decade, “to invest in improving maternal health care for South Carolinians enrolled in the Health Connections Medicaid program,” according to the report.
The Department of Public Health is expected to launch mobile maternal health clinics over the summer in an effort to help reach women in rural areas without other nearby care.
Expanding programs already in place could address part of the problem, Pack said. Some programs have seen good results but operate only in specific cities or counties, she said.
Those organizations could also use more resources to increase awareness of services for mothers who may not know they have other options, she said.
“Understanding the resources available to one’s family at the community level is a big part of that health literacy,” Pack said.
Even as health professionals faced rising maternal mortality rates, the prevalence of programs trying to address the problems give researchers hope, they said Tuesday. That shows people are aware of the problem and trying to help, Waddell said.
Still, there’s more to be done. The report makes a dozen recommendations to help increase access to care, bolster the health care workforce and teach both doctors and patients more about maternal care, including other risk factors, such as mental health and substance use issues.
For instance, a grant program similar to the one the state’s Medicaid agency used to encourage hospitals to open more behavioral health care units could similarly increase maternal care in areas that need it, according to the report.
Group prenatal classes could encourage women to keep up with their appointments and be more engaged with their care. Opening maternal-specific care units in existing public health departments could create more access, even if it’s somewhat limited, the report suggests.
Dedicated transportation systems could help rural women reach health care providers, while more telehealth could allow women in rural areas to chat with their doctors without having to find a way to get to the office, the report suggests.
“All of these various programs that are being recommended will make a difference,” Waddell said. “I’m convinced that they will. We’ve got a lot of energy, optimism and excitement around really wanting to do things that are better for women and infants in our state, and I’m convinced that this report will help.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2176-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 16:09:17.570475

(Screenshot/Capitol TV)Emily Mandel, a senior economist for Moody’s Analytics, opened her presentation to Rhode Island state budget crunchers Tuesday with a caveat:
“You will probably be very tired of hearing the word ‘tariff’ by the end of this.” 
Mandel’s comments came during the Rhode Island’s biannual Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference at the Rhode Island State House.
The twice-a-year conference updating state revenue and spending forecasts aims to help lawmakers shape the state’s fiscal 2026 budget, which will take effect July 1. But Rhode Island’s financial future looks fuzzier than ever as question marks hang over federal funding to state governments and the fallout from the international trade war.
“Recession risks remain very high, and it’s evolving day by day,” Mandel said. “It will feel somewhat recession-adjacent.”
The average tariff rate of 21%, based on the existing 145% reciprocal tariffs with China and 10% tariff on goods from all other countries, is the highest the United States has seen since 1909.
“It’s not unprecedented, but it’s unprecedented over the last century,” Mandel said.
The country, and by extension Rhode Island, will see job growth and wages stagnate as consumer and business costs surge as tariff consequences take hold this summer. Assuming Trump backs off the tariff policies — still a major if — economic recovery is expected by 2027, according to Moody’s latest forecast.
Meanwhile, cuts to federal funding, including for Medicaid, threaten to devastate Rhode Island, which relies on an outsized share of federal funding in its spending relative to other states, according to analysis from Pew Charitable Trusts.

And, preserving the state’s declining population will become even more challenging as residents flee for less destinations in the South and mid-Atlantic, as well as cheaper New England states like Maine and New Hampshire. 
Moody’s analysts did not name specific income tax policies, such as a millionaire’s tax, as an influence on out-of-state migration. However, they noted that neighboring Massachusetts, which began an extra 4% tax on income over $1 million in 2023, has lost some residents to Rhode Island in recent years.
Legislation introduced in both chambers of the Rhode Island State House calls for a 3% surtax on the top 1% of state earners, setting off the perennial debate over what could be a new state revenue source, or a deterrent to wealthy residents.
Will rich Rhode Islanders flee because of a millionaires tax? Don’t believe it, advocates say.

A new report published Monday by The Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive D.C. think tank, showed the amount of top earners who live in Massachusetts, as well as their collective wealth, has increased since voters passed the “Fair Share Amendment” in 2022.  
Yet the greater Boston metropolitan area has also seen wage growth slow over the last year far more rapidly than the national average, or in the Providence area, according to federal labor data. Kumael Bilgrami, associate economist with Moody’s, blamed Boston’s weak job growth performance on its high cost of living, including housing.
Rhode Island, too, is facing a critical housing shortage that has driven up costs for buyers and renters. The housing crisis is not likely to ease anytime soon; tariffs have sent building material costs skyrocketing, suppressing demand for residential permits, while stricter federal immigration policies make it harder for the construction industry to keep and retain its foreign-born workforce, Bilgrami said.
Yet despite its reputation as a “first in, last out” state when it comes to economic recessions and downturns, Rhode Island has a few advantages over the rest of the country.

Chief among them is the state’s labor market, which has continued to enjoy strong employment growth relative to national and regional averages. The 515,600 jobs recorded in Rhode Island in March 2025 is the highest on record, according to Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training data. While the unemployment rate has ticked up to 4.8% as of March, and is expected to hit 5% by the end of 2025, Rhode Island continues to outperform the country and neighboring states, Massachusetts and Connecticut.
Another advantage for the state’s job market is its diversity of industries, which offers some “insulation” from the consequences of tariffs, Bilgrami said.
Rhode Island boasts an outsized share of finance, education and health care jobs relative to its total labor market, which will be shielded from tariff policies more than other industries like manufacturing.
“We think health care is going to remain relatively stable,” Mandel said.
Job growth forecast for Rhode Island through fiscal 2030 remains relatively unchanged from the last Revenue Estimating Conference in November. Moody’s has revised its projections for state employment upwards slightly since November.
Also consistent with November forecasts are the state’s “housing starts,” or increases in its housing supply, which remain low through the end of the decade, but not much worse now than six months previously.
The forecast does not account for slashing up to $880 billion in federal Medicaid spending nationwide, which would have dramatic consequences in Rhode Island, where federal funds supply more than half of the state’s annual Medicaid budget. The updated financial projections also don’t consider other federal funding cuts beyond the firing of 400,000 federal workers, most of whom are not based out of Rhode Island.
The May Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference continues through May 9, when budget crunchers will update the amount of budget surplus, or deficit, expected heading into fiscal 2026, and beyond.

David Standridge, R-Hayden, points on the floor of the Alabama House of Representatives on April 30, 2024 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A bill that would have required Alabama to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America” fail to pass an Alabama Senate committee Tuesday.
HB 247, sponsored by Rep. David Standridge, R-Hayden and called the Gulf of America Act, would have required all state and local entities and their employees to refer to the body of water as the “Gulf of America,” following President Donald Trump’s preference.
“We know the president did an executive order changing the name, and all the federal agencies are using that they’ve officially adopted, that the federal agencies have also since that time,” Standridge said to the committee, adding that some states have moved to change the name.

The legislation, which passed the House on April 18, would have also mandated that reasonable efforts be made to update pre-existing resources, unless it imposes an operational or financial burden on the entities. An exception allowed the term “Gulf of Mexico” to be used in academic instruction for historical purposes in public K-12 schools and institutions of higher education.
Democratic senators on the committee asked about the cost of implementing the name change. Senator Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove, said the bill’s fiscal note states it would increase “administrative obligations” of state and local governments, but it does not state the amount.
“We’re supposed to be good stewards of the taxpayers’ dollars. So, do we have any idea how much of this is going to cost the taxpayers?” Coleman asked.
Standridge said “that is unknown” because the bill provides an exception if it would “impose an operational or financial burden” on state and local government.
The committee deadlocked on whether to report the bill on a 4-4 tie, effectively killing it. 
In response to the bill and President Donald Trump’s executive order, the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico plans to change its name to the National Maritime Museum of the Gulf. The move was first reported by Lagniappe Daily.
“This change reflects the museum’s commitment to celebrating the rich history, ecology, and economic impact of this incredible body of water. Known by many names throughout its history, the Gulf has played a profound role in shaping the economy and culture of Mobile and other coastal communities from Texas to Florida,” said Karen Poth, executive director, in a statement on Tuesday.
The museum plans to implement the change in stages, according to Jason Johnson, a spokesperson for the Museum.  Physical printed materials will be updated as new orders are placed, and digital platforms are in the process of being changed.
While the name change is not expected to create new costs for the museum, updates to signage could cost approximately $40,000. 
There are currently no plans to update the name in existing or developing exhibits due to the extensive costs involved. Future exhibits will use “Gulf of America,” and an additional exhibit will reflect the name change and the Gulf’s historical names.

Glenn Youngkin's Spirit of Virginia PAC. (Photo courtesy of John Reid) Amid a political firestorm, John Reid’s continued campaign for lieutenant governor — the first time an openly gay candidate of any party has run for statewide election in Virginia — represents a litmus test at the intersection of politics, sexuality, gender and privacy in the digital age.
Youngkin’s political adviser under fire as extortion allegations rock Virginia GOP

After a Tumblr account with the same name as Reid’s shared sexually explicit images of men, Gov. Glenn Youngkin asked Reid to drop out of the race last Friday. Reid, who wasn’t in any of the online photos and has denied that the account is his, refused, saying he “won’t back down.” He also accused Youngkin’s PAC of extortion and some members of his party of attacking him because of his sexual identity.
“Let’s be honest: It’s because I’m openly gay and I have never bowed down to the establishment and I will not,” Reid said in a video response. 
So-called sex scandals involving heterosexual men are not new in U.S. politics. From dozens of members of Congress to presidents including Thomas Jeffferson, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, most of their political careers survived scrutiny from constituents and colleagues. 
The same isn’t generally true for women in the political arena, where cultural norms about gender and sexuality have often prompted heightened scrutiny and scorn for female candidates and lawmakers. 
Former California congresswoman Katie Hill resigned after her nude images were shared on a right-wing blog in what she called “a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation,” and her admission of an extramarital affair with a woman campaign staffer. 
Virginia’s own Susanna Gibson faced online harassment and a chorus of calls to drop out of her 2023 state House of Delegates race when her sexually explicit live-stream video with her ex-husband, which they released to a limited audience on a porn site, was recorded and shared widely without their consent. 
“We have that culture of ‘boys will be boys’” said Virginia Wesleyan University professor Leslie Caughell, whose work focuses on the intersection of gender and politics. “Gibson (and others) didn’t get that treatment because ‘women aren’t supposed to do this.’” 
In his recently posted videos since the news broke, Reid has repeatedly emphasized that he is being targeted for his sexuality. 
“He knows that the rules that apply to a heterosexual man don’t apply to him,” Caughell said. 
“I am sickened and outraged at the weeks of veiled accusations and attacks on my family,” Reid said in a video posted to his campaign’s Facebook page Sunday. “I’m not going to continue to answer a never ending parade of questions and false accusations from people who we now know are solely motivated to stage a coup against a gay man, whom they didn’t want to be their nominee, but didn’t have the guts to run against.”
In a form of protest over the controversy, Phil Kazmierczak, a member of Youngkin’s LGBTQ+ Advisory Board, resigned from his position over the weekend.
Kazmierczak said in his resignation letter that he was “deeply shocked” Youngkin “would involve himself in a diabolical attack of this nature.” 
Even as Reid’s campaign emerged, this year’s legislative session showed that many Virginia Republican elected officials do not appear to support same-sex marriage. Though such unions are federally protected by a near-decade-old U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Virginia’s state constitution still has a defunct ban on them. 
A Democrat-led effort to undo this is underway and earlier this year, most Republicans in the House and the state Senate either voted against the measure or abstained from voting. It will need to pass both chambers again next year, where, should Reid become lieutenant governor, he could be a potential tie-breaking vote. All seats in the House are up for election in November.
Democrats have argued that without removing the ban, Virginians’ marriages could be at risk if the Supreme Court reversed its stance on same-sex marriage — a possibility Justice Clarence Thomas has expressed interest in doing.
If Reid were to drop out, the Republican Party of Virginia’s state central committee members would need to select someone to run in his stead. June 17 is the deadline for candidates from both or third parties to qualify for the November ballots. 
 Weaponizing sexuality in political contexts

Like Reid, defying critics to stay in the race is familiar ground for Gibson, who narrowly lost her 2023 House campaign in the competitive 57th District.

Though she said she agreed to her ex-husband’s request to live-stream sex acts on a porn website, they did not consent to it being recorded and shared beyond their initial, limited audience. After an anonymous “Republican operative” sent the content to The Washington Post in 2023 just before early voting started in Virginia, an echo of pundits noted potential uphill battle for her campaign. The Republican Party of Virginia later sent out mailers with screenshots from the live stream. 
She, like Reid, didn’t back down.
But behind the scenes, she endured the trauma of the situation along with subsequent online harassment. She said she’d received death threats and people loitered outside her home during the scandal. At one point a false call was placed to law enforcement, resulting in officers showing up at her house. The act, referred to as “swatting,” is often a tactic to target or harass public figures or activists. 
Following the election, she laid low before later emerging with a PAC dedicated to combatting the nonconsensual sharing of intimate digital images. A model policy the group wrote has been carried and advanced through both Republican and Democrat-leaning states. Gibson consulted with Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax, to adjust the statute of limitations on prosecuting “revenge porn” and other such crimes in Virginia. 
At the federal level, a bill to punish people who publish revenge porn — whether actual images of targeted individuals or artificially-generated ones — has recently cleared congress and is on its way to Trump’s desk. 
While the Tumblr account purported to be Reid’s shared other people’s content, it’s unclear if they had consented.
Virginia’s extortion laws make it a crime to threaten a person’s reputation, safety, property or immigration status to gain money, property or financial benefit. It’s a Class 5 felony in the state to use threats, accusations of criminal conduct or the misuse of immigration documents as leverage for personal or monetary gain. Potential legal battles could be on the horizon if Reid does pursue a suit against the governor’s PAC for alleged extortion. Reid’s lawyer has also sent a cease and desist letter to Moran. 
Political analysts have posited that as technology evolves and younger people enter politics, the risk of digital sexual content being used against candidates may increase. The sharing of intimate images to publicly shame or tarnish someone most often happens to women, multiple studies show, but it can happen to anyone. 
Gibson’s perspective on Reid’s predicament is nuanced, she said, because he used his platform as a radio host to call her a “legislative hooker” two years ago during the scandal she was at the center of. Still, she understands the myriad of feelings he may be coping with now as some in his own party have turned on him, and said it’s unacceptable for him to be targeted because he’s gay. 
“The attacks on Reid for his sexual expression are completely inappropriate and incredibly harmful and damaging, not only to him, but to his family and to the democratic process,” she said.
Gibson also took aim at Matt Moran, a Youngkin adviser who is involved with the governor’s PAC. 
“This is the second state election in a row that Matt Moran and Glenn Youngkin have attacked a candidate that they did not like on their sexuality,” she said. “It raises concerns for future elections and leadership of, honestly, both parties being willing to weaponize people’s sexuality and sexual expression in order to achieve some kind of partisan political outcome.” 
From her own experience, to “sexting” that becomes public, to the allegations against Reid which he’s so far denied, she worries these situations may discourage  people from running for office.
It’s something Caughill wonders about too — particularly concerning women and LGBTQ+ prospective politicians.
“It seems like standards for personal behavior don’t apply evenly to all candidates,” she said. “So you have to wonder if you’re a woman or you’re gay and you’re thinking about running, you might have concerns about what somebody could dig up about you to try to make it into an issue.”
As to Reid’s situation specifically, she said it shows where some of his party falls on supporting LGBTQ+ issues and people. Earlier this year, Reid’s ticket-mates Attorney General Jason Miyares and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears joined Youngkin to boost support for lawmakers’ efforts to ban transgender student athletes from school sports. 
“I think (we’re) seeing some of the Republican Party’s discomfort with many of these transgender and gay issues. Having gay candidates as a voice for their party, at least to some segments, can pose a problem,” Caughell said. “You have to wonder, would Governor Youngkin have been so quick to ask him to step aside if he had been a heterosexual man?”

Kennedy Jr. speaks at a news conference on April 22. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attracted notice — and in some quarters, outrage — for remarks about autism, a topic he’s clashed with scientists about for years.
Kennedy held an April 16 press conference pegged to a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that found the prevalence of autism rising to 1 in 31 among 8-year-olds, the latest in a series of increases in recent decades.
Kennedy said “autism destroys families” and is an “individual tragedy as well.”
Kennedy said many autistic children were “fully functional” and had “regressed” into autism “when they were 2 years old. And these are kids who will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem, they’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”
He also said: “Most cases now are severe. Twenty-five percent of the kids who are diagnosed with autism are nonverbal, non-toilet-trained, and have other stereotypical features.”
Medical experts, along with people on the autism spectrum, told PolitiFact that Kennedy’s portrayal was skewed. A 2023 study written by CDC officials and university researchers found that one-quarter of people on the autism spectrum have severe limitations. But this is on the high end of studies, and many people in that one-quarter of the autism population do not have the limitations Kennedy mentioned.
The vast majority of people on the spectrum do not have those severe challenges.
“I wish he would spend some time with parents of other autistic children, and well-regarded scientists who have studied this condition for decades,” said David Mandell, a University of Pennsylvania psychiatry professor and director of the Penn Center for Mental Health. “He has a fixed, myopic view.”
The Department of Health and Human Services did not provide data on what share of people with autism diagnoses are unable to do the things Kennedy described.
“Secretary Kennedy remains committed to working toward a society where people with autism have access to meaningful opportunities, appropriate supports, and the full respect and recognition they deserve,” department press secretary Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano told PolitiFact. “His statements emphasized the need for increased research into environmental factors contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses, not to stigmatize individuals with autism or their families.”
The Washington Post reported that an HHS spokesperson said Kennedy “was referring to those that are severely affected by this chronic condition” and that “this was in no way a general characterization.”
We took a closer look at the available data and research.
What is autism spectrum disorder?
At root, “autism is a difference in how your child’s brain works that shapes how they interact with the world around them,” according to the Cleveland Clinic. People with autism diagnoses, the clinic says, “may excel more in certain areas and need more support in other areas compared to their neurotypical peers.”
Over the years, autism’s definition and diagnosis has changed.
In the 1950s and 1960s, “it is very likely that many people with profound autism were misdiagnosed with ‘mental retardation,’ a term in use at the time, or schizophrenia, while other autistic people probably got no diagnosis at all,” said John J. Pitney Jr., a Claremont McKenna College politics professor, author of the book “The Politics of Autism: Navigating the Contested Spectrum,” and a father of an autistic son who’s about to graduate from college.
In more recent decades, the diagnostic criteria for autism have broadened, producing a spectrum ranging from severe impacts to more modest ones. Today’s definition encompasses “individuals with milder symptoms, stronger language skills, and higher IQs,” said Christopher Banks, president and CEO of the Autism Society of America.
How common are the more limiting forms of autism?
Autism’s expanded definition means a minority of people on the spectrum have the kinds of severe limitations Kennedy cited, though it’s hard to say how many.
The highest total we found comes from a 2023 federal report, written by CDC officials and university researchers. It found that 26.7% of 8-year-olds with autism had “profound” autism, a newly framed (and not universally accepted) definition that included children who were nonverbal, were minimally verbal, or had an IQ below 50. (“Average” IQ is considered 90 to 109.)
People with profound autism “will require lifetime, round-the-clock care,” said Judith Ursitti, co-founder and president of the Profound Autism Alliance, a nonprofit. Ursitti said her 21-year-old son “is not headed towards employment or a career in poetry or baseball. Acknowledging this fact is important, as this population is often excluded from media portrayals and research.”
Other estimates are lower.
A study published in 2024, by researchers at the University of Utah and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, looked at 1,368 U.S. children with autism. When parents were asked whether they would characterize their child’s autism as “severe,” 10.1% said yes. Among this group of children with “severe” autism, a minority — 38% — were classified as having a “severe” intellectual disability.
“Even among those with an intellectual disability, there’s huge variability,” Mandell said. “People with Down syndrome have an intellectual disability but often are quite capable and can do all the things RFK points to.”
The CDC published data in 2020 showing that 42% of people with autism had an IQ in the average or higher range, and another study has found that this figure could be as high as 60%.
Zoe Gross, the director of advocacy at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, said limited available data suggests that Kennedy’s characterization is exaggerated.
Gross, who is on the spectrum herself, said a 2017 study found that 61% of people on the spectrum who were studied were employed. As for baseball, the Special Olympics, which was founded by Kennedy’s family and includes competitors who are on the spectrum, includes softball. At least two people who played major league baseball, Tarik El-Abour and Jim Eisenreich, were public about their autism diagnoses.
Gross said there is no official data on autistic poets, but she was aware of the poet DJ Savarese, a nonspeaking but highly literate advocate. Gross was also unable to find data on dating, but she said she’s married, and she pointed to the Netflix reality show “Love on the Spectrum,” which follows autistic people’s dating lives. It is now in its third season.
As for not using a toilet unassisted, the 2024 study that analyzed 1,368 U.S. children with autism and found that 10.1% were considered “severe” found that 67% of those in the “severe” category had trouble bathing or dressing, which, if generalizable to the entire autistic population, would be less than 7%. Another study found urinary incontinence reported by 12.5% of the autistic people studied and fecal incontinence by 7.9%.
Eric M. Garcia, who is on the spectrum and who has written the book “We’re Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation,” was covering Kennedy’s remarks as Washington bureau chief of The Independent. Hearing his words “felt so demoralizing,” Garcia told PolitiFact. “A lot of people will respond by saying, ‘He didn’t mean autistic people like you.’ But that doesn’t make it any better.”

Judge rejects effort to block noncitizen voting in Burlington 

by Auditi Guha

Because school budgets have statewide implications — school budgets are determined locally but are ultimately funded by the state — only U.S. citizens should be allowed to vote on them, the group’s suit claims.Chittenden County Superior Court Judge Samuel Hoar Jr. dismissed the case in February. The RITE group is now asking the state’s highest court to weigh in.The case is being headed by Brady Toensing, a former vice chair of the state GOP who also served in the Department of Justice during President Donald Trump’s first term. Attorneys Patrick Strawbridge and James Hasson are also listed on the appeal.While noncitizen voting is not permitted in federal elections, Vermont is one of several states to allow it in local elections. In addition to Burlington, both Winooski and Montpelier allow noncitizen voting.The national and state branches of the Republican Party sued both of those cities over the issue in 2021, alleging that their noncitizen voting measures were unconstitutional. Both lawsuits were eventually dismissed, though one was appealed. In January 2023, the Vermont Supreme Court upheld a 2022 Washington Superior civil court decision to dismiss the suit against Montpelier. The Supreme Court ruled then that Montpelier’s charter provision did not violate the state’s constitution.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Conservative group challenging noncitizen voting in Burlington appeals to Vermont Supreme Court.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/election-day-burlington-8-20221108.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 16:09:17.570475

The new waiver will allow for the shipment of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho for the purposes of conducting research at Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho, officials said.
The waiver specifically allows for a high burnout nuclear fuel cask from the North Anna Power Station, a commercial nuclear power plant located in Virginia, to be sent to Idaho National Laboratory for research, according to a press release issued Tuesday.

The waiver was necessary because the 1995 settlement agreement called for limiting shipments of, and removing certain types of, spent nuclear fuel in Idaho. 
“The collaborative effort between the state of Idaho, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Idaho National Laboratory showcases our commitment to advancing nuclear energy research while upholding the goals of the 1995 Settlement Agreement,” Little said in a written statement. 
“We are proud to support innovation in nuclear energy that will support national security and energy independence into the future.”
  Research at INL to support licensing for extended storage of spent fuel at nuclear power plants 

Idaho National Laboratory, or INL, is one of 17 Department of Energy national labs, and it employs or contacts with about 6,400 researchers and support staff. 
Much of the nuclear research and energy research conducted by Idaho National Laboratory occurs at a vast research complex referred to as “the site” that is located in the eastern Idaho desert, between the town of Arco and Idaho Falls.

“Idaho National Laboratory is DOE’s lead lab for nuclear energy research and development, and it is critical that we continue to grow this research capacity and maintain American competitiveness,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a written statement. “This agreement between the State of Idaho and DOE ensures the lab can continue its cutting-edge research to advance nuclear technology, helping to meet President Trump’s commitment to unleash American energy dominance.” 
In today’s press release, state and federal officials said the research will provide data to support licensing for the extended storage of spent fuel at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states.
“As the nation’s center for nuclear energy research and development, we look forward to utilizing our unique facilities and expertise to support this critical national need,” Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner said in a written statement. “We are thankful to the Department of Energy and the state of Idaho for entrusting us with the safe and secure execution of our vital mission.”

As part of the new waiver, Idaho National Laboratory will also be allowed to safely manage small amounts of spent nuclear fuel from domestic university reactors. Without the waiver, some U.S. universities could have been forced to shut down their research reactors due to limits on spent fuel storage, officials said.
Signed in October 1995 by then-Gov. Phil Batt, the 1995 settlement agreement resolved a lawsuit filed by the state amid public concern about environmental and health resulting from disposal of nuclear waste in Idaho. The lawsuit was filed in order to keep Idaho from becoming a dumping ground for the country’s spent nuclear fuel, according to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality.  
The new waiver relaxes the annual limit on the amount of spent nuclear fuel and materials that can come into Idaho, officials said. The shipment could occur in 2027 under the waiver.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A bill that would ensure that credits earned from prison-based classes count toward professional licensing requirements has passed in the Florida House of Representatives and is headed to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ desk for consideration.
The House on Tuesday unanimously passed the Senate version (SB 472), sponsored by Central Florida Republican Keith Truenow, which passed unanimously in that chamber earlier this month.
The measure requires the Correctional Education Program (CEP) within the Department of Corrections to provide educational programming to inmates in state correctional facilities. The CEP provides 92 career and technical education courses in 37 vocational trades that are aligned to Florida’s in-demand occupations, including barbering, cosmetology, electrical contracting, landscaping, plumbing, and HVAC contracting, according to a bill analysis.
The CEP has awarded 36,689 certificates and industry-recognized credentials over the last four years. However, these certificates were largely only valid while the people receiving them were incarcerated, and they are not recognized outside of prison, according to the Florida Policy Institute.
The House measure (HB 195) is sponsored by Miami-Dade Democrat Kevin Chambliss and Seminole County Republican Rachel Plakon.
“I’m reminded of the women who are girlfriends, who are wives and even the moms of the loved ones who are incarcerated,” said Plakon. “And the theme that comes up again and again is hope. They say, ‘Please give them something to hope for.’ And I think they’re right, because when someone has served their time and they want to choose a different path, let’s give them the education, let’s give them something to hope for a second chance.”
Chambliss has sponsored a version of this bill for the past several sessions, calling it a “labor of love.”
“We know that our prisons are overcrowded, but we also know that our  labor force has in-demand jobs that are readily available. This bill addresses that,” he said.
The measure is similar to a proposal that Gov. DeSantis vetoed last year, with one major omission.
In his veto message, DeSantis specifically referred to a provision that would have reduced the time from five years to three years that the Barbers’ Board and Board of Cosmetology could use a criminal conviction as ground to deny licenses. He wrote in his message that “there may be good reason for the board to have this information before making a decision regarding a particular applicant.”
This year’s bill does not include that provision.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)Former Doña Ana County Magistrate Court Judge Jose Luis “Joel” Cano and his wife, Nancy Cano, were released on separate $10,000 bonds Tuesday in connection to federal charges of tampering with evidence in an immigration case.
The Canos appeared in U.S. Federal District Court in Las Cruces Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Gregory J. Fouratt. Joel Cano faces one charge of tampering with evidence while Nancy Cano faces a charge of conspiracy to tamper with evidence. The couple’s charges relate to their alleged connection to Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, a Venezuelan national prosecutors allege resides in the U.S. unlawfully and has connections to the Tren de Aragua gang. 
The Canos have been in custody at the Doña Ana County Detention Center since Friday, according to the jail’s website. They appeared in court Tuesday in shackles, alongside over 70 other people facing criminal charges who were waiting to have their cases heard. The room had standing room only, and viewers included several of the Canos’ neighbors.
Fouratt agreed to release both defendants on $10,000 secured bonds, on the condition that they: provide DNA samples; notify the court of any address changes; surrender their passports and eschew new travel documents; don’t associate with Ortega-Lopez and avoid contact with possible witnesses to the case; don’t leave Doña Ana County without his approval; and provide pretrial service officials with information about their renters.
The Canos told Fouratt that they own nine rental properties and all but one are occupied. The judge said they must ensure they rent only to U.S. citizens or immigrants legally allowed to live in the U.S. Fouratt also said they must provide pretrial services with information about their renters and any overnight guests outside of immediate family.
The judge permitted the couple to continue to reside together in their long-time home, despite prosecutors’ worries that they might discuss the case. Fouratt said he could not legally restrict topics of conversation between married couples. 
“I want you to have a chance to convince any other judge you see” that the decisions the couple made related to this case were outside of their usual “decision-making,” Fouratt said during the hearing.
The U.S. Department of Justice announced the charges against the Canos in the same news release in which they announced the arrest of a Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan for allegedly allowing a Mexican immigrant charged with domestic violence to temporarily avoid arrest by federal agents.
The Canos have not yet entered pleas to the charges, and neither of them have yet been scheduled for an arraignment hearing, according to court records.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee and top health care officials unveiled a new set of plans to mend Rhode Island’s ailing primary care system Tuesday, with strategies like grants for helping clinics serve more patients and asking big commercial insurers to pay more.
The Ocean State’s dearth of primary care doctors won’t be solved entirely, or even quickly. And the plan announced at a State House news conference by McKee and his Health Care System Planning Cabinet came a day before Anchor Medical Associates closes its Warwick office with two more set to close by June 30.
“We know that fixing these challenges will not happen overnight,” said Richard Charest, secretary of the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS). “These problems have developed over very many years, and we take and it will take time to rectify that.” 
The state is short about 300 primary care providers, according to Dr. Elizabeth Lange, a pediatrician at Hasbro who attended the conference. 
The all payer claims database shows Rhode Island currently has about 520 primary care providers, said Dr. Jerry Larkin, the state health department’s director.
“So right now, we’re a little bit short,” Larkin told the crowd.
Solutions offered — like bigger primary care payments from commercial insurers, speeding up the Medicaid rate review process, and $5 million in grants for primary care practices — are all part of what McKee called “a full deep dive into all factors that are related to primary care delivery.”
“There’s still important work ahead, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to identify other strategies to strengthen our primary care system,” McKee said. “We know that it is alarming when people in the state of Rhode Island are unable to find a primary care doctor, and we’re going to do everything we can to connect them with the help that they are looking for.”
Anchor Medical Associates on Wednesday will close its Warwick office — the first of the physician group’s three locations which will all be shuttered by June 30. The Anchor closures announced earlier in April will affect about 25,000 patients, mostly children, who now need to find new primary care doctors. Charest told reporters he’d “rather not get into the specifics of that practice,” but characterized the closure being due to “internal operational challenges.”
“If we had been notified earlier, we may have been able to help stabilize that practice,” Charest said. “I think that they were at a position that they had no liquidity at the end.”


McKee’s big ideas to tackle primary care crisis
Accelerating Medicaid rate review for primary care.
Requiring commercial health insurers to increase funding for primary care reimbursements
Reducing red tape by easing prior authorization requirements
Providing grants to help primary care practices serve additional patients and hire new providers
Strengthening fiscal oversight of Rhode Island’s health care system
Expanding the primary care student loan forgiveness program


Low reimbursement the state’s Medicaid program pays providers have frequently been cited as a major contributing factor in the state’s primary care troubles. McKee said he is moving to stabilize the state’s primary care system by filing a budget amendment that would require the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC) to complete the primary care provider rate review process on an accelerated timeline. The rate review would be completed within a year instead of the usual two afforded to the rate review process for human services.
Cory King, the health insurance commissioner, said the rate review would be completed by September 2026 on the new timeline.   
“I don’t set rates. I make recommendations after data driven analysis,” King said. 
That data and King’s recommendations inform EOHHS’ annual budget ask of the governor, which is submitted to the General Assembly in January. If the budget passes with the rates intact, it then goes to the federal government, which pays about half of Medicaid rate increases. If approved by the feds, the rate increases would take effect at the start of fiscal year 2028.
“There’s some administrative tasks that have to happen before the actual rates are implemented,” Kristin Sousa, the Medicaid program director, told reporters. “Traditionally, when the legislature passes the budget, it’s effective on July 1. In this case, July 1 of 2027, we may not be ready to implement on July 1, but it will retro back to July 1.”
Several studies published on primary care in Rhode Island in recent years, including a 2024 study by the Rhode Island Foundation, have found the Ocean State’s reimbursement rates lag far behind Connecticut and Massachusetts. Could that data be used to inform the rate review process?
“I would say, ‘Share the data with us.’ Cuz I haven’t seen it,” McKee said.
King encouraged people to dig into that report’s numbers a little more. The Rhode Island Foundation report was not exclusively focused on provider reimbursement, he said, but rather “hospitals and patient and operation services.” Yes, reimbursement rates in other New England states are higher, King said, but this is consistent with higher health insurance premiums in those states. 










We know that it is alarming when people in the state of Rhode Island are unable to find a primary care doctor, and we’re going to do everything we can to connect them with the help that they are looking for. 


– Gov. Dan McKee


“In Massachusetts, of the 53 hospitals in the inpatient data set, only six hospitals are actually reimbursed at or above the statewide average, And in Connecticut, of the 26 hospitals in the inpatient data set, only eight of those 26 hospitals are reimbursed at or above that statewide average. So there are great variations that we need to consider when looking at reimbursement rates more granularly.”
Still, King cited the importance of primary care investment as a preventative measure for even more health care spending.
“My position has always been that putting money into primary care is a wise investment, as opposed to, say, putting money into emergency department reimbursement,” King said. “Primary care accounts for approximately 6% of what commercial payers pay for health care business services, but it helps control the other 94%.”
For a more immediate fix, McKee is proposing $5 million in grants to help existing practices serve more patients. Clinics can apply for up to $75,000 to take on new patients or up to $300,000 to hire primary care physicians or “mid-level” providers such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants. 
Applications for grants are available online through May 16.
Separately, the state is imposing new regulations on commercial insurers requiring them to double their primary care spending by 2029. The rules also mandate a 20% reduction in prior authorization requirements to help lower administrative burdens on primary care doctors.
‘Slapdash response’ comes too late
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha blasted McKee’s plans in a press release issued about 40 minutes after the press conference ended. 
“The Governor’s health care announcement today is a slapdash response to political and public pressure because of the dissolution of Anchor Medical, and unfortunately, I expected nothing more,” Neronha said.
Neronha, who has established himself as one of McKee’s most vocal critics, said the governor is “hanging his hat” on conducting future studies and reviews. 
“Our PCPs are overworked and overburdened by a state health care system that doesn’t support them,” Neronha said. “Our residents are scrambling to find primary care physicians to care for them through illnesses and fill prescriptions for live-preserving medications. We are in crisis. And some of us have been sounding the alarm for years.”
McKee said at the press event that Rhode Island surpasses many other states for health care access in quality, citing U.S. News and World Report’s ranking of Rhode Island as fifth in the nation in health care overall.
Neronha took issue with McKee’s rosy outlook, saying McKee was “once again showing how out of touch this Governor is with the reality of the situation.”

The resolution comes the same day Trump is slated to return to Michigan in his first visit to the state since retaking the White House last November, with a scheduled rally at Macomb Community College.
Ahead of introducing the resolution Tuesday in the Michigan House, state legislators issued statements decrying Trump for violations of the U.S. Constitution, namely forgoing legal processes in recent deportations. 
The resolution that Democratic state lawmakers are proposing specifically outlines the March deportation of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, where the U.S. Supreme Court has ordered Trump’s administration to “facilitate” his return, which it has not complied with.
Salvadoran officials allow Van Hollen, Abrego Garcia to meet

The Trump administration’s decision to suddenly and without explanation revoke student visas for international students at the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Grand Valley State University is also cause for concern, the resolution reads. And with Trump expressing interest in deporting legal U.S. citizens who are convicted of crimes, the resolution raises concerns that Trump is bypassing the justice system, denying residents protection from government overreach. 
“These cases are representative of a larger policy of reckless abuse of authority to undermine due process and, in turn, the protection of other fundamental American rights such as free speech and freedom of assembly,” the resolution proposed by Michigan state legislators reads.
It is the U.S. House of Representatives sole right to present articles of impeachment outlining supposed offenses by the president and the U.S. Senate’s sole right to hold a subsequent impeachment trial.
The Michigan state House of Representatives has very little oversight on the actions of Trump or his administration, Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) said in a statement sponsoring the resolution supporting impeachment. But state lawmakers are very aware of the sentiments of their districts, Wegela said, and as Trump and his administration act like they are above the checks and balances of government and exempt from the processes of the U.S. legal system, it is the right of state lawmakers to sound alarm bells.
 “Our communities are under assault by this administration, and members of Congress need to take this seriously,” Wegela said. “It is unthinkable that a president would send innocent people to a foreign country’s prison known for its human rights violations. The constitution is clear in regards to due process and the freedom of speech for residents of the United States.”
The news release from Wegela’s office said Reps. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) and Jimmie Wilson Jr. (D-Ypsilanti) have signed on as cosponsors, as well as several others.
The state resolution follows Thanedar’s introduction Monday of a resolution presenting the necessary articles of impeachment to begin an impeachment process, outlining what he called, “unlawful actions [that] have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service.”
Both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate are under Republican control, making any action of Thanedar’s effort unlikely.

Attorneys for the state filed court documents stating their intention to petition the nation’s highest court to overturn a decision from an appellate court that found a state election law conflicted with federal election laws. 
U.S. District Judge Louis Guirrola halted all lower court action until the proceedings with the Supreme Court are completed. 
The Republican National Committee, the state Republican Party and the Libertarian Party of Mississippi sued Secretary of State Michael Watson and local elections officials over a state law that allows election workers to process absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day for up to five days after the election. 
The political parties argue that Congress is the only entity that can set specific parameters for federal elections, while state officials contend that federal law defers to states on specific details for conducting elections.
Judge Guirrola initially ruled in favor of the state, but the plaintiffs appealed. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most conservative appellate courts in the nation, overturned Guirrola’s ruling and struck down the state law. 
Now Mississippi officials are asking the Supreme Court to uphold the state law, a decision that could have broad implications for more than a dozen states that have similar laws on the books. 
The litigation does not impact state or local races, including Mississippi’s current municipal elections.

Glenn Youngkin's Spirit of Virginia PAC. (Photo courtesy of John Reid) In a stunning escalation of Virginia’s Republican infighting, Matt Moran — head of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC — has emerged as the central figure blamed for the widening rift between the governor and John Reid, the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor.
After Reid publicly accused Spirit of Virginia of extortion Sunday without naming Moran, his campaign lawyers fired a cease and desist letter directly at Moran Monday evening, accusing him of making “false and defamatory statements” about Reid — and threatening further legal action. 
Moran has declined multiple requests for comment. 
Meanwhile, pressure is building inside the party for accountability. Several GOP officials are urging the Republican Party of Virginia’s Executive Committee to confidentially review the explicit images that Moran allegedly showed Youngkin — images that reportedly convinced the governor to personally ask Reid to drop out of the race.
The result is a crisis that threatens not only to fracture Virginia Republicans months before Election Day but also to severely damage Youngkin’s national ambitions.
 Reid strikes back

The controversy escalated after Reid, a conservative radio host and the first openly gay statewide candidate from either party in Virginia, posted a spirited video Sunday afternoon on X, formerly Twitter.
“I had certainly hoped that we could put the bigotry and ugliness of last week behind us and unify our Republican ticket this year,” Reid said. “But shockingly, once again representatives of my campaign have been told by the leader of Governor Youngkin’s political organization that the attacks on me will continue unless I drop out of the race for lieutenant governor.”
Hours later, Reid’s legal team delivered a cease-and-desist letter to Moran, laying out accusations of defamation, extortion and reckless disregard for the truth.
“It has come to our attention that you provided information accusing our client of owning a Tumblr account containing unsavory images to multiple news organizations,” the letter reads. 
“While this account shared a common username with our client’s Instagram, he is not and never has been associated with the account.”
Reid’s attorneys said Moran crossed the line into defamation because the statements were “knowingly untrue,” and warned that “continued publication of these false claims would constitute actual malice.”
In a particularly damning passage, the letter alleged that Moran made direct threats in an April 27 conversation with Reid: “You literally said ‘him getting out of the race is the only way it stops.’”
The lawyers further argued that Moran’s accusations gave rise to defamation and defamation per se, noting that falsely alleging Reid was linked to criminal behavior “is so egregious that it is assumed to harm the plaintiff’s reputation without further need to prove harm.”
They demanded Moran “immediately cease and desist” from making or publishing any additional false claims, and instructed him to preserve all documents related to the case, including communications with consulting firms and journalists.
 GOP officials demand action

As the legal drama escalated, some Republican officials across the state voiced alarm at Moran’s handling of the situation — and called for transparency.
In a joint email sent to Republican Party of Virginia Chairman Mark Peake obtained by The Mercury, Rick Buchanan, chairman of the 5th Congressional District GOP Committee, and John Massoud, his counterpart in the 6th District, urged the party leadership to allow members of the State Central Committee’s Executive Committee to review any alleged evidence confidentially.
“As leaders of the Republican Party of Virginia, we are very concerned about our upcoming elections,” Buchanan and Massoud wrote. “Accusations have been made about our Lt. Governor nominee that are very serious. People are lining up on each side behind either the accuser or the accused, yet the evidence behind the allegations being made have not been forthcoming.”
They stressed the need for unity, warning, “In order for us to win this November, this affair must be put behind us. … Giving us the actual facts will make that possible.”
In a phone interview Tuesday, Buchanan went even further, telling The Mercury that Youngkin must fire Moran to salvage party unity.
“Either way we come out of this, it has caused a lot of turmoil within the party,” he said. “And I am very disappointed that the governor would listen to (Moran) without knowing the facts.”
Amid the unfolding controversy, an event scheduled for Wednesday at Atlas 42 in Henrico County featuring the full Republican statewide ticket — with Youngkin billed as a special guest — was abruptly canceled.
But Reid, undeterred, confirmed in a text message Tuesday that he still plans to go forward with the rally, even without his running mates.
 Moran silent as criticism mounts

In a text message Tuesday, Moran declined to comment. 
But Virginia GOP figures like Casey Flores, founder of the Richmond chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, the nation’s largest Republican organization dedicated to representing LGBTQ conservatives, made clear that Moran’s position is becoming untenable.
“I think that this is blowing back on Governor Youngkin and Matt Moran more than they ever expected,” Flores said in a phone interview. “Matt’s being kind of the one-hit wonder — he had Youngkin’s victory in 2021, but I think Youngkin won in spite of him, not because of him.”
Flores accused Moran of trying to “scuttle anything that doesn’t make him money” and said his actions were now damaging the party’s broader chances.
“In the age of Trump, people really don’t care about all this, even if the accusations against John Reid were true, which they are not,” Flores said. “Firing Matt really is the only appropriate thing for Governor Youngkin to do.”

Moran, 36, has been a fixture in Virginia politics for over a decade. After managing one rural delegate’s campaign and serving as a legislative aide for another, he rose quickly — first as spokesman for then-House Speaker William J. Howell, R-Stafford, then as chief of staff to Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights.
He later joined Youngkin’s campaign and served as director of policy and legislative affairs in the governor’s office — but notably without taking a salary from the state. Instead, Moran stayed on leave from two consulting firms he had ownership interests in: Creative Direct and Link Public Affairs.
Critics said the arrangement created serious conflicts of interest.
“There’s certainly a cause for him to try to make money, both within the administration and outside of Spirit of Virginia through his other companies,” Scott Pio, chairman of the Loudoun County GOP Committee, said in a phone interview.
Pio, whose committee hosted a rally for Reid in Sterling Monday evening, suggested that Moran’s dual loyalties allowed him to shape Virginia policy while benefiting financially. 
“Since Matt doesn’t have a statewide client, he decides to throw this bomb,” Pio said, referencing the Reid controversy, which blew up just days after Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity — a client of Moran’s — dropped out for health reasons last week. 
He also argued that firing Moran was a necessary step to rebuild trust: “Youngkin being a businessman, he should know when to hire and fire quickly. He should not keep people around that are being inappropriate.”
 Youngkin’s 2028 calculus and GOP damage control

Even before the Reid episode, Moran’s unpaid status within the administration had drawn scrutiny. In 2022, Youngkin’s chief counsel Richard Cullen in an interview with The Washington Post defended Moran’s arrangement, saying, “He would have been the hottest guy in Richmond (for lobbying). But Matt did the opposite and to his financial detriment.”
Moran declined an interview request for the same story but at the time issued a statement through Youngkin’s press office defending his arrangement. 
“I am on leave from all companies and as a result do not have clients with business before the governor or state government,” Moran said. “I formalized this arrangement with counsel’s office and I am fully committed to my service to the governor and the people of Virginia. It is a privilege to have the opportunity to serve the governor and work on behalf of the commonwealth.” 
His statement did not explain why he chose to forgo a state salary.
Now, however, political observers say Moran’s continued presence could be politically fatal — not just in Virginia, but nationally, as Youngkin positions himself for a possible 2028 White House run.
David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said the scandal “has done tremendous damage” to Youngkin and the GOP in Virginia.
“It reveals a real limit to Youngkin’s power in the state GOP and has exposed an ugly underbelly of the Republican party here,” Richards said. “Someone in Youngkin’s circle will have to take the fall. It does not look like Reid will bow out.”
Richards also noted the ongoing silence from Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee for governor, who has yet to comment publicly on the controversy engulfing her running mate.
“Her response so far raises a lot of questions about her ability to lead and make tough choices,” Richards said.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Youngkin, Earle-Sears, and Spirit of Virginia continued to dodge public comment. Reid, meanwhile, remains defiant and shows no sign of abandoning the ticket.
 
  John Reid’s campaign lawyers fired this cease and desist letter directly at Spirit of Virginia PAC head Matt Moran Monday evening, accusing him of making “false and defamatory statements” about the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor.

The crime novel explores the theme of Native American women who are missing or murdered.
Rendon is a member of the White Earth Nation in northwest Minnesota who now lives in Minneapolis.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The story begins with the protagonist, Quill, a Native American wife and mother of two, who is jogging on the reservation when she hears a woman scream. That scream sends her into panic, which later leads to an investigation.
Rendon told the admiring audience that she is a crime junkie who loves to create page-turners, and that her goal with the new book wasn’t to provide a sociological study of indigenous life, but to tell a good story.
However, Rendon framed the book’s accounts of missing Native American women taken from a reservation and an infant kidnapped from a Walmart to the movement recognizing the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Relatives (MMIW/R) 
Early on, Crow, Quill’s husband, expresses concern about his wife risking her safety chasing  down information on the possible identity of the woman she heard screaming:
“We’ve been hearing these horror stories of four thousand, maybe five thousand women missing across Canada. Missing down here. The stories of what has happened to women and children” – he emphasized children – “in the man camps over the Dakotas. And they are here now.” He jabbed two fingers onto the table when he said the word now. “Those same men are here now.” He jabbed the table again. “I don’t want anyone from my family to go missing. To end up dead in a ditch or a river. No. Not on my watch.”
When the book club members had an opportunity to ask Rendon questions, they didn’t focus on the plotline of the story but on the larger MMIW/R issue, what’s behind it and what could be done to address it.
In mainstream culture, Rendon responded, Native Americans are seen as invisible and their problems have not been taken as seriously.
“When I go out East to talk, most people out there think we’re all dead; that we disappeared with, I don’t know, the Black Hills gold rush, which also makes it easier for us to disappear if people don’t think we exist,” she said. “How can you disappear if you don’t exist?”
Although the MMIW/R issue has benefited from more public discussions, such as the upcoming May 5 MMIW/R Day of Awareness, Rendon said, when she was recently in Madison, she met a college professor who had never heard of the issue.
“Where They Last Saw Her” is an example of a work of fiction that raises awareness of a real crisis and provides insights into subcultures and their struggles.
In 2018, as part of a statewide program called Wisconsin Reads, several book clubs around the state collectively read and discussed “The Round House” by Louise Erdrich, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota. That book also raised awareness of struggles on Native American reservations and, in particular, the complication of prosecuting a crime when there are competing jurisdictional authorities between a tribal nation and county and state authorities.
Rendon is also the author of the “Cash Blackbear” series, which involves a Native American 19-year-old woman who solves crimes in the Red River area of Minnesota/North Dakota in the 1970s. She said her editor at Bantam asked her about writing another book outside the series.
“She said, ‘Well, what’s the current issue in Indian Country?’ and I said, ‘missing and murdered Indian women.’”
However, Rendon was initially reluctant to write a story around the MMIW/R issue.
“I said, ‘there’s no resolution. If somebody’s missing or murdered, there’s no happy ending,” she said. “There’s no resolution to the story. They’re either dead or they’re still missing.’”
Rendon’s story is set in Minnesota at a fictional tribe on the outskirts of Duluth, Minnesota, where in real life there had been a major pipeline project on a reservation in the area, like the one in her book — the replacement of Line 3 by Enbridge on the Fond du Lac Reservation, completed in 2021.
Prior to the Line 3 permit being approved, there had been concerns by Native American groups about man camps and violence and harassment against Native women.
A 2021 article by The Guardian, “Sexual violence along pipeline route follows Indigenous women’s warnings,” reported that a local crisis center for survivors of violence had “received more than 40 reports about Line 3 workers harassing and assaulting women and girls who live in northwestern Minnesota.”
Rene Ann Goodrich, a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, and a member of the Wisconsin MMIW/R Task Force is one of several Ojibwe women from Northern Wisconsin who have also expressed concern over Enbridge replacing a portion of Line 5, currently located on the Bad River Reservation, but Enbridge has filed for permits to build outside the reservation. Besides environmental concerns, the new project could result in a man camp in the area and possible assaults against Native women.
Rendon said there is a strong relationship between the extractive industry and the MMIW/R issue, and she makes a strong correlation between the two in her book.
“Anytime you have an extractive industry, like the pipelines, gold mines, uranium mines, anytime you have an extractive industry where large groups of men are pulled in to do the extraction, there’s no police force. They show up without their wives and families. They show up without ministers or priests. It’s just like the Wild West,” she said. “There has to be something done about the extractive industries and this use of men in large groups to actually go out and do these extractive industries. I don’t know how you change this. But I think that awareness is a piece of it.”
However, Rendon said she had heard that some oil companies have responded to concerns about man camps by putting men up in hotels with their families.
“Talk about the power of women, right? Bringing your wife and she’ll make you go to church,” she said.
Rendon said it was vital for her to portray Native American women in a community. In the story, three women, Quill and her friends Punk and Gaylyn, often travel together as they pursue information about missing women or help with searches.
“In Native communities, you almost never do anything alone,” she said. “You know, if I’m going to go to the grocery store, somebody’s with me. There’s one family that, if you see them at the pow wow —  if you see them at the grocery store, if you see them downtown, in the courthouse —  it’s the mom, the grandma, the kids, you know; it’s like, it’s a whole group,” she said.
Regarding Native women and community, Rendon notes it was Indigenous/First Nation women in Canada who first gathered together and spoke out about the phenomenon of Indigenous women missing around the man camps of oil pipelines and mining operations.
“I knew that in this story about missing and murdered Indian women, what was important to me was a community of women, and so I knew that it wasn’t going to be just one person,” she said.
Rendon said she has received some criticism for including a male Native American who is abusive.
“We have bad people in our communities, too,” she said, “and then there’s the thing about domestic abuse, it happens in every community and in smaller communities. People know that it happens, but people don’t talk about it, or there’s this secrecy and stuff that happens around it.”
In Minnesota, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) reports there were 716 Indigenous persons missing in that state in 2024, 57% of whom were women.
In Wisconsin the exact number of missing Indigenous persons is not published, in part because the state does not have a clearinghouse like Minnesota for gathering that data.
Rendon praised efforts in Minnesota to create an MMIW/R office that tracks MMIW/R cases, works with families, and provides support and even rewards for information. And she noted that in Minneapolis, the Indigenous Protectors Movement, a branch of the American Indian Movement, is active in putting out flyers and organizing searches for missing persons.
In researching the novel, Rendon said she was surprised by how often white women who went missing were blamed for causing their own victimization through their behavior, including having multiple sexual partners. In Native American communities, she said, there isn’t that cloud of guilt over women.
“The Native community clearly has said, ‘I don’t care what our women were doing, nobody deserves to be trafficked. Nobody deserves to end up dead in a ditch or in a gunny sack in the Red River Valley,’” she said. “So there’s a difference, a cultural difference that I saw, which surprised me.”

The proposal, Senate Bill 484, would allow employers to obtain an injunction and temporary restraining order against anyone who protests at their place of business to the extent of “hindering or preventing” work, using threats or force, or blocking workplace entrances, exits, or public roads and streets. It amends an existing law that centers on protecting employees from harassment, stalking, and violence.
Among the forms of relief available to judges in the bill are no-contact orders and prohibitions on visiting the workplace, punishable as contempt of court, which would open violators to fines and jail time.
“What Senate Bill 484 strives to achieve is a balance between those who want to peacefully protest and those who actually want to go to work and earn a living uninhibited by those that are protesting,” said Sen. Tim Moffitt (R-Henderson), a primary sponsor of the bill.
The bill comes amid a flurry of labor activity around the state as union efforts has risen in recent years, with the number of union election petitions nationally doubling from 2021 in the most recent fiscal year. In February, North Carolina saw a high-profile union election at Garner’s Amazon warehouse that spurred protest events from labor activists, though demonstrators gathered across the street from the warehouse rather than near any entrances or exits.
In an interview after the committee vote, Duke professor and labor organizer Orin Starn said he feels the bill aims to “discourage workplace demonstrations and picketing” regardless of the conduct of protesters.

A participant in the efforts to unionize the Amazon warehouse, Starn said employers already have “plenty of protections” when it comes to protests on their property. He noted that some members of the Amazon union campaign were arrested for trespassing by Garner police when they tried to collect union cards and give out food on the premises.
“This bill seems very much about weaponizing the law to keep workers from organizing,” Starn said. “Workers are already afraid of retaliation because there are minimal protections right now for workers who are trying to organize.”
Sen. Terence Everitt (D-Wake) asked whether protests at Tesla dealerships — which have drawn large crowds around the country as demonstrators have denounced CEO Elon Musk’s actions in the Trump administration — would be permitted by the bill so long as they remain peaceful and do not include threats or obstruction. Moffitt confirmed they would be.
Sen. Mujtaba Mohammed (D-Mecklenburg) proposed two amendments seeking to clarify the scope of the bill, aiming to avoid any prohibitions on federally protected labor activity. The first defines obstruction as a “sustained or deliberate physical blockage” that disrupts operations or public safety, and the second excludes from the bill any peaceful demonstrations, informational pickets, or protected labor activity — provided they do not rise to the level of violence, threats, or obstruction.
Both amendments passed, though Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) said she still held concerns that workers may be intimidated from participating in labor protests by the messaging around the bill.
“We have a lot of efforts underway to protect employee rights, and I think it’s important that they not be limited or people be intimidated from participating in those,” Grafstein said. “I believe there are some aspects of this bill that could continue to intimidate people from engaging in peaceful protests.”
The bill is will proceed to a vote before the Senate Rules Committee, where it could then be scheduled for a hearing on the Senate floor.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0607-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-29 15:08:12.243809

A lawsuit over a Des Moines Register poll that showed Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in Iowa during the final days of the 2024 campaign has been moved to federal court.
The lawsuit, one of two related to the poll, is a potential class-action case filed by the Center for American Rights on behalf of one West Des Moines man, Dennis Donnelly, against the Register, pollster J. Ann Selzer, and the newspaper’s parent company, Gannett Co. It seeks actual damages totaling $2,799,600 — the alleged cost of an annual subscription for each of the Register’s 40,000 subscribers — plus punitive damages and attorneys’ fees.
Because the lawsuit involves litigants headquartered in different states, and the total damages could exceed $5 million, the Register’s parent company, Gannett Co., sought removal of the case from state court to U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.

The lawsuit takes issue with a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll that Selzer conducted for the Register in the final days of the 2024 presidential campaign. The poll, published the Sunday before the election, showed Harris leading Trump among likely Iowa voters 47% to 44%. Trump went on to win Iowa with 56% of the vote to Harris’ 43%.
The lawsuit alleges “a miss by 16 points is not an innocent error — it is either intentional fraud or reckless disregard for accuracy. Either way it is actionable.” It is based on the Center for American Rights’ claim that Donnelly, a Register subscriber, “was intensely frustrated by the inaccurate poll,” which was published on the Sunday before the election. It alleges Donnelly “felt like the Register was disserving him and other readers when it ran, and when its results were compared to the final outcome.”
The lawsuit seeks damages for alleged consumer fraud, professional malpractice and interference with the right to vote. The latter claim is based on the argument that “it looks like the Iowa Poll did, in fact, increase Iowa public opinion favoring Harris to win the state.”
The defendants in the case have denied any wrongdoing and the lawsuit has yet to win class-action status.
Donnelly’s lawsuit parallels one filed by Trump 
A separate lawsuit against the Register and Selzer over the same poll results was filed late last year on behalf of Trump, U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, and former state senator Brad Zaun in Polk County District Court. Like the lawsuit filed on behalf of Donnelly, Trump’s lawsuit has since been moved to federal court.
In that lawsuit, Trump and his co-plaintiffs claim the poll results in their races were intentionally skewed and that in the presidential race “Selzer was trying to generate fake enthusiasm and momentum for Harris.”
The defendants are seeking dismissal of the lawsuit, arguing the laws they are accused of violating are designed to regulate commercial businesses, not to constrain news reporting, and that polling results “do not qualify as falsified facts” merely because they don’t align with an election’s outcome.
“In our constitutional system, a claim for ‘fraudulent news’ does not exist. Full stop,” attorneys for the newspaper argue. “The remedy for disagreement with political speech one does not like is counter-speech — not court-enforced damages under the guise of commercial regulations.”
In that same case, the Center for American Rights recently asked permission to file a brief of its own in the matter, arguing that its lawsuit on behalf of Donnelly was based on largely the same issues and that the center hopes to challenge “the use and abuse of powerful and entrenched media institutions to distort our national debate.”
U.S. Magistrate Judge William P. Kelly ruled against the center two weeks ago, finding that while the center clearly had an interest in Trump’s lawsuit, the “core arguments” the center would make have already been made by the president and his fellow plaintiffs in the case.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Education Minnesota, the state’s largest union representing more than 86,000 members, elected its first Black president on Saturday.
Monica Byron ran unopposed to replace Denise Specht, who led the union since 2013. Byron started her career as a homeschool liaison for the Richfield Public Schools in 1995 before earning her teaching license. She taught elementary school in Richfield for 24 years, most recently as a math coach. In 2022, she left her teaching job when she was elected vice president of Education Minnesota.
Bryon takes over one of the state’s most influential unions at a critical juncture for public schools. More than 8 in 10 schools report having a shortage of teachers, and the union wants to increase pay to fill the ranks. But a looming budget deficit is tying the hands of state lawmakers who might otherwise support robust increases in school funding. At the federal level, the Trump administration has threatened to eliminate the Department of Education while also attacking unions.
This conversation was edited for length and clarity. 
Why did you run for president of the union?
I ran for president because I believe in the power of our union and to protect and strengthen things that matter most, like professional pay, secure pensions, affordable health care and respect for all of our educators.
You are the first Black president of Education Minnesota. What does that mean for your union and also organized labor in Minnesota?
I am really proud and honored to be the first Black president of Education Minnesota. I believe that I’m able to bring a unique and fresh perspective and voice to not only Education Minnesota but to the labor movement. I’ll be able to advocate not only for educators, but for our students and our community. And I’ll be able to ensure that all educators, but especially our educators of color, will have a voice.
The Trump administration has vowed to close the Department of Education and has threatened to withhold funding from schools with diversity programs, which was recently blocked by judges. What do you see as Education Minnesota’s role in responding to the Trump administration?
Education Minnesota has been publicly defending against the attacks on diversity, equity, inclusion and the other attacks from Washington, D.C. We are going to ensure that we have freedom to read. We’re going to make sure our history isn’t whitewashed. We’re just going to make sure that our students and our educators are able to teach and do all the things that they need to do.
What do you see as the biggest threats facing teachers and the union at this moment?
Right now, I think it’s just been the chaos and the executive orders coming. We have great partners though, from our national allies and our other labor allies. I think it’s just the unknown and the threats to the unions as a whole. But we are positioned well to be able to respond.
In 2024, just 28% of 8th graders rated proficient at reading, which is the lowest on record for the nationwide benchmark. In math, students’ abilities seem to be just as dire. I’m curious why you think teachers aren’t able to equip students with these basic skills of reading and math.
For me, the question is what resources and what other things our educators need. I believe that we need to ensure that all educators are equipped with those resources. They have the time to be able to teach and that we ensure that when it comes to class sizes, those teachers are able to reach each of those students.
Gov. Tim Walz, former teacher and union member, ran on being an education governor. Could you give him a grade on his tenure?
Education Minnesota has worked closely with Gov. Walz. President Speck is in charge when it comes to working with Gov. Walz. So as vice president, I’ve been able to watch and follow her lead. So I don’t have a grade at this time.
What are Education Minnesota’s top priorities at the Legislature this year?
Right now, our top priorities have been around professional pay, which includes a starting pay for our entry educators and $25 per hour for our ESPs. We have a pension bill, which would ensure that we have a career rule for our teachers. And we also have a bill around health insurance, so that our educators have quality health insurance. It would start a health insurance pool for our educators across the state. And we also are looking to protect the inflationary rule on education that we won last year.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250429_0024-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-29 15:08:12.243809

Currently,  Iowa code defines bullying and harassment in schools as electronic, written, verbal, or physical acts or conduct that create an objectively hostile school environment for a student based on “any actual or perceived trait or characteristic.” There are 17 traits listed as potential characteristics of a student that could be used in bullying, including age, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability and political belief. The law states that bullying is not limited to these categories.
House File 865, approved 32-16, would remove this list and reference to students being bullied because of an actual or perceived trait of a student, instead defining bullying and harassment as “repeated and targeted” acts and conduct that create a hostile school environment for a student. Sen. Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, said this change is needed because some schools are not addressing bullying incidents if a student is being bullied for a reason not related to a listed trait.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Those schools don’t believe they are required to act unless the behavior is based on one of the traits listed, those school officials believing their hands are tied,” Salmon said. “This has resulted in an unequal treatment of students and underreporting of bullying. The bill removes that confusion and clarifies that all students should receive an equal level of protection.”
But Democrats said the measure will weaken Iowa’s laws on bullying. Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said bullying is a “life of death matter” — she has known students who have died by suicide because of bullying, and Trone Garriott said it would be more difficult for families with students who are bullied to get support and responses from schools if the bill becomes law.
The law is not limited to the traits listed, Trone Garriott said, but having the 17 characteristics in law for reference helps schools and families both identify and track many of the major reasons why students are bullied, she said.
“I think the real intent might be to make it harder for folks on this list to get the support they need, and for the people of Iowa to know what’s happening in our schools,” Trone Garriott said. “This bill makes it harder. This bill removes guidance. This bill is not going to protect anyone. It’s going to make our students more vulnerable.”
Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale, said he was bullied in school, and suffered severe depression during middle school and high school because of the bullying he faced. He said the bill will make it harder for students like him to seek help from schools, saying the definition of bullying as “repeated and targeted” acts and conduct will not cover much of the harassment students face.
“The instance of my life when I was the lowest, where I went home from school and cried for the entire day and the entire afternoon, is because some child, student, that had never bullied me before said one mean word to me, and that’s what set me off that day,” Blake said. “You never know what that behavior will be that sets a child off, and taking these restrictions and making it harder to protect our children is not something we should be doing in this body.”
Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, the former president of the Central DeWitt School Board, called for lawmakers to look at how their local school districts address bullying. He said Iowa school districts already have board policies created to define and address bullying, which includes the ability to report bullying and harassment incidents using an online form.
“The vehicle to address bullying and harassment is already in code, it is already in board policy,” Zimmer said. “It is in every single school district in this state. If an administrator is misinterpreting this, this is not going to solve that. That’s an issue that’s got to be handled internally between the superintendent their subordinates.”
He said a better approach, if there is a problem with school officials not addressing bullying if it does not involve harassment based on limited traits, would be doing more to inform parents about the existing policy and platform.
Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, said that while Zimmer’s point was correct — a board policy and procedure on how to report bullying exists — he said there are some school districts misinterpreting the law so that if a bullied student does not have an identity or characteristic listed in the Iowa code, “they’re passing it off as just two kids that were having a disagreement or a misunderstanding or a skirmish.”
“Every child should be protected in schools, every child, not just because they match up some certain traits that we decided to laundry list a number of years ago in Iowa code,” Evans said. “The bill that is before us cleans up Iowa code. It makes it very clear that it should apply to the majority of school board policies already on the books, but it ensures that every kid — even though their traits may not be listed in Iowa code — that they get the same protections as everyone else.”
The measure heads to Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk.

(Photo by Ty Wright/Getty Images)Former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis plans to ask the United States Supreme Court to weigh in on whether she was protected by the First Amendment when refusing same-sex marriage licenses a decade ago, her lawyer announced Monday. 
This comes after the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused a request to re-hear her case, saying the panel of judges who ruled against Davis in March already considered the case fully. 
Mat Staver, the founder and chairman of conservative legal group Liberty Counsel, said in a statement that the nation’s highest court is “the next step to give Kim Davis justice in this case since the emotional distress damage award against her in her individual capacity is barred by the First Amendment.” 
Davis is fighting a federal jury’s decision that she should pay $100,000 to a couple she denied a marriage license in 2015. But her lawyers also want the case to result in same-sex marriage rights being revoked. 
“This case underscores why the U.S. Supreme Court should overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, because that decision threatens the religious liberty of many Americans who believe that marriage is a sacred institution between one man and one woman,” Staver said. “The First Amendment precludes making the choice between your faith and your livelihood.”
The move is expected. Staver, who argued on Davis’ behalf in Cincinnati in January before a 3-judge panel in the 6th Circuit, said at that time he intended to use her case to try and overturn marriage equality. 
Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that guaranteed same-sex couples marriage rights, is “on the same shifting sand” that doomed Roe v. Wade, Staver said.   
“I think … it’s not a matter of ‘if,’ it’s a matter of ‘when’ Obergefell will be overturned,” Staver told the Lantern in January. “I have no doubt that Obergefell will be overturned, and the issue will be returned back to the states as it was before 2015.” 
The Kim Davis case 
Davis, then the Rowan County clerk, made national headlines in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to several same-sex couples based on her religious beliefs. 
In 2015, U.S. District Judge David Bunning ordered Davis to jail for five days for contempt for refusing to comply with a court order. 
In 2024, Bunning ordered Davis to pay $260,104 in fees and expenses to attorneys who represented one of the couples she refused a marriage license. Bunning earlier ordered Davis to pay the couple, David Ermold and David Moore, $100,000 in damages for violating their constitutional rights. Liberty Counsel has unsuccessfully fought Bunning’s decisions. 
Davis lost her bid for reelection as Rowan County clerk in 2018.
Her lawyers have argued she acted within her First Amendment rights when she refused to issue the licenses, though judges don’t agree. 
In March, the 6th Circuit refused to strike down the jury judgement against her on those grounds, saying she “cannot raise a Free Exercise Clause defense because she is being held liable for state action, which the First Amendment does not protect.” 
Liberty Counsel said the case raises the question “of whether a government official sued in an individual capacity and stripped of governmental immunity may assert a personal First Amendment defense to monetary damages.”
The group wants the Supreme Court to take up the case to “answer the question of ‘first impression,’ resolve any conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, and ensure that former government defendants standing before the Court in their personal capacity do not lose First Amendment protections.”

The byproduct was high in ammonia and very corrosive, according to DNR staff who responded to the incident and observed murky, brown water conditions flowing all the way into the Des Moines River. 
The majority of dead fish, 62,620, were observed in South Branch Lizard Creek, where the spill from CJ Bio America occurred. The company noticed the byproduct from manufacturing lysine had leaked into a stormwater drain, which staff blocked with a berm that they later realized had developed a breach. According to DNR, this allowed an unknown amount of the byproduct to flow to the surface intake of a neighboring field and into the creek. 
DNR valued the fish killed from the incident at $73,819. Most of the dead fish were small minnows, shiners, dace and chub, but other varieties included nearly 5,000 suckers, more than 2,000 rock and smallmouth bass and 37 northern pike. 
CJ Bio America did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the issue. 
DNR investigating wastewater spills in Boyer and South Skunk Rivers
DNR is investigating two recent wastewater spills, one from a meat processing facility near Denison into Boyer River and another from a wastewater treatment plant into the South Skunk River. 
A valve malfunction at Smithfield Fresh Meats Corp. in Denison led to an estimated 500-gallon spill of wastewater into the Boyer River. DNR staff were notified Sunday morning of the release, which was quickly stopped by Smithfield staff who closed the stormwater drain where the water was flowing. 
John Baker, environmental specialist with the DNR field office in Atlantic, said most of the wastewater was contained to the stormwater system, which is being cleaned. 
Baker said no dead fish have been observed in the Boyer River. 
In Story City, an estimated 1.5 million gallons of partially treated wastewater was released into South Skunk River over the weekend due to unusually high flows to a wastewater treatment plant. 
According to a press release from DNR, the wastewater was treated using an ultraviolet disinfection process before it was diverted into the river. High flows at the plant were caused by heavy rain over the past week. 
The plant began discharging the water around 2 p.m. on Saturday and ended Sunday around 4 p.m. 
No dead fish have been observed in the river as a result of the event.

It was a unanimous opinion but one judge dissented on the reasoning. 
“This court finds there was no election irregularity and the election results are valid,” Chief Justice Mary Russell wrote in the opinion.
Business groups have been fighting on two fronts to gut the law since it passed in November. Tuesday’s decision marks the failure of one front, but efforts to convince Republican lawmakers to overturn the law remain in play. 
A bill that cleared the House and awaits action in the Senate would repeal the sick leave provisions. Negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans on that legislation appear to have stalled. 
“In light of today’s decision, it is now imperative that the Missouri General Assembly pass HB 567,” Kara Corches, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said in a press release, referring to the bill to gut paid sick leave.
The Missouri Supreme Court heard arguments last month seeking to strike down the law, filed by a coalition of business groups and individuals. The lawsuit argued the law should be thrown out for violating constitutional rules on ballot initiatives, including violations of the state constitution’s single-subject requirement and a lack of a clear title, which the court ruled it lacks jurisdiction over. 
Prop A passed with nearly 58% of the vote and had the support of numerous unions, workers’ advocacy groups, social justice and civil rights organizations, as well as over 500 business owners.
Senate Democrats have spent two nights this month blocking Republican efforts to overturn the law. They have worked on reaching a compromise regarding implementation details.
Lawmakers and business groups push rollback of Missouri minimum wage hike, sick leave law

Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, has been an especially loud voice urging full repeal. She has said that even though requirements go into effect May 1, the Senate could continue working to weaken the law until the end of session on May 16.
The bill sponsored by state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a Republican from Jefferson City, and state Rep. Sherri Gallick, a Republican from Belton, would overturn the law requiring most employers to provide paid sick time off for hundreds of thousands of qualifying workers. It would also modify the minimum wage law by removing the requirement that it be indexed to inflation.
State Sen. Brian Williams, a Democrat from University City, spent over two hours blocking action in the chamber with a filibuster Tuesday morning, saying some had been acting in bad faith during negotiations.
“This year, there’s been again, people going back on negotiation, bad faith efforts, distrust, people feeling deceived and members of the body feeling disrespected,” he said. “But most importantly, all in the name of disregarding voters. The very same voters that have sent us here.” 
Under the law, beginning May 1 employers with business receipts greater than $500,000 a year must provide at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers with fewer than 15 workers must allow workers to earn at least 40 hours per year, with larger employers mandated to allow at least 56 hours. The law also gradually increases the minimum wage.
“It is financially burdensome, just short of devastating, and its regulatory requirements are extremely difficult for single unit operators,” Buddy Lahl, CEO of the Missouri Restaurant Association, told The Independent Tuesday.
The bill would allow the minimum wage to increase to $15 per hour in 2026, as voters approved, but it would not be adjusted for inflation thereafter — a policy that has been in place since 2007. The sick leave provisions would be repealed entirely.
Prop A would make sick leave guaranteed for around 728,000 workers who currently lack it statewide, or over 1 in 3 Missouri workers, according to an analysis from the progressive nonprofit the Missouri Budget Project.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)New Mexico lawmakers this week rolled out a plan to help prepare for potential hefty reductions in federal funding.
The Legislative Council, the group of state representatives and senators that oversees all lawmaking between New Mexico’s legislative sessions, voted unanimously Monday afternoon at its first meeting following this year’s session to create a new panel called the Federal Infrastructure Funds and Stability Interim Committee. 
House Speaker Javier Martínez and Senate President Pro Tem Mimi Stewart, both Albuquerque Democrats, told Source NM after the meeting that the committee, in a nutshell, will examine potential federal funding cuts and consider ways to adapt to them if they become real.
For example, the committee will look at proposals to cut funding to Head Start, a child care and early education program. This week, U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) joined 40 other senators in a letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. demanding he immediately unfreeze Head Start funding and reinstate early childhood education workers who have either been laid off or furloughed as result of closures of the preschools, which rely on federal funding.
Similarly, the new legislative committee will track funds for Medicaid, the safety-net health insurance program for people with low incomes, Martínez said. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said previously she might call a special session in the fall, should the state need to address federal shortcomings in programs such as Medicaid. The state also is also party to multi-state lawsuits challenging federal cuts.
Its members will also consider the Trump administration’s proposal to abolish the federal Department of Education, Stewart said. Federal funding accounts for 30% of New Mexico’s education budget, she said, including money for special education.
Stewart said the committee has no historical precedent in the New Mexico Legislature, noting “this is an ahistorical presidency.” The committee is intended to last for the remainder of the year, but could extend beyond that if needed, she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Martínez told the Legislative Council the new committee will not duplicate the work being done by the Legislative Finance Committee and other legislative panels but, rather, supplement it with a “proactive approach to deal with any potential reductions in federal funding.”
“It will be what I consider to be a very nuts-and-bolts committee, with a tailored, specific focus,” he said.
Martínez appointed Rep. Patricia Lundstrom (D-Grants) as the panel’s co-chair from the House of Representatives, and Stewart appointed Sen. William Soules (D-Las Cruces) as the co-chair from the Senate. Attempts to reach Lundstrom and Soules for comment through spokespeople for their respective chambers were unsuccessful as of publication time.
Other members of the new committee include Reps. Susan Herrera (D-Embudo), Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Las Cruces), Mark Duncan (R-Kirtland) and Cathrynn Brown (R-Carlsbad); and Sens. George Muñoz (D-Gallup), Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe), James Townsend (R-Artesia) and Minority Whip Pat Woods (R-Broadview).
The panel is expected to hold an organizational meeting in May, Martínez said.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The state House on Tuesday sent a bill that would limit most public schools to two virtual days a year to the governor’s desk despite bipartisan opposition.
Beginning in the 2026-27 school year, Senate Bill 758 limits brick-and-mortar schools to 12 hours of virtual instruction as long as the state superintendent approves an online instruction plan or if there’s a governor-issued state of emergency affecting the district.
State Rep. Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, the bill’s author, said nothing in the measure eliminates the option for a four-day school week. More than two virtual days just couldn’t count toward instruction time. Moore said his bill ensures that districts not specifically approved for a four-day school week are not taking every Friday off by scheduling a virtual day, resulting in 37 fewer days of instruction.
“I think that I’m with you on this idea that we don’t want to be losing class time, but I’m not sure why virtual days are equating to not having instruction,” said Rep. Michelle McCane, D-Tulsa, a former educator. “Is that how it’s being applied? Because every virtual day I’ve ever been involved in really still required a lot of instruction and support on my part as a teacher.”
Moore said it should work that way, but it isn’t in a lot of districts. Schools are sending packets home with no teacher available online. His children had two virtual days last year where they had no instructional material. He said there are also young children that might not have parents at home who are able to help them complete their assignments.
“Who’s going to help that kid?” he asked. 
He said he’s received hundreds of emails about the bill.
Moore said the state wants to improve its poor academic ranking, and more face-to-face instruction will help.  
McCane said virtual school days should have structure and not be a packet sent home. But she said virtual school days should be an option in the event of bad weather or excessive teacher absences. Districts would lose the flexibility to utilize that option moving forward.
Rep. Cynthia Roe, R-Lindsay, said her grandson had a virtual day two weeks ago and completed his work in 45 minutes. This bill fixes that issue.
The measure passed the state House by a 53-32 vote.

Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, shared disappointment with President Donald Trump's policy agenda during the first 100 days of the Republican president's second term. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of House's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids marked the 100th day of President Donald Trump’s second term by rattling off objections to handling of tariffs, threats to Medicaid and Social Security, and presidential adviser Elon Musk’s conflicts of interest.
Davids, a Democrat who serves the 3rd District in the Kansas City area, has stood out in her evaluation of Trump given Kansas’ three other representatives and two senators — all Republicans — endorsed Trump’s candidacy and remain supportive of the president.
“Kansas families deserve so much more than chaotic policies that raise their costs and weaken their freedoms,” Davids said Tuesday.
Davids said Trump’s tariff war could raise household costs by $3,800 per year and harm export markets for Kansas farmers and manufacturers. In response to imposition of tariffs, trade partners of the United States imposed retaliatory barriers to commerce. For example, Trump’s import duties on Chinese products were set at 145%. U.S. exports entering China face a 125% tariff.
Davids objected to federal legislation that could jeopardize Medicaid coverage and retirement security for thousands of her constituents in Kansas. She said she opposed “destabilizing” job cuts at the Social Security Administration and other federal agencies.
In addition to advocating for due process for Americans and judicial independence in the court system, Davids supported a bill to increase transparency of Musk’s work with DOGE or the Department of Government Efficiency. A U.S. Senate report indicated Musk’s role in the Trump administration could shield his companies from more than $2.3 billion in potential legal liability.
“I’ll always stand up for our community, whether that’s protecting Social Security, making child care more affordable or lowering prices at the grocery store,” Davids said.
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican representing the 4th District surrounding Wichita, said the U.S. House’s passage of a federal budget framework before a two-week recess was a “major win for Kansans and President Trump’s American First agenda.”
Republican majorities in the House and Senate have been working on a legislative bundle that would extend tax cuts adopted in 2017 during Trump’s first term and authorize federal spending reductions that critics contend would have an impact on Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security.
“By voting ‘yes,’ we’re voting for a path to make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent,” Estes said. “A ‘yes’ vote prevents the largest tax increase for Americans in history.”
GOP U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, who serves the 1st District of western and central Kansas, also voted for House Concurrent Resolution 14 that set revenue and spending targets for fiscal years 2026 through 2036.
“I was proud to advance this legislation and set the foundation for Congress to implement President Trump’s agenda,” Mann said. “I look forward to working with my committees in the coming weeks to identify even more savings for the American taxpayer and deliver the one big, beautiful bill Americans have asked for.”
The budget resolution passed the House 216-214 with backing from Estes, Mann and U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt of the 2nd District. Davids voted against it. In the U.S. Senate, the budget framework passed 51-48 with support from Sen. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall, both Kansas Republicans.
Mann said the resolution directed Congress to find savings for taxpayers, invest in border security and national defense, promote domestic energy production and prevent expiration of the 2017  tax cuts.
“Seventy-seven million Americans, including myself, gave Washington, D.C., a mandate to secure the border, lower taxes and get our country back on track,” he said. “These are the common sense policy solutions that the Big First District overwhelmingly voted for last November.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sharice-Davids-on-house-floor-1024x508.png,,,2025-04-29 14:11:38.484534

The sole no vote was Republican state Sen. Mike Moon of Ash Grove. 
The bill garnered little opposition when it cleared the House last week 129 to 14, though a group of Republican lawmakers condemned the provision making it illegal for anyone under 18 years old to marry. 
“There are legitimate reasons for people 16, 17 to become married,” said state Rep. Dean van Schoiack, a Savannah Republican, who was also vocal in his opposition to the idea last year. “A pregnancy could be a legitimate reason to become married, for one thing.” 
He said he knows many couples who were married at 16 or 17 who are still together.
State Rep. Hardy Billington, a Poplar Bluff Republican, said “more babies will die” if the bill passes. 
“People at 16, 17 years old will have more abortions because they can’t get married,” he said.
Both Billington and Van Schoiack left the House chamber during a roll call on the legislation, and thus did not record a vote.
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said the Platte County recorder of deeds shared with her “how horrifying his experience is when he has to assist a young woman with a marriage certificate, the look in her eyes when he knows that this is against her will.” 
She then turned her comments to Van Schoiack.
“And for you to stand up here and advocate for young women to be married off, it is disgusting,” Aune said. “Honestly, I can’t believe it. It’s indefensible. I can’t believe you would stand up in a microphone and say it out loud.” 
Under current Missouri law, anyone under 16 is prohibited from getting married. But 16 and 17 year olds can get married with parental consent to anyone under 21. 
Marriage would be banned for anyone under 18 under the bill that passed Tuesday. 
There was no discussion before Tuesday’s vote, but in 2023 Moon’s opposition to the child marriage ban garnered national attention when he said: “Do you know any kids who have been married at age 12? I do. And guess what? They’re still married.”
The ban on child marriage almost passed last year but was stalled by a small group of Republican critics.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The underlying bill, dealing with foster children, was sponsored by Republican state Rep. Melissa Schmidt of Eldridge, and handled by Republican Sen. Jamie Burger. Most of the provisions were added on by other members as amendments.
Among its many provisions is a ban on Missouri’s social services agency from seizing Social Security benefits from foster kids. 
Missouri’s child welfare agency takes millions of dollars each year in foster children’s benefits and uses the money to help pay for foster care. In fiscal year 2024, the Children’s Division spent over $10.6 million in children’s benefits. Over 1,200 foster kids were receiving benefits in Missouri of late last year, or just over 10% of all kids in care.
As a result, kids who are orphaned or have disabilities are responsible for paying toward the cost of their care in state custody. 
The bill would ban the state from using those benefits to pay itself back for routine foster care expenses. Instead, the division could use the funds for the child’s “unmet needs” beyond what the division is obligated to pay, such as housing as the child prepares to age out of foster care.
The effort to ban the practice won bipartisan support during last year’s session and was on the precipice of passing. But it died when GOP infighting forced the state Senate to adjourn early. 
House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, pledged earlier this year that this legislation would be the first bill sent to the Senate, highlighting the issue as legislation that “should have been passed but fell victim to our inaction and politics.”
The bill also voids nondisclosure agreements in childhood sexual abuse cases. 
And it includes a proposal by Republican state Sen. Travis Fitzwater of Holts Summit that would assign foster children 14 to client-directed attorneys, meaning they would be required to act based on the goals of the children. Currently, foster children have guardians ad litem, who are attorneys tasked with acting in what they view as the child’s best interest. 
The shift, which would be subject to appropriation, goes into effect in 2028 unless a county opts into a pilot program.The judge in each case would still have the discretion to continue the guardian ad litem appointment. The bill also creates a commission appointed by the chief justice of the state Supreme Court to review family legal representation throughout the state, and make recommendations to bolster its uniformity and quality.
It would also require the state Department of Social Services to build a program of residential care for youth with severe behavioral challenges currently being held in inappropriate placements, by contracting with qualified service providers. This, too, would likely require funding by the legislature. 
Other provisions include:

Increasing a tax credit for donations to certain youth programs.
Clarifying that parents allowing children to engage in appropriate independent activities without supervision would not be considered abuse or neglect.
Stating that the state Children’s Division cannot hold itself harmless in contracts with private service providers when there are issues resulting from the state’s negligence.
Requiring Children’s Division caseworkers to present identification of themselves when conducting investigations of child abuse and neglect, and inform parents of their rights;
Requiring the Children’s Division to take into consideration the religion of the foster child when determining placement, in order to ensure children are in households of a similar religion to their families’ when practicable.
Modifying the Amber Alert system to add that the system will aid in finding not only an abducted child but an “abducted or missing African American youth.”

They found more detainees, and health care gaps",Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/04/ice-detention-center-investigation/,A California law empowers state investigators to check on conditions at ICE detention centers. A new report raises concerns about health care inside them.,"In summary
A California law empowers state investigators to check on conditions at ICE detention centers. A new report raises concerns about health care inside them.


A new report from the California Department of Justice finds that immigration detention facilities across the state continue to fall short in providing basic mental health care, with gaps in suicide prevention and treatment, recordkeeping, and use of force incidents against mentally ill detainees. 
The report’s release today comes alongside an aggressive expansion of immigration enforcement and broader changes to immigration policy under President Donald Trump’s second administration. The timing of the report’s release signals California officials plan to continue oversight as federal officials move to expand immigration detention capacity in the state.
It flagged that California’s detainee population has grown since the state’s last review: more than 3,100 people were held in immigration detention statewide as of April 16, up from the daily average of about 1,750 in 2021, the report found. About 75% of those detained had no documented criminal history.     
Investigators with the state’s Department of Justice inspected all six active immigration facilities in California. The inspections were conducted under a 2017 state law that mandated the Attorney General’s office review and report on immigration detention facilities operating in California. It’s the fourth report to be released on conditions in facilities where noncitizens are detained in California by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities. 
The findings come amid broader concerns about federal oversight: the report notes that the federal Department of Homeland Security recently moved to shutter internal offices tasked with investigating civil rights complaints and detention conditions. Last week, the homeland security department quietly removed more than 100 civil rights and civil liberties records from its website, sparking concerns about transparency and accountability in immigration enforcement. 
“California’s facility reviews remain especially critical in light of efforts by the Trump Administration to both eliminate oversight of conditions at immigration detention facilities and increase its inhumane campaign of mass immigration enforcement, potentially exacerbating critical issues already present in these facilities by packing them with more people,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta. 
The 165-page report details conditions at privately operated facilities where federal immigration officials detain people facing deportation. State investigators found “deficiencies in suicide prevention and intervention strategies” at every site, including missed mental health screenings and improper clinical decisions about when to release detainees from suicide watch. 
Staffing shortages, poor coordination between medical and mental health care providers, and widespread problems with record-keeping contributed to the risks for detainees, many of whom suffer from depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the report. 
Conditions that can worsen mental health, such as solitary confinement, remain common, the report found. At facilities known as Desert View Annex, Imperial, and Otay Mesa, investigators found that force was disproportionately used against individuals with mental health conditions, including cases where chemical agents were deployed. At the Mesa Verde facility in Bakersfield, officials failed to properly document or report the forced transfer of detainees who had participated in a peaceful hunger strike, the report said. 
Despite federal guidelines discouraging the isolation of detainees with mental illness, the California review found people with serious mental health conditions were routinely placed in segregation, sometimes for months at a time. Investigators found some facilities failed to properly inform detainees about protections under a federal court settlement that requires legal representation for people with severe mental health disorders. 
Pat-down policies at the Mesa Verde center discouraged detainees from seeking health care, the review found. Detainees reported feeling that invasive searches deterred them from attending medical appointments or accessing other services. 
A spokesman for Geo Group, the private company that operates several of the facilities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the just-released report, but previously told CalMatters that the company provides high-quality medical services including “around-the-clock access to medical care, which is governed by the Performance-Based National Detention Standards set by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and independently accredited by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care.” 
“In all instances, our contracted services are monitored by the federal government to ensure strict compliance with Performance-Based National Detention Standards, which apply to all ICE Processing Centers,” Geo spokesman Christopher Ferreira said in December. 
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Screenshot via Attorney General's X livestream)Attorney General James Uthmeier said his office is “putting our money where our mouth is” in announcing a state-funded legal team dedicated to enforcing parents-rights laws.
Addressing a crowd of fourth graders at Jacksonville Classical Academy Tuesday, Uthmeier said his office is “making sure that we’re walking the walk and setting examples” in enforcing laws related to gender transition, library materials, school surveys, and other topics that have dominated legislative, judicial, and executive conversations in recent years. 
Uthmeier announced the creation of the Office of Parental Rights, a “team of litigators focused on fighting the fights that parents bring to us.”
“It’s frustrating that we do have to go so far as to enshrine in law a lot of these rights that are indeed God-given,” Uthmeier said. “But at the end of the day, government is weak. Government cannot be trusted, and we want to protect parents everywhere we can.”
Uthmeier was flanked by Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice, Patti Sullivan from Parental Rights Florida, Kim Hermann from Southeastern Legal Foundation, and January Littlejohn, a Leon County parent who claims a school aided her child’s gender transition, although the school has prevailed in court proceedings so far.
Uthmeier said his office will coordinate with the Department of Education to address complaints to be handled by the Office of Parental Rights. 
“I understand you guys probably don’t fully appreciate the importance of the announcement here today, but you will grow up fast,” Uthmeier said, addressing the fourth-graders. “You will have your own kids, your own families. It will happen much faster than you think. And I assure you, you will appreciate what’s being done here today.”

Uthmeier said Florida has been a “shining city on a hill, an example for the rest of the country to look to when it comes to enshrining parental rights.”
Lawmakers have focused heavily on enabling parents to remove books from school libraries they may consider to be “pornographic,” require parental consent to take surveys related to mental health concerns and sexual behavior, and parental notifications relating to a student’s education. 
Litigation for some of the laws has become costly. For example, in Escambia County, as of December, the school district had spent more than $640,000 to defend book-removal policies, the Tallahassee Democrat reported. 
“We’re certainly not looking to run up costs, but when it comes to fighting the right fights, I’ll spend every dollar we have,” Uthmeier said. 
Last week, a bill (HB 1505) to require parental consent for any survey offered to a child, including about mental health, politics, and sexual health, passed the House on a party-line vote. It would expand the state’s “Parental Bill of Rights” and includes mandatory parental consent for STI treatment.
Similar legislation is awaiting debate on the Senate floor.
Uthmeier has been in office less that three months. He was appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year, filling the vacancy created by former AG Ashley Moody’s appointment by DeSantis to the U.S. Senate.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 17:43:05+00:00,CT Mirror,AG says Lamont didn’t break law handling ARPA interest,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/ned-lamont-arpa-interest-ruling/,But a GOP leader said Lamont's administration still was wrong for not reporting these interest dollars to legislators for nearly three years.,"Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration didn’t violate state law when it moved $340 million in interest earned on federal COVID relief grants into the state budget, Attorney General William Tong said Monday.
But while Tong settled the legal question, a Republican leader said the Democratic governor’s administration still was wrong for not reporting these interest dollars to legislators for nearly three years.
Though Connecticut received roughly $2.8 billion from Congress in March 2021 through the American Rescue Plan Act, Lamont’s administration didn’t shift investment earnings on that pandemic relief from an off-budget account into the General Fund until Jan. 8 of this year — roughly one month before the governor would propose spending most of that interest to expand child care services. (Most state programs and services and financed through the General Fund or other accounts within the formal state budget.)
Frustrated by that late disclosure and timing, House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, asked whether Lamont could move the funds into the budget without legislative approval.
Tong wrote that existing law stipulates all interest on investments must go into the General Fund, unless the legislature directs otherwise. And no special instructions were issued when Connecticut received the ARPA funds, which it’s used to bolster education, human services, municipal aid and other programs for the past four years.
The attorney general also noted the legislature is aware of its legal options. “The General Assembly knows how to override the default rule when it wants and has done so on several occasions,” he wrote.
And while the legislature set many special rules for Lamont to follow on spending ARPA dollars, the Tong noted they apply only to “federal funds designated for the state” and not on the interest those grants may generate.
“This opinion from Attorney General Tong confirms that our reporting of the interest income is consistent with statutory requirements,” the governor’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said Monday.
“I never doubted in my mind that the Democrat attorney general would have a ruling favorable to the Democrat governor,” Candelora said Monday, adding it still doesn’t explain how hundreds of millions of dollars was not reported for years to the legislature “but magically appeared in the dark of night” shortly before Lamont would propose a use for it. “Fundamentally, I think that’s wrong for good government, and I think it’s wrong for transparency.”
When The Connecticut Mirror first reported that the interest dollars had appeared on a Jan. 15, 2025, revenue projections document that Lamont’s budget office and nonpartisan legislative analysts sent to the General Assembly, legislators from both parties expressed concerns about the timing.
Collibee said in January that the administration had asked the treasurer’s office in the spring of 2021, shortly after the ARPA funding had been received, to assign all interest earnings to the General Fund. But, he added, “There appeared to have been some miscommunication.”
And Jeffrey Beckham, Lamont’s budget director since early 2022, said in mid-January that his office wasn’t aware for years that tens of millions of dollars in ARPA-related interest due annually to the General Fund wasn’t being transferred.
“It became apparent to us in the last couple of months,” he added at the time.
State Treasurer Erick Russell, who succeeded fellow Democrat Shawn Wooden as treasurer in January 2023, has not speculated on communication between his predecessor and the Lamont administration.
But Russell noted in mid-January that the treasurer’s office provides four reports yearly to Beckham on how ARPA investments are performing. 
In other words, the Lamont administration had plenty of reminders each year that tens of millions of dollars in interest in ARPA investments were pouring in annually.
The Lamont administration co-writes revenue reports filed three times annually with the General Assembly that reported other interest earnings — but not the return on ARPA investments until this year.
Candelora added that Connecticut Democrats who are worried about President Donald Trump’s efforts to cut spending without congressional approval should be more concerned about Lamont’s handling of the ARPA interest.
“This very behavior,” Candelora said, “reeks of the things they accuse the president of doing.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lamont-and-Tong-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-29 14:11:38.484534

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Late in an acrimonious legislative session certain to run into overtime, House Speaker Daniel Perez on Tuesday announced an intensive study of property taxes with an eye toward taking reforms before the voters next year.
Perez announced he was creating a Select Committee on Property Taxes that would craft a proposed constitutional amendment that could be passed by lawmakers at the start of next year’s session in January, then go to the ballot in November 2026. 
Perez included in his remarks a shot at Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has pushed for the elimination of property taxes, for not coming up with his own detailed proposal.
“Several months ago, Gov. DeSantis introduced the exciting and provocative idea of abolishing property taxes in Florida. Naturally, many of us had the same questions. How would elimination of property taxes work? If property taxes go away, how would local governments pay for the services? We expect local government to provide by police, fire, and infrastructure,” Perez said.
 “Unfortunately, as the weeks have gone by, the governor has yet to come forward with any specific answers to those questions or with any specific plan or with actual bill language.”
Perez did stress, though, that the House would consider any proposal from the governor.
“If the governor comes forward with a proposal, we will hear it. All ideas are welcome. All voices are invited to be heard. This process is not about ego or pride of authorship or credit. This is about bringing the very best proposals before the people of Florida so that they have an opportunity to decide their own fate,” Perez said.

The speaker took another shot at the governor and the Senate for their proposed fiscal year 2025-26 spending plans, which run higher than the budget passed by the House.
“I am not oblivious to the impact that property tax reform would have on local governments, but we, as a House, have a unique credibility on this front, as we proposed to doing something neither the governor nor the Senate were willing to do, apply the same revenue restrictions to ourselves that we are asking local governments to endure.”

The speaker tapped Reps. Toby Overdorf and Vicky Lopez as chair and vice chair of the panel, respectively. Perez encouraged members who want to serve on the panel to come forward.
“However, please remember that this select committee will be meeting throughout the rest of spring, summer, and into the fall. So if you are interested, be prepared to work,” he said.
Five potential reforms
Perez wants the select committee to begin its work by “exploring a variety of potential reforms,” including:

Requiring every city, county, and special district to hold a referendum on the question of eliminating property taxes on homestead properties.
Creating a new $500,000 homestead exemption, as well as a $1 million homestead exemption for properties owned by Floridians aged 65 and older, or who have had a homestead for 30 years, applicable to all non-school taxes.
Authorizing the Legislature to increase the homestead exemption to any value by general law rather than constitutional amendment.
Modifying the assessment increase limitations on property values: For homestead properties, changing the cap from the lower of 3% or consumer price index to a flat 3% over any three-year period for all taxes. For non-homestead properties, changing the cap from 10% annually to 15% over any three-year period for all non-school taxes.
Protecting homeownership by eliminating the ability to foreclose on a homestead property due to a property tax lien.

Perez will announce the committee appointments Wednesday and the panel will meet this week. Usually, the last week of session (set to end Friday) is reserved for budget conferee meetings at which members of the House and Senate meet to hammer out the spending differences between the chambers.
The impasse over tax relief, though, has prevented that from occurring.
 Tax impasse

DeSantis has pushed for the elimination of property taxes while Perez has championed rolling back the state’s sales tax by 0.75%, to 5.25%. The speaker’s plan also would roll back all other sales tax rates by the same amount — commercial rent from 2% to 1.25%; electricity from 4.35% to 3.6%; new mobile home purchases from 3% to 2.25%; and coin-operated amusement machines from 4% to 3.25%.
Senate President Ben Albritton supports tax relief but earlier this session floated a more modest$2.1 billion  plan  centered around a permanent elimination of the sales tax on clothing and shoes costing $75 or less. Other parts of his plan include a permanent reduction in the business rent tax from 2% to 1%, a one-time credit for vehicle registration fees, and several sales tax holidays.
The difference between the House and Senate proposals for fiscal year 2025-26 is $4.4 billion. The Senate made seven spending and tax relief offers to the House as of Monday but none were accepted.
“Given the importance of this issue, you cannot afford further delay in moving this conversation beyond promises or generalities. We need to put in the time in order to give stakeholders meaningful opportunities and make sure that we put the very best proposal or proposals on the ballot as amendments to the Florida Constitution,” Perez said.

Mississippi nonprofit centers that serve survivors of domestic violence, dating violence and sexual assault have been unable to apply for crucial federal grants, creating uncertainty and potentially jeopardizing services and staffing.   
The U.S. Department of Justice awards tens of millions of dollars yearly through the Violence Against Women Act, but in February, grant information was taken down from the Office on Violence Against Women’s website right before the usual application deadline.
As of the end of April, the information hasn’t returned, and the office’s website announcing funding opportunities was last updated Feb. 6, telling applicants not to finalize any applications.
“So many times when you’re utilizing federal funds to pretty much run your organization, when those federal funds are cut, you have to start looking at cutting staff and services,” said Joy Jones, executive director of the Mississippi Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which receives VAWA funding. 
“That is detrimental to victims of crime,” she added. 
Since 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded nearly $50 million to Mississippi nonprofit centers, the State Department of Health and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. That’s money that has supported the operation of shelters, transitional housing, victim advocacy, education and more. 
Other funding through VAWA includes training for law enforcement officers and prosecutors as well as support for rural communities and college campuses. 
Meridian’s Care Lodge serves nine counties in the east central part of the state. Its executive director, Kim Neal, said federal grants support the organization’s emergency shelter, where over 200 women, men and children turned to last year. 
She said a lot of the funding is to ensure people have basic needs like clothing, food and a safe environment, in addition to advocacy, like when survivors want to file charges or to seek a protective order. 
Tupelo-based S.A.F.E., Inc. serves nine counties in northeast Mississippi. A rural grant has allowed the organization to do work at its domestic violence shelter and in the community, including throughout April – Sexual Assault Awareness Month. 
Through federal and state grants, S.A.F.E, housed 55 people last year, including those who are homeless as a result of domestic violence and sexual assault, said Zowee Shanks, S.A.F.E’s executive director. 
“When people are making these decisions to pull the grants out, they are not understanding these shelters do more work than at our 19-bed facility,” she said. 
Another federal funding source for domestic violence and rape crisis centers is through the Victims of Crime Act. That act created the Crime Victims Fund, which collects fines and penalties from people convicted of federal crimes and distributes the money to states. 
In October, the start of the federal government’s fiscal year, the crime fund is expected to be cut by $700 million, meaning less funding for states and victim service programs.
The Mississippi Department of Health uses VAWA and VOCA grants along with $12 million from the State Legislature to support victim services that many shelters provide, said Gregory Flynn, a spokesperson for the department. 
Currently, the Health Department funds support ten of the 11 domestic violence shelters across the state, including Care Lodge and S.A.F.E, Inc. 
At the same time as VAWA grants were frozen, the Justice Department cancelled funding for 365 grant programs for nonprofit organizations across the country working with crime victims. Some of the grant recipients were notified that their projects no longer “effectuate” the DOJ’s agencies, CBS News reported. 
“It certainly concerns us,” Neal said about the wait for answers about the federal grants.  
“Domestic violence doesn’t stop even though they may freeze the funding.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/29105536/AP18303679897225.jpg,,,2025-04-29 14:11:38.484534

I have a developmental disability, ADHD, but no one would ever know unless I share that information. My invisibility makes disability skeptics and critics shockingly open about their bigotry.
A former boss genuinely thought the whole point of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was to ensure people in wheelchairs could apply for jobs, not provide individual workplace accommodations. Long before the current administration was in office, the owner of a salon told me she’d never hire anyone with a disability because she thought accommodations were a scam to increase her small business expenses.
Lest you think the current harsh commentary of people with disabilities lies only on one side of the aisle, even my progressive family members are quietly ideologically aligned with today’s attacks on the disability community.
So when I read headlines about how the disability community is to blame for a plane crash or how some of us “should just die,” I’m not surprised.  Instead, I look at what is causing such unfounded panic.
First, there are over 40 million of us with disabilities, and a bulk of them are over the age of 75.  That’s a lot of people to accommodate in individualized ways, so perhaps such a task is too daunting, but we’re not asking for the impossible.
Second, there is a real fear that individualized accommodations could lead to an unfair advantage.  What those complaints fail to acknowledge is that people with disabilities already begin with a significant disadvantage by merely having a disability. The world we live in was designed for neurotypical, able-bodied people and no one else.
Third, the recent alarm is partially based on the idea that disability accommodations create reliance on external assistance while simultaneously diminishing the need for personal responsibility. Yes, we do rely on external assistance to be healthy and productive every day, in the same way a person requires glasses to see properly or a person with diabetes needs insulin. Knowing your disability rights and asking for legally mandated accommodations is the epitome of personal responsibility and not letting a disability impede daily life.
Rather than even a lopsided playing field, critics would rather “fix” us so we can conform to a neurotypical world or risk shutting us out altogether.  (Whipping the ADHD out of children is one of the latest suggestions.  I have firsthand experience that this method doesn’t work.)
But I don’t want to be “fixed” because I am not deficient, ashamed or broken. People with disabilities are different, not better or worse or the same. What we want are basic human rights and dignity that include: the ability to live up to our potential; fairly compete with our peers; be a productive and contributing member to society; and the opportunity to fully participate in everything life has to offer.
A person living with paralysis from the waist down will never be able to walk up a flight of stairs in the same way I will never be an organized, focused student.  These behaviors are a matter of skill, not will.  If you think having a disability is a coveted status, try living with one every day in this country.  Live long enough and you eventually will.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1210226489-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 14:11:38.484534

David Cortese, the idea of gaining Republican support for a bill to provide cash to certain residents would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.
But his proposed legislation to offer $1,000 per month to homeless youth has so far received bipartisan support in the state Senate.
“It’s being embraced,” said Cortese. “This was not even considered possible five years ago.”
Cortese is among more than 20 Democratic lawmakers from 17 states launching Legislators for a Guaranteed Income on Tuesday to advocate for programs that provide direct, regular cash payments to lower-income residents to help alleviate poverty. They join a network of more than 245 mayors and county officials who have pursued dozens of basic income pilot projects across the country.
Washington state House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, and Washington state Senator T’wina Nobles, D-Fircrest, are among the founding members of the state lawmaker group.
The lawmakers want to see states play a larger role in guaranteed income programs, which aim to help residents in need by handing out no-strings-attached cash.
The concept of basic income programs took off following a 2019 experiment in Stockton, California. There, 125 individuals received $500 per month for two years, which researchers found improved their financial stability and health.
Michael Tubbs, the former Democratic mayor of Stockton and current executive chairman of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, said these kinds of efforts are more important now as economic uncertainty and high prices squeeze the most vulnerable people.
“The work around guaranteed income is moving from cities and counties to states,” he said. “We’re going to be organizing state officials across the country who see what we all see: that affordability is an issue, that the Trump tariffs and gross mismanagement of the economy has made the problem even worse.”
While the concept has gained traction across the country, Republican state lawmakers have pushed bills to ban basic income programs, arguing they disincentivize work.
Last year, then-state Sen. John Wiik sponsored successful legislation banning South Dakota localities from launching basic income programs. At the time, the Republican said he was worried about people growing dependent upon the government.
“So, if you get people addicted to just getting a check from the government, it’s going to be really hard to take that away,” he told Stateline.
Legislators for a Guaranteed Income says its 23 members have so far introduced 25 bills across 11 states.
Those include Cortese’s proposed legislation in California to create a new program to help homeless youth transition out of high school.
Eligible students would receive four monthly payments of $1,000 each beginning in May. That bill, expected to cost $40 million to $50 million, has passed through two state Senate committees.
Cortese previously advocated for a 2023 California program that was the nation’s first state-funded pilot of a basic income program targeting former foster youth. He pointed to research showing basic income programs supplement, rather than replace, the need for work. And he said growing these programs can eventually reduce costs for other social safety net programs.
“I’m so pleased to see the proliferation that we’ve seen so far,” he said. “I think that it will become ubiquitous as a way of doing things and that’s going to outlast me and my career.”
In Pennsylvania, Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta said he’s still exploring details on legislation for a basic income program there.
He said pilot projects across the country have proven that people pay rent, buy groceries and invest in small businesses when they have more financial freedom.
“So, this isn’t really some big experiment,” he said. “It is a proven way to reduce poverty, improve health care, boost our local economies and really get a real return on that investment.”
Kenyatta said so-called trickle-down policies that aim to boost business interests and high earners have failed many ordinary people.
“But basic income really flips that equation on its head,” he said. “It’s not about charity. It’s about power, and about giving people the power and the resources to breathe.”

Because the child did not travel outside the state, this indicates the first case of community spread this year, according to a press release. 
Measles is a highly contagious illness that can cause severe health complications. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis and rash, according to the health department. Patients are infectious both four days before and after they develop a rash. 
The individual was not fully vaccinated and lives in Faulkner County. While infectious, the person visited Conway Regional Greenbrier Family Medicine from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. on April 18 and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on April 21. The individual also visited Irby Dance Studio in Conway from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. on April 23, according to the release. 
The state health department will be contacting potentially exposed individuals and is urging anyone at the identified locations to get up to date on the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine as quickly as possible. If the vaccine is given soon after exposure, it can stop the infection from developing, according to health officials. 
Poll: Belief in false measles claims correlated with lower vaccination rates

Anyone who may have been exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure. People who develop symptoms should inform their health care provider that they were potentially exposed to measles and are now experiencing symptoms, according to the release.
Because there is evidence of community spread in Faulkner County, vaccine recommendations for anyone living in or traveling to Faulkner County and surrounding counties (Cleburne, Conway, Lonoke, Perry, Pulaski, Van Buren and White) have been updated.
ADH reported the state’s first case of pediatric measles since 2018 on April 10. The unvaccinated Saline County resident was exposed during out-of-state travel. ADH reported a second case that same day in an unvaccinated Faulkner County resident who was also exposed during travel.
There were nearly 900 confirmed cases of measles in 30 states as of April 24, more than three times the cases in all of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The vast majority of confirmed cases, around 650 as of last week, are in Texas where an outbreak started in the western part of the state about three months ago. Two unvaccinated school-aged children living in the outbreak area have died, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. 
A new poll by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF found a correlation between false claims about measles and lower vaccination rates. 
More information about measles, including a list of Arkansas measles exposure locations, is available on the state health department’s website.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A Rapid City-based nonprofit that advocates for children in the state court system lost $15,000 last week after the federal government terminated grant awards to the National Court Appointed Special Advocates Association.
The decision “abandons American children” and will cause ripple effects throughout the state, said Seventh Circuit CASA Program Executive Director Kehala Two Bulls. The organization serves children in Pennington, Fall River and Custer counties. Seven other organizations serve South Dakota’s other circuit courts.
Volunteers with CASA advocate for children who’ve been removed from their families and placed in state care due to suspected abuse and neglect. The volunteers meet with the children and other contacts, such as teachers, therapists and caseworkers. They also write reports to judges about the children’s needs, strengths and interests to create “customized services and decision making,” Two Bulls said.

Over 330 CASA volunteers worked with 658 children in 37 counties last year, according to the state Unified Judicial System.
The national organization suspended all services and support to state and local programs, it announced last week, after the Trump administration’s Department of Justice terminated funding.
In a statement to Reuters, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said grants were rescinded that “do not align with the administration’s priorities,” but she said the Department of Justice will “continue to ensure that services for victims are not impacted and any recipient will have the ability to appeal and restore any grant if direct impact on victims can be thoroughly established.” The national CASA office said it is appealing.
Though the Seventh Circuit was the only South Dakota CASA office receiving grant funds from the national office, other local organizations rely on services provided by the national organization. That includes training and coordination, Two Bulls said.
Shifting that administrative burden and coordination to states will result in redundancy and reduced efficiencies, she added.
“Children will be destabilized by these changes,” Two Bulls said. “It’s important for people to make these decisions responsibly. Whether people agree with this or not, there’s a need for people at a local level to partner with us and step up and come up with the funding, the infrastructure, the support needed, because these are real kids that deserve good futures.”
Seventh Circuit CASA was awarded $25,000 in grant funding this year — $5,000 to conduct background checks of volunteers and $20,000 to develop support and specialized services for older youth in the system. The organization already received and spent about $10,000, but won’t receive the remaining $15,000.
In 2014, 207 kids in the Seventh Circuit were in state care over the course of the year, Two Bulls said. In 2024, that grew to 795 children because cases are taking longer to resolve.
Older children are staying in the system longer and aging out once they turn 18 years old, she added. Last year, 35 kids aged out of foster care in the area. Nearly a decade ago, that number was closer to five children a year. About 80% of the Seventh Circuit CASA’s cases are Indian Child Welfare Act cases.










Children will be destabilized by these changes.


– Kehala Two Bulls, executive director, Seventh Circuit CASA Program


Youth who age out of the system are more likely to become homeless, incarcerated or die than their peers, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Two Bulls said the grant was intended to build supplemental training for advocates focused on building life skills for older children.
The grants amounted to about 5% of the organization’s operating budget, Two Bulls said. While the terminated funding won’t shutter the program, she’ll have to reallocate funds or find new revenue for the increasing need the grant was intended to address.
“This action was completely disconnected from the need and the vulnerability in our community,” Two Bulls said. “What we have is less funding and less infrastructure to properly address it. We’re painfully aware of how many kids it leaves at risk.”
Greg Sattizahn, state court administrator for the South Dakota Unified Judicial System, said in a news release that the state is committed to “providing leadership, support and encouragement” to the eight CASA nonprofits across the state.

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)The House had its final debate Monday on the “big budget bill,” with legislators on the right lambasting spending, and the sponsor defending the increases as paying for the big ticket items Montanans want — such as property tax relief.
Rep. Terry Falk, R-Kalispell, said Gov. Greg Gianforte handed legislators a bloated budget, and it was still too big on the cusp of its near final vote.
Although it was Day 83 of a session that’s a maximum 90 days, Falk said it wasn’t too late to trim the budget, to return more money to taxpayers, contrary to the lyrics of a country song, it’s “too late to do the right thing now.”
“That might be true in love. I don’t think it’s true in budgets,” Falk said.
As the session nears a close, the argument brought political divisions into focus, including a dynamic in the Senate. There, “The Nine” Republicans and all Democrats teamed up as a working majority, frustrating more conservative Republican leadership.
In the House debate, members of the Freedom Caucus condemned Gianforte for presenting a “smoke and mirrors” budget in House Bill 2, and hardline Republicans faulted their colleagues for going along with it.
But Republicans in support of HB 2 said its critics wanted to unfairly characterize the budget as a failure to score political points, and Democratic supporter Rep. Mary Caferro of Helena said it takes care of the basics.
“The House passed a fair budget over to the Senate, and then the Senate made it even more fair, particularly for the working-class people of Montana and their families,” Caferro said.
Monday, the House voted 67-33 to agree with the changes the Senate had made to HB 2 last week, with support from all 42 Democrats and 25 Republicans, albeit some frustrated ones.
In support of taking the budget to the finish line, but against the idea to send it to committee for a trim, Majority Leader Steve Fitzpatrick said any more work on the budget would just backfire.
Fitzpatrick, R-Great Falls, said he didn’t have any particular love for the budget, but it was high time to be done with it before it grew even bigger.
He pointed in particular to a lack of restraint in the subcommittee that handled the health department — “our Section B can’t say ‘no.’” But he said neither could others along the way.
“I sit here and pull my hair out some days wondering what happened to the Republican party,” Fitzpatrick said.
In a later debate over another bill, he told Republicans it was time to be “fiscal conservatives, not part-time fiscal conservatives.”
On the floor, however, sponsor and Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, said the increases criticized in the budget represent legislative priorities and needs of Montanans, and the budget is balanced.
The most recent tally shows $224.8 million unspent at the end of the 2027 biennium.
After the debate, Jones said he believes that amount will increase as bills currently accounted for fail to pass, and as the governor potentially vetoes some spending.
The 2027 biennium budget costs 17% more than the 2025 biennium budget so far, and critics in the legislature have highlighted the figure as much too steep.
Jones, though, sponsor of House Bill 2 and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said those costs include as much as $200 million in property tax relief.
He said if giving Montanans their money back is wrong, “then we should be wrong every day.”
The increase also includes nearly $100 million more required in the state match by the federal government for Medicaid, another $100 million for education, and money for “backing the blue,” he said.
Once large items are accounted for, Jones said, the increase looks more like 4% each year, in line with inflation.
“Yes, the budget is bigger,” Jones said. “We’re returning money to taxpayers. We’re keeping criminals off the street. We’re protecting our elders and vulnerable neighbors, and we’re taking care of health care.”
But Rep. Jane Gillette, R-Three Forks, said the budget isn’t fully transparent with taxpayers, an “illusion” from the start.
“It was presented from the governor as a smoke-and-mirrors budget,” said Gillette, a member of the Freedom Caucus.
She said the governor tried to present some spending as outside of HB 2 in order for his proposal to appear more conservative than it was, but legislators didn’t sign onto the idea.
However, Gillette also said the Senate took a $50 million bite out of HB 2 for contract nurses, helping the most vulnerable patients including at the state hospital.
The Senate added $15 million back for hiring employees at the state hospital instead. But Gillette said the health department would spend all the money anyway.
Gillette said the agency has the authority to dip into other funds it controls, and it would simply scrape $35 million out of another bucket, such as for children or nursing homes.
“They’ll take money from next year’s general fund. It’s just putting it on the credit card,” said Gillette, chairperson of the subcommittee that reviews the health department budget.
Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, though, asked the House to reject Gillette’s testimony.
He said the Department of Public Health and Human Services had been spending money profligately on traveling nurses, largely at the state hospital.
“The department of health … did absolutely nothing to hire state employees at the state hospital, and I mean absolutely nothing,” Fitzpatrick said.
He said Gillette’s subcommittee had included $75 million for traveling nurses. Yet state employees were more affordable than contract travelers, he said — a cost of $91,000 compared to $280,000.
Roughly six weeks ago, however, he said the governor told him, as did health department staff at a more recent committee hearing, that the agency had finally started hiring, and at a rate of one nurse a week.
If that was the case, he said, it didn’t need $75 million for traveling nurses, and the Senate rightly stripped out that money.
“It’s time to make the Department of Public Health and Human Services accountable to the people of Montana, to make a real effort at hiring state employees,” Fitzpatrick said.
“They’re claiming they can do it. Fine. Let’s hold their feet to the fire, and if they don’t get the job done, then we’ll have a real serious discussion about the supplemental (budget request) next time.”
But Rep. Jerry Schillinger, R-Circle, blamed the Senate for the results in HB 2, pointing the finger at the working majority in the Senate, the coalition of Democrats and nine Republicans.
He said the Senate’s Finance and Claims Committee didn’t scrutinize the budget for long, but it wasn’t fully in control, with bills being blasted out of its hands.
“The chaos that started on Day One continues to this day, and we see it on House Bill 2,” said Schillinger, a Freedom Caucus member.
Jones called the allegation the budget was “smoke and mirrors” the “new term of the hour,” and said it must be “the saddest magic show on earth” given the numbers on spreadsheets and results for taxpayers.
After the debate, Rep. David Bedey, R-Hamilton, said some of the accusations on the floor were about showmanship and political games, not crafting a budget that works for Montanans.
“It’s evident from the rhetoric we heard when House Bill 2 was on the floor that several members of the House are creating soundbites for the purpose of attacking their political enemies,” Bedey said.
He said some of the Republicans who spoke against the budget want to paint a negative picture for political purposes.
“The idea is to portray the budget as a failure,” Bedey said. “The budget is balanced. It meets the needs of the state and provides the government services that the citizens of Montana expect with respect to education, health care and criminal justice.”
HB 2 is scheduled for its last vote on Tuesday before it heads to the governor’s desk.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos01-scaled-e1731707160413-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

(Courtesy of CommonWealth Beacon)President Donald Trump raked in nearly $4.1 million for his 2025 inauguration from donors and businesses with Massachusetts addresses, just under 2% of the total $239 million raised for the parties tied to his swearing-in for a second term in January.
Trump’s inaugural committee reported the names and figures earlier this month in a filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which showed the president beating the previous record he set: $107 million for his first inauguration. Presidential inaugurations feature the oath of office as well as official and unofficial balls or galas in Washington, D.C., offering a way for companies and individuals to ingratiate themselves with a new administration.
Large corporations made appearances on the list, including e-commerce giant Amazon and Facebook owner Meta, which each gave $1 million. The largest donation, coming in at $5 million, was from Pilgrim’s Pride, a poultry producer based in Colorado. Cryptocurrency interests also donated, with Ripple Labs donating $4.9 million.
The 21 Massachusetts donors and businesses, with donations totaling roughly $4.1 million, fell below their counterparts in other states, such as Pennsylvania ($8.6 million) and Michigan ($6.4 million). Both were swing states in 2024, while Massachusetts has remained a Democratic stronghold, with Ronald Reagan the last Republican to win the Bay State in 1984.
CommonWealth Beacon reviewed the Trump inauguration fundraising committee’s filing with the Federal Election Commission, which included donors and companies listing Massachusetts addresses. One of the largest donors in the state was a company tied to billionaire and car dealership magnate Ernie Boch Jr. The company, which is called Boston Port Service and shares an address with his nonprofit charity Music Drives Us, donated $1 million. Boch, who previously hosted a fundraiser for Trump in 2015, was unreachable for comment.
DraftKings, the Boston-based gambling company with a focus on sports betting, gave $502,000, while FanDuel, its New York-based rival, gave $482,000.
Another $500,000 came from GE Vernova, a Cambridge-based energy technology company working in the renewable power sector. The company, whose wind power division is grappling with a White House that has sought to put a stop to new wind turbine projects, spun off from the conglomerate General Electric in 2024. (CommonWealth Beacon reached out to DraftKings and GE Vernova for comment but did not hear back.)
Jessica Beeson Tocco, the CEO of A10 Associates, which bills itself as the country’s “largest woman-owned bipartisan lobbying firm,” personally donated $101,652 to the Trump inauguration committee and then an additional $50,000 through her Malden-based company. (The company also hosted a cocktail reception at the Waldorf Astoria the weekend before the inauguration, according to Politico.)
One of her clients, Quantum Computing Inc. CEO William McGann, also donated $101,652. He is retiring from the technology company in May and is listed as having an East Falmouth address on the FEC’s records.
Reached for comment, Tocco stressed that her firm’s donations go to top elected officials in both parties, with contributions flowing to prominent Massachusetts Democrats like US Sen. Ed Markey, Gov. Maura Healey, and Congresswoman Lori Trahan.
A potential Healey rival for the corner office in the State House, Michael Minogue, donated $250,000 to the Trump inauguration committee. Minogue, who now has his own consulting firm after serving as president and CEO of medical technology company Abiomed, has previously donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican National Committee and the state GOP. He also gave several thousand dollars to former Gov. Charlie Baker and Josh Kraft, who is looking to unseat Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, according to publicly available campaign finance records.
Others gave smaller amounts. Sriprakash Kothari, an accounting professor at MIT and a Lexington resident who regularly donates to the state GOP, gave $2,500 to the Trump inauguration committee. Kothari, who worked as the chief economist for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during the first Trump administration, declined to comment about the donation.
Some of the donors, like the company tied to Boch, had to be tracked through corporate documents on file with the Massachusetts secretary of state’s office. For example, Randolph-based GGBF Inc. donated $50,000 to the Trump inauguration committee, according to the FEC filing.
Documents on file with the state show the company shares the same address and same president as NEI General Contracting, Josef Rettman. Rettman has mostly donated to Democrats at the state and local level, and a mix at the federal level, including U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Trump White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s 2022 congressional campaign in New Hampshire.
The list of donors to the inauguration committee did not include the names of some major donors who had previously contributed to the first Trump presidential campaign or the first inauguration in 2017. Jim Davis, the chairman of shoemaker New Balance, donated nearly $400,000 to support Trump’s 2016 campaign.
The Kraft Group, tied to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, didn’t donate to the 2025 inauguration after donating $1 million for the 2017 inauguration. Ahead of the 2024 election, Kraft distanced himself from Trump, saying he was “very upset” by the insurrection attempt to keep Trump in office on January 6, 2021. Kraft has since reportedly helped a law firm, Paul Weiss, broker a peace deal with Trump, who has targeted lawyers through executive orders.
“I made a strong donation to his [2017] inauguration,” Kraft said during an appearance on a radio show last October. “I couldn’t believe it, it was like having someone who was a drunk fraternity brother become president of the United States.”

The state's perpetual ranking as among the deadliest in the nation for workers points to systemic disregard, advocates say.
The post In honoring fallen workers, advocates call for action in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—A silver triangle rang out 45 times in the Capitol’s rotunda. Each ring commemorated a worker who went to work in Wyoming in 2023 and didn’t return home to their families because they were killed on the job.
About three dozen people — mostly from local unions — gathered for the Workers Memorial Day ceremony on a cool and wet Monday evening.
“Every person who goes to work deserves to come home,” said Marcie Kindred, executive director of the Wyoming AFL-CIO. “Every family deserves the peace of knowing their loved ones are protected. Every life lost is one too many.”
The Rev. Delaney Piper, pastor of Highlands Presbyterian Church, led the group in prayer.
“Oh God, we do not understand why deaths like this, that we remember, that we mourn today, occur,” Piper said. “More so, we do not understand why everyone — workers, business leaders and political leaders — don’t just join in taking decisive action to prevent future deaths and to protect workers.”

The annual event recognizes Workers Memorial Day, the anniversary of the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act. The measure, in response to the carnage of workplace fatalities, injuries and illnesses, is supposed to ensure safe work conditions. Though accidents do happen, Kindred said, far too many are entirely preventable and, collectively, they point to a systemic disregard for workers.
“Behind every workplace fatality lies a story [of a life] cut short too soon and a ripple of grief that continues long after the headlines fade,” Kindred said.
Kindred and other speakers noted that Wyoming’s 45 occupational fatalities in 2023 made it the deadliest state in the nation for workers that year — a distinction Wyoming has held far too many times. Marcia Shanor, executive director of the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association and a longtime worker advocate, said the annual commitment to demand safer working conditions appears to ring hollow among state leaders.

Local trona miner and United Steelworkers Local 13214 President Marshal Cummings speaks to a small crowd about the importance of worker safety Monday during Workers Memorial Day at the Wyoming State Capitol in Cheyenne. Cummings told the crowd that he was motivated to fight for safe working conditions to ensure that his children would always have a father present. (Ivy Secrest/WyoFile)
“We have committed, every single year for the last 20 years, to do better,” Shanor said. “And here we are, 20 years later, decades later, with one of the highest workplace fatality rates since 2007. It feels hollow to have to say those words that I have said every single year as we have remembered the great people who keep our state working.”
United Steelworkers Local 13214 President Marshal Cummings, who works at the WE Soda trona mine near Green River, believes Wyoming’s perpetual worker fatality epidemic is the result of a disregard for workers enshrined in its “right-to-work” laws. Such laws ostensibly protect employees from being forced to join a union. But, in Cummings’ estimation, the laws are specifically intended to limit the power of unions, along with their persuasion to hold employers accountable for worker safety. 
“Let’s be very clear about this: right-to-work is a lie,” Cummings said. “It’s not about jobs. It’s not about freedom. It’s about weakening the very organizations — our unions — that keep us safe.”
In states with right-to-work laws, workers see lower wages, fewer health benefits and weaker retirement security, according to Cummings.
“Most importantly, workplaces [in right-to-work states] are more dangerous,” he said. “What is the right to liberty if you can’t speak up on dangerous conditions because you might be fired if you do? What’s the right to personal happiness if you’re trapped in a system where your work, your blood, your sweat, your tears, if your sacrifice is treated as disposable?”

Wyoming is the deadliest state in the nation for workers, again 



For now, the Wyoming AFL-CIO is focusing its legislative efforts not on the state’s right-to-work laws, but on the larger and more immediate goal of improving workplace safety, according to Kindred. The union group, the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association and other worker advocates see an opportunity to reignite past statewide efforts that had nudged Wyoming toward safer workplaces — efforts that seemed to fizzle out after the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It shouldn’t be one time a year that we all get together and talk about why this is an important issue,” Shanor said. “We should be having those conversations at the workplace, upstairs [in the House and Senate chambers], the governor’s office, and we should have leadership by our elected officials in helping us actually make steps forward that stay in place.”

Senate Bill 394, “Prohibit Foreign Ownership of NC Land,” passed without discussion after the panel approved a technical amendment. The legislation now moves to the Senate Rules Committee.
The bill comes at the same time that tensions between the U.S. a several other nations have been on the rise as the result of the Trump administration’s economic tariffs and other foreign policy shifts.
Sens. Bob Brinson (R-Beaufort, Craven, Lenoir), Bobby Hanig (R-Bertie, Camden, Currituck, Dare, Gates, Hertford, Northampton, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Tyrrell), and Timothy Moffitt (R-Henderson, Polk, Rutherford) serve as the primary sponsors for SB 394.
The bill would prohibit the “adversarial” nations of China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from making claims to land that is agricultural, situated within a 25-mile radius of a military installation, or underneath special use airspace as designated by the Federal Aviation Administration.
Lawmakers on the same committee reviewed SB 394 during a meeting on April 16, prior to taking a one-week recess. During that session, legislators discussed the bill but did not vote.
“This bill essentially acknowledges that food security is national security and it’s a state effort to protect our military bases,” Brinson said during that meeting.
Entities falling under the bill’s stipulations who own the land prior to the legislation becoming law, if it happens, would need to register with the secretary of state and attorney general.
Twelve states have already enacted similar measures, according to Brinson.
Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham) asked if the bill would apply to dual citizens and prohibit them from owning farmland in North Carolina.
Legislative staff responded that individuals holding U.S. citizenship, permanent residence, or other forms of lawful presence would not be subject to the measure.
Chitlik also asked if the bill would pose challenges to the Fair Housing Act, which makes it illegal to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing due to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability.
Brinson said the legislation was modeled after language in Florida, where it did not run into issues.
“It doesn’t mention nationality, it mentions citizenship,” Brinson said. “There is a distinction and a difference.”

The Public Service Pathway Bar Admission Pilot Program is an outgrowth of a yearslong debate on the value of the bar exam as a measure of fitness for legal service in the state. For about a decade, bar exam critics in South Dakota have criticized the timed test as a barrier to the profession that can prevent otherwise competent lawyers from service based not on their ability, but on slower reading speeds or extra time spent fine-tuning their analysis.
Pilot program will allow new lawyers to swap public service for the bar exam

The pilot program creates an alternative route to bar licensure by combining legal education and practical experience. Law school students selected for the program must complete a minimum of two years of full-time public service employment, such as in the office of a state’s attorney or public defender, upon admission to practice law in the state.
The University of South Dakota Knudson School of Law, in partnership with the host public service entities, selected the nine participants from 13 applicants.
“This program reflects our commitment to shaping lawyers who are not only skilled and ethical but also dedicated to serving the public good,” said Knudson School of Law Dean Neil Fulton in a news release. “It provides an innovative, rigorous pathway to licensure that emphasizes real-world experience and professional responsibility.”
Participants have been placed to work with the Minnehaha County Public Defender’s Office in Sioux Falls, Brown County State’s Attorney’s Office in Aberdeen, Minnehaha County State’s Attorney’s Office in Sioux Falls, Pennington County State’s Attorney’s Office in Rapid City, and the Federal Public Defender’s Office in Sioux Falls. Attorneys with the host entities will supervise, mentor and assist each participant.
Program participants will be required to submit a portfolio of their work during the program. The Board of Bar Examiners will evaluate the work and perform a character and fitness review of each participant before making a recommendation regarding a participant’s admission to practice as an attorney in South Dakota.
The five-year pilot program is administered through the cooperation of the USD Knudson School of Law and the state Board of Bar Examiners. The program is open to students at the law school and limited to a maximum of 10 students that meet specific criteria in each law school class during the pilot.

(Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A losing legal battle that stretched over nearly 10 years has potentially quadrupled the cost Missouri taxpayers must pay to a software firm fired in 2016 as it worked to modernize the state’s social services enrollment system.
In January, the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals upheld a $23 million jury award to EngagePoint, handed down in 2022 for work it performed but for which it was never paid. The judgment included 9% interest starting in May 2015 for one portion of the award, a little over $4 million, and starting in March 2016 for another claim for $19 million.
The Missouri Supreme Court at the beginning of April declined to hear another appeal and the Senate Appropriations Committee has, at the request of Gov. Mike Kehoe, included $92.7 million to pay off the judgment. Of that amount, $48.8 is from general revenue and $43.9 millions from federal funds.
“The state asked our client to do a whole lot of extra work, and a jury found it had agreed to pay our client for that extra work,” said attorney Chuck Hatfield, who represented EngagePoint and its successor claimant, HHS Technology Group.
EngagePoint, a Florida-based firm, was hired by the state in 2013 in response to a request for proposals for a vendor to implement the Missouri Human Services Eligibility, Enrollment and Case Management System, a comprehensive, fully-integrated system for Department of Social Services’ programs, like Medicaid.
EngagePoint was hired over competitors such as IBM, and alleged in its lawsuit that the state ignored the company’s advice and licensed a software directly from IBM and then later held EngagePoint accountable for flaws with the software, which was “unstable and not functionally ready.”
Problems with the Missouri Eligibility Determination and Enrollment System that EngagePoint was hired to implement continue to be an issue. The system was blamed for delays in enrolling newly eligible participants under expanded Medicaid. The state cited updates to the state’s Medicaid system to make eligibility determinations as the reason applications wouldn’t be processed for 60 days after the state was court-ordered to implement expanded Medicaid in 2021.
In May 2024, federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in a letter sent to the state that it was concerned the state is not doing enough to “achieve and sustain” compliance with federal rules on Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Missouri was among the worst states in the nation for processing times, with 72% of applications taking more than 45 days to process in February 2024. The processing times have improved, and the latest report from the Department of Social Services shows the average processing time in March was 38 days.
HHS Technology acquired EngagePoint’s claims for the contract dispute lawsuit and was substituted as the plaintiff. It sued DSS in 2023, alleging the state violated Missouri’s Sunshine Law by refusing to turn over public records that it was denied in the litigation over the software work.
In September, Circuit Judge Jon Beetem determined that the department violated the Sunshine Law by wrongfully withholding public records based on the identity of requester and not the contents of the records. The department also took months to respond to the request without a reasonable justification, Beetem ruled.
Beetem ordered the state to pay a $5,000 fine for a knowing violation of the Sunshine Law and $115,200 in attorney fees and costs. An appeal is pending before the Western District Court of Appeals.
Whether the entire $92.7 million — four times the original judgment — will be paid out is uncertain.
A calculation of interest since the 2022 judgment shows that the $4 million portion of the award will be about $9.8 million on June 30, the final day of the current fiscal year, and the $19 million portion will have grown to $42.3 million.
The budget takes effect July 1 and the final cost will be determined by when the state makes the payment, with interest adding about $13,000 a day to the cost.
“The judgments got really big,” Hatfield said, “because there’s both pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, pursuant to Missouri law.”

,DC,2025-04-29 16:38:53+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Relief on auto tariffs coming, Treasury secretary says",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/relief-auto-tariffs-coming-treasury-secretary-says,,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled a reprieve on auto tariffs will come Tuesday ahead of the president’s stop in Michigan to mark his first 100 days in office.Bessent and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Tuesday curtailing the import taxes for domestic car manufacturers, but offered few specifics. The president’s 25% levy on cars and auto parts went into effect at the beginning of April.“I’m not going to go into the details of the auto tariff relief, but I can tell you that it will go substantially toward reshoring American auto manufacturing,” Bessent said. “And again, the goal here is to bring back the high-quality industrial jobs to the U.S.”The press secretary and Bessent began the day defending Trump’s trade policy as part of a weeklong morning press conference series marking the 100-day milestone in Trump’s second administration.Investors and businesses have been on edge since Trump declared foreign trade a national emergency on April 2 and imposed what he billed as “reciprocal” tariffs on nearly every nation. Trump issued a 90-day pause on the steep levies — some reaching nearly 50% — after trillions of dollars disappeared from U.S. and world markets in reaction to the dramatic policy.However, Trump dug in his heels on goods from China, increasing tariffs to 145%. Nearly all other countries face universal 10% baseline levy.No deals yetNearly a month after the tariffs went into effect, Bessent told reporters the administration has not yet inked deals with any of the 17 trading partners, not counting China, currently in negotiations with the U.S. When pressed about a timeline for the deals, Bessent said Trump has created “strategic uncertainty” as a tool to get the best terms.“I think the aperture of uncertainty will be narrowing, and as we start moving toward announcing deals, then there will be certainty. But certainty is not necessarily a good thing in negotiating,” Bessent said.Bessent sidestepped questions about trade talks with China, saying he wouldn’t get “into the nitty-gritty of who’s talking to whom.” China has imposed 125% tariffs on U.S. goods and has denied any meaningful negotiations.“I think that, you know, over time, we will see that the Chinese tariffs are unsustainable for China,” Bessent said, adding that China sends more goods to the U.S. than Americans send to China.Americans' approval of Trump’s job performance, particularly on economic policy, is lagging, according to numerous recent surveys.In response to a report that Amazon will highlight spikes in prices due to tariffs, Leavitt said the e-commerce behemoth was committing a “hostile and political act.” Punchbowl News reported the story Tuesday citing “a person familiar with the plan.”Amazon denied the report hours later, according to NPR and other outlets.Tax cutsWhen asked about potential economic damage from business owners clamping down on hiring and growth, Bessent told reporters “tax cuts are coming.”The secretary said he and Trump met at the White House Monday with congressional Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota.Johnson and Thune have signaled different timelines — from Memorial Day to further into summer — for when Congress would finish a large budget reconciliation package, at the heart of which is Trump’s plan to extend his 2017 tax law.Bessent said Trump wants the tax bill to revive and expand full business expensing, meaning businesses could write off expenses for certain investments, like equipment.“The other thing that we are looking to add is full expensing for factories,” Bessent said. “So bring your factory back, you can fully expense the equipment and the building.”",,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

House Bill 859 is sponsored by Rep. Cody Honeycutt (R-Montgomery). It would prohibit the establishment of guaranteed income programs without express authorization of “general or local law” — something that would require approval from the General Assembly. It was referred to the House State and Local Government Committee without discussion.
Guaranteed income programs provide individuals or families with cash payments generally with no strings attached. The cash payments may be used for necessities such as food, childcare expenses, medicine and transportation.
The goal is to provide low-income families or individuals with a steady income to increase financial stability.
Supporters see such programs as a way to help lift families and individuals out of poverty and to address income inequality. Meanwhile, critics argue that such programs create a disincentive for work, are expensive and will not reduce dependency on welfare programs as some supporters claim.
Under HB 859, programs under which an individual is required to seek reemployment, perform work or attend training as a condition of a cash payment would be exempt from the law.
In North Carolina, the City of Durham launched a guaranteed income pilot program for formerly incarcerated individuals in March 2022 titled Excel. The pilot ended in August 2024.
Assistant Durham City Manager Karmisha Wallace told NC Newsline that the city council allocated $1 million this fiscal year to continue the program, which the city would manage. A nonprofit administered the pilot program.
Wallace said the city has neither determined the amount of the monthly stipend under the new program nor the number of participants. Under the pilot, 109 formerly incarcerated individuals received $600 a month for one year.
She said training for justice involved individuals is already available through other city-run programs in which they participate.
“We already have programming in place now that help justice involved individuals get IDs, get jobs, secure medical support, transportation and that sort of thing,” Wallace said.
Wallace said HB 859 could be problematic.
“I think it’s safe to say the city is concerned about any legislation that restricts our abilities to meet the needs of our constituents,” Wallace said.
According to the Durham County website, the county is launching a guaranteed income pilot program called DCo Thrives that will provide $750 per month for one year to 125 randomly selected low-income families. That program is funded by the American Rescue Plan Act and will be administered by Durham Children’s Initiative, according to the website. 
Guaranteed income programs gained steam during the pandemic. Large cities such as Los Angeles and Atlanta are among those that launched pilot programs.
Michael D. Tubbs, founder and chair or Mayors & Counties for a Guaranteed Income, said last summer in a letter defending a program in Harris County (home to the city of Houston) that was blocked by the Texas Supreme Court that there were more than 100 pilot programs nationwide in-process or having concluded with “great success.”
Tubbs is a former Stockton, California mayor who helped launch one of the country’s first guaranteed income programs in 2019.
The Harris County program is still on hold due to the legal challenge. Last week, the Texas Senate approved a bill to ban local governments from adopting such programs.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2889-2048x1536-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Insurance companies handily gained an advantage Monday in the Louisiana Legislature’s debate over how to bring down the state’s exorbitant auto coverage rates. Lawmakers worked well into the evening to approve a long list of bills that target personal injury lawsuits, which they said  is the primary cause of high premiums.  
House Bill 34, sponsored by Rep. Brian Glorioso, R-Slidell, passed the House of Representatives in a 68-26 vote and now heads to the Senate for consideration. It would allow any party in a lawsuit that stems from an auto accident to introduce evidence related to medical expenses.  
Current law prevents juries from seeing what accident victims actually pay for medical treatment and only allows access to what a doctor billed. In many instances, however, medical providers don’t actually receive the full amounts that they bill. Sometimes, Glorioso said, lawyers work with doctors who will inflate their medical billings just to get an increased payout for the plaintiff. Also, health insurers often do not pay doctors the full amounts they bill.
Glorioso’s bill would limit a plaintiff’s recovery of medical expenses to “reasonable” amounts, which would be left for a judge or jury to decide. 
The vote on the bill fell mostly along party lines with two defections from each side. Democrats Pat Moore of Monroe and Steven Jackson of Shreveport voted in favor of the proposal. Republicans Jeremy LaCombe of Livonia, an attorney, and Joe Stagni of Kenner opposed it. 
During floor debate, several Democrats pointed to similar tort reform bills from years prior that failed to reduce Louisiana’s auto insurance rates, which remain among the highest in the country.  
Rep. Sylvia Taylor, D-LaPlace asked Glorioso whether he could say for certain that his bill would lower premiums — a question heard frequently from Democrats as Republicans have presented their insurance bills. Glorioso, who’s a lawyer, rejected the premise of the argument. 
“If that is the standard by which we’re going to pass insurance bills, we may as well go home,” Glorioso said, implying that such guarantees would be impossible to make. 
House Bill 435, by Rep. Peter Egan, R-Covington, passed in a 62-23 vote and drew some of the more colorful debate of the evening — even though it’s unlikely to have much of an impact on auto insurance rates. It puts a ceiling on the amount a person can be awarded in a lawsuit, capping general damages at $5 million even in the case of wrongful death.
When the bill came up for a hearing last week in the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure, lawmakers pointed out that it won’t directly lower rates because $5 million is already the maximum payout on commercial auto policies in Louisiana. Insurance companies currently don’t pay any more than that regardless of how much a jury awards a plaintiff.
Nevertheless, Egan has said his bill would stem what he believes is a culture of litigiousness in Louisiana if people understand they can no longer receive huge jury awards. 
Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, an attorney, questioned how Republicans can claim to be “pro-life” if they would support a bill that effectively establishes a $5 million maximum value on a person’s life.
“This cap is the opposite of pro-life,” Jordan said. “If you were truly pro-life, you would not succumb and agree with the premise that we should be putting [value] caps on people’s lives.”
Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, argued Louisiana residents are overwhelmingly complaining of excessive litigation and asking lawmakers to fix the tort system in an effort to lower rates. 
House Bill 439, by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette, passed in a 57-30 vote with LaCombe and Stagni joining Democrats in opposition. The bill aims to limit contingency fees, the money a lawyer makes off a percentage of the lawsuit winnings, to 10% on the first $15,000 in damages. Settlements with insurers for most minor accidents fall under this ceiling. For any damages beyond $15,000, Hebert’s bill would not limit lawyer payments. 

House Bill 431, by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, passed in a 66-26 vote along strict party lines. The bill would limit the ability for people to recover damages for injuries sustained in accidents for which they are mostly at fault.
Her bill would change Louisiana’s comparative fault statute, which assigns a percentage of blame to each party in an accident and allows for the recovery of damages in proportion with those percentages. 
Under current law, a person partly at fault in an accident would be liable for their share of the damages and can recover the remaining amount found to be the fault of the other party. Chenevert’s bill would change that to prohibit recovery of any amount by a party who’s 51% or more at fault. 
House Bill 450, by Rep. Michael Melerine, R-Shreveport, would end the Housley presumption, a standard of evidence explained in a 1991 Louisiana Supreme Court ruling that applies to auto accidents, medical malpractice and other injury lawsuits. In a nutshell, the Housley presumption says courts should assume a plaintiff’s injuries resulted from the accident in question if they were in good health beforehand.  
Lawmakers have tried repeatedly to revoke the presumption, only to see their attempts fail or vetoed. This year is expected to be different as Gov. Jeff Landry recently signaled support for the measure from Melerine, whose law firm handles insurance defense and other litigation. 
House Bill 436, by Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, passed in a 69-17 vote. It would prohibit “unauthorized aliens” — defined in the measure as individuals illegally in the United States under federal immigration law — from receiving general damages stemming from auto accidents. General damages include compensation for pain and suffering, but the proposal would still allow recovery for “special damages,” such as medical expenses and property damage.
Firment, an insurance adjuster, said the purpose of his bill is to help address the state’s auto insurance crisis while discouraging illegal immigration. 
House Bill 443, by Rep. Chance Henry, R-Crowley, passed in a 70-22 vote. It would require plaintiffs to notify defendants of an intent to file a lawsuit within 10 days of retaining a lawyer. 
Currently, plaintiffs’ lawyers can gather evidence and prepare for a lawsuit for almost two full years before a defendant is even aware a suit is coming. Henry, an insurance agency owner, said his bill would give a defendant the same amount of time to prepare for a claim as a plaintiff.
House Bill 291, sponsored by Rep. Jay Gallé, R-Mandeville, won the most bipartisan support of the insurance bills, passing the chamber in a 90-5 vote. It would extend the filing deadline, called a “prescriptive period,” for wrongful death lawsuits from one year to two, aligning Louisiana with the deadline in most other states. 
Proponents of the bill have argued that a shorter prescriptive period attracts more tenuous lawsuits by essentially forcing people to quickly file claims so as to not lose their litigation rights. The proposal also complements a similar measure lawmakers approved last year to extend the deadline for filing personal injury claims.   
A measure that did not target litigation, House Bill 496, also gathered bipartisan support in a 86-3 vote. It would give policyholders a pass protecting them from any rate increases tied to a lapse in auto coverage. The bill would prohibit insurers from penalizing policyholders for a single instance of nonpayment during a five-year period.

Submitted on behalf of Stride, Inc. and its online education subsidiary, K12 Virtual Schools, the complaint alleges Hyatt sought a $235,000-per-year salary as Stride’s Vice President for Academic Innovation, while the company had an active contract with the school district—and when he was not hired for the position, Hyatt sought to terminate that contract.
K12 provides online education for the district’s Destinations Career Academy of New Mexico.

This story was originally published by New Mexico In Depth.

“Superintendent Hyatt is apparently knowingly and willfully abusing his public position, at the expense of ~4,200 New Mexico students” who are enrolled in online schooling, the complaint alleged.
In an email to New Mexico In Depth, Monday, Hyatt refuted the allegations, saying the company, not he, behaved in “illegal” and “unethical” ways, because of inadequate student-teacher ratios for their online courses.
“We have recently found out the illegal [and] unethical practices of Stride and how they are profiting and increasing revenue by breaking the law in our online program,” Hyatt wrote. “We notified them of their wrongdoing and had previously notified them to not break the law when it comes to students teacher ratios.”
The ethics complaint letter alleges that Hyatt potentially violated the New Mexico Government Conduct Act (GCA) and state procurement code. “The GCA has specific prohibitions against a public officer or employee seeking employment with a contractor who has a contract with the public officer or employee’s employer,” according to the complaint. “The Procurement Code similarly prohibits an employee who is participating directly or indirectly in the procurement process to become, or to be, while such an employee, the employee of any person or business contracting with the governmental body by whom the employee is employed.”
The complaint was filed by attorney Laura E. Sanchez of the law firm Rodey, Dickason, Sloan, Akin & Robb, P.A., in Albuquerque.
The New Mexico State Ethics Commission declined to comment on the complaint or its investigation plans. On Monday, Deputy Director Amelia Bierle told New Mexico In Depth in an email that the Commission does not comment on alleged ethics violations before investigations are concluded.
Gallup-McKinley signed an Educational Products & Services Contract with K12 in June 2020. Hyatt was district superintendent.
According to the company’s complaint letter, Hyatt applied for the company’s VP position on December 11, 2024 and was initially interviewed on Jan. 21, 2025.
On Feb. 21, the company’s senior vice president of schools, Adam Hawf, spoke with Hyatt by phone to let him know he had not been hired.
“Mr. Hawf called Superintendent Hyatt, as opposed to issuing him a formal letter, due to the sensitivity of the relationship and fear that Superintendent Hyatt would adversely affect the District’s relationship with the Contractor,” the complaint letter states.
In his email to New Mexico In Depth, Monday, Hyatt confirmed, “I applied for a job there in 2024.”
Less than a month after the call with Hawf, at a routine monthly meeting with the company on March 10, Hyatt’s demeanor had become “completely different than it had been in past meetings,” according to the complaint letter. “[T]he meeting was hostile […] instead of amicable and collaborative.”
On April 1, Hyatt sent a breach of contract and termination letter to the company, citing several alleged contract breaches, including inadequate student-teacher ratios, teacher licensure, and problems with student achievement in Destinations Career Academy students. Three days later, Gallup-McKinley issued a request for proposals to find a new contractor.
The termination letter violated a 45-day “cure” period for contractual disputes, the company contends. The complaint further alleges that Hyatt directed the district to issue the new request for proposals for virtual education services while Stride’s contract was still in effect, potentially violating its exclusivity provision.
Hyatt knew previously about student-teacher ratio concerns, according to the complaint letter.
“Superintendent Hyatt’s conduct after he was denied employment … shows that he is potentially abusing his authority, and not acting in the public interest,” the ethics complaint states. “He was aware of the alleged student-teacher ratios and the licensure issues prior to submitting his application for employment with the Contractor. He also served as a positive reference for the Contractor with the New Mexico PED [Public Education Department] on February 6, 2025 and for Ohio as recently as February 25, 2025, despite knowledge of the concerns he later raised in the letter to the Contractor on April 1, 2025.”
The firm submitted 18 supporting documents with the ethics complaint, including emails and correspondence, the termination letter, and the request for proposals.
The company has tried to address Hyatt’s concerns within the 45-day “cure period” set out in the contract but has been hindered by Gallup-McKinley since receiving the termination letter, according to the complaint. Examples include the district delaying teacher criminal history fingerprint clearances and refusing to sign off on teachers’ license extensions.
“Out of desperation they are attempting to deflect the harm they have done […] and are trying to create a narrative that I by myself am trying to break a contract for personal reasons,” Hyatt wrote in his email to the news organization. “Nothing could be further from the truth.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hyatt-1024x584.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

The suit argues that two companies, Express Scripts Inc. and Prime Therapeutics LLC, made an unlawful agreement to suppress reimbursement rates to independent pharmacies. According to a statement from Nessel’s office, this allowed the companies to make excessive profits and contributed to the closure of pharmacies in Michigan and across the state. 
Pharmacy benefit managers act as intermediaries between insurance providers, drug manufacturers and pharmacies, negotiating discounts and rebates with manufacturers and reimbursing pharmacies for the prescriptions they fill on behalf of the insurance company.
In December 2019, Express Scripts and Prime Therapeutics allegedly entered into an agreement for Prime Therapeutics to adopt Express Scripts’ lower reimbursement rates in exchange for accessing Express Scripts’ buying power and pharmacy network while paying Express Scripts administrative fees. Pharmacies outside this network allegedly received less money for filling prescriptions to the degree that some pharmacies paid more to dispense medication than they were reimbursed. 
Nessel argues the two companies’ agreement contributed to the creation of pharmacy deserts in half of Detroit’s neighborhoods and numerous communities throughout northern Michigan. Her suit aims to terminate the agreement, among other remedies.
“Michigan residents should not have to drive 45 minutes, or sometimes even farther, to pick up the insulin, heart medication, or antibiotics they need,” Nessel said. “Yet the unlawful, anticompetitive agreement that the lawsuit alleges has handed these PBMs unprecedented control over which pharmacies receive medication, how quickly residents get their prescriptions, and how much they’re forced to pay — crippling small, independent pharmacies and restricting access to lifesaving medications in the process.” 
“With this lawsuit, we are putting an end to these harmful practices to ensure Michiganders have reliable, affordable access to the medications they depend on,” Nessel said.

She maynot be getting any help from the state’s Child Care Assistance Program — at least not for the foreseeable future. The Mississippi Department of Human Services has put a cost-cutting hold on which families could apply.
Without it, Coleman, who works as a housekeeper, continues to rely on her relatives and friends to watch her kids, a 2-year-old and a 12-year-old, instead. She doesn’t know if she’s been rejected, but she is in a grey area. She applied in March, the month before the hold took place.
Beginning April 1, MDHS began limiting who could apply for new applications, redetermination applications, and “add a child” applications for child care certificates. 
Families who do not fit one of six priority categories (on or getting off Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, are homeless, have foster children, are teen parents, are deployed military or families with special needs) cannot apply for new certificates or have their certificates renewed. There were 36,186 children with child care certificates in late March, a week before the hold began. About 10,800 did not fit any of the six priority categories. 
Coleman is concerned that the lack of child care puts an extra strain on relatives and older children, creates a greater safety risk for young children, and makes it harder for communities to thrive.

““Our kids need the help, we need the help, because if you take the help from the American people, how do you expect us to thrive as Americans? How do you expect us to thrive as a state?” she said.
MDHS is trying to reduce the number of children receiving certificates to fewer than 27,000 to fit what the department can afford since COVID-19 relief funding dried up, with a target program cost of less than $12 million a month, said Mark Jones, chief communications officer for MDHS.
“We cannot accurately estimate how long the hold will remain in place, but we will be monitoring the situation very closely and will lift the hold as soon as we can,” he said.
MDHS will notify parents 60 days before their annual redetermination deadline. Parents who want to be notified can enter their email address in the application portal.
The Child Care Payment Program provides assistance to working parents and guardians for child care. The parent or guardian still has to pay the difference between what the program provides and the actual cost of tuition. They may also have to make a co-payment every month. 
According to Jones, Mississippi has dedicated approximately $379.9 million from various COVID-19 relief funding programs to child care since 2020. Mississippi currently spends 85% of its funds from the Child Care Development Fund on child care certificates, which was about $127 million in fiscal year 2024 and more than the federal minimum they’re required to spend. 
Mississippi also transfers 30% of its annual state funds from the Temporary Assistance For Needy Families program to child care. In 2024, that amounted to $25.9 million.

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)
Carol Burnett, executive director of the Mississippi Low Income Child Care Initiative, explained the financial impact for families: “The CCPP can reduce the cost of child care by as much as 80%. And so if a family is gonna have to pick up what the CCPP has offered, it’s gonna really increase the cost of child care for that family.”
MLICCI’s Employment Equity for Single Moms program helps single mothers in Mississippi access resources for child care and workforce development to help single moms find higher-paying work. 
A key part of the program is helping these mothers get on the Child Care Payment Program. MLICCI usually covers child care costs for its mothers while they wait to get assistance. Without the assistance, MLICCI can’t afford to pay for long-term child care.
“The biggest chunk of families on CCPP are low-income, single-mom-headed families who are working in jobs with low wages, and they’re not one of the six priorities,” said Burnett.
In addition to the financial impact on families, the hold on applications would disrupt education for children during a crucial period. Research has shown that children who attend quality early childhood education have better academic performance in elementary school.
“Without the CCPP vouchers, many families will not be able to afford child care, and so it’s likely that families’ child care arrangements will become unpredictable and piecemeal…and this uncertainty can cause children stress, which can hinder their development and growth,” explained Biz Harris, executive director of Mississippi Early Learning Alliance. 
Deloris Suel, who owns Prep Company Tutorial Schools in Jackson with her husband,said she thinks parents would be able to teach their children at home with the right training, but it would be a strain on top of their other responsibilities. 
“Child care today is not a babysitting service. There’s benchmarks and goals that we have to meet,” she said.
Prep Company Tutorial Schools serves 260 children, 61 of whom have child care certificates. Only two of their students fit among the six exception categories MDHS listed. 
Last week, a group of child care providers, parents and child care advocates held a press conference on the south steps of the Capitol, urging MDHS to lift the limits on new applications and redeterminations, communicate better with providers and families, and use the current and carry-over TANF funds to supplement the child care voucher program.
At the end of 2023, MDHS had over $156 million in unspent TANF funds, as other states do. Nationwide, states had unobligated TANF balances of nearly $8 billion in 2023. Spending this money on child care would be doable without legislative action, MLICCI said, and has already been done in other states. 
Burnett said she does not know why the state hasn’t used this method of funding. “I mean you would think that they would want to do that when they have the money rather than create this harm for so many families,” she said.
When asked why she thinks MDHS has been hesitant to use the available TANF funds, she said “I have two words: ‘Republican state.’ Because if we have other states joining hands to say, ‘Hey, we can pull this down from here.’ Why can’t Mississippi?”
When asked about using unspent TANF funds in this way, Jones responded, “MDHS is committed to following official federal guidance regarding conversion of TANF funds to CCPP. MDHS is resolved to utilize all available recurring revenue streams to support the CCPP and ensure the long-term viability of the program.”
Jones would not comment on why the department will not use left-over TANF funds.
Jones also stated, “MDHS has discussed the potential for a pause in CCPP certificates with the child care industry each month during the information sessions. The members of SECAC (State Early Childhood Advisory Council) were well aware of this potential pause as far back as 2023.”
Families can call the Child Care Payment Program call center at 800-877-7882 for questions or reach out to their nearest Resource & Referral Center for help.

Next time you’re around such politicians, especially if they are legislators or running for the Legislature, you should ask them a few questions.
Ask them why the Mississippi Legislature exempts itself from the open records and open meetings laws it levies on all other divisions of state government, and why legislative leaders have even fought in court to keep proceedings involving a majority of a legislative chamber secret from the public.
Ask them why you cannot get on your phone or computer and easily search for who funds their campaign and by how much. Then ask them why you could go to any surrounding state (and nearly all others across the country) and easily and quickly find such information.
Then, ask the same for why you cannot easily, or sometimes at all, see who buys them expensive dinners, trips or gifts to influence their voting, or why there aren’t any prohibitions or limits on this as there are in other states.
Ask their thoughts on “gift laws,” or prohibition or limits on campaign donors getting massive government contracts from the people to whom they donate.
Ask them if they believe all the folks who lobby lawmakers even bother to register as lobbyists or report what they do to influence them.
Ask them why Mississippi government, state to local, provides so few public records online, or why agencies charge so much when they do cough up records. 
Ask them why millions of dollars in out-of-state, secret-sourced “dark money” has been pouring into Mississippi elections in recent years, and what has been done to curb this.

Ask them to explain what Mississippi’s so-called “ethics laws” actually prohibit, what penalties they carry and what authority the so-called “Ethics Commission” has. Ask them how we compare here to other states, such as Alabama, where government ethics laws are actually enforced and their ethics agency has some authority.
READ MORE: Does Mississippi have any campaign finance rules?
For that matter, ask them who or what agency in Mississippi enforces campaign finance, ethics or lobbying laws.
Ask them why Mississippi’s attorney general recently decreed Mississippi’s campaign finance laws and limits to be so jacked up, convoluted and contradictory as to be unenforceable or un-prosecutable. Ask why the head of the state’s ethics agency has described Mississippi campaign finance laws as “a jigsaw puzzle that doesn’t fit.”

Ask them why, whenever even modest reforms such as campaign finance reporting requirements for politicians are proposed, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle act like their hair is on fire and line up to help kill it.
Ask them whether they believe Mississippi government is riddled with cronyism, nepotism or pay-to-play politics.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 16:01:10+00:00,CT Mirror,"Data, disease, and disparity: CT’s public health emergency",William J. Bannon IV,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/data-disease-and-disparity-connecticuts-public-health-emergency/,"When public health funding disappears, infectious disease surveillance weakens, vaccine coverage declines, mental health crises deepen, and health disparities expand.","Connecticut is facing a silent unraveling of its public health infrastructure.
In March, more than $155 million in federal public health aid was abruptly cut, destabilizing the foundation of care that thousands of Connecticut residents rely on directly, and an estimated 1.8 million benefit from indirectly through statewide immunization programs and disease surveillance efforts.
The loss includes $118.8 million for epidemiology and lab capacity, $29.2 million for immunization activities, and $4.5 million targeted toward addressing health disparities. These numbers represent vaccines that won’t be administered, outbreaks that may go untracked, and critical programs facing long-term disruption or permanent loss.
As someone involved in clinical research and public health advocacy, I’ve come to understand that health systems are only as strong as the infrastructure behind them—from frontline providers to behind-the-scenes public health programs. These funding losses are compounded by workforce disruptions. With the Centers for Disease Control eliminating entire grant oversight teams, Connecticut agencies report being unable to contact federal administrators, submit deliverables, or ensure compliance. 
Public health is not self-sustaining; it depends on coordinated systems. When those systems break down, programs stall. Public safety is compromised.
The ripple effects are already reaching vulnerable communities. The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) lost $6 million that supported harm reduction centers, maternal substance use screening, and overdose prevention. Connecticut’s opioid overdose death rate rose by over 50% between 2018 and 2023, according to the DPH Opioid Surveillance Dashboard. Pulling support from overdose reversal efforts, such as naloxone distribution, will only accelerate this trajectory.
Climate-driven public health risks are also becoming more urgent. The Office of Climate and Health had been developing localized strategies to mitigate extreme heat and worsening air quality—both of which disproportionately affect older adults, low-income communities, and individuals with cardiovascular conditions. Research from the EPA and NIH links prolonged exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and heatwaves with increased rates of heart attacks, strokes, and hospitalizations. These initiatives were supported by the CDC’s Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) framework, a science-based strategy to help communities adapt to environmental threats. Those plans are now on hold, according to internal updates from the Connecticut BRACE program.  
Meanwhile, persistent health disparities continue to plague the state. A child born in northeast Hartford can expect to live 68.9 years on average. Just 50 miles away in Westport, life expectancy climbs to 89.1 years. These disparities are not the product of biology; they stem from unequal access to care, safe housing, clean air, and economic opportunity. These cuts risk deepening longstanding inequities and dismantling the very infrastructure designed to address them.
Workforce capacity has also been compromised. Connecticut has issued stop-work orders to 69 contractors and laid off over 50 long-term public health collaborators embedded in agencies like the Department of Public Health. These professionals provided vital services ranging from lab testing to emergency response coordination. Their expertise is not easily replaced.
But this isn’t just about federal decisions—it’s about how Connecticut chooses to respond. As of March 2025, the state’s budget reserve exceeded $4.1 billion and has recorded average annual surpluses of $1.8 billion over the past seven years. These circumstances demand serious consideration of a dedicated Health Infrastructure Stabilization Fund to protect the systems we rely on most. Strategic use of these reserves could provide a critical safeguard.
Programs with demonstrated success should be prioritized. Research from the Connecticut Health Foundation shows that every $1 invested in community-based public health programs returns $14 in reduced emergency visits, lower chronic disease costs, and improved workforce productivity.. Mobile harm reduction services, air quality monitoring, and neighborhood-based health equity partnerships all fit this evidence-based model.
The health of our state is a measurable, observable reality. Reductions in funding are historically associated with increased disease burden and preventable outcomes. When preventive systems disappear, we spend more on crisis care that could have been avoided. The data tells the story long before the headlines do. What matters now is whether we choose to act.
What can Connecticut citizens do? Start with advocacy. Contact state legislators and demand immediate action to replace lost federal funds and stabilize essential services. Support local public health efforts. Donate to health equity organizations. Amplify the science on social media and in your communities. This is not only a test of policy—but of principle. What we choose to fund today will shape the health of our communities tomorrow.
When public health funding disappears, infectious disease surveillance weakens, vaccine coverage declines, mental health crises deepen, and health disparities expand. The termination of these federal grants was abrupt —but our response doesn’t have to be. If Connecticut is serious about protecting its residents, especially those most at risk, then we must move beyond concern and act now.
Good governance requires listening to the data. The science is unambiguous. Economic modeling supports intervention. The ethical obligation is no less clear. Delay only deepens the damage.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 16:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Plan to heat state buildings with natural gas system riles advocates,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/ct-state-buildings-natural-gas-heating/,The plan would upgrade a facility that supplies heating and cooling to an underground network of pipes connected to 15 buildings in Hartford.,"Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration plans to invest in a new gas heating system for state office buildings in downtown Hartford, but the decision has fueled backlash from state and local activists who say it will spew pollution into surrounding neighborhoods and undermine the governor’s own climate goals.
The administration’s plan would upgrade a facility that supplies heating and cooling to an underground network of pipes connected to 15 buildings in downtown Hartford known as the Capitol Area System.
The system — also called the “loop” — includes several government buildings including the Armory, the Supreme Court Building and the Legislative Office Building, as well as private ones like the Bushnell Theater. (The Capitol itself relies on a separate system to heat and cool the 146-year-old building.)
Hot air and water, as well as steam, is produced at the CAS plant several blocks west of the Capitol, which officials say is in desperate need of renovations — particularly after a 2021 explosion damaged the plant’s pump house and necessitated the installation of temporary boilers.
Environmental and climate activists seized upon the project, arguing that it offered the Lamont administration an opportunity to de-carbonize more than a dozen buildings at once through the installation of electric boilers or a geothermal heating and cooling system. 
But earlier this year the Department of Administrative Services announced that it was opting to move forward with a “hybrid” approach, utilizing both heat pumps and newer natural gas boilers to power the system. The upgrade is estimated to cost roughly $42 million and take several years to complete.
The decision infuriated advocates, who accused Lamont of breaking his pledge to reduce the use of fossil fuels to heat and cool state buildings.
“He’s going against his own word,” said Alycia Jenkins, a Sierra Club organizer from Hartford. “It falls in line with what we see happening across this country, people choosing fossil fuels, people choosing natural gas.”
Jenkins and other opponents of the state’s plans say they want a new study to examine the feasibility of turning the CAS into a geothermal system, which would harness ambient temperatures from deep underground that can provide heat in the winter and cooling during the summer.
Similar systems are being piloted nearby in Framingham, Mass., and — dependent on federal funding — at New Haven’s Union Station. 
Leigh Appleby, a spokesman for DAS, said the state has not entirely given up on potentially cleaner options for the future of the facility. In an email last week, he said that the next step in the process would be to hire an engineering consultant to study the hybrid approach, along with other “viable alternatives” that could reduce costs or carbon emissions.
“We recognize that the selected option of heat pumps and natural gas condensing boilers is not zero emissions, as many of the comments advocated,” Appleby said. “However, other factors, most notably the uncertainty surrounding the long-term location of the CAS facility due to the anticipated realignment of I-84, prevented the implementation of more costly and extensive zero-emission scenarios. During the design development process, we will seek additional opportunities to reduce emissions.” 
When asked about the project during an event commemorating Earth Day last week, Lamont said he was concerned about the cost of updating the facility along with the environmental impacts.
“We’re going to look at everything, and we’re also going to let the taxpayers know what the relative costs of everything are,” Lamont said. “I think affordability has got to be on the table right alongside what we’re celebrating here on Earth Day.”
According to a decarbonization study commissioned by DAS in 2023, the hybrid approach selected by the administration would produce about 197,668 fewer metric tons of carbon dioxide over the next three decades — the equivalent of driving nearly 50,000 cars for a year — compared to it’s current operations.
Still, the study found that utilizing a geothermal system or a combination of all-electric boilers and heat pumps could reduce emissions by an additional 80% or more.
The total cost to build the new system — including the $42 million in construction costs — and operate it for for the next three decades using the hybrid approach was roughly $164 million, according to the study. That was nearly half the cost of using all-electric boilers and about one-third less than the cost of geothermal.
Opponents, however, argue that the volatile price of natural gas as well as the future health care costs for people living in the vicinity of the plant could put the plant’s price tag much higher.
“The cost is not just the cost of rebuilding this plant, it’s maintaining this plant for 30 to 35 years, because that’s how long it’s going to be there, [releasing] all kinds of toxic pollutants into the air and creating all kinds of asthma and respiratory conditions,” said Cynthia Jennings, a former Hartford councilwoman who is involved with local efforts to oppose the state’s plans.
Jenkins, the Sierra Club organizer, pointed to data showing that Hartford has among the highest asthma rates of any city in the nation. While attending Trinity College, Jenkins said she lived in the Frog Hollow neighborhood abutting the CAS plant, and later developed bronchitis as an adult.
“We’re concerned about the air pollution, we’re concerned about asthma rates, and we’re also concerned about jobs,” Jenkins said.
The state’s study — conducted by Veolia, a French infrastructure management company — attempted to calculate the so-called “social” costs of carbon pollution, such as human health impacts, property damage from floods and storms, and changes in agricultural productivity. The study concluded that they did not outweigh the additional expenses of carbon-free options.
Asked for comment on the project this week, a spokesman for Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam said it was a “state matter” and deferred further requests to the governor’s office. 
The CAS plant was originally constructed in 1988 as a cogeneration plant producing both electricity as well as steam that was used to heat and cool buildings connected to the loop. At the time, it was the second-largest source of air pollution in the city of Hartford, according to the Sierra Club. 
The previous owners of the plant, Capitol District Energy Center Cogeneration Associates Property Co., shuttered its gas-powered electric turbines in 2021, several months before the pump room explosion, and sold the facility to the state the next year for $7.3 million.
In the public notice of its decision to adopt the hybrid power plan, DAS said the decommissioning of the plant’s power-generation capabilities will reduced annual greenhouse gas emissions by more than two-thirds, and that it is no longer considered a major source of air pollution as defined by the federal Clean Air Act. The agency added that its review of the project determined it will not result in “significant environmental impacts,” and thus does not require a separate environmental impact study.
During a public comment period, officials at Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection submitted several recommendations regarding applicable environmental laws and regulations during construction, but the agency did not signal any overall objections to the project. A DEEP spokesman deferred to DAS for comment on the project. 
Appleby, the DAS spokesman, said work is expected to begin this summer to demolish and remove old, unused equipment from the site including wiring, generators, turbines, chilling equipment and a boiler. That work is intended to make space for the installation of new equipment.
Following the completion of the engineering study and design work, Appleby said construction will begin around December 2027 assuming funding for the project is in place. Work is expected to be completed sometime in 2029. 
Lamont’s budget proposal for the upcoming year called for an additional $16 million in capital expenses for the CAS project, bringing the total available funding through bonds to $35 million.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA Kennesaw State University faculty advisory panel wants to team up with other universities to fight what some call inappropriate political influence from the Trump administration and state leaders.
The university’s faculty Senate voted 30-7 Monday on a resolution to establish a mutual defense compact. Kennesaw students have expressed concerns over the university’s plans to shut down student resource centers that help members of minority groups, apparently as part of a national push against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI.
The Trump administration has engaged in a public pressure campaign against elite college campuses over what the president views as left-wing indoctrination as well as student protests over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. State lawmakers are also targeting DEI, including through a bill that would ban programs or activities that promote diversity, equity and inclusion at all grade levels. That bill stalled this year, but will still be active when next year’s session begins in January.
Matthew Boedy, president of the Georgia chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said the University System of Georgia is targeting programs associated with DEI.
“That includes any scholarship that is funded by any third party, and then also multicultural offices, and the decades-long African-American Male Initiative, which is a USG thing, every campus version of that is being shut down, and this is all supposed to happen by the end of the academic year or the end of the fiscal year, and they do say that faculty who may have been a part of that or working those things will be reassigned, but there’s no guarantee that staff would be reassigned. That has been the USG directive to all schools here in the last two weeks or so.”
According to the KSU faculty Senate’s resolution, faculty senates from institutions across the country have recommended joining such a compact, including Rutgers University, Indiana University, the University of Nebraska, Michigan State University, Yale and UMass Amhurst.
Member institutions would “commit meaningful support—financial, legal, organizational, and/or strategic—to a shared or distributed defense infrastructure designed to respond immediately and collectively to attacks by the governmental actors on any member institution,” according to the resolution.
The KSU faculty Senate is an advisory board to the university’s president, Kathy Schwaig, and would need her approval to actually join.
Boedy didn’t mince words on the likelihood of that happening.
“This is a symbolic move,” he said. “The faculty Senate is asking the university administration to participate in legal filings, amicus briefs, defending academic freedom, using state funds, their institutional funds, to do this. Whether or not these presidents will actually do this is not an open question – they’re not going to do this, at least in the USG. So I would say it’s a symbolic move, but it is also a very powerful, powerful symbolic move for the Senate to say, ‘You’re not doing this, and you need to do this.’”
Boedy said he expects other university faculties across the nation to take similar actions, though he’s not aware of any others in Georgia with concrete plans.
“To be honest with you, part of the debate was what are the consequences for signing on to this? Would there be political or state consequences for signing on to this?” he said. “That’s a real concern for many faculty, even though the vote at Kennesaw was overwhelming, that was a concern.”

The Ohio Supreme Court is keeping the ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth as the case goes through litigation.
In March, the 10th District Court of Appeals partially blocked the state from enforcing House Bill 68, a ban on gender-affirming care for LGBTQ+ youth, allowing doctors to continue prescribing puberty blockers and hormone therapy.
Attorney General Dave Yost filed a motion with the high court to stay the law, or pause changes, until a full review by the justices. This was granted Tuesday.
H.B. 68 went into effect in 2024. The controversial legislation prevented LGBTQ+ minors from accessing care such as hormone blockers, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and some mental health services.
“There is no way I’ll stop fighting to protect these unprotected children,” Yost said, in part, in a statement from the March ruling.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe law has been in court for months now, with the ACLU of Ohio arguing that it is unconstitutional and goes against parental rights and the right to bodily autonomy.
“It is a terrible shame that the Supreme Court of Ohio is permitting the state to evade compliance with the Ohio Constitution. Our clients have suffered tangible and irreparable harm during the eight months that H.B. 68 has been in place, including being denied essential health care in their home state,” Freda Levenson, ACLU legal director, said. “The Court of Appeals was correct that H.B. 68 violates at least two separate provisions of the Ohio Constitution. We will continue to fight this extreme ban as the case goes ahead before the Supreme Court of Ohio.”
The law also prohibits trans athletes from participating in middle, high school or college athletics on teams that align with their identity.
In July 2024, parents and doctors testified to prevent the state from enforcing the ban, citing that the ban would “deny basic human rights.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 15:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Records restored for some CT international students, but many remain in legal limbo",Eddy Martinez | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/ct-international-students-records-restored/,Several international students in CT can now resume their employment and studies after their records were restored in a federal database.,"Several international students in Connecticut can now resume their employment and studies after their records were restored in a federal database, according to the University of Connecticut.
“We have learned that all of the impacted students at UConn have now had their SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Program) records restored by the federal government, meaning absent some other unexpected change, they should be able to resume their studies and work at UConn uninterrupted,” UConn officials said in a statement.
This comes after the federal government announced Friday it would move to restore the statuses of many international students who previously had their records eliminated in recent weeks.
But the update doesn’t mean the federal government will abandon attempts at revoking visas, according to a Georgia attorney representing four Connecticut students who are a part of a nationwide lawsuit in a federal district court in Georgia.
Their attorney, Charles Kuck, previously obtained a temporary restraining order against the government to restore his clients’ statuses before the government made their announcement last Friday. But Kuck emphasized the government is simply buying time to resume their efforts.
“What ICE said was that they were temporarily restoring, as of that date, the SEVIS access, leaving students with a large gap of unlawful status,” Kuck said. “And they also indicated they were drafting new rules so they could reinstate the revocation.”
Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary, did not reveal how many foreign students in Connecticut are affected by the federal government’s abrupt reversal on Friday. All the federal government did, she said, was to restore the records for certain foreign students.
“What we did is restore SEVIS access for people who had not had their visa revoked,” McLaughlin said.
UConn spokesperson Stephanie Reitz said in a statement the restoration of those records is distinct from restoring a previously revoked student visa.
“When a person’s SEVIS record is deleted, they are unable to prove their visa status for purposes of travel, work, etc., even if the visa has not been revoked,” Reitz said.
Kuck said he will file a class action lawsuit in response to what he said is an anticipated move by the federal government to impose harsher rules for foreign students.
According to Reitz, none of the students at UConn had their visas revoked by the federal government, although according to her, 300 international students nationwide, have. McLaughlin said the federal government has not reversed their decision on a single visa revocation.
Kuck said he is also awaiting a decision in Georgia on whether his clients can have their statuses restored for the duration of the lawsuit. A decision is expected this week.

DemasA federal judge in Detroit has ended litigation against one of the companies that consulted with the city of Flint when lead contamination led to a drinking water crisis 10 years ago. 
U.S. District Judge Judith Levy entered the final judgment Monday for the $53 million settlement reached in February in a lawsuit brought by the state of Michigan and approximately 26,000 individuals claiming Veolia North America, or VNA, contributed to the Flint Water Crisis by failing to properly identify corrosion control treatment issues.
It was alleged that the Boston-based company did not do enough to get Flint to treat its water so that it would be less corrosive inside the city’s lead pipes. That followed the 2014 switch from Lake Huron to the Flint River as the city’s water source, a decision made by emergency managers appointed by then-Gov. Rick Snyder as a cost-saving move. 
VNA claimed it had only been hired to do a one-week assessment on carcinogens, not specifically lead content, and that it has made recommendations to the city about corrosion control.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The $53 million agreed to in the settlement will be distributed among the plaintiffs who were directly impacted by the lead-tainted water, including a significant number of children.  
With the settlement, the state will also dismiss a separate lawsuit against VNA.
The company, in a statement, said the settlement was not an admission of guilt and argued that public officials were to blame for the crisis.
“VNA stands behind its good work in Flint. The only jury who had to consider the facts and hear the truth did not find any evidence to say otherwise” referencing a nearly six-month long trial in 2022, which ended in a mistrial.
“As the facts of the 2022 trial clearly demonstrate, the Flint water crisis was caused by government officials. It is a disgrace that nearly a decade plus since the crisis was set in motion, still no person who was actually responsible has been held accountable,” said VNA’s release. 
Snyder, a Republican who left office in 2019, and eight other high-level officials, were charged in January 2021 in connection with the water crisis.  However, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that a judge lacked the authority to issue the indictments, and all of the charges were later dismissed.  
However, the crisis did result in the largest civil settlement in Michigan history. 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced in March 2023 a settlement totaling about $626.25 million had been formally approved, with the state ordered to pay $600 million, the city of Flint $20 million, the McLaren Regional Medical Center $5 million and $1.25 million from Rowe Professional Services.
Nessel said the settlement with VNA had finally closed out a chapter for Flint residents. 
“While no amount of money can fully repair the damage caused to the Flint community, these funds will provide additional resources to those directly impacted, especially Flint children, by this preventable crisis,” Nessel said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC08883-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Republican State Auditor Allison Ball is calling five open records requests from a Kentucky Democratic Party official “an attempt to intimidate me” from investigating how the state’s Office of Medical Cannabis processed license applications. 
Ball, who has previously clashed with the Beshear administration over her office’s investigations, issued a statement Monday saying after she announced the investigation into OMC earlier this month Kentucky Democrats “sent five Open Records Act requests to my office in what can only be described as an attempt to intimidate me from continuing the investigation.” However, the Kentucky Democratic Party denied that the requests were related to Ball’s investigation. 
Ball said a Finance and Administration Cabinet official sent similar open records requests after her office announced investigations into the Cabinet for Health and Family Services in recent months. 
“It is a shame that parties would seek to weaponize the Open Records Act, an important transparency tool, as a political weapon,” Ball said. “Because I believe in the importance of transparency, I have responded to the KDP’s requests in full, just as I did to the Finance Cabinet requests.  
“Kentucky should rest assured that these intimidation tactics will not work. I will continue to carry out the job that Kentuckians elected me to do.”
Under the Kentucky Open Records Act, members of the public may request records from public agencies within the state. 
Kentucky Democratic Party spokesperson Nat Turner said in a statement to the Kentucky Lantern that Ball “is trying to manufacture partisan drama, and what she is alleging is not true.” 
“The requests in question were not related to her audit; they were for records related to grievances, personal appeals, travel records and her use of taxpayer money to attend a religious leadership conference,” Turner said. “Transparency is important and Auditor Ball has a responsibility to be accountable to Kentuckians.”
Joy Markland, a spokesperson for Ball, shared copies of the requests made by the Democrats and responses of the auditor’s office. The records match the requests Turner described. In a search for the records, the auditor’s office found no records of grievances from staff members filed this year and provided records related to travel, personal appeals and contracts entered by the office. 
Amye Bensenhaver, a retired Kentucky assistant attorney general and co-founder and co-director of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition, said “all is fair in love and open records.” The state law is “intended to be almost blind to who is asking and why they’re asking,” with some limitations on requests made for commercial reasons, she added. 
Ball’s accusation against the state Democratic party is also “weaponizing the law,” Bensenhaver said. 
“Ultimately, you could be a thin-skinned public official who shows resistance or expresses outrage when your office is expected to produce records, but it tends to undermine your credibility when you’re seeking records from another public agency,” Bensenhaver said. 
Some political staffers look for information to use in campaign messaging through open record requests. Ahead of the 2023 governor’s race, the office of then Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron ruled Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration violated the Kentucky Open Records Act when denying part of a request from the Republican Party of Kentucky. Cameron later became the Republican nominee and was defeated by Beshear that fall.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fancyfarmfull_08-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 13:19:37.712180

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The federal government has restored the student record of a doctoral candidate from India at South Dakota Mines in Rapid City, but the fight over her student visa continues. 
The record restoration from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement means Priya Saxena could collect her degree at graduation on May 10.
But the revocation of her student visa means she could still be subject to deportation before her visa was originally scheduled to expire in February 2027. If deported, she would also lose the opportunity to apply for an extension to remain in the country after graduation and do work related to her degree.
The news of her record restoration came by way of a motion filed by ICE attorneys in Saxena’s federal lawsuit against ICE and the federal Homeland Security secretary, former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. 
A dozen international students report visa cancellations in South Dakota

A little more than a week ago, U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier ordered the agency to restore Saxena’s student record.
The U.S. State Department issues and manages visas, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement maintains the student record system used by schools across the country to verify and manage international student eligibility. 
ICE terminated more than 1,000 international student records in that system in recent weeks, but reversed course over the weekend. The decision impacted cases across the country similar to Saxena’s.
In South Dakota, a dozen international student visas were impacted by the recent moves. Saxena’s name is the only one that’s appeared in the public sphere, thanks to her lawsuit.
The visa revocation for Saxena came after a “criminal records check,” according to documents filed in her lawsuit. Her only criminal conviction came in 2021, for the misdemeanor of failure to move over for flashing yellow lights.
In its filing Monday night in her case, ICE called Judge Schreier’s order to restore Saxena’s student record “moot,” because the agency had moved to restore terminated international student records across the U.S.
Saxena has asked for a preliminary injunction that would prevent deportation until the lawsuit is resolved. The federal government says a preliminary injunction is a bridge too far, arguing that district court judges don’t have the authority to interfere with visa status determinations. 
A hearing in the matter is set for May 13.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 15:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump orders list of ‘sanctuary cities’ to target for funding freeze,Ariana Figueroa | States Newsroom,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/trump-sanctuary-cities-funding-freeze/,Trump's executive orders threaten to revoke federal funding from cities that do not coordinate with federal immigration authorities.,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday evening signed executive orders targeting so-called sanctuary cities by threatening to revoke federal funding and providing legal services and national security assets to law enforcement.
The signings fell on the eve of Trump’s first 100 days of his second term, during which his administration has enacted an immigration crackdown that has led to clashes with the judiciary branch and cities that do not coordinate with federal immigration authorities, often referred to as “sanctuary cities.”
“Some State and local officials nevertheless continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws,” according to the executive order regarding sanctuary cities. “This is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law and the Federal Government’s obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the United States.”
The order directs the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to publicly list local jurisdictions that limit cooperation with immigration officials, but do not stop immigration enforcement.
Jurisdictions on the list will then be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget to “identify appropriate Federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, including grants and contracts, for suspension or termination, as appropriate.”
This is not the first time the Trump administration has targeted jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. 
The Justice Department recently filed a lawsuit against the city of Rochester, New York, over its immigration policies after local law enforcement did not assist federal immigration officials in an arrest. The Trump administration argued those ordinances in Rochester were impeding federal immigration enforcement.
The president also signed an executive order in January that threatened to withhold federal funding from states and local governments that refused to aid in federal immigration enforcement activities. A federal judge in San Francisco last week blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from 16 so-called sanctuary cities.
Republicans have also scrutinized those policies, including during a six-hour hearing of the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that included grilling mayors from Boston, Chicago and Denver, on their cities’ immigration policies. 
The executive order also aims to curb any federal benefits that may extend to people without permanent legal status.
That executive order directed DOJ and DHS to “take appropriate action to stop the enforcement of State and local laws” that allow for students without proper legal authorization to receive in-state tuition, which would include those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.
Last week, administration officials cheered the FBI arrest of a Wisconsin judge who they say helped an immigrant in the country without legal authorization escape detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The arrest followed the third appearance by ICE officers seeking to make arrests at the Milwaukee County Courthouse, a practice some experts believe hinders local law enforcement.
Law enforcement resources
A second executive order Trump signed Monday provides legal resources for law enforcement officials “who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law.”
The order also directs coordination among the departments of Justice, Defense and Homeland Security to “increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist State and local law enforcement.” 
Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the executive order relating to law enforcement will “strengthen and unleash America’s law enforcement to pursue criminals and protect innocent citizens.”

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

“These cuts represent some of the best options of bad options,” said Kyle Murray, the Massachusetts program director at the Acadia Center about the new compliance plan for Mass Save, which reduces the budget for heat pump incentives and program to help residents use one vendor for energy efficiency upgrades. 
The post Utility companies target heat pump ince[...]","After state officials reduced Mass Save’s proposed budget by $500 million in February, the utility companies that run the energy efficiency program have proposed a new pared down compliance plan with the largest cuts coming to incentives for heat pumps and a program that provides a one-stop shop for residents looking to weatherize and invest in electrification upgrades.  Six utility companies, including Eversource and National Grid, run the Mass Save program with the guidance of the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council. The utility companies presented their compliance plan with cuts on Monday to the council.  The new plan cuts $220 million from heat pump rebates and a loan program that offers zero percent financing for qualifying energy-efficiency upgrades that include heat pump projects for residents. The plan also cuts $207 million from a “residential turnkey” program which is a streamlined solution that coordinates weatherization, barrier mitigation, and electrification upgrade projects through a single vendor that manages all steps of the process.  There are also smaller cuts of $43 million to the sales, technical assistance, and training budget, $12 million to the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center for economic development for green jobs, and $2 million to a program offering that translates program materials into different languages. Generally, the cuts come from programs targeted towards residents in market-rate housing and to a lesser degree moderate income housing. The Department of Public Utilities directed the utility companies not to cut funding from programs targeted towards lower-income residents.   “It has been a trying and challenging time going back and fundamentally revisiting a lot of what we planned over the last year and a half,” said Brian Greenfield, a supervisor of energy efficiency regulatory and planning at Eversource, who presented the plan to the council. “Faced with this order and dissecting what was in the plan and where we could make adjustments to comply with the required $500 million reduction to the residential budgets, the [utility companies] prioritized maintaining our program design and we are eager to get into and focus on implementing these plans over the course of the term.” The council voted to support the compliance plan. The utility companies will submit the revised compliance filing to the DPU for approval by April 30. Mass Save estimates it has provided $31 billion in total energy cost savings since it launched in 2013. The initial proposed budget projected that the program would save another $13.7 billion between 2025 and 2027. According to Greenfield, the cuts to the program will result in an 11 percent decrease in the total benefits in the next three years, bringing the total benefits down to $12.2 billion. “These cuts represent some of the best options of bad options,” said Kyle Murray, a member of the council and the Massachusetts program director at the Acadia Center, a non-profit research and advocacy organization dedicated to combating climate change.  The Mass Save program – which helps homes and businesses become more energy efficient and reduces greenhouse gas emissions – is funded through a surcharge on electricity and gas bills. After gas bills spiked across the state due to an unusually cold winter and the increase in the Mass Save surcharge, the DPU decreased the budget for the program from the proposed $5 million to $4.5 million. The DPU directed that the cut come from programming for the residential sector.  Environmentalist advocates including Murray called the move “short-sighted,” saying that the cut will result in increased costs for residents in the long run.  The energy efficiency program is key to the state’s decarbonization efforts. Massachusetts aims to convert 500,000 households to heat pumps by 2030, but even that target – which was set before Mass Save saw its budget pared back – would fall short of what the state needs to do to meet its climate goals of being carbon neutral by 2050.  The post Utility companies target heat pump incentives for cuts to pare back Mass Save budget appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Worcester_Housing_Triple_Three_Decker_Homes.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 11:05:03.578804

The post M[...]","PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP raked in nearly $4.1 million for his 2025 inauguration from donors and businesses with Massachusetts addresses, just under two percent of the total $239 million raised for the parties tied to his swearing-in for a second term in January. Trump’s inaugural committee reported the names and figures earlier this month in a filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which showed the president beating the previous record he set: $107 million for his first inauguration. Presidential inaugurations feature the oath of office as well as official and unofficial balls or galas in Washington, D.C., offering a way for companies and individuals to ingratiate themselves with a new administration. Large corporations made appearances on the list, including e-commerce giant Amazon and Facebook owner Meta, which each gave $1 million. The largest donation, coming in at $5 million, was from Pilgrim’s Pride, a poultry producer based in Colorado. Cryptocurrency interests also donated, with Ripple Labs donating $4.9 million. The 21 Massachusetts donors and businesses, with donations totaling roughly $4.1 million, fell below their counterparts in other states, such as Pennsylvania ($8.6 million) and Michigan ($6.4 million). Both were swing states in 2024, while Massachusetts has remained a Democratic stronghold, with Ronald Reagan the last Republican to win the Bay State in 1984. CommonWealth Beacon reviewed the Trump inauguration fundraising committee’s filing with the Federal Election Commission, which included donors and companies listing Massachusetts addresses. One of the largest donors in the state was a company tied to billionaire and car dealership magnate Ernie Boch Jr. The company, which is called Boston Port Service and shares an address with his nonprofit charity Music Drives Us, donated $1 million. Boch, who previously hosted a fundraiser for Trump in 2015, was unreachable for comment. DraftKings, the Boston-based gambling company with a focus on sports betting, gave $502,000, while FanDuel, its New York-based rival, gave $482,000. Another $500,000 came from GE Vernova, a Cambridge-based energy technology company working in the renewable power sector. The company, whose wind power division is grappling with a White House that has sought to put a stop to new wind turbine projects, spun off from the conglomerate General Electric in 2024. (CommonWealth Beacon reached out to DraftKings and GE Vernova for comment but did not hear back.) Jessica Beeson Tocco, the CEO of A10 Associates, which bills itself as the country’s “largest woman-owned bipartisan lobbying firm,” personally donated $101,652 to the Trump inauguration committee and then an additional $50,000 through her Malden-based company. (The company also hosted a cocktail reception at the Waldorf Astoria the weekend before the inauguration, according to Politico.) One of her clients, Quantum Computing Inc. CEO William McGann, also donated $101,652. He is retiring from the technology company in May and is listed as having an East Falmouth address on the FEC’s records.  Reached for comment, Tocco stressed that her firm’s donations go to top elected officials in both parties, with contributions flowing to prominent Massachusetts Democrats like US Sen. Ed Markey, Gov. Maura Healey, and Congresswoman Lori Trahan. A potential Healey rival for the corner office in the State House, Michael Minogue, donated $250,000 to the Trump inauguration committee. Minogue, who now has his own consulting firm after serving as president and CEO of medical technology company Abiomed, has previously donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican National Committee and the state GOP. He also gave several thousand dollars to former Gov. Charlie Baker and Josh Kraft, who is looking to unseat Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, according to publicly available campaign finance records. Others gave smaller amounts. Sriprakash Kothari, an accounting professor at MIT and a Lexington resident who regularly donates to the state GOP, gave $2,500 to the Trump inauguration committee. Kothari, who worked as the chief economist for the US Securities and Exchange Commission during the first Trump administration, declined to comment about the donation. Some of the donors, like the company tied to Boch, had to be tracked through corporate documents on file with the Massachusetts secretary of state’s office. For example, Randolph-based GGBF Inc. donated $50,000 to the Trump inauguration committee, according to the FEC filing. Documents on file with the state show the company shares the same address and same president as NEI General Contracting, Josef Rettman. Rettman has mostly donated to Democrats at the state and local level, and a mix at the federal level, including US Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Trump White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s 2022 congressional campaign in New Hampshire. The list of donors to the inauguration committee did not include the names of some major donors who had previously contributed to the first Trump presidential campaign or the first inauguration in 2017. Jim Davis, the chairman of shoemaker New Balance, donated nearly $400,000 to support Trump’s 2016 campaign. The Kraft Group, tied to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, didn’t donate to the 2025 inauguration after donating $1 million for the 2017 inauguration. Ahead of the 2024 election, Kraft distanced himself from Trump, saying he was “very upset” by the insurrection attempt to keep Trump in office on January 6, 2021. Kraft has since reportedly helped a law firm, Paul Weiss, broker a peace deal with Trump, who has targeted lawyers through executive orders. “I made a strong donation to his [2017] inauguration,” Kraft said during an appearance on a radio show last October. “I couldn’t believe it, it was like having someone who was a drunk fraternity brother become president of the United States.” Massachusetts donors to Trump inauguration

State lawmakers across the country are joining forces to pursue legislation for basic income programs to help reduce poverty. (John Moore/Getty Images)To California Democratic state Sen. David Cortese, the idea of gaining Republican support for a bill to provide cash to certain residents would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.
But his proposed legislation to offer $1,000 per month to homeless youth has so far received bipartisan support in the state Senate.
“It’s being embraced,” said Cortese. “This was not even considered possible five years ago.”
Cortese is among more than 20 Democratic lawmakers from 17 states launching Legislators for a Guaranteed Income on Tuesday to advocate for programs that provide direct, regular cash payments to lower-income residents to help alleviate poverty. They join a network of more than 245 mayors and county officials who have pursued dozens of basic income pilot projects across the country.
The lawmakers want to see states play a larger role in guaranteed income programs, which aim to help residents in need by handing out no-strings-attached cash.
Red states fight growing efforts to give ‘basic income’ cash to residents

The concept of basic income programs took off following a 2019 experiment in Stockton, California. There, 125 individuals received $500 per month for two years, which researchers found improved their financial stability and health.
Michael Tubbs, the former Democratic mayor of Stockton and current executive chairman of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, said these kinds of efforts are more important now as economic uncertainty and high prices squeeze the most vulnerable people.
“The work around guaranteed income is moving from cities and counties to states,” he said. “We’re going to be organizing state officials across the country who see what we all see: that affordability is an issue, that the Trump tariffs and gross mismanagement of the economy has made the problem even worse.”
While the concept has gained traction across the country, Republican state lawmakers have pushed bills to ban basic income programs, arguing they disincentivize work.
Last year, then-state Sen. John Wiik sponsored successful legislation banning South Dakota localities from launching basic income programs. At the time, the Republican said he was worried about people growing dependent upon the government.
“So, if you get people addicted to just getting a check from the government, it’s going to be really hard to take that away,” he told Stateline.
Legislators for a Guaranteed Income says its 23 members have so far introduced 25 bills across 11 states.










The work around guaranteed income is moving from cities and counties to states.

Those include Cortese’s proposed legislation in California to create a new program to help homeless youth transition out of high school.
Eligible students would receive four monthly payments of $1,000 each beginning in May. That bill, expected to cost $40 million to $50 million, has passed through two state Senate committees.
Cortese previously advocated for a 2023 California program that was the nation’s first state-funded pilot of a basic income program targeting former foster youth. He pointed to research showing basic income programs supplement, rather than replace, the need for work. And he said growing these programs can eventually reduce costs for other social safety net programs.
“I’m so pleased to see the proliferation that we’ve seen so far,” he said. “I think that it will become ubiquitous as a way of doing things and that’s going to outlast me and my career.”
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

In Pennsylvania, Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta said he’s still exploring details on legislation for a basic income program there.
He said pilot projects across the country have proven that people pay rent, buy groceries and invest in small businesses when they have more financial freedom.
“So, this isn’t really some big experiment,” he said. “It is a proven way to reduce poverty, improve health care, boost our local economies and really get a real return on that investment.”
Kenyatta said so-called trickle-down policies that aim to boost business interests and high earners have failed many ordinary people.
“But basic income really flips that equation on its head,” he said. “It’s not about charity. It’s about power, and about giving people the power and the resources to breathe.”

(Cade Rothenberger for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Fear that federal funding cuts will mean loved ones won’t receive nutritional food and safety checks through Meals on Wheels is driving an increase of calls to agencies across Kansas.
“It’s scary,” said Laurel Alkire, executive director of Senior Services Inc. of Wichita. “I’ve had a lot of families call me about their mom or dad. We’re trying to not overreact, but it’s very concerning.”
The fear is generated by potential federal funding cuts from multiple sources that could affect Meals on Wheels budgets nationwide, said Josh Protas, an advocate at the organization’s national office, Meals on Wheels America. 
“I think there’s a lot of confusion and a lot of anxiety that we’re hearing from across our network that is in response to multiple threats that are happening all at once,” he said.
Programs facing federal cuts include those funded by Health and Human Services, which has faced “massive” cuts of budget and personnel, Protas said. A leaked budget document signaled intentions to cut and split apart some programs that serve older adults. 
Also of concern is the ongoing budget reconciliation process, which among other things may include elimination of social services block grants and cuts to the Older Americans Act, he said. 
“Social Services Block Grants are a critical source of funding for many Meals on Wheels programs to help fill in the gaps where there are shortfalls in other funding sources,” Protas said. 
Proposed cuts to Medicaid also could harm Meals on Wheels budgets because those funds sometimes offer reimbursements, he said. 
Isys Schmitt, director of nutrition at the Northwest Kansas Area Agency on Aging, said her agency serves 18 counties at 28 sites in northwest Kansas. 
“I do hear the concerns from participants,” she said. “I think it’s more they hear these things on the news, and they automatically think it’s going to affect our program very badly.”
Her agency receives about 25% of its funding from federal sources, 25% from the state, and the rest in contributions, Schmitt said. 
Protas said Meals on Wheels programs are all funded through different mechanisms, so it’s difficult to tell how cuts might affect each program. Some get almost no federal funding, while others may receive 80% of funds from federal sources.
 
 Staying calm, planning ahead

Julie Govert Walter, executive director of the North Central-Flint Hills Area Agency on Aging Inc., is assessing potential cuts and trying to plan for how her agency might be affected, including the Meals on Wheels program it runs. 
“We’re right now telling people don’t panic,” she said. “We don’t want our elder Kansans to stress out over the uncertainty. At the same time, we want lawmakers in Washington to understand that the Older Americans Act programs are making significant differences in the lives of older Kansans and their caregivers and their families.”
About half of Walter’s agency budget is derived from the Older Americans Act, with about 34% of the allocation and related in-kind match donations supporting the meals program in 18 northeast Kansas counties.
Alkire said that Wichita’s Senior Services has other programs besides Meals on Wheels, including a senior employment program and four senior centers for active seniors 55 and older. 
“Meals on Wheels is our bread and butter,” she said. “We’ve got some reserves, but that wouldn’t last long.”
Walter said she believes the programs her organization runs are aligned with Trump administration policies because they’re frugal, cost-conscious and have significant volunteer support. In addition, Meals on Wheels helps seniors live independently, which often keeps them out of more costly nursing home facilities. 
Protas said the national organization is walking the line of not scaring seniors about funding cuts but making sure people are reaching out to make their voices heard.
“Many of these things that we’re worried about, there haven’t been final decisions made yet,” he said. “So we’re using this time to advocate and to just tell the story about Meals on Wheels. We’re advising our Meals on Wheels member programs to do some contingency planning so that in the event that there are delays or disruptions in funding, they’re not caught off guard. We’re not doing that in a way that instills panic, but we recognize that the threats are serious.”
 
 No budget numbers

Walter said planning right now is tough because of political uncertainties, but even more so because she doesn’t have information from the feds that she needs. Usually by this time of year, she knows what her budget is for the upcoming year. She doesn’t have those numbers yet to plan for fiscal year 2026, which will start in October. 
In mid-March, Congress funded the Older Americans Act and other programs through September 2025 with a continuing resolution. But no one knows what will happen next, Walter said. When she considers potential cuts of up to 30% of her agency’s funding, she’s not sure how to think about what actions to take. 
Options could include cutting the number of days they serve meals from five to two or three, but that would involve potential workforce cuts, she said. 
“It’s a puzzle,” she said. “We’re doing what we can to communicate with members of Congress about our situation, and I will say I think most members of the Kansas congressional delegation understand the importance of the OAA.”
 
 Little understanding of aging

Walter said one of the biggest challenges is communicating with people about the importance of Meals on Wheels and other programs for aging Kansans. 
“We all know what it’s like to be a kid, to be an adolescent, to be a young adult, and to be in middle age,” she said. “But honestly, most people don’t get what it’s like to really deal with challenges and the anxieties of being older, 75 and 80 plus, until we’re there. It’s so dependent on health and community and social relationships.”
“The stress and uncertainty is real, and it has real effects on people’s minds and hearts and spirits,” Walter said. “It’s hard to quantify, but you know it’s real. Drama is not good for older people.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4-28-25-Meals-on-Wheels-Hays-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-29 10:03:43.297250

Missouri’s Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Task Force is comprised of state senators and representatives, and the task force chose professor Rachel Winograd to represent its recommendations before the House Health and Mental Health Committee.
Winograd researches addiction science and works to develop solutions to substance abuse at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.
Changes to the state’s drug supply inspired the task force’s recommendations. Winograd said even though opioid deaths are decreasing and deaths from stimulants have plateaued, new street drugs like Xylazine (a veterinary sedative commonly known as “tranq”) complicate efforts to combat substance abuse.
“Across my last two years of sitting with the substance abuse task force, I reviewed our recommendations, which were plentiful,” Winograd said. “I did my best to cluster them in five key domains.”
 Funding

Winograd said funding for substance abuse prevention needs to increase or at least stay at its current level.
Medicaid, she said, has been crucial in caring for people with addictions without tapping into state funds.
Most state funding for substance abuse treatment comes from sales tax on cannabis and tobacco, as well as settlement funds received from tobacco companies that compensate for smoking-related medical costs.
Rep. Becky Laubinger, R-Park Hills, pointed out how the state has some of the lowest tobacco sales taxes in the nation. The tax rate per one pack of cigarettes in Missouri is 17 cents.
The task force found that the biggest gaps in funding are basic needs like recovery housing.
 Transportation and housing

“I’ve been really humbled,” Winograd said, “by how little it matters if you provide really effective evidence-based treatment service if no one can get there.”
She described transportation as an issue of “equifinality,” or how different experiences can lead to similar outcomes. In rural areas, she said, treatment centers might be too far away. In urban areas, public transportation and infrastructure might be subpar.
Some current solutions to the issue are state-provided bus passes and funds for ride-booking services from care providers, but Winograd said she doubts these solutions are the most efficient way.
Housing is another basic need that effects how those struggling with substances get the help they need.
“What good is fabulous, gold-standard care if then I go back to living on the streets,” Winograd said. “The way we work as humans operating in society is that my first priority is going to be finding housing. Then I’ll deal with my sobriety.”
She recommended flexible strategies as a solution, such as outpatient treatment combined with sober living and recovery housing.
 Crisis care

Overdose response makes up a large part of crisis care for substance abuse. Winograd praised the state’s push for behavioral health crisis centers, which she compared to urgent care facilities. However, she also recommended that those centers be required to provide medical treatment for people struggling with opioid addiction.
Another task force proposal was ambulance transport to non-hospital settings, such as behavioral health centers.
“Especially after an opioid overdose or a stimulant overamping event, often the hospital is not necessarily the best place for somebody to go,” Winograd said. “They don’t get the right care, it’s not what they want, it’s not what they need. They kind of get spun and churned back out to the streets.”
Behavioral health care centers can provide more comfortable or personalized care for such cases, she said.
The task force also recommended helping people navigate recovery programs, legalizing needle exchanges and expanding drug-checking services.
 Legal programs

Overdoses are a “huge killer” of people who have been formerly incarcerated, Winograd said.
She recommended drug courts and diversion programs in communities to help in lowering incarceration rates. She also suggested increasing resources to treat people with addictions while they are incarcerated.
The task force also recommended judicial treatment courts, which offer care as an alternative to incarceration. Winograd said the task force wants to make sure use of life-saving tools isn’t discouraged.
“There’s a real culture in specific drug courts of success and motivation,” Winograd said. “I’m looking forward to learning more about drug courts and also making sure they are as evidence-based and effective as possible, specifically ensuring that they not only allow, but encourage and support people to stay on medications for addiction treatment.”
Other legal recommendations from the task force include evidence-based treatment for the incarcerated, expanding naloxone distribution and increased funding for public defenders.
 Youth prevention

The task force found that community support and infrastructure is crucial for youth prevention of substance abuse.
“All of these things are really about letting a child have a childhood and not be running in the streets unattended and getting into dangerous stuff,” Winograd said.
The task force supported funding for youth mentoring and community service liaisons, school-based supports and youth crisis centers.
After hearing testimony in the task force, Winograd agreed that current prevention programming is not very effective, and can even be harmful.
“There is a difference between any school assembly talking about ‘don’t do drugs’ and efforts that actually work,” she said.
Winograd said targeted messaging to an age-appropriate audience can help adolescents understand what is going on inside their mind so drugs don’t seem like the easiest option.

NEWARK — In an effort to boost foot traffic downtown during the typically slow summer months, the city of Newark will offer free parking on weekends starting June 16 and running through August 15.
Approved by city council Monday night, the initiative will make parking free on Saturdays and Sundays in all city-run lots and on-street spaces.
Officials hope the move will attract more residents and visitors to the downtown area and give local businesses a summer boost.

The summer promotion replaces a previous strategy that offered discounts throughout the week during the past two summers.
City officials said those discounts had little effect on increasing downtown traffic and believe free weekend parking will be more appealing to potential visitors.
The city expects to generate $40,000 more in revenue this summer compared to last, due to the return of regular weekday parking fees.

This isn’t Newark’s first experiment with this type of program.
A pilot program over the winter offered it on Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesdays. Officials said the shift to Saturdays and Sundays was made at the request of business owners and to simplify marketing efforts.

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”










It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state. 


– David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst


Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
‘Generational change’ to taxes
While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Governor, Democrats split on regressive or progressive tax changes to close budget gap

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
An uneven tax burden
Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

Delaware officials announced a major milestone in the fight against the opioid crisis, reporting a nearly 36% decrease in drug-related deaths in 2024 compared to the previous year.
State agencies confirmed 338 drug deaths in 2024, down from 527 in 2023 and 537 in 2022.
The dramatic decline, confirmed through toxicology data from the Division of Forensic Science, mirrors broader regional and national improvements, with neighboring states like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland also reporting significant drops in overdose fatalities.
“The drop in drug deaths in Delaware, the region, and in most states nationally is encouraging, but we need people to recognize the danger of the filler substances in street drugs,” said DHSS Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health (DSAMH) Director Joanna Champney. “Fentanyl is still a concern, but now we’re also very concerned with substances like medetomidine and other substances not meant for human consumption that can make people extremely sick and can result in death.”
The decline is part of a larger national trend. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. saw a 26.5% drop in drug overdose deaths between November 2023 and November 2024.
Delaware’s drop outpaced this figure, as did neighboring states like Virginia (42%) and Washington, D.C. (33%).
Officials credit the improvement to a range of initiatives, including targeted naloxone distribution, expanded addiction treatment access, and widespread public health campaigns.
They also point to a shift in drug use methods, with less injection and more smoking, which can carry a reduced overdose risk.
The state continues to invest heavily in addiction response, with more than $50 million in federal grant funding supporting treatment and outreach.
The state’s Prescription Opioid Settlement Distribution Commission (POSDC) is preparing to award another $13 million in June for addiction-related initiatives.
“Every overdose is one too many, and we still have a long road ahead of us — but we are also seeing real progress,” said Attorney General Kathy Jennings.“This is a staggering reduction in the opioid epidemic’s death toll and a testament to the dedication of our community groups, public health agencies, first responders, and state leaders who have prioritized this work. I am tremendously proud of our work to hold Big Pharma accountable for the devastation that the opioid crisis has wrought in our state, and I am in awe of the on-the-ground work that has made this progress possible.”
Lieutenant Governor Kyle Evans Gay echoed the sentiment, calling the results “promising” while urging continued focus. “We must continue advancing prevention and recovery efforts so that one day we can say Delaware has overcome this crisis.”
Despite the gains, drug overdoses remain the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 44, and Delaware officials stress that prevention, education, and treatment access will remain top priorities.
“Our job now is to double down and keep up the pressure. We have some of the best people and organizations in the country devoted to this fight, and we will not rest until overdose deaths are eradicated in Delaware,” Jennings said.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-29-at-8.58.48-AM.png,,,2025-04-29 09:08:07.889083

Alaska is the first U.S. state to require that businesses post signs warning that alcohol consumption raises cancer risks. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska bars and liquor stores will be required to post signs warning of alcohol’s link to cancer, under a bill that became law on Friday.
The new sign mandate, to go into effect on Aug. 1, makes Alaska the first U.S. state to require such health warnings.
The warnings about the alcohol-cancer relationship will be added to already mandated warnings about the dangers that pregnant women’s consumption can lead to birth defects.
The requirement is part of a measure, Senate Bill 15, that allows employees under 21 to serve alcohol at restaurants and breweries. Lawmakers last year passed a similar bill, with the same combined provisions, but House members gave their final approval just minutes after the midnight adjournment deadline. It was one of five bills that Dunleavy vetoed because of passage after that deadline.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, was the leading proponent of the new signage. He sponsored a stand-alone measure, House Bill 37, that became combined with the alcohol-server measure; the same process was used last year, though passage of that bill was after the adjournment deadline.
This time, the combined bill on alcohol servers and cancer warnings was approved by lawmakers well before they adjourned. It won final passage with a unanimous vote in the Senate on April 4. Dunleavy allowed the measure to become law without his signature.
Alcohol consumption has been shown to increase risks of certain types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer.
Gray said the relationship has gained more attention in recent years, and he some gave credit to former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. In January, Murthy issued an advisory report describing how alcohol consumption, even at moderate levels, increases risks of at least seven types of cancer. “Alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after tobacco and obesity,” said the report. 
Murthy recommended that the label on packaging for alcoholic drinks be updated to include the cancer-risk link.
Currently, South Korea is the only nation that requires warning labels about alcohol consumption increasing cancer risks. A similar warning is set to go into effect in Ireland next year.
  The newly passed bill includes a provision, originally part of a stand-alone bill sponsored by Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, that requires warnings to be posted about alcohol use’s link to cancer. The currently requried sign is on the left; the new sign required starting on Aug. 1, 2025, is on the right. (Graphic provided by Alaska Legislature)

In California and across the country there’s a growing push to minimize the role police play when someone is in the throes of a mental health crisis. Too often, those incidents can result in the person being injured by police — and a federal court ruling has inspired fresh police concerns about their liability.
Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper recently responded with a dramatic policy change. His deputies won’t be responding to those calls unless a crime is in progress or the person in crisis has already committed a crime or placed someone else in imminent danger.

Susanna, a mother frustrated when help didn’t come: “Who is going to assist my family in these situations, and not only my family, but other families like mine, whose child might be more aggressive or might actually kill them or hurt them very badly? Who is going to step in and stop that before it’s too late?”

Already, some other police agencies around the state are following his lead.

Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes, president of the California State Sheriffs Association: “We’re not in the profession of white coats coming out to take somebody to the hospital.”

CalMatters contributor Lee Romney explores what this means for family members of people with serious mental illness, and to firefighters and social workers who rely on police for backup.
Lee also examines the quieter decision by other police and sheriffs’ departments to step back after they arrive on the scene. When that happened to one desperate mother who needed to get her son to the hospital for urgent treatment, she resorted to hiring a bounty hunter to do it.
The good news: There are other promising approaches.
But, as Lee reports, there will always be a role for well-trained law enforcement officers: When someone in crisis has a weapon or is exceptionally volatile, for instance, and when those who meet the legal criteria for involuntary psychiatric care are unwilling — or unable due to psychosis or substance abuse — to consent to care.

Trump administration cancels money to help crime victims

Under President Donald Trump, the federal government has cancelled millions of dollars worth of grants to organizations that help victims of violent crimes get back on their feet — putting some of the most vulnerable Californians at risk, writes CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.
Last week the U.S. Justice Department cut $811 million in grants that went toward victim services and violence prevention — including more than $80 million to California organizations.
A spokesperson for the justice department said that while the department will “always protect victims of crime and legitimate law enforcement initiatives,” it will “no longer spend millions on ‘listening sessions’ and ‘bridging socio-ecological contexts.’”
Criminal justice reform advocates argue that these services aren’t a luxury, but rather part of a holistic approach to public safety. The Asian Women’s Shelter, for example, lost its three-year $500,000 grant, which went towards connecting Arab survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking with legal and social services. 

Saara Ahmed, the shelter’s communications and community engagement specialist: “The irony is that the reasons given by the Justice Department is that they’re shifting funding toward law enforcement to combat violent crime and trafficking. But violent crime and trafficking affects survivors so there’s a lot of contradiction. It’s a matter of asking: Whose safety and security are they prioritizing?”

CA reckons with effects of lost salmon

Plummeting salmon populations have forced California to shut down its commercial salmon fishing season for a third year in a row. Though some experts say efforts like this offer a glimmer of hope for the species to rebound, residents who rely on salmon fishing are weighing the possibility that the species may never fully recover — and they must seek other opportunities to keep their livelihoods afloat.
As CalMatters’ Alastair Bland explains, before the mid-2000s, Chinook salmon harvests in some California coastal towns, including Bodega Bay, were abundant and lucrative. But a combination of diverting water from the Delta, the loss of river habitat and poor ocean conditions have driven the species to the brink of collapse over the last two decades.
As the fishing economy in Bodega Bay shrinks, businesses are doing their best to adjust: Local restaurants have dropped salmon from the menu — instead featuring farmed or imported clams, oysters and shrimp — while boats that once offered fishing are turning into cruises or whale-watching expeditions. 

Mike Long, who ran a Bodega Bay fishing charter company for eight years: “Bodega Bay back in the day when the salmon were running … was an absolute party, people were camping, having fun. From a fishing standpoint, Bodega Bay has become a ghost town.”

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: In another example of the ongoing battle to either limit or expand civil wrongs, or torts, the state Legislature is considering a bill that would extend California’s False Claims Act to high-dollar tax disputes.
The California Privacy Protection Agency wants to narrow rules that would have protected Californians against automated decisions — despite it being crucial to limit how much access algorithms and artificial intelligence have to our personal information, writes Justin Kloczko, a tech and privacy advocate at Consumer Watchdog.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.













I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University





GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

And then I met up with a bunch of South Dakota journalists for a few days last week. And my faith was renewed plenty.
I have just returned from the 142nd convention of the South Dakota NewsMedia Association, and I am happy to report community journalism is alive and well in South Dakota.
The energy and passion demonstrated by the 100-plus South Dakota journalists who gathered in Aberdeen last week was authentic and contagious. It warmed my heart and made me proud. Proud to be in a profession that matters dearly these days.
South Dakota Searchlight wins 12 awards in annual contest

I attended my first newspaper convention in 1979 to pick up an award for a photograph of mine published in The Corsica Globe. I was hooked. I have been to many conventions since that time, having worked at SDNA since 1995. And I’ve enjoyed them all. However, I witnessed something truly special this year: journalists of all ages and backgrounds coming together to learn from one another and, just as importantly, to encourage, support and believe in one another. All things desperately needed in today’s often contentious civic arena where journalists work.
In attendance were individuals of all ages and backgrounds, from college students to publishers and editors who have been in the business for decades. Also, attendees who knew little about the profession until they took over the local newspaper because they couldn’t imagine their community without one.
During the opening lunch, I asked those who were first-time convention attendees to stand. Half of the room stood up. Young and old alike.
At that same lunch, we honored two journalists under the age of 30 for their exemplary work. Wren Murphy is a reporter at the Madison Daily Leader doing award-winning work that is making a difference for the community and audience served by that newspaper. Amelia Schafer covers the Indigenous affairs beat for the Rapid City Journal. Her six-month investigation and reporting about 38 unmarked graves at a former Indian boarding school resonated with readers and gained nationwide attention.
On Friday night, we inducted Debbie Hemmer into the South Dakota Newspaper Hall of Fame. Debbie worked at the Grant County Review in Milbank for more than four decades, eventually becoming co-owner. Her hard work and dedication over the years has helped the Review to continue its tradition as one of South Dakota’s best and largest community newspapers.
Also at the convention, we handed out more than 250 awards for excellence in community journalism. Awards for reporting and writing, commentary, photography, design, advertising and much more.










I have just returned from the 142nd convention of the South Dakota NewsMedia Association, and I am happy to report community journalism is alive and well in South Dakota.


The Dakota Scout won the 2024 SDNA Freedom of Information Award for its dogged reporting and legal challenges to obtain information about former Gov. Kristi Noem’s government credit card spending. The Aberdeen Insider is among South Dakota’s newest newspapers and won its first general excellence award – one of the highest awards we give. These are just two examples of the great work that South Dakota’s news media organizations are doing and what we celebrated during our time together in Aberdeen last week.
I firmly believe the statewide surveys we commission every few years to gauge what South Dakotans think about local newspapers and local news media organizations are spot-on.
Last year, the survey we commissioned found that more than 7 in 10 South Dakotans believe having a local newspaper or news media outlet to serve their community is very important, and more than 8 in 10 adults in our state read a newspaper every month.
Spending time last week with South Dakota journalists from across the state reaffirmed those survey results for me. These journalists are dedicated to their work and to the communities served by their newspapers and news organizations. They know better than anyone that the success and sustainability of local journalism is dependent on the support of readers, advertisers and others.
Their passion is inspiring. Their work matters. Because without journalism, democracy suffers.
Finally, here is my hot tip for the week. A 3-year-old colt named “Journalism” is the 3-1 favorite to win this Saturday’s Kentucky Derby.
Bet on journalism. Every time.

How an ailing industry has transformed this fishing village,Alastair Bland,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/water/2025/04/salmon-crab-fishing-industry-bodega-bay/,"Collapsing salmon runs and restrictions on Dungeness crab have forced restaurants, charter boats and commercial fishers in California's coastal villages to adapt.","In summary
Collapsing salmon runs and restrictions on Dungeness crab have forced restaurants, charter boats and commercial fishers in California’s coastal villages to adapt.




From the living room window of their waterfront home, Carol and Tony Anello have watched the rise and fall of Bodega Bay. Traffic on Westshore Road flows past in waves, fishing boats pull into the docks and throngs of visitors line up at Spud Point Crab Co., their restaurant next door. Launched more than 20 years ago and known for its chowder and Dungeness crab rolls, the restaurant has helped make the Anellos beacons of the community. 
It has also served as a life raft as they left the commercial fishing business.   
“I had a premonition that the fishing industry was going down,” said Tony Anello, who fished commercially for salmon, crab and herring for 54 years before selling his boat Anabelle last year. “There are guys dropping out of this industry like flies, and I’m one of them.”
At Bodega Bay and other picturesque seaside villages along the California coast, the fishing economy is gradually sinking.
The latest blows came earlier this month: Commercial harvest of Chinook salmon was banned in California for the third consecutive year because of low populations, and the state’s Dungeness crab fishery has been severely restricted in an effort to protect humpback whales from entanglements. Sportfishing for salmon — a valuable industry and a beloved pastime — also was prohibited for two straight years, and will be severely cut back this year to what may amount to a single weekend in June in Northern California.  
Now coastal towns that once relied on freshly caught seafood are finding ways to adapt. In Bodega Bay, fishing has increasingly taken a backseat to tourism and the draw of souvenir shops and art galleries, saltwater taffy, waterfront dining, vacation rentals and a backdrop from Hitchcock’s “The Birds.” 
Tourism is “the lifeblood of this town now. It’s not fishing,” Tony Anello said. He nodded to the line of boats moored at the harbor — elaborate rigs that can cost the price of a Bay Area home. “All the boats are in. What are they fishing for? Niente. Nothing.”

When the salmon closure hit two years ago, sportfishing charter boat operator Ty Taube’s revenue stream was cut almost in half. To compensate, he has shifted much of his business from Bodega Bay to San Francisco Bay, where he now rents a second berth in Richmond and takes his clients fishing in the spring and summer for halibut and striped bass. 
“Bodega Bay now has very little to offer,” he said.

Mike Long, who ran a Bodega Bay fishing charter company on his boat Miss Vic for eight years, said Chinook salmon fishing used to drive a frenzy of local activity. 
“Bodega Bay, back in the day when the salmon were running … was an absolute party. People were camping, having fun,” he said. “From a fishing standpoint, Bodega Bay has become a ghost town.” 
Lucrative salmon harvests — sometimes exceeding a million fish in a season — and a robust population persisted through the mid-2000s, before the fish seemed to cross a tipping point, collapsing almost to extinction in 2009. Experts say the harvests were sustainable but that Delta water diversions, loss of river habitat and poor ocean conditions are driving the collapse of the past 20 years.
The Anellos fondly recall those banner days of their youth, and the fishery’s prime, rehashing stories of big days on the water and unloading the catch in port. 
“I remember saying, ‘My God, is there a bottom to this boat? The fish just kept coming up and coming up,” Carol Anello said.  
At nearby boat ramps, the traffic jams of the salmon season are a thing of the past, at least for now, though a trickle of skiffs still comes and goes, mostly targeting either crab or rockfish. Some anglers come to fish from shore.

Abalone, and the kelp forests they live in, also have almost vanished, the victims of overfishing and climate change. Banned in 2018, diving for abalone was a recreational attraction for decades that brought visitors and cash flow to remote North Coast communities.
A small fleet of party boat services, including Taube’s vessel Dragonfly, Pole Dancin’ and New Sea Angler, still keeps a presence in the harbor, but some don’t fish as much as they once did. Some are turning to cruises, whale-watching and ash-scattering voyages to replace lost fishing opportunities. 
Visitors to the town still expect seafood, and they still get it — but many menus feature products farmed or delivered from faraway waters, including clams, oysters and shrimp.
Local Dungeness crab has become more expensive — a boon to fishers — but it remains plentiful, even when the season ends, thanks to freezing and thawing on demand. Salmon has dropped off most local menus.

At Fishetarian Fish Market, co-owner Shane Lucas supports local boats but must lean on imported catch. This market-cafe at the south edge of town on a recent day was selling farmed New Zealand Chinook salmon under their display case, and it may shift later to wild salmon from the Pacific Northwest. Rockfish, though locally available, mostly comes from Oregon, simply because local hook-and-line commercial fishers don’t catch enough to meet his needs.
Oysters are a plentiful local product, with their crushed shells mashed into the asphalt and picnic grounds throughout town. But they are mostly farmed — not fished — in nearby Tomales Bay. Lingcod and halibut remain seasonal catches, along with albacore tuna and some bluefin, too.
Nothing, however, matches the value and cachet of Chinook salmon, also known as king salmon.
Last fall, restaurants countywide collaborated with Bodega Bay fishers and the county tourism board in a promotional push dubbed “Black Cod Week.” The idea was to promote the buttery, soft flesh of locally caught black cod, also known as sablefish, as a stand-in for salmon.  
“They were looking for an alternative fish that is highly sustainable, with lots of them out there,” said Patty Ginochio, owner of Ginochio’s Kitchen on the northeast shore of Bodega Bay, explaining that black cod is oily but delicious.
“We offered black cod tacos in lieu of the salmon tacos that we would normally have been offering,” she said. Ginochio, who has not served salmon since California’s season was shut down two years ago, also served smoked black cod. 
“No matter what you do, it’s not king salmon,” she said. 
Untangling whales and crabs 
At least for now, Dungeness crab remains a valuable fishery, though seasonal catches range wildly. 2022 saw one of the poorest statewide harvests in 40 years. 2023 was a huge year, 2024 less so and this year another bummer. 
“It’s been horrible,” said Bodega Bay commercial fisherman Dick Ogg on a recent morning as he prepared to offload and sell one of his last Dungeness crab hauls of the season at Spud Point Marina, across the road from the Anellos’ restaurant.

Ogg, who has fished out of Bodega Bay for 25 years, said profitability of crab fishing has declined, contributing to attrition in the statewide fleet. 
“The gear has gone from $50 a pot to $350 a pot, plus the rope is more expensive. The regulations are more stringent, and the time we get to fish has been condensed down to three months,” he said. “If you sit back and look at what’s happening, it’s getting to the point where you just can’t make a living.”
The West Coast’s Dungeness crab population is generally booming, and landings have soared since the early 2000s. 2024’s catch of 14 million pounds was worth $50 million, and 2023 saw the eighth largest catch — 21 million pounds — in the past 45 years. 
But new regulations have constrained the fishery, including trap limits and frequent season closures. This year, the Dungeness fishery opened late — in January — and state officials announced last week that they are shutting it down early, on May 1, in much of the state.

The complicating factor is whales — particularly humpbacks, which are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act and routinely become entangled in ropes that connect floating buoys to crab traps on the seafloor. These synthetic lines can slice deep into their skin and blubber and, when attached to heavy traps, exhaust and drown the giants. 
Entanglements have increased in the last decade following a change in feeding activity that has concentrated the animals closer to the California coast, especially from spring through summer.
“The regulations are more stringent…It’s getting to the point where you just can’t make a living” off Dungeness crab.BODEGA BAY FISHERMAN DICK OGG
Since about 2014, reported entanglements have averaged several dozen per year. Last year, 31 humpbacks were reported snagged in fishing gear off the West Coast. 
“We know that we’re only observing maybe 10%, maybe 20% of the entanglements,” said Catherine Kilduff, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. 
About 84% of entangled humpbacks may die or suffer serious injury as a result, according to an estimate by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
Shifting gears: Can an old industry learn new tricks?
Commercial crabbers are collaborating with environmental groups, including Oceana, to develop whale-safe crab gear that involves no unattended vertical ropes in the water. 
They have experimented with a system reliant on compressed buoys fixed to each trap and which inflate by remote control, lifting the cage to the surface with no rope. Another model relies on a buoy spool coiled with rope and fixed to the sunken trap, then released via remote control. When the spool surfaces, the fishers, standing by, retrieve it and their gear. 
The concept for each is brilliant, but the problem that manufacturers have struggled with is reliability. Ogg, who has tried some of these methods, said they fail too frequently to be trusted. While advocates have cited a 98% reliability figure, Ogg said it’s lower, likely less than 90%. 
Ogg plans to move ahead with a whale-safe system in which he drops a line of crab traps strung together on a single rope, then retrieves the array later by snagging it with a grappling hook dragged over the bottom.

Ogg thinks this alternative gear system could represent the future of crabbing, allowing fishers to bypass seasonal bans on conventional gear implemented when whales are near.
Retrieving gear via grapple hook takes at least twice as long per trap, Ogg said. “It’s a pain in the butt, it’s hard to do,” he said. 
But maybe worse, he said, is snagging a whale. “Nobody wants to interact with an animal other than the targeted species.” 
Boom and bust of salmon
For Taube, the glory days of the North Coast salmon fishery are just a few years gone. Taube launched his fishing charter service in 2019, cashing in on several good years. Sometimes, he said, fishing was hot enough just outside the Bodega Bay harbor that he was able to run two trips daily, each with about a half-dozen customers. 
“We would do a morning trip, and we’d do an afternoon trip … it was easy fishing,” said Taube, owner of Reel Obsession Sportfishing, which features a 34-foot boat named Dragonfly. 
Those were the days when salmon season traffic jammed up the bay’s boat ramps, when wait times could be an hour and early morning tempers sometimes flared. All morning, commercial trollers, private skiffs and charter boats like Dragonfly funneled out the mouth of the harbor, where they dispersed across the water. 
Often, the fish were barely a mile outside the Bodega Bay harbor mouth, with clouds of anchovies darkening the electronic screen of the dashboard “fish finder,” feeding whales surging in all directions and the salmon quick to strike a bait. 
“If we catch the quota quickly, then it could be done in a day or two. It’s not going to make a difference in the 100 (salmon sportfishing) trips or so that we used to run.” TY TAUBE, CAPTAIN OF THE CHARTER BOAT DRAGONFLY
This year, the tradition will resume — but perhaps for just one weekend. Recreational anglers have been allocated a sliver of a season for the first time since 2022. Fishing will begin June 7, and while multiple weekends are designated for fishing, there is a catch: a 7,000-fish quota. 
“If we catch the quota quickly, then it could be done in a day or two,” Taube said. “It’s not going to make a difference in the 100 trips or so that we used to run.” 
Along part of the Central Coast, a second fishing window, with a 7,500-fish quota, will open in September.
In the historical context, such numbers are almost nothing — what a single commercial boat might catch in a season. “Total averages (in the 1970s) would be about 80 fish a day,” Tony Anello said. 
Long left the fishing business when the salmon closure took effect two years ago. Now — like many other boat operators — he runs the Miss Vic to cash in on alternative guiding opportunities. 
“We do whale-watching trips now,” he said.

Graphs depicting past abundance show a towering wall of California Chinook through the 1980s and 90s. In the record year of 1988, ocean harvest in California — commercial and recreational combined — amounted to nearly 1.4 million salmon, the best year on record. Even after that huge harvest, more than 200,000 fish returned to the Sacramento River to spawn that fall and in 2002, more Chinook swam into the Central Valley than ever recorded before — about 900,000 adults.  
Salmon abundance plunged off a cliff in the late 2000s, and it has never recovered. Just 140,000 adults migrated up the Central Valley’s rivers last year, and that came after two years with essentially no harvest. 
Return of the salmon
A salmon rebound would change everything, and it’s something state officials are calling for. 
“We are hell-bent … pushing as hard as we can, because we hate the idea of a future California without salmon,” said Chuck Bonham, director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
Some positive signals, maybe suggesting a comeback, are emerging from the watersheds where salmon spawn — due, Bonham says, to the state’s restoration efforts as well as the record wet year in 2023. Wet winters increase river flows, which help juvenile salmon reach the ocean, and can be a precursor to salmon rebounds. Bonham is optimistic that next year will see a bump. Already, numbers of spawning endangered coho salmon in coastal watersheds jumped last winter to several times the recent historical average.   
In the Sacramento River, premature returning Chinook — two-year-old males known to biologists as “jacks” — returned in very large numbers last fall. That could reflect a swelling population in the ocean. 
A major victory was recently scored in the Klamath basin, where four dams were removed from 2023 to 2024. Already, Chinook are reported to be entering spawning habitat that was inaccessible for decades, and experts and local tribes anticipate a revival.  
“We are hell-bent … pushing as hard as we can, because we hate the idea of a future California without salmon.”CHUCK BONHAM, DIRECTOR OF  CALIFORNIA DEPT. OF FISH AND WILDLIFE 
Bonham said a state policy of “cutting the green tape” has allowed faster movement on projects to rebuild habitat features like wetlands and floodplains, mostly in the Central Valley. Another new state policy allowing project developers to pack multiple project permits into a single approval has helped the state make progress on salmon restoration work. 
“Just last year, we streamlined the approvals for 60 important projects related to salmon,” he said. “We don’t have a chance to dink around and take 20 more years.” We need “more good projects faster and cheaper,” he said. 
Fishery experts and advocates say the state is not doing enough to save salmon. Scott Artis, executive director of the Golden State Salmon Association, an industry group, said the state has failed to guarantee that Central Valley rivers contain adequate cold water for salmon. He said reservoirs are drained too early, which depletes the supply of cold water essential for successful spawning, and too much water is pumped to farms and cities to the south. 
“Dead salmon don’t use habitat,” Artis said. “So if we kill all the salmon because there is no water, are we really creating habitat and allowing them to use it?”
Relics of a thriving industry
At Bodega Bay, an old fishing pier, succumbing to saltwater and wind, is falling to pieces and is no longer accessible. 
The local ice machine, installed at the Spud Point Marina in the 1980s, is in disrepair, too.
“It’s long past its life expectancy,” said Noah Wagner, marina supervisor for the Sonoma County Regional Parks Department, which operates the facility. “We’re very concerned that we’re going to have a catastrophic failure that necessitates a complete replacement of that ice house during one of these really important seasons for the salmon or crab.”
Officials with the state and county visited last year, part of an ongoing quest for funding to modernize the ice house, which is the only one of its kind between San Francisco and Fort Bragg, Wagner said. “All the fishing boats and the processors … rely on this ice house, so it’s vitally important to the fleet,” he said.

While the community thrives on the bustling tourism economy, many residents and business owners are worried about the town’s fishers.
Waves of Compassion is a local nonprofit that, among other things, helps struggling commercial fishers in and around Bodega Bay with food, clothes, laundry money, dog food and other items that Ginochio, a cofounder, says many fishers increasingly cannot afford. 
Lucas, at Fishetarian, sees a gray future for the local fishing economy.  
“It’s sad because my grandfather was a commercial fisherman, but I don’t think there will be a commercial fisherman left here in 10 years,” he said. “They’re going to be all gone. To support a family in California as a commercial fisherman, you’ve got to be doing something else.”

Justin Kloczko
Justin Kloczko is a tech and privacy advocate at Consumer Watchdog.


Let’s say you work in the food service industry for a large company, whose scheduling software assigns shifts to workers. For you, which shifts you receive mean everything because much of your salary depends on tips. But in the eyes of the algorithm, you could be deprioritized and miss out on lucrative weekend shifts based on mysterious data. Without your knowledge, information such as when you take a break, how fast you turned over a table or where you live could work against you. 
Shouldn’t you have the right to know the logic behind the algorithm, and the right to opt out of its automated decision?
Californians were on track to have novel protections against automated decisions under rules drafted by California’s top privacy agency, the California Privacy Protection Agency. But this month, the privacy board proposed substantially narrower privacy regulations, including deleting specific protections — like the example above — surrounding criminal justice, education, essential goods like food, and employment matters if they were made by automated decisions. 
Some members even suggested deleting the automated decision-making language altogether. The five-member board also committed to deleting other rules aimed at giving people control of their personal information in the training of artificial intelligence and in targeted advertising. 
We are at a major crossroads in California’s battle over data privacy protections. After the establishment of the landmark California Consumer Privacy Act and its 2020 voter-enacted California Privacy Rights Act, forces within the privacy agency and Gov. Gavin Newsom, under pressure from powerful business interests, are pushing to scale back these seminal protections. A key hearing is scheduled for Thursday.
After the departure of the protection agency’s first leader, Ashkan Soltani, and the very questionable dismissal of privacy-facing board member Vinhcent Le, there has been a shift away from the pro-consumer mission statement of the small but influential agency. The new head of the agency is Tom Kemp, a tech entrepreneur. The real estate developer who spurred the state’s data privacy law is now among some of its biggest skeptics.
But wouldn’t you want to know if algorithms, not people, were deciding sensitive aspects of your life and at least have the option to stop it? Automated decisions dictate everything from how we get jobs to essential services or mortgages, for example, in rapid, nonchalant and unaccountable fashion. 
The privacy agency’s board members already recommended loosening opt outs for targeted advertising and training data that feeds artificial intelligence systems. Without opt-outs, companies can indefinitely train AI models on your personal data without consent, and because you said the word baby, the algorithm thinks you’re a parent and bombards you with parenting ads on every feed.
Californians complain about this stuff all the time.
The privacy agency doesn’t have to listen to the governor. Board members just have to read the voter-passed Proposition 24 and the privacy act statute, which directs them to draft regulations in the interest of privacy — not in favor of the interests of a few large tech companies. 
More importantly, the right to privacy is enshrined in the first article of the California Constitution. By letting algorithms and AI take the reins, we relieve ourselves of responsibility — a comfort that comes at the cost of our own control. 
We are supposed to be in a new era of privacy, and California is supposed to be leading that charge. Instead, we’re willingly moving to the back of the line. We’ve heard these industry threats for decades now — that regulations will be too costly — yet tech companies have only grown and remain rooted in our state after 20 years of dominance. 
We can’t afford to let their tactics scare us.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042825-Data-Privacy-JF-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-29 09:08:07.889083

Groups that support California crime victims and attempt to reduce gun violence lost millions of dollars in grants when the Trump administration pulled funding.


Dozens of California violence prevention and victim service programs, including ones to protect survivors of domestic violence and end sexual abuse in jails and prisons, are facing devastating cuts after the Trump administration abruptly pulled funding from them. 
“These programs literally save lives – not just for the victims, but for our entire communities,” said Tinisch Hollins, executive director of the nonprofit organization Californians for Safety and Justice. “When they go away, we lose a safety net.”
The U.S. Justice Department last week slashed grants that were initially valued at $811 million. In California alone, the department cut just over $80 million, the majority of which was for groups based in Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco, according to a U.S. Justice Department document obtained and published by Reuters. 
The organizations might have already spent some of the grant funding, which typically lasts for three years, and it’s unclear how much the administration clawed back. They have 30 days to appeal the decision. The U.S. Justice Department did not respond to repeated attempts to confirm the list of affected grant recipients in California. 
In a statement to CalMatters, Justice Department spokesman Gates McGavick said, “Under Attorney General (Pam) Bondi’s leadership, the Department of Justice is committed to ensuring its resources are spent on arresting criminals, getting drugs off the streets, and crucial litigation. We will always protect victims of crime and legitimate law enforcement initiatives, but we will no longer spend millions on ‘listening sessions’ and ‘bridging socio-ecological contexts.’”
California officials rejected the Trump administration’s characterization of the grants, and described the programs as critical.
“The Trump administration is recklessly disregarding the safety of the people it is sworn to serve,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement to CalMatters. “These resources are not optional luxuries, they are essential, and critical to ensuring the security and stability of our communities nationwide. My office will do everything in our power to stop the potentially deadly consequences of freezing federal funding.”
Representatives from three organizations that lost money told CalMatters they were committed to continuing their programs, and they stressed that they provide vital services to vulnerable people.
In Oakland, the nonprofit organization Youth ALIVE! lost its $2 million grant to support the nation’s first hospital-based violence intervention program. The organization’s staff appear at the hospital bedside of youth who have been violently injured in order to help them navigate their recovery and prevent retaliatory violence. 
Through ongoing support such as mental health and housing services, the organization maintains that it can break cycles of violence. Last year, it served 113 clients, only one of whom was injured again.
“It’s an essential part of the ecosystem, because you need to be in specific places to help quell violence and help people heal,” said Dr. Joseph Griffin, executive director of Youth ALIVE! “It’s about increasing the health of the community.”
When he learned that the organization had lost its funding, he said he was in disbelief. 
“It’s not an impact that we can absorb lightly,” he said. “Replacing $2 million is never easy.”

Elsewhere in Oakland, the organization Impact Justice lost $8.5 million in grant funding.
“This was a sledgehammer,” said Alex Busansky, its founder and president.
The organization was awarded a $4 million grant to expand opportunities for reentry housing for people returning home from prison. It also received three grants totaling $4.5 million to support its work in eliminating sexual abuse and sexual harm from confined facilities, such as prisons and jails. 
“To take that away puts the most vulnerable people in a much riskier and potentially harmful situation,” Busansky said. 
Asian Women’s Shelter, one of three domestic violence shelters in San Francisco, lost its $500,000 grant to support Arab survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking through connecting them with legal and social services. 
The competitive grant had only been awarded to five organizations last year, according to the Asian Women’s Shelter’s communications and community engagement specialist, Saara Ahmed. 
“The irony is that the reasons given by the Justice Department is that they’re shifting funding toward law enforcement to combat violent crime and trafficking. But violent crime and trafficking affects survivors so there’s a lot of contradiction,” Ahmed said. “It’s a matter of asking: Whose safety and security are they prioritizing?”
On April 25, over 600 local, state and national organizations, including the Asian Women’s Shelter, signed a letter to Attorney General Bondi expressing “deep concern” over the Justice Department’s federal funding decisions, including the canceled grants.
“This longstanding bipartisan commitment to supporting services and prevention efforts for victims of [domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking and trafficking] remains strong; however, the Department’s recent actions have left these critical lifesaving programs uncertain about their ability to continue serving victims,” advocates wrote. 
The San Francisco District Attorney’s Office also lost a grant in the culling. “It is heartbreaking to see funds cut for such critical work,” said San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, whose grant supported at-risk youth and young adults from underserved communities. 
“Public safety, at its core, is fewer victims of crime overall. And as a government, we cannot simply be reactionary,” she said. “We have to do the front end, proactive work so that people don’t feel the need to get involved in crime in the first place.”

Teens aged 14 and 15 are already prohibited by federal law from working between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m., but the Nevada proposed law would put in place restrictions for 16-, 17- and 18-year olds who are enrolled in public or private school.
Emancipated teenagers, lifeguards, arcade workers, farm workers, and theatrical performers would be exempt from the hourly restrictions. Additional exemptions could be granted on a case-by-base basis.
The bill would also lower the maximum number of hours a child under 16 can work: from 48 to 40 hours per week.
“Every single day in my classes I have kids who are too tired to participate,” said Matt Nighswonger, a teacher at Shadow Ridge High School on the northern edge of the Las Vegas Valley. “When I wake them up and ask them why they’re so tired, they tell me they had to close, or had to work late last night. Many of them have to work until 1 or 2 in the morning.”
The business community, he said, is taking advantage of vulnerable teenagers.
“As a government teacher, I try to teach my students that the government is here to protect its citizens,” he added. “AB215 helps to protect our exploited high school workers.”
Karissa Murdoch was one of those teens. The Shadow Ridge senior began working at a local ice rink at 15. She started with a reasonable workload, then she asked for more hours because she wanted more money, then she was asked by her bosses to stay late after her official shift to do extra work.
That’s how she found herself regularly working until midnight Monday through Thursday. After the commute home, eating and showering, she was going to bed at 1 or 2 a.m. and sleeping a paltry few hours before school started up again at 7 a.m.
Her grades slipped. She says she went from being a student who “almost never turned in an assignment late” to a student who couldn’t stay awake in class and turned in everything late. Murdoch said she came to her senses on her own and now wants to advocate for her younger self.
“At 15, I was nowhere near mature enough to prioritize school over money,” she told Assembly members during the bill’s first hearing, which she traveled to Carson City for over spring break in March. “I wish the adults around me would have thought about more than just using me for business gain.”
Teagan Clark, another Shadow Ridge student, testified that working closing shift meant driving home late at night tired — a potentially dangerous scenario for anyone but especially an inexperienced driver. It also resulted in her skipping breakfast in order to get an extra few minutes of sleep, drinking too many caffeine-filled energy drinks, and feeling isolated socially.
Nighswonger said he surveyed working high school seniors at Shadow Ridge and found that 48% regularly work past 10 p.m. on school nights. Many of the students were worried they would lose their job if they shared their own stories, though a few hand-wrote letters for him to deliver to lawmakers.
“I work at a car wash and every night we close at 8 and I stay after hours to clean the vacuum trays and sewage out of the tunnel where the cars are washed,” read one. “It’s too much for a 17 year old kid, but I don’t want to lose my job.”

 
Equipo Academy Assistant Principal Erik Van Houten said a quarter of 16- and 17-year-olds at the East Las Vegas charter school have jobs, and 1 in 5 of them work over 40 hours a week.
“These students are ill equipped to advocate for themselves to leave work at reasonable hours,” he said. “Many are holding their very first job.”
AB215, he continued, would ”put guardrails in place to protect our kids and make clear that a high school education should be their number one priority.”
Nighswonger, Murdoch and other Shadow Ridge students pitched the proposed law to Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno and Republican Assemblymember Brian Hibbetts, whose districts cover the school’s enrollment area. Both signed on to sponsor a bill on the issue.
Independently, Democratic Assemblymember Cinthia Zermeño Moore was working on similar legislation inspired by concerns raised by Van Houten from Equipo, which is located in her district.The three Assembly members decided to combine their bills and work together.
Strong support, but some concerns raised
AB215 passed the Nevada State Assembly with unanimous bipartisan support earlier this month and is now making its way through the Senate. If passed, the bill will head to Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s desk for final approval.
Hibbetts acknowledged that some might see the inclusion of protections for 18-year-olds as a problem because it means they are being considered adults in some legal contexts and not adults in others. But he said there is precedent.
High school students are not allowed to sign off on their own school paperwork just because they turn 18 during their senior year, he said. They still need parental signatures.
“This is, in my vision, just going along with that same type of mentality,” he said. “I think this is something that we need to offer them. Just because you’re 18, it doesn’t mean your employer can make you work until 2 a.m. because you have to be at school at 7 a.m.”
Monroe-Moreno added that the inclusion of 18-year-olds was specifically asked for by Shadow Ridge students who said their managers target them for late shifts because they are 18.
Several lawmakers in the bill’s two hearings raised concerns about the impact the legislation might have on lower income families whose teens contribute to essential household bills.
Moore said she understands that reality, adding that her first job was at age 14 selling CDs at the Indoor Swap Meet in East Las Vegas. But she argued the state needs to support students with their education because, without it, “they may not be able to seek the opportunities they may have” that could lift them, and their families, upward.
Teresa Benitez-Thompson, a former state lawmaker, spoke in personal support of the bill, saying she wished such restrictions were in place two decades ago when she was a teenage hostess whose paychecks helped support her single mom, who worked as a waitress, and her sister, who was a teen mom at 15. She said she fell behind her junior year and had to do credit recovery to get back on track.
“A low-wage job for a teenager is not going to solve poverty,” she said. “Education is what breaks the cycle of poverty. Education is absolutely what has to be prioritized.”
Groups in support of AB218 included the Vegas Chamber, Nevada Resorts Association, NAACP, City of North Las Vegas, and ACLU.
No groups publicly opposed AB218 during its two bill hearings, but the Nevada Restaurant Association testified in neutral.
“We support efforts to balance student well being and academics with valuable work experience,” the group’s lobbyist, Peter Saba, said. “Many restaurants rely on student workers, and we encourage ongoing discussions to ensure these small businesses can adapt smoothly.”
Monroe-Moreno acknowledged that concessions were made to appease business groups. The bill originally sought to prohibit teens from working past 10 p.m. on school nights but the time was amended to 11 p.m.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2173891470-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 09:08:07.889083

(Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)Tens of thousands of square feet of vacant lots and commercial properties sit empty in the Las Vegas and Reno metro areas. Proposed legislation attempts to help tackle the state’s housing crisis by establishing a process to rezone them as residential. 
State lawmakers are considering multiple proposals that would empower cities to more aggressively encourage infill development to address Nevada’s shortage of affordable and available units.
Assembly Bill 241, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, is designed to spark development of more multi-family housing, and require counties to speed up the process to rezone land currently designated commercial use into residential or mixed use. 
“Many commercial properties, particularly aging strip malls and vacant office buildings, are underutilized,” Jauregui said during the bill’s hearing in March. “Repurposing them for housing makes better use of existing infrastructure. Building homes closer to jobs, schools and public transit reduces commute times, lowers greenhouse gas emissions and decreases urban sprawl.”
The bill, which passed the Assembly on a party line vote earlier this month, is directed toward the state’s most populous counties, Clark and Washoe, and would give them until Oct. 1, 2026 to adopt an ordinance that allows for a more expedited rezoning process. 
Under the legislation, if a buyer purchases a commercial property and wants to build multi-family housing on it instead, they could seek swift approval rather than go through a lengthy rezoning process, Jauregui said. 
A recent analysis by the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern and the regional planning collaborative known as Southern Nevada Strong identified 78,285 acres as “vacant or underutilized land,” most of it — 85% — vacant.
The bill is scheduled to be heard Wednesday in the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee.
The legislation’s supporters included theNevada Conservation Leaguethe Nevada State Apartment Association. 
However, the Nevada Association of Counties along with Clark and Washoe County opposed the legislation.
“There are some commercial areas where multi-family or mixed-use (zoning) may not be appropriate,” said Ashley Kennedy, a lobbyist with Clark County, adding the county wants to retain “the ability at the local level to determine” when to quickly rezone without state legislation mandating it. 
Kennedy said that the county supports infill development and hasn’t denied any application for a multi-family project since 2022. 
She added that during that timeframe there were 39 applications for multi-family projects approved, and 21 of those applications were in commercially zoned areas.”
Cadence Matijevich, a lobbyist with Washoe County, warned the bill would produce “unintended consequences” and could “upset the balance of land use in our community” by requiring some commercial projects to be rezoned as residential. 
“Nevada cannot afford to let outdated zoning laws and people who oppose density continue to be the reason we are stalling housing production,” Jauregui said. 
Efforts to promote infill development come as state lawmakers, some members of Nevada’s Congressional delegation and Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo have pushed for stepped up sales of federal land development. 
Assembly Joint Resolution 10, also sponsored by Jauregui, would ask the federal government to pass the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act, commonly referred to as the Clark County Lands Bill.
The bill passed the Assembly 36-6 April 17. Six Democrats Assemblymembers, Natha Anderson, Venicia Considine, Tanya Flanagan, Selena La Rue Hatch, Cinthia Moore, and Howard Watts, voted against the resolution.
Democratic Rep. Dina Titus recently took issue with state lawmakers voting for the resolution  and denounced the federal bill, saying nothing in the legislation mandates that any of the land must be dedicated to affordable housing. The bill would only make land available “to developers to build more homes that average Nevadans cannot afford,” Titus said. 
AB 241 isn’t the only bill that could lead to more infill development.
Senate Bill 28, legislation being brought by the City of Las Vegas, would create “tax increment areas” in which a portion of future property tax revenue would be used to pay interest on bonds used to finance  affordable housing development as well as public transit.
Much of the city’s development over the next 25 years “will consist of infill and redevelopment within existing neighborhoods, Seth Floyd, Director of Community Development for the City of Las Vegas, told the Senate Government Affairs Committee during a hearing on the bill in lawmakers during the bill’s hearing in March.” 
SB 28 passed the Senate 17-4 on April 17. Republican Sens. Carrie Ann Buck, Robin Titus, Ira Hansen and John Ellison voted against the bill.  
Funding supportive housing
Lawmakers are also considering allocating general fund dollars to aid housing development, including $250 million proposed by Lombardo.  
Any proposal seeking to allocate any funding could face serious setbacks after the Economic Forum meets Thursday, when it will set final budget limits that legislators and the governor must meet when they approve a budget for the upcoming biennium. 
Uncertainty and anxiety driven by Donald Trump’s trade war and the resulting fallout have prompted widespread projections of not only a slowing economy, with many observers projecting the chance of a recession has increased substantially in recent weeks.
Assembly Bill 366, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, would appropriate $25 million from the state general fund to supportive housing initiatives throughout the state. The Nevada Housing Division would determine the projects eligible to receive those dollars.  
Permanent supportive housing projects are subsidized for populations with significantly low or no income, such as folks experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, and comes with case management and wrap-around support services. 
Brooke Page, the Nevada director of the Corporation for Supportive Housing, said funding supportive housing for unhoused people is more cost effective than the alternative.
The organization conducted an analysis for Northern Nevada last year that found eight days in the emergency room, three months in jail, and one year in supportive housing with rental assistance and warp around services all cost the same. Page said. 
“It makes more sense to house people, ensure they have the services they need to improve their mental health, their physical health, and gain access to employment than it does to continue to allow people to cycle in and out of high-cost systems,” she said. 
Not only do developers struggle to find financing for supportive housing, funding for operational support and tenant services is also limited.
State lawmakers in 2023 allocated $30 million from the state’s general fund to permanent supportive housing projects. 
AB 366 seeks to strengthen the program.. 
During its first hearing in March, Monroe-Moreno said though the state “doesn’t have any money” allocating funds for permanent supportive housing was a priority Lombardo also identified during his budget proposal, she said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Public Service Commission approved a 4.7% increase in residential electricity rates on Friday, only about a quarter of the 18.1% that Rocky Mountain Power requested last August — and an even more substantial reduction than the original 30.5% increase proposal that appalled Utah leaders.
With the change, an average single-family residential customer using 700 kilowatt hours per month will see a monthly increase in their utility bill of $4.31 this year, about $10 less than Rocky Mountain Power proposed. 
Commissioners said in the order that the 18.1% ask was unprecedented both in the scope of issues it addressed and price. Ultimately, the decision to only approve a small portion of the rate proposal was attributed to the reasons Gov. Spencer Cox and legislative leaders had cited as they promised to do everything in their power to avoid such an increase — Utah ratepayers shouldn’t pay for other states’ costs.

“I think there’s two themes to this case,” Chris Parker, director of the Utah Division of Public Utilities, said on Monday. “They are that the commission wants to make sure that Utahns aren’t paying expenses that need to be borne by other states’ customers, and that Utahns should not be paying for imprudent actions by the utility.”
After wildfires plagued Oregon in 2020, PacifiCorp, Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company, saw an impact in its equity and also “paid $550 million in dividends to its parent company, Berkshire Hathaway, after it became aware of potential wildfire liability,” according to the order. 
“The current capital structure of the company is primarily a result of its own actions,” commissioners wrote. “It is unreasonable to expect RMP’s ratepayers in Utah to pay higher rates because of the wildfires in Oregon and the depletion of cash reserves by these dividend payments.” 
Rocky Mountain Power lowers its rate increase proposal to 18.1%, down from 30.5%

The commission also rejected making payments for insurance premiums “driven far beyond industry norms for Utah,” legal fees associated with the Oregon wildfire litigation, and other costs tied to “specific state climate action policies or specific state agreements driven by individual state circumstances (particularly in Washington and Oregon).”
The order, however, approved some smaller expenses for wildfire mitigation, and an increase in the low-income Lifeline assistance credit, an electricity bill discount program for low income Utahns — from $13.95 to $18 a month.
As of Monday afternoon, PacifiCorp was still reviewing the nearly 200-page order, David Eskelsen, a spokesperson for the company, said. 
“We are determining its implications and our next steps in meeting our responsibility to provide electric service to our customers,” Eskelsen said in a statement. 
It’s possible that the company could appeal the decision, triggering a revision process. The utility is also expected to present its case in May to recover some past costs through its Energy Balancing Account — a price adjustment that either credits or debits users for differences between power prices and the other market costs that are somewhat outside the control of the utility.
PacifiCorp has also taken legal action against other states it serves, like Wyoming, for their partial denial of rate increase.
The rate change took effect immediately once the commission’s order was issued.
A controversial rate increase 
Utah has for years flaunted its ranking at the top of states with the cheapest electricity. So, when Rocky Mountain Power proposed a two-digit increase in rates, it woke tensions with the state.
The company listed increased costs of fuel and wholesale power in addition to ongoing new electric transmission and generation projects for a substantial part of the 30.5% rate increase, as well as the escalation of wildfire risk insurance premiums.



Let us know what you think...


 


That triggered legislative proposals to change Rocky Mountain Power’s rate structure, a firm request to split PacifiCorp into two consortiums of blue or red states, and a strong social media post from Cox. 
“The proposal is completely unacceptable,” the governor wrote on an X post in June. “The audacity and lack of awareness with this request seriously calls into question management at RMP. I will do everything I can to make sure a rate increase of that magnitude never sees the light of day.”
Changes are coming to Rocky Mountain Power’s contracts with AI centers, but not its rate structure

Some of those bills, including one that would have made Rocky Mountain Power pay for everything that’s currently included in the Energy Balancing Account, didn’t materialize. But, there’s still a big focus on studying the utility’s books to determine what costs should and shouldn’t be in Utahns’ bills. 
Parker, from the Division of Public Utilities, said that a big item the commission denied last year in the company’s Energy Balancing Account case was tied to expenses covering the cost of greenhouse gas allowances the utility bought to comply with a Washington state law. 
And this time, the denials are mostly because of wildfire liability. While he sympathizes with the company’s challenges, he said it’s its duty to provide appropriate services at reasonable rates.
“And if that requires additional infusions of equity that ratepayers aren’t responsible for paying, then that’s what it requires. That’s their obligation,” Parker said. “The privilege of being a public utility is that you’re a monopoly, and the obligation of being a public utility is that you have to act in the public interest.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Two bills that would change Alabama’s bail system are working their way through the Legislature in the waning days of the 2025 session.
The Senate Judiciary Committee hosted a public hearing Wednesday for HB 42, sponsored by Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, which gives judges the authority to allow defendants to pay a portion of their total bond to be released from pretrial detention.
HB 410, sponsored by Rep. Shane Stringer, R-Citronelle, which was approved by the House Judiciary Committee, modifies the composition of the Alabama Professional Bail Bonding Board, expands the exemptions for the fees that bail bond companies must pay the court, increases penalties for bail jumping and adds more regulations for bail bond companies when they operate in another state.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A message was sent to Stringer Monday seeking comment.
HB 42 has passed the House and is awaiting a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee. The House is scheduled to vote on HB 410 on Tuesday. England’s bill adds three words, “a part of” back into an  Alabama statute that were removed when the same Legislature enacted the Alabama Bail Reform Act of 1993.
The removal of the words meant judges in the state could not allow defendants to pay a percentage of their bond to get release from pretrial detention.
“What that translates into is a large amount of money that would normally go to the court system, instead of going to the court system, it goes to a bondsman,” England said to the committee Wednesday.
People can secure their release after an arrest if they pay a bail bond company. The premium, which is typically 10% of the total amount of the bond, is paid to the bail bond company, which then must ensure the individuals go to their court appearances.
The money that people pay when released on a percentage bond would be retained by the court and kept if defendants fail to appear for their court dates.
The Alabama Bail Bond Association has been a vocal opponent of the bill, speaking out against the legislation at a March public hearing and the House Judiciary Committee considered it then and eventually approved the bill a week later.
Victor Howard, vice president of the Alabama Bail Bond Association and bail bond company owner, said that enacting the legislation would reduce accountability for defendants to appear for their court dates.
Chris McNeil, the president of the Alabama Bail Bond Association, suggested Monday in an interview that the rates that people would not appear for court would increase. He also cited records from the Alabama Administrative Office of Courts saying that people who paid cash to be released from pretrial detention in 2022 and 2023 had a failure to appear (FTA) rate of 55%.
“The court just can’t function when you have a failure to appear rate of 55%,” McNeil said Monday. “The bonding companies were averaging about a 14%-15% failure to appear rate. And were able to trim that rate by returning defendants back to court.”
England told the committee that the numbers do not present a fair comparison to percentage bonds.
“The numbers are obviously going to be off because there are more people on smaller offenses with cash bonds versus somebody who is on a large bond with a bondsman,” England said to the committee on Wednesday. “Obviously, there is going to be a higher number of FTAs on smaller cases, traffic tickets, because they all count.”
Jerome Dees, policy director from the Southern Poverty Law Center, supported the legislation.
“The vast majority of times when there was an FTA that was ultimately secured, and the defendant showed up in court, it largely was due to law enforcement bringing that individual in and not the bail bond company,” he said to the committee on Wednesday. “That is not to say that it never happened, but the vast majority of time it was law enforcement bringing that particular individual in.”
McNeil said in an interview Monday he supports HB 410, Stringer’s bill.
“It expands the Alabama Professional Bail Bonding Board by adding a sheriff to the board, adding a layperson, so I think that is very important,” he said.
It also states that any fees that bail bond companies pay to the court that have not been deposited within 90 days and that have an expiration date “shall be deemed uncollected” and will no longer hold the bail bond company responsible for making the payment.
The bill also exempts bail bond companies from fees that the courts or district attorneys have not attempted to collect past one year from the original due date.
HB 410 also adds more conditions such that the bail bond company will not pay a fee, known as forfeiture, to the court when in cases that the defendant fails to appear in court.
McNeil said the bill would cancel that forfeiture payment if someone was not placed in the National Crime Information Center and failed to appear in court, or if the bail bond company brings back a defendant that the jail refuses to accept.
The bill also addresses instances when an individual travels out of state and enhances the penalty for bail jumping, going from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class D felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a $7,500 fine.

Richard Wright wrote his memoir about growing up in Roxie, Miss., called “Black Boy.” Credit: Wikipedia
“Black Boy,” Richard Wright’s memoir about his upbringing in Roxie, Mississippi, became the top-selling book in the U.S. 
Wright described Roxie as “swarming with rats, cats, dogs, fortune tellers, cripples, blind men, whores, salesmen, rent collectors, and children.” 
In his home, he looked to his mother: “My mother’s suffering grew into a symbol in my mind, gathering to itself all the poverty, the ignorance, the helplessness; the painful, baffling, hunger-ridden days and hours; the restless moving, the futile seeking, the uncertainty, the fear, the dread; the meaningless pain and the endless suffering. Her life set the emotional tone of my life.” 
When he was alone, he wrote, “I would hurl words into this darkness and wait for an echo, and if an echo sounded, no matter how faintly, I would send other words to tell, to march, to fight, to create a sense of the hunger for life that gnaws in us all.” 
Reading became his refuge. 
“Whenever my environment had failed to support or nourish me, I had clutched at books,” he wrote. “Reading was like a drug, a dope. The novels created moods in which I lived for days.” 
In the end, he discovered that “if you possess enough courage to speak out what you are, you will find you are not alone.” He was the first Black author to see his work sold through the Book-of-a-Month Club. 
Wright’s novel, “Native Son,” told the story of Bigger Thomas, a 20-year-old Black man whose bleak life leads him to kill. Through the book, Wright sought to expose the racism he saw: “I was guided by but one criterion: to tell the truth as I saw it and felt it. I swore to myself that if I ever wrote another book, no one would weep over it; that it would be so hard and deep that they would have to face it without the consolation of tears.” 
The novel, which sold more than 250,000 copies in its first three weeks, was turned into a play on Broadway, directed by Orson Welles. He became friends with other writers, including Ralph Ellison in Harlem and Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus in Paris. His works played a role in changing white Americans’ views on race.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/06001214/April29-FeatImage-Richard_Wright.jpg,,,2025-04-29 09:08:07.889083

This story was originally reported by Jasmine Mithani of The 19th.  Meet Jasmine and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
President Donald Trump has taken aim at trans people during his first 100 days in office in his second term. He has sought to restrict access to accurate passports, erase the accomplishments of trans elders, remove transgender members from the military and purge the government of what he has termed “woke gender ideology.” But a new 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll shows that 49% of Americans think politicians should not be focusing on transgender issues at all.
It’s a rise from before the election, when 43% of Americans said they believed politicians should not focus on trans issues, versus protecting trans rights or restricting gender-affirming care. In 2023, the figure was 44%.
Democrats and Independents are less likely than they were in September to think politicians should be protecting transgender rights, and 42% of Democrats think politicians should not focus on trans issues — up from 33% last year.
More Republicans also think politicians shouldn’t focus on trans issues — 57% vs 53% last year — and the number who think lawmakers should concentrate on restricting transgender rights has fallen.
Overall, despite the Trump administration’s attempts to erase trans people from public life, the majority of Americans (59%) support the right of transgender adults to access gender-affirming care. However, fewer Americans, 43%, support the right of trans youth to seek such care. That doesn’t necessarily translate into a desire for bans. In fact, 55% opposed laws that would restrict gender-affirming care for minors, including 41% of Republicans and 57% of Independents.
Gender-affirming care for trans people is any health care designed to support and affirm their gender identity, and typically differs depending on age. For trans adults, care can include therapy, consultations with doctors, hormones or other medication, and surgery. For trans youth, gender-affirming care can include therapy, consultations with doctors, hormones or puberty blockers, other medication, and, rarely, surgery. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health does not recommend gender-affirming gential surgeries for anyone under 18.
The results are from a 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll conducted online from April 11-21, 2025, among 5,032 American adults. Results have a margin of error of 1.5 percentage points.
The majority of Americans are not confident that politicians are informed enough about gender-affirming care for transgender minors to make fair policy. But the number who say they are informed enough has risen from 24% last year to 31% this year.
Women continue to be more likely than men to support access to gender-affirming care for both adults (65% versus 52%) and youth (46% versus 38%). While this survey collected only binary gender data, a 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll from September showed widespread support for access among nonbinary and transgender Americans.
Movement in favor of transgender rights is notable given how central antri-trans rhetoric was to Trump’s campaign, which is now manifesting into federal policy impacting hundreds of thousands of lives.
Meanwhile, Democrats are split on whether to support their trans constituents. In the immediate aftermath of the election, some congressional Democrats loudly criticized their party for supporting trans people. And in the inaugural episode of his new podcast,  California Gov. Gavin Newsom signaled interest in restricting how trans women athletes can compete in sporting events.
But others, like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, have vocally condemned Trump’s anti-trans policies and refused to back down.
This was notably seen a couple months into the Trump administration, when Senate Democrats did band together to block a bill which would have prevented transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports teams in federally-funded schools.
This 19th News|SurveyMonkey poll was conducted online from April 11-21, 2025, among a national sample of 5,032 U.S. adults 18+.

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)The Democratic National Committee will transfer more than $1 million per month to its state and territorial parties over the next four years in an effort to build state-level infrastructure and operations, the DNC announced Thursday.
The agreement marks the DNC’s largest total investment in Democratic state parties to date and comes as Democrats try to rebound from significant losses in the 2024 election cycle.
Each state party is set to receive a minimum of $17,500 per month, a $5,000 increase from the current baseline, the DNC said in materials provided to States Newsroom ahead of the wider announcement.

Republican-controlled states will get an additional $5,000 a month, bringing their monthly total to $22,500. The GOP-controlled states will get that additional investment through the DNC’s Red State Fund.
The DNC’s definition for a GOP-controlled state is one that meets at least two of the three criteria: no Democratic governor or Democratic U.S. Senator; one-quarter or less of the congressional delegation is made up of Democrats; and Republicans hold supermajorities in both state legislative chambers.
As part of the agreement, the DNC said it will host six regional training “bootcamps” for state parties per two-year cycle and will also hire new staff to the Association of State Democratic Committees.
The DNC said the initiative also aims to help Democratic state parties with their infrastructure, staffing, data and tech operations as well as with organizing programs and preparation for future election cycles.
DNC Chair Ken Martin, the former Minnesota party chair who was elected to lead the national party in February, called the initiative “a historic political investment unlike anything Democrats have done in modern times” and said in a statement it is part of a long-term strategy.
“We’re putting our money where our mouth is to equip state parties with what they need to reach working families who deserve better, build long-term success all across the ballot, and gain electoral ground for years to come,” Martin said in the statement.
“Elections are won in states — and that’s exactly where we will be investing our resources,” said Martin.
Last week, Martin laid out the leadership board’s organizing principles, which centered on “organizing early, organizing always, organizing everywhere, and winning everywhere.”
“You’re going to continue to witness a level of aggressive investment and organizing from this DNC that’s unlike anything we’ve done before,” Martin wrote in that memo.
In a Thursday statement, Jane Kleeb, president of the Association of State Democratic Committees and chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said “state parties are the backbone of the Democratic Party, and through this investment, our state parties will receive the support they need to show voters that, no matter where they live, there is a strong Democratic Party in their corner, protecting their rights and economic opportunity against Republican attacks.”

20 years later

The strategy bears some resemblance to the 50-state strategy pioneered by former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who led the DNC from 2005 to 2009 and appeared on a DNC press call Thursday.
“This is a really critical move that’s being made here,” Dean said. “We have not been anything but a Washington, D.C.-centric party since 2008, and the reason that the Democrats have had a tough time is because if you’re not out there doing the grassroots politics, you don’t win. Period.”
Critics during Dean’s tenure argued that spending in deep-red areas pulled resources away from winnable races in more moderate states and congressional districts.
Asked on the press call whether the push to spread money to more states could lead to a decline in financial support to swing states, Martin said, “No, not at all.”
“I mean, as I said, there’s no such thing as a perpetual blue state or a perpetual red state, and over the years, because there’s been a lack of investment in blue states, as an example, by other partners in the ecosystem, not necessarily the DNC, it’s meant we’ve seen actually our vote share in some of the bluest parts of the country actually starting to decrease,” he said.
“I believe you have to invest everywhere and organize everywhere if you want to win everywhere, and so, that’s what this will do.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are now unwelcome across education. Under new federal guidelines and procedures (some of which were paused by a pair of court rulings last week, but only temporarily), schools, colleges and universities are being inspected for any DEI programs and policies. If the administration’s proposals stand, federal funding will be withheld to enforce the elimination of DEI.
DEI concepts promote sound educational policies and practices in public schools. Diversity requirements are protections, not guarantees. Equity ensures fair consideration for admission, scholarships and programs regardless of race or ethnicity. Inclusion means that students from all backgrounds have access to public education.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited segregation and discrimination in schools and colleges. It was not enacted to produce quotas, but to provide equal opportunities. DEI initiatives are used to enhance and preserve this legislation.
Backpedaling on these guarantees will bring us back to Brown v Board of Education and the Little Rock Nine. Most have grasped the notion that “separate but equal” is not acceptable, but bigotry and racism are still with us.
Our history should not be whitewashed or have past acts of prejudice diminished. Students hold no responsibility for the actions of their ancestors.
Analyzing historical and Constitutional cause and effect relationships creates knowledge, not guilt or remorse. It is not indoctrination to receive an unvarnished account of the progression of women’s and civil rights or learning that race is a social construct with no scientific merit.
It was illegal to educate slaves due to the fear of exposing fallacies of racial superiority. Despite the legal end of slavery and Constitutional guarantees (13th, 14th, and 15th amendments), Jim Crow laws and overt discrimination kept non-whites as second-class citizens, including limited access to education.
Students should know that white resentment triggered race riots across the country when Jack Johnson beat a white boxer (1910), destruction by white mobs of affluent black communities in Tulsa (1921) and Rosewood (1923) and bitterness from white players and fans as Black players were integrated into Major League baseball.
Effects of racism and bigotry have not been limited to Black Americans. Students should understand the systematic destruction of the Native American population and culture, and comprehend prejudice and hatred against those with Asian and Jewish backgrounds, and conflicts over religious beliefs.
Ironically, it is now illegal in some states (but not Nevada, fortunately), to teach some of the content in the three previous paragraphs. “Enola Gay” scrubbed from the picture of the plane that dropped the first atomic bomb on Japan. Really? Should the identity label “WASP” be back en vogue?
Viewpoint diversity on college and university campuses need not include opinionated nonsense; just rational, evidence-based discussions without invented facts lacking no causal relationships. Emotional expressions based on race/ethnicity or hollow concerns about gender lack academic worth.
Competence and merit cannot be determined when there is exclusion before consideration. DEI also includes accommodations for the disabled, pay equity, parental leave, having a job after the birth of a child, rejection of workplace harassment. Imagine public education without any DEI.
Is this assault on DEI warranted and will it improve student outcomes? The answer to both questions is no. So, what drives this backlash?
Described as lacking ethics and having inferior intellectual ability by his former cabinet members and government officials, the president’s push against DEI policies and practices should not be a surprise. He has exhibited life-long racist behavior and education has not always been kind to his followers.
From housing discrimination, calling for the death penalty for wrongly accused black teenagers, not wanting blacks to count money at his casinos, birther assertions against political opponents, claims of bias from a Mexican judge, Muslim bans, retweeting racist messages from white supremacists, stating white nationalists are “very fine people,” kneeling NFL players “shouldn’t be in the country,” and Haitian immigrants “all have aids,” suggesting that immigrants from Norway are superior to those from Africa and telling congresswomen of color they “should go back to the countries they came from.” This is only scratching the surface.
Reducing and eliminating DEI initiatives makes perfect sense politically. It protects a large part of his political base; undereducated white males who lack the talent and ambition to compete for positions in society. As the president declared after winning the Nevada Republican Presidential Caucus in 2016, “I love the poorly educated.”
President Lyndon B. Johnson once said, “If you can convince the lowest white man he’s better than the best colored man, he won’t notice you’re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he’ll empty his pockets for you.” 
Johnson knew all too well the white grievance that seems to be driving part of our politics today. DEI backlash is just the latest version of what Johnson saw in the 1960’s.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trump-and-mcmahon-in-oval-1024x710.jpg,,,2025-04-29 08:06:05.475916

So why did he take the New Jersey Monitor to the state Supreme Court over access to police records?,"Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop tells voters he wants to bring more transparency to Trenton. So why did he take the New Jersey Monitor to the state Supreme Court over access to police records? (Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor/Fulop photo by Reena Rose Sibayan)When lawmakers proposed gutting the state’s public records access law last year, a surprising advocate for transparency came out against that push: Steve Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City and a 2025 candidate for governor.
I say surprising because when I covered Jersey City, the city and I often tussled over access to public records. Police reports, emails between city officials, architectural records, Fulop’s work schedule … name a public record and I probably got a “your request is denied” email from the Fulop administration about it.
But, hey, I welcome any and all transparency advocates, even bandwagon-jumpers.
So color me surprised that the Fulop administration and I will be facing off in court yet again, this time at the New Jersey Supreme Court on Tuesday as Jersey City argues that it simply must withhold records the New Jersey Monitor is seeking.
This time, the record is an internal affairs report we requested from the file of police Lt. Michael Timmins, who police say fired a gun at guests during an alcohol-fueled dispute at a party at his Sussex County home in 2019 (no one was injured). Timmins was initially charged with terroristic threats and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes, a violation of the New Jersey Graves Act, which requires mandatory prison sentences for some gun crimes. But Timmins went through a pretrial diversionary program and was able to get details of his arrest expunged. Fancy that.
Police disciplinary records are not necessarily open for public inspection — but the state Supreme Court ruled three years ago that, under the state’s common law right of access, when the public’s interest in the records outweighs an officer’s confidentiality concerns, the records must be made public. I think when it comes to a cop who has a six-pack or more of beer and then fires a gun at civilians while off duty, the public’s interest in the department’s investigation of his conduct is more important than the cop’s privacy.
Another interesting fact about Timmins’ case: He was allowed to have his record expunged even though people charged with violating the New Jersey Graves Act are normally not given the option of pleading guilty to any non-Graves Act offenses. So Timmins gets a special deal and a slap on the wrist, and his expungement could give his bosses in Jersey City a chance to hide the details of his departmental discipline (Timmins was suspended for 19 days and lost another 71 days).
It’s not as if we don’t have evidence that Jersey City has already tried to hide the details of Timmins’ behavior. When the city published its annual list of officers who face discipline in 2021 but didn’t have to provide the officers’ names, it wrote about Timmins, “A member of this agency while off duty retrieved a firearm after consuming 6-8 beers. He negligently discharged a round from the firearm during a dispute.” When it later had to amend that report to include the officers’ names per a state directive, it amended it to, “Lt. Timmins negligently discharged a firearm while off duty and on his personal property.” Suddenly the city decided the public didn’t have to know Timmins had been drinking before firing his gun and that he fired it during a fight with someone.
The secrecy even extended to the lawsuit we filed about Timmins’ IA report — the city asked the trial court judge to seal all the records, so the filings in the case were, and remain, shielded from public view.
The city cannot be trusted to be honest about what happened with Timmins, so it’s up to us to find out, if the Supreme Court agrees.
Fulop campaign spokeswoman Emily Potoma disagreed with my argument that the case represents Fulop whistling a different tune on transparency than he does on the campaign trail.
“Both sides are seeking further clarity from the Supreme Court, as Jersey City prevailed at the trial court level, and that ruling was partially reversed by the Appellate Division. This is not an attempt to avoid accountability, it’s about ensuring that everyone is following the law,” Potoma said.
Except the city could have released these records back when we requested them in March 2022, before any expungement order had been issued and muddied the waters. Instead, it denied the request, moved to make all the legal briefings in our case secret, and, when it partially lost an appellate court ruling, asked the Supreme Court to weigh in. Hardly the actions of a transparency crusader.

Daisy Berbeco, D-Winooski, ranking member of the House Committee on Health Care and member of the House Discrimination Panel.In 2022, the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, dismantling nearly 50 years of legal precedent and stripping away a fundamental civil right. Vermont voters responded by passing Article 22 to enshrine the right to reproductive liberty in our state constitution and shortly after, passed our state’s landmark shield laws (Acts 14 and 15 in 2024) which also protect gender-affirming care. In Vermont, abortion and gender-affirming care remain safe, legal, and a personal decision made between a patient and their medical provider.Shield laws provide protection from tactics that are used to harass and harm those seeking and those providing gender-affirming or reproductive care. There are currently 23 states and the District of Columbia that have shield laws related to reproductive health care, and 17 states and the District of Columbia. have shield laws related to gender-affirming care. As national attacks on women and LGBTQ+ folks escalate, Vermont continues to stand on the right side of history with compassion, clarity, and strength. With the passage of S.28, we take the next critical step: tightening and strengthening our shield law protections to ensure they are clear, enforceable and resilient.Most importantly, S.28 protects privacy. It limits disclosure of health information that could be used to criminalize legally protected care, and it creates clear guardrails around what can be shared in public records and federal investigations. These provisions send a message to patients that they are not alone. They send a message to our care providers that we care for them, too.This legislation updates our shield laws to fill important technical gaps. It ensures that if a health care provider acts lawfully in another shield state, they are protected here in Vermont. For example, if it is legal to get an abortion in New York and a doctor provides that service there, as long as it is also legal in Vermont to do that, we will protect them when they are in Vermont under our shield law.S.28 also clarifies what constitutes unprofessional conduct, including deceptive advertising and service misrepresentation, and applies those standards across all professions. Health care delivery evolves, but we must maintain high-quality, accurate and equitable access to care. In a time when other states are actively criminalizing care, Vermont is doubling down on human rights. We are saying that your gender, your identity and your health care decisions should never make you a target. We are responding to a national narrative with a different story, one where dignity, autonomy and truth still matter.We are protecting the people who need them and the professionals who provide them.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatments. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.
GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.










I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine, Campbell University


“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
‘Significant concerns’
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease, and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
‘Shortsighted, bad policy’
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)There’s a battle at the Minnesota Legislature this session to defend environmental standards from attacks by industry.  A bipartisan group of Minnesota legislators recently attempted to repeal the environmental rules that protect wild rice and prohibit mine waste from polluting water by rushing a bill through a committee that has nothing to do with the environment. 
Then again, on Earth Day, another attempt was made to repeal these rules. But what was so breathtakingly cynical, so beyond the pale, was that both times legislators tried to sneak these significant environmental rollbacks through by attaching them to a critical extension of unemployment insurance for laid off mine workers.
This episode epitomizes how low some will go to advance their agenda, as well as the choice facing our Legislature this session: either defend Minnesota from polluters, or join in the push to give them what they want. Minnesota legislators need to know that reducing state environmental standards — especially in this perilous national moment — is a red line that nobody should cross. 
The unprecedented blizzard of terrible ideas coming out of Washington, D.C. to accelerate mining, logging and industrial development by reducing federal environmental standards is almost certain to have significant consequences for our state. Just in the past few weeks, we’ve seen executive actions to exempt coal burning power plants from regulations; allow mining and logging in and next to the Boundary Waters Wilderness; eliminate clean water standards on PFAS forever chemicals; and slash the federal workforce that enforces U.S. environmental law. It adds up to a staggering giveaway to corporations and billionaires that will harm Minnesota’s clean air, clean water and public health.  
One of the strongest defenses we have against these reckless federal rollbacks is our suite of state environmental laws, often described by industry lobbyists as among “the strongest environmental standards” in the nation. 
When it suits them, they point to those standards as the reason we should locate polluting industries in MInnesota, because surely they will protect our environment, they argue. “Trust the process,” they say. 
But their brazen attacks on these standards — through legislative gimmicks with little to no public involvement — reveal their true aim: to advance industrial proposals, even if it means eliminating protections for clean water. 
The state mining pollution standards they now want to repeal have been litigated all the way to the Minnesota Supreme Court, which struck down the copper-sulfide PolyMet permit because of them. Millions of public dollars and thousands of hours have gone into creating and defending these critical rules that protect clean water. 
With Lake Superior and the Boundary Waters in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, this outrageous attempt to gut state environmental standards should shock everybody and compel all Minnesota legislators who claim to care about the environment to double down on that commitment. 
Mining standards are not the only place they need to hold the line. The same crowd gleefully gutting federal environmental laws across the board in D.C. are engaged in a similar project here in Minnesota, just a bit more quietly. 
Industrial interests are also attempting to weaken Minnesota’s landmark PFAS legislation and 100%clean energy law; repeal our successful solar garden program; and give environmental workarounds and lucrative tax breaks to the billionaire tech companies who want our water and energy for new data centers. 
The Minnesota Legislature has big decisions ahead that will have a direct impact on people’s health now and decades into the future. For the sake of our children and grandchildren, let’s encourage Minnesota lawmakers to do the right thing and prioritize clean water, clean air and climate justice over corporate pressure and short-term profits. 
Our response in the next month is critical. If Minnesota doesn’t stand up and defend our state environmental laws, we could lose the places and values that define our state.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Refinery.jpg,,,2025-04-29 07:05:01.429924

Some of the standards Arkansas meets are class sizes of 20 children or fewer, at least one teacher per every 10 students, specialized pre-K training for teachers and “comprehensive, aligned, supportive, culturally sensitive” early learning and development standards, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIERR), housed at Rutgers University.
Arkansas falls short in its early childhood education degree requirements and annual staff professional development, the report noted. Arkansas does not require all early childhood educators to hold bachelor’s degrees, and the state requires a minimum of 15 hours of professional development per year while the report says at least 30 should be required.
Arkansas ranked 31st nationwide in state spending on early childhood education during the 2023-24 school year, and its spending per student decreased while its enrollment of 3- and 4-year-olds in pre-K remained steady, according to NIERR’s nationwide analysis of state preschool programs released Tuesday.
The state’s preschool program, Arkansas Better Chance (ABC), serves children ages 3 and 4 from families earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level. ABC enrolled 20,311 children during the last school year, accounting for 19% of 3-year-olds and 32% of 4-year-olds statewide, according to the NIERR report.
While ABC enrollment increased by 1,063 children compared to the previous school year, overall spending decreased by more than $43 million, and spending per student decreased by $2,564, with those figures adjusted for inflation, the report states.
Federal funds helped Arkansas childcare providers stay afloat, but staffing struggles continue

Arkansas spends $2,016 less per student and nearly $41 million less overall than what the report considers “adequate” for its early childhood education landscape. The report defines adequacy as enough money to “support minimum quality standards and provide K-12 pay parity for preschool teachers within their current operating structures.”
The starting annual salary for Arkansas’ K-12 teachers increased from $36,000 to $50,000 in 2023 due to the wide-ranging LEARNS Act. This pay disparity between educators who teach 5-year-olds as opposed to 4-year-olds makes it challenging to maintain a robust pre-K workforce, early childhood education administrators told the Advocate in November 2023.
Arkansas has not implemented any “statewide initiatives or minimum set pay” to bolster the early childhood education workforce, which not only affects the overall quality of the system but also forces some preschool educators to rely on public assistance to meet their needs, Nicole Carey, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said in an interview Monday.
State spending per child enrolled in pre-K was at its lowest in nearly two decades during the 2023-24 school year, according to the NIERR report. Spending spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic but has since dropped, and it saw little change and no upward trend during most of the 2010s. Meanwhile, Arkansas’ rates of child enrollment in pre-K have returned to their pre-pandemic levels after decreasing in the early 2020s, according to the data.
“It would be great if we could have additional state investment in the ABC program, either toward educator wages or other types of workforce support,” Carey said.
Arkansas Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill this year that would have created a tax credit for early childhood educators, and a Republican-sponsored bill would have created a similar policy for “a licensed childcare provider.” Neither bill advanced.

Eleven states met nine or 10 of the NIERR standards, and none of those 11 states were “low spenders” because “money does matter for quality,” Steve Barnett, NIERR’s senior director and a co-author of the report, said in a virtual press briefing Friday.
Overall, Arkansas ranked 8th nationwide in 3-year-olds enrolled in pre-K, while 15 states do not have pre-K programs for 3-year-olds at all, according to the report. Arkansas ranked 24th in enrollment of 4-year-olds.
Additionally, 5% of 4-year-olds and 7% of 3-year-olds in Arkansas were enrolled in the federally-funded Head Start program in 2023-24, while 15% of 4-year-olds and 4% of 3-year-olds were enrolled in special education, the report states.
Arkansas has 28 Head Start locations statewide. Federal employees who administer Head Start have faced recent layoffs, but changes on the federal level have not impacted the program in Arkansas, said Leslie Taylor, spokesperson for Head Start’s Arkansas grantee, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.
The state Department of Education oversees the Office of Early Childhood, which was under the jurisdiction of the Department of Human Services before the LEARNS Act went into effect in 2023. The law also required “local lead” organizations throughout the state to assess local and regional access to pre-K and what gaps or barriers should be addressed.

Most of the local lead organizations are education cooperatives, along with some school districts and child care organizations, according to the Department of Education.
AACF is “hopeful” that local leads will create “positive growth” in their areas, Carey said.

Bailey’s office issued the subpoena to Missouri Abortion Fund demanding it turn over years’ worth of documents as part of a lawsuit his office filed against Planned Parenthood more than a year ago. 
The lawsuit is based on a video published by Project Veritas which depicts a man entering a Planned Parenthood clinic in Kansas City asking for help accessing abortion for his fictional underage niece.
Missouri Abortion Fund, a nonprofit that helps financially support Missourians who can’t afford the cost of abortion, is not a party in the case, nor is the group mentioned or depicted in the Project Veritas video. 
Despite that, the organization received a subpoena on March 19 from Bailey’s office demanding it turn over any records involving minors seeking abortions, including any communications with Planned Parenthood Great Plains.
Jess Lambrecht, executive director of Missouri Abortion Fund, said while the organization believes minors should have full access to abortion, Missouri laws prevent it. Missouri Abortion Fund also does not currently pay for travel or lodging for anyone seeking financial support for an abortion, she said. 
Missouri AG sues Planned Parenthood over Project Veritas video involving fictional girl

Elad Gross, an attorney representing Missouri Abortion Fund, called the subpoena “an abuse of government power” and a “fishing expedition.” Gross ran unsuccessfully against Bailey for  attorney general last November. 
Turning over the requested documents would “impose significant burden, expense, annoyance and oppression” on the nonprofit, which is run by two full time and one part-time staff members, as well as a board of volunteers, Gross wrote in court filings.
The organization estimated it would take more than 2,900 hours to sort through the 35,000 records needed to fulfill the request. This would “substantially interfere with the day-to-day operations of Missouri Abortion Fund and impose heavy financial costs on the organization,” Gross wrote in a request that the judge quash the subpoena.
Assistant Attorney General Caleb Rutledge in court records accused Missouri Abortion Fund of “an abuse of discretion” for failing to turn over the documents in the 2-week timeline the attorney general’s office set.
At a hearing Monday, Boone County Judge J. Hasbrouck Jacobs temporarily halted Bailey’s attempt to get the Missouri Abortion Fund records. The issue has been tabled until a later date.
Lambrecht said while the judge’s decision brought some short-term relief, she still fears a financial burden in the long-term that ultimately “harms and hinders” Missourians who seek help getting abortions paid for. 
“We know that the AG’s office will stop at nothing to make accessing abortion impossible, if not exponentially difficult,” Lambrecht said after the hearing.
Jacobs on Monday also denied Planned Parenthood’s second request that the lawsuit be dismissed. 
At the crux of the case is an accusation by Bailey’s office alleging Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which oversees clinics in Kansas City and Columbia, is transporting minors out of state for abortions. 
The lawsuit was filed based on an undercover video filmed by a man affiliated with a right-wing group pretending to be the uncle of a 13-year-old in need of an abortion whose parents couldn’t know. 
The videos do not involve, reference or depict Missouri Abortion Fund.
Bailey filed the initial lawsuit in February 2024.
A Missouri teen spent her life in foster care. Now she’s fighting the state to keep her baby

At a hearing last June, Planned Parenthood also asked that the judge dismiss the case on the merits that the video was “fictitious.” The judge denied the initial request.
Last November, Missourians narrowly voted to codify the right to reproductive health care, including abortion, in the state constitution. A few months later, Planned Parenthood again requested the judge drop the case. 
The video surrounding the lawsuit remains “heavily disputed and completely hypothetical,” Planned Parenthood attorney Eleanor Spottswood said Monday. But in light of the abortion-rights amendment passing, she argued, the issue should be dropped.
“Everything the state alleges Great Plains did is now protected explicitly by the Constitution,” she said.
Lawyers with the attorney general’s office argued Monday that the issue was still relevant, in part, because Amendment 3 couldn’t be applied retroactively. 
The AG’s office also argued that the state doesn’t believe the abortion-rights amendment lifted the state’s parental consent laws for minors seeking abortions. 
Jacobs ultimately agreed. 
“My concern is over the parental rights issue,” he said.
In the video filmed at the Kansas City clinic, the man secretly taping the interaction for Project Veritas told the Planned Parenthood employees the fictional girl’s parents couldn’t know about the abortion. Staff then directed him to their affiliate clinics in Kansas where they said he could “bypass” parental consent. 
When the man asked how often girls go out of state for abortions, the Planned Parenthood employee said it happens “every day.”
A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Great Plains said last year that they do not provide any form of transportation directly to any patients, regardless of age or where they live. They also described the video, taken without staff’s knowledge, as “heavily doctored and edited.”
Missouri law, written prior to the state’s trigger law banning abortions going into place and prior to the reproductive-rights amendment passing two years later, states: “No one shall intentionally cause aid or assist a minor to obtain an abortion.”
Missouri doesn’t have explicit laws requiring parental consent for minors getting abortions in other states, nor does it prohibit minors from going to other states to get abortions.
The issue of parental rights is expected to be litigated at a future date.

Depending on what route the federal budget takes to reduce spending on the program, it could cost the state up to $16.8 billion over 10 years, according to the report from the Department of Health Services (DHS).
Medicaid — jointly  funded by the federal and state governments — provides health care coverage for low-income Wisconsinites as well as long-term care for elderly people and people with disabilities.
GOP leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives are looking for ways to cut $880 billion from programs under the supervision of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The budget plan hasn’t taken formal shape. Because Medicaid is the single largest program in the committee’s budget portfolio, however, “substantial impacts to Medicaid and other health programs are unavoidable,” the report states.
In Wisconsin Medicaid covers about 1 million Wisconsin residents up to the age of 65 for primary health care through BadgerCare Plus. It also covers long-term care for people with disabilities and the elderly under a variety of different programs. Medicaid covers 20% of state residents and 40% of births, along with 38% of Wisconsin children and 60% of state residents in nursing homes.
  Bill Hanna, Wisconsin Medicaid director
“Medicaid is an important part of our health care infrastructure,” said Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna at a DHS press conference Monday.
One possibility the report considers is a cap on federal coverage for each Medicaid patient.
Currently the federal share is 60% of the health care costs incurred by Wisconsin Medicaid recipients, with the state paying the remaining 40%. “This arrangement allows state budgets to cope with unforeseen circumstances, such as economic downturns or faster-than-expected medical cost growth,” the DHS report states.
The report states that a per-person ceiling on Medicaid costs, which Congress is reportedly considering, “would squeeze state budgets and put Wisconsin taxpayers on the hook if medical costs rise quickly, with cuts to benefits and cuts to provider payments.”
Hanna said that there remains “a lot of unknowns” in how Congress might structure a payment system with a ceiling. The report considers various scenarios under a cap, including low, medium and high increases in health care costs.
Over 10 years, Wisconsin could lose anywhere from $6.4 billion to $16.8 billion, DHS projects.
Other Congressional proposals include adding higher barriers to Medicaid coverage — primarily through a work requirement.
Work requirements have long been found to eliminate eligible people from Medicaid because of the additional burden to demonstrate that they are eligible.
“Adding an additional burden for this population will certainly result in fewer people making it through, even if they are working, just struggling with the paperwork pieces,” Hanna said.
According to the report, Wisconsin Medicaid enrolled about 191,000 childless adults per month in late 2024. Nearly half of them would be exempt from a work requirement.
“It is unknown how many people would lose coverage simply because it would be difficult to report their hours or wages,” the report states. It calculates that about 52,000 people “would be at the highest risk for losing eligibility.”
Reducing the Medicaid rolls through a work requirement, however, will carry other costs, the report argues.
“It’s not like these people disappear,” Hanna said.  “They still need care that now they just won’t have the insurance [to cover]. Meaning hospitals again will be picking up additional costs, which gets passed on to all health care consumers.”
A third approach Congress is said to be considering would reduce the federal government’s share of the cost to run Medicaid programs. That could cost Wisconsin up to $93 million, the report finds.
While congressional leaders have pointed to data on “improper payments” in Medicaid in defense of cuts and say they’re targeting “waste, fraud and abuse,” Hanna said members of Congress are  conflating two sharply different issues.
“Improper payments are not fraud, waste and abuse,” Hanna said. “Improper payments are often documentation errors that can be for any number of reasons.”
Wisconsin’s last Medicaid audit — required every three years — found an improper payment rate of 0.5%, which was due to clerical errors.
“In Wisconsin, you’re definitely not going to find significant savings” in the form of ineligible people getting covered, he said. “We have a very robust system in Wisconsin with very few errors.”
Facing substantial federal reductions, the state has four policy options, Hanna said: putting in more state funds to keep the program the same; restricting eligibility, so there are fewer Wisconsinites covered; cutting some services that Medicaid now pays for; or cutting what Medicaid pays to doctors, hospitals and other providers.
If the state pays more, then it will have to raise taxes or divert funds from other priorities. But each of the alternatives has other consequences, Hanna said.
Cutting provider rates “would have major impacts on our state’s health care system,” the DHS report states, with hospitals offsetting those by charging other payers more.
If fewer people are eligible for Medicaid, the rate of uninsured people in Wisconsin will increase, potentially driving up health care costs as well.
“Uninsured rates going up means more uncompensated care” for hospitals and other health care providers, Hanna said.
Reducing the services that Medicaid covers, however, would likely mean that people put off getting health care until an illness or condition gets worse, he said — “which ultimately means we end up spending more.”

Sheriff’s deputies in a western Idaho county will soon be able to stop and interrogate any person they believe to be in the country without authorization.
In February, Owyhee County Sheriff Larry Kendrick signed his county up for an Immigration and Customs Enforcement program that was discontinued in 2012 following multiple instances of racial profiling from participating law enforcement agencies. After taking office earlier this year, President Donald Trump reinstated the program, which President Barack Obama had halted.

Under the program, called the 287(g) task force model, local police officers are trained to work as ICE agents, acting as a “force multiplier” for ICE, according to its website. Designated officers will be able to stop and question people they believe to be in the country illegally and process them for federal immigration violations if they are also arrested on state charges.
Trump has encouraged widespread participation from law enforcement agencies across the country to help enforce his mass deportation efforts. Idaho Gov. Brad Little also issued an executive order in February that asked local law enforcement agencies to consider entering into the 287(g) programs with ICE. 
The Owyhee County Sheriff’s Office is the first agency in Idaho to have this kind of task force agreement with ICE. It went into effect Feb. 19, according to a copy of the agreement obtained by InvestigateWest. But Kendrick said his officers have not gone through training or begun participating yet in the program. Owyhee County has just 12 full-time and two part-time deputies. Kendrick said a sergeant and two deputies will likely make up the task force.
Under the program, ICE pays for any new technology needed, but all other expenses will be paid by the sheriff’s office. That includes salaries, benefits, overtime and local transportation. Previous law enforcement agencies have ended agreements due to the added costs. 
The 287(g) program refers to Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act passed by Congress in 1996. The section authorizes ICE to tap state and local law enforcement officers for some components of immigration enforcement. 
Kendrick said the county’s participation in the federal program is mostly meant to acknowledge support for Trump in Owyhee County.
“My constituents are all very conservative, and I’m conservative,” he said. “I support Trump. I support his policies. So I joined to get on board with this simply because that is what my constituents expect. That’s just supporting the Trump administration, which I do very, very much.” 
But the program’s history of abuses concerns many immigration attorneys and advocates.
“I think it is going to reduce trust in the police, reduce the reporting of crimes,” said Nikki Ramirez-Smith, a partner and immigration attorney at Ramirez-Smith Law in Nampa. 
“Nobody’s going to want to talk. Because if you witness a crime where normally you would come forward and testify, are you really going to go talk to ICE? That’s like being sent into the ICE building. I think the police need some distance from ICE if they want to do police work, which is their job, is to work with victims and perpetrators.” 
 Advocates worry about racial profiling, distrust of law enforcement

Kendrick said the agreement doesn’t mean deputies will target people for immigration enforcement who aren’t already under investigation for criminal activity. He said it will allow officers to add immigration charges to people who are arrested for drug trafficking. 
“The purpose isn’t to go out and look for illegals,” Kendrick said, referring to people who are in the country without authorization. “Here’s the thing, we have three dairies in our county, and the dairies were here even before me, and, yeah, there’s probably some illegals working there, but we’re not after them. We’re after the bad guys.”
Attorneys like Smith-Ramirez worry agreements like this alone damage the department’s relationship with the community. 
“The current political climate of fear has led, already, to a level of distrust of law enforcement,” Smith-Ramirez said. “The police departments rely on relationships to get people to talk, to get people to report crimes, to get people to trust them. And doing something like this is counterproductive.” 
A study from Texas A&M University found that law enforcement agencies who had not signed 287(g) task force agreements — but were geographically close to another agency — were likely to engage in the same racial profiling that the participating agencies engaged in. The study found the state highway patrol in North Carolina and South Carolina were more likely to stop Latino drivers than white drivers. 
Research like that concerns Smith-Ramirez who said Owyhee County has a significant number of Latino farmworkers who she worries could be caught up in the system.
“Owyhee County has a huge farming population, which means you’ve got a lot of immigrant workers who are terrified to go to work,” she said. “They’re scared to leave the house. Their kids are scared for their parents to go outside or do anything. I think it’s only going to get worse once they start doing this.”
In 2011, a federal government investigation found that under the task force model, deputies in Arizona’s Maricopa County racially profiled Latino residents for immigration enforcement and conducted unlawful searches, detentions and arrests of Latinos. A year later, federal authorities found that deputies in North Carolina’s Alamance County, who also operated as task force agents under the 287(g) agreement, were unfairly arresting Latinos and had set up checkpoints in Latino neighborhoods and pulled over Latino drivers for traffic violations 10 times more often than non-Latino drivers. Both agencies had the 287(g) agreements revoked.
“If this is happening, I would be hesitant to report a crime myself,” said Neal Dougherty, partner and immigration attorney at Smith-Ramirez Law. “I would be hesitant to advise my clients to report crimes to the Owyhee sheriff if I thought they were operating as ICE.” 
 Other Idaho counties cooperate with ICE

While Owyhee is the only Idaho county with an agreement to be trained as ICE agents, a different kind of agreement under the 287(g) program can allow local jurisdictions to hold ICE detainees in jails and to serve immigration-related warrants. 
Both kinds of agreements under the 287(g) program have grown dramatically under Trump. According to reporting from the Markup, 133 law enforcement agencies in 21 states had a form of the 287(g) agreement before the election. Earlier this month, 300 agencies in 38 states had them. 
In Idaho, three counties have the 287(g) agreements to hold ICE detainees or serve immigration warrants: Owyhee County, Power County and Gooding County. The Gooding and Power agreements have been in place since 2020. It is unclear if any other counties in Idaho will join the 287(g) program.
Even without formal agreements, some sheriffs in Idaho have defined their own process for immigration enforcement. In Kootenai County, as InvestigateWest previously reported, deputies shared the immigration statuses of people who they encountered who were not being investigated for any state crimes.  
Idaho State Police Lt. Col. Fritz Zweigart said during a media briefing that the state police have been looking into the task force model, but “right now, we’re working so well with our federal partners that we don’t necessarily need to sign into a written agreement.”
Immigration enforcement is the sole duty of the federal government, according to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, and local police may assist under federal direction. Without a 287(g) agreement, it is illegal for local police to serve federal immigration warrants and to investigate people’s immigration statuses.
Gov. Little has encouraged more coordination with ICE under 287(g). 
“To the fullest extent of the law, all State agencies with law enforcement … authority must consider formal procedures and agreements to assist the federal government in the enforcement of immigration law, including agreements under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,” his executive order said.

The draft four-year plan for Western lands proposes developing natural resources for American prosperity.
The post Leaked federal roadmap for public land called ‘industry wish list’ appeared first on WyoFile .","As the Department of the Interior develops a plan to “restore American prosperity” by exploiting Western natural resources, a Wyoming attorney who has steeled rural communities against federal policies is atop the hierarchy that will marshal the effort.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum last month appointed Karen Budd-Falen as temporary deputy secretary and his senior advisor. As the department fleshes out a four-year strategic plan to use natural resources across 19.9 million acres of national parks and Bureau of Land Management property in Wyoming, Budd-Falen will be in the Interior’s second-highest position.
A draft of the four-year Interior plan leaked to Public Domain outlines department objectives for prosperity, security and recreation. Conservationists have decried elements they say would dismantle environmental safeguards, turn over federal property, promote energy development and favor rural communities over nationwide interests.
“It is irresponsible for a media outlet to publish a draft document.” Department of the Interior
The Interior Department last week blasted the leak and called its publication “irresponsible.”
“It is beyond unacceptable that an internal document in the draft/deliberative process is being shared with the media before a decision point has been made,” Interior’s press office wrote WyoFile on Thursday. “Not only is this unacceptable behavior, it is irresponsible for a media outlet to publish a draft document.
“We will take this leak of an internal, pre-decisional document very seriously and find out who is responsible,” the statement reads.
The draft plan, which the agency said is “not final nor ready for release,” sets four goals and several objectives to accomplish them. Interior’s drafted goals are to restore American prosperity, ensure national security through infrastructure and innovation, and allow sustainable enjoyment of natural resources. It would do all that through the fourth goal — collaboration with states, tribes and local governments.
American prosperity
The draft plan to restore American prosperity would use American energy to “lower… costs and increases affordability.” But it includes elements that worry conservationists who fear damage to Interior agencies including the National Park Service, BLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs.
The plan would “deregulate” to increase “clean coal” production and oil and gas drilling. It would streamline the National Environmental Policy Act, a law designed to safeguard the environment. And it would reduce the cost of grazing, which critics say is already too low.

The draft would “release federal holdings” — divest Americans of their public property — to allow states and communities to reduce housing costs. Interior would support agriculture and increase revenues from logging, non-energy mining, and grazing. The draft treats natural resources as assets, viewing federal holdings for the economic value that can be derived from them.
The leaked document “reads like an industry wish list,” the Center for Western Priorities said in a statement. It includes “a thinly veiled reference to the seizure and sale of public lands,” according to the conservation group.
The draft treats the West’s natural resources “as nothing more than numbers on a balance sheet,” Western Priorities Executive Director Jennifer Rokala said in a statement. In the plan, those resources are “products to be sold off and exploited to help pay for tax cuts for Elon Musk and Trump’s fellow billionaires,” she said.
“It resembles a business plan from a desperate CEO, not a framework to steward public lands for the benefit of all Americans,” Rokala’s statement reads.

To her post, Budd-Falen brings years of experience fighting for ranchers and other public land users and developers. The federal government has been a frequent adversary, but so has Western Watersheds Project, another conservation group that focuses on public land grazing.
She represented a group of ranchers who sued Western Watersheds for trespassing when a field worker collected water to test for pollution caused by grazing. She advised rural counties to adopt land use plans they could leverage when contesting federal programs on public land in their areas. She also represented stock growers who sided against four Missouri hunters who corner crossed to hunt public land on Elk Mountain in Carbon County. She represented the Cliven Bundy family and others as they fought grazing reductions imposed after Las Vegas developers were permitted to occupy desert tortoise habitat. That family later became infamous for armed standoffs with federal officials over use of public land.
Conservation measures
The draft plan includes numerous other elements like supporting law enforcement, disseminating science and managing lands to reduce wildfire risk. It would reduce the federal infrastructure footprint and ensure public lands meet visitors’ needs. The draft envisions clean and adequate amounts of water.
Interior would restore historic names, some of which have been changed to recognize indigenous monikers or demote racist figures. The department would “right size” national monuments, according to the draft.

A goal to “enjoy our natural resources while ensuring they remain sound and sustainable,” includes a variety of conservation measures, according to the draft. Species and natural resources would be protected and ecosystems would be healthy and balanced, the draft said. Progress could be measured by the number of species taken off threatened and endangered lists, according to the draft.
Abandoned mines and wells would be cleaned up, the draft proposes. The department would support co-management of its properties with “local stakeholders and tribes,” the draft states.
Burgum appointed Budd-Falen “to facilitate the prompt and effective accession of the Trump administration’s leadership team,” his order states. She will serve until the Senate confirms high Interior Department personnel appointed by President Trump, but no longer than through May 31.
The timeline for public engagement is from May 16 to July 18, with publication, or final adoption, set for Oct. 1. The strategic plan is a “bold, outcome-driven roadmap for how we deliver impact to the American people,” the draft states.

Wyoming Congresswoman distorts deportation case and taunts detractors in Buffalo, columnist Kerry Drake opines. 
The post Truth is a casualty of Hageman’s town halls appeared first on WyoFile .","Safety was the reason Wyoming Congresswoman Harriet Hageman said she put the brakes on her town hall road show a month ago in favor of virtual events.

Opinion

But when she returned in person in Buffalo last Thursday, the truth was the only thing that seemed to be in danger. Hageman, an attorney, was called out by members of the audience for telling an outrageous whopper about a deportation case, then doubling down on her false claims.
The incident demonstrated there’s nothing Hageman won’t do to defend President Donald Trump in his war against the federal judiciary and the rule of law. It also showed the political peril we’re in, when truth is continually distorted by the MAGA movement Hageman embraces.
Because of new rules that limited who could attend, Buffalo’s Bomber Mountain Civic Center was a much friendlier environment than Hageman experienced March 19 in Laramie, when many in the crowd of about 500 booed, cursed and heckled her.
Two hundred people with reservations to the Buffalo town hall signed up through Hageman’s office, according to Cowboy State Daily. No one could directly ask a question live, but queries were handwritten and placed in a box. 
The most contentious moment came after Hageman pulled out a question about whether she would pressure the Trump administration to do what the U.S. Supreme Court said it must: return a wrongfully deported Maryland man to the U.S.
The high court unanimously ruled Abrego Garcia should get the hearing he was denied before federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers sent him to a notorious prison in El Salvador.
Many in the crowd erupted in protest when Hageman bluntly said no. They asked why there was no due process in Garcia’s case.
The administration initially admitted to a lower court that Garcia’s deportation was due to an “administrative error.” An immigration judge ruled in October 2019 that Garcia, who had entered the country illegally as a teen, had “a well-founded fear” of persecution by a gang in El Salvador that had been extorting his family for years. The judge granted Garcia protection from being deported.
“First of all, [Garcia] was given due process,” Hageman said, which was met by shouts of “no.” She continued: “He went in front of two different immigration judges [who] ruled that he was a member of [the gang] MS-13. That’s due process.” 
But she inaccurately stated what happened. Garcia was detained by police after they saw him and three other men allegedly “loitering” outside a Home Depot store. Because of his clothing, tattoos and a confidential informant’s claim he was a MS-13 member, Garcia was taken into custody in 2019 by ICE.
The judges Hageman referred to both denied Garcia bail, because of the gang allegations, which remain unproven. He’s never been charged with a crime, despite Trump’s sensational claims he’s a convicted human trafficker and wife-beater. After a third judge ordered that Garcia not be deported, ICE did not appeal and he returned to his wife, a U.S. citizen, and their three children.
Hageman jumped headfirst into the rabbit hole dug by Trump and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who contend the Supreme Court didn’t order Garcia’s return.
“In fact, they reversed the district court and said [it] used the word ‘facilitate’ [his return],” Hageman argued. “I have never heard of a writ of facilitation, but oh well.”
In fact, the high court used the word when it unanimously found the lower court’s order “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.”
After trying to make her phony case that Garcia did receive due process, a  term the lawyer of course understands, Hageman’s next words were truly stunning.
“And as far as due process, I’m not sure what you are talking about or what you mean by due process,” she said, with a straight face. This wasn’t a case of legal amnesia, but an example of what earned Hageman such 
a hostile response in Laramie by taunting and dismissing her critics.
“Are you kidding me?” a woman yelled over the noise of the crowd.
Hageman stumbled. “Yes, no I’m not,” she said.
“You’re a lawyer!” the woman said.
“Yes, I am. Due process is notice and an opportunity to be heard, and he was given notice and an opportunity to be heard,” Hageman said.
No. After being given a temporary visa and work permit, Garcia spent five years in a construction apprenticeship program before being pulled over by ICE officers in Baltimore last month. He was told his immigration status had changed, and was then arrested and transferred to jails in three states before being flown with other deportees to CECOT prison in El Salvador. Like many inmates he was held in brutal conditions, never given a hearing, and believed he’d be held indefinitely.
Trump wants to keep it that way, and judging by Hageman’s responses in Buffalo, she’s perfectly OK with that. To her it’s justice.
But due process of law is much more than Hageman’s simplistic definition at her town hall. It’s a fundamental principle in the legal system that ensures fairness and justice. It serves as a safeguard against arbitrary denial of life, liberty or property by requiring adherence to established legal procedures. 
This concept is crucial for upholding individual rights and maintaining public confidence in the judicial process. Thanks in large part to Hageman and U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, who support Trump’s continued defiance of the federal judiciary, confidence in the legal process is very low in Wyoming these days.
More than 100 Wyoming jurists warned the delegation in a March 26 letter that Trump and his allies’ threats could erode the country’s rule of law.
These distinguished members of the Wyoming Bar — including a former governor and three ex-Wyoming Supreme Court justices — were insultingly called “biased, misguided” and “liberal” by Barrasso, Lummis and Hageman in a press release. The delegation said federal judges are the problem, not the president.
But as more news about Garcia’s shameful treatment comes out, it shines a bright light on Hageman’s cruel defense of Trump’s refusal to bring him home. The U.S. is paying El Salvador $6 million to keep more than 230 alleged gang members, including Garcia, who was recently transferred to a lower security prison because of his high profile.
It’s a nasty game Trump is playing in cahoots with El Salvador’s dictator, Nayib Bukele, over Garcia’s fate. Using a ridiculously narrow definition of “facilitate,” AG Bondi said, “We would facilitate [his release], meaning provide a plane.”
But Bukele vows to hold Garcia in prison forever, and Trump says he’s a terrorist who will never again set foot on American soil.  
On Friday, however, The Atlantic broke the story that U.S. officials were actively trying to bring Garcia home before their plans were blocked by Trump, who suddenly saw Garcia’s plight as a major political win in his fight with the courts over his deportation agenda.
The State Department puzzled over the sketchy evidence tying Garcia to a gang. Officials worried about his safety in prison where he could be targeted for attack. All of these concerns are valid.
Hageman didn’t need to throw Garcia, who has endured suffering for weeks and had his rights violated at Trump’s hands, under the bus. But it was red meat for her base, which can never get enough stories about how this president is supposedly leading the fight against crime.
But the truth matters, and so does the rule of law. How can we protect both when officials like Hageman turn a blind eye to justice?
Keep asking her hard questions at town halls and then vote her out of office.

Earlier this month, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Drug Enforcement Agency and FBI appeared at the Milwaukee County Courthouse with an administrative warrant to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery, and scheduled for an appearance in Dugan’s courtroom. 
An administrative warrant is not signed by a judge and does not allow agents to enter private spaces to make an arrest like a judicial warrant would. While the agents sat in the hallway outside the courtroom, Dugan told Flores-Ruiz and his attorney to use a side door. The door exits into the same public hallway and one agent rode the same elevator down to the lobby as Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer. Agents let Flores-Ruiz leave the building and then arrested him on the street. 
Last week, FBI agents appeared at the courthouse again to arrest Dugan. She’s been charged with obstructing justice and harboring an individual, both felony counts. Soon after her arrest, and before she had made her initial appearance in front of a judge, President Donald Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel were discussing the case on social media and television, accusing Dugan of being “deranged.” 
Bondi said on Fox News Friday that the charges were filed against Dugan to show the administration was willing to go after anyone, even judges, if they get in the way of their efforts to deport millions of people. Bondi said interfering with ICE agents “will not be tolerated.” 
“What has happened to our judiciary is beyond me,” Bondi said. “The [judges] are deranged is all I can think of. I think some of these judges think that they are beyond and above the law. They are not, and we are sending a very strong message today … if you are harboring a fugitive… we will come after you and we will prosecute you. We will find you.”
From the beginning, the case displayed many missteps in an effort to show force and draw attention, says Stephen Kravit, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. 
“It looks like these prosecutors are completely co-opted in Trump World and aren’t really using very good judgment. You should just look at the facts and law, and there’s just no chance they’ll be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Judge Dugan was corruptly intending to avoid a government subpoena, or that she was harboring a fugitive,” he says, calling the charges “crap.”
During the initial arrest of Flores-Ruiz, Kravit questions why DEA and FBI agents are appearing at the courthouse for immigration enforcement actions and why so many agents were needed to serve an administrative warrant. 
“It’s bad for justice on any level. They had six agents there, six to make an unarmed collar of a person who was accused of battery to his roommate,” Kravit says. “And they know he’s not armed. And there’s six of them. Two of them are DEA agents. Those are two agents not enforcing drug laws, which is what they’re charged to do. There’s no drugs involved here, OK? Two of them are FBI agents, who have 100 other different things to do. We probably only have six or seven DEA agents in the state.”
Kravit adds that the whole situation might have gone differently if ICE had gotten a warrant to arrest Flores-Ruiz from a judge rather than one “written by some guy in the office” and it’s going to be difficult for prosecutors to prove Dugan had a corrupt intent by sending Florez-Ruiz out the side door when she could have just been avoiding a “ruckus” outside her door while she’s trying to move on with the court schedule. 
He also takes offense with the way Dugan was “perp walked” out of the courthouse when she could have just been asked to turn herself in; questions why federal prosecutors didn’t bring the case to a grand jury first — which would have been the standard process — and why the country’s most powerful justice officials are discussing the case on cable news. 
“The arrest warrant for the judge is a travesty, but there’s so much reasonable doubt,” he says. “Was she corruptly trying to interrupt a government proceeding? Corruptly? Was somebody paying her money? No, or was she harboring a fugitive? That’s what she’s charged with. Did she harbor a fugitive on any set of facts that you can imagine? That’s what she’s charged with. These are serious felonies. They ruin the woman’s life and all so that Pam Bondi could make a press statement.”
Dugan’s arrest, and the attention her case has brought to ICE operating at county courthouses could have a chilling effect on Wisconsin’s justice system, Jeff Mandell, executive director of Law Forward, says. 
“I do think that there’s a chilling effect to having federal officials prowling a state courthouse to make arrests and absent real danger or exigent circumstances, it feels like that’s not a good thing,” Mandell says. “We want people in our communities to be willing and able to show up in court. We want those people to know that they can do so without feeling like they’re getting entrapped or something like that, and that’s in all of our interests.” 
For immigrants, undocumented or not, appearing in court for any reason now is a fraught decision, which could lead to witnesses to crimes not showing up to testify, Mandell says. 
“If you were just going about your day and something happened to you and this person was a witness, and you needed them to help sort things out in court and things like that, then you know, you didn’t choose your witnesses,” he says.” You didn’t decide who was going to be standing there when you were in an accident or some other misfortune befell you.” 
ICE’s focus on arresting people making court appearances puts those criminal defendants — who have not yet been convicted of a crime — in the position to decide between showing up to court and potentially being picked up by ICE or skipping their court date. Last week, the Wisconsin public defender’s office sent an email to private defense attorneys across the state advising them how to deal with clients asking about ICE operations in courthouses. 
“Explain to the client the consequences of not showing to court like you would to any client,” the email states. “Remember you cannot tell a client not to come but you can explain that ICE has been coming to courthouses and that it may no longer be a safe haven.” 
Mandell says the operations in courthouses and Dugan’s arrest are emblematic of the Trump administration’s worst impulses. 
“I think it reinforces what we’re seeing through day 98 of the administration, what we’re seeing in all kinds of ways in this administration, which is an impatience, a heedlessness, a recklessness, a disregard for norms,” he says. “That many of these folks seem to believe there’s one set of rules for them and a different set of rules for someone else.” 
“So they want respect paid to federal officials, but they are going to trample on state institutions and state officials,” he continues. “They want everyone to follow the law, but they are going to play fast and loose and cut corners, whether that’s using administrative warrants, whether that is avoiding grand juries to bring federal charges.” 
Mandell adds that when Trump was charged with felonies, he was given the privilege of turning himself in to be booked. 
“They want all of the trappings of tremendous respect for their offices, but they are not going to afford even a modicum of respect to others,” Mandell continues, “which we see handcuffing and perp walking Judge Dugan out of the courthouse without even the common courtesy of a phone call to ask if she might be willing to turn herself in, which, of course, is how the President himself insisted on all of his bookings being handled.”

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, is collecting Idahoans’ opinions on affordable housing through a survey.
The survey is meant to inform Crapo about common issues to possibly consider legislation, the senator’s office announced in a news release in March. In 2014 and 2015, the senator’s veterans’ surveys led Crapo to introduce legislation that became law, his office said. 
“A lack of affordable housing is the number one issue Idahoans raise with my staff and me in meetings across the State,” Crapo said in a prepared statement.  “Idaho is far from alone in this nationwide challenge, but Idahoans can be a key part in piecing together the housing puzzle as I continue to work to find collaborative solutions to this issue. I invite any Idahoan to complete the survey and share as much detail as they are willing and able to provide.”
For two years in a row, Idahoans have listed workforce and affordable housing as their overall top budget priority for the Idaho Legislature, according to the annual Idaho Public Policy Survey by Boise State University. Almost a third of Idahoans, 32%, listed the issue as their top state legislative budget priority. Nearly half of Idahoans, 49%, reported feeling financially strained by housing costs, the survey found.
Crapo’s affordable housing survey, available online, is open through May 31.
The survey is intended to hear feedback from homeowners, renters, insurance brokers, bankers, realtors, government officials and general contractors, Crapo’s office said.

Robin Smith, shown with members of her legal team, testified for the prosecution Monday in a federal corruption trial. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The prosecution’s chief witness in Tennessee’s political corruption case testified Monday the identities of former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff had to be “masked” because of their connection to a racist and sexist texting scandal.
On the trial’s fifth day, former state Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson explained how she, Casada and Cade Cothren met at a Nashville bar in October 2019 to plan the formation of Phoenix Solutions, a shadowy company that printed and sent out constituent mailers for lawmakers without their knowledge of who ran it. Smith, who pleaded guilty to honest services fraud in 2022 and is cooperating with federal prosecutors in the kickback case against Casada and Cothren, described the state’s postage and printing program for lawmakers as “low-hanging fruit” because it would be an instant way to make money. House members receive $3,000 in state funds to send out surveys and informational mailers, both of which must receive approval from the Speaker’s office and the director of legislative administration.
Cothren formed Phoenix Solutions in early November 2019 through the New Mexico Secretary of State’s office and created a registered agent, a method that would enable them to “mask identities” of Casada and Cothren, just months after they resigned their posts because of the texting scandal that broke open in the spring of 2019.
Smith explained that politicians are “acutely aware and sensitive” about their associates and want to maintain the “halo effect.” Thus, they had to keep Casada’s and Cothren’s connections to Phoenix Solutions secret to do business with Tennessee lawmakers.

“It was understood that I would be the least suspicious of the three to approach lawmakers,” Smith said of the business arrangement. “I was the only one that didn’t have a radioactive halo around me.”
She added that Casada “did not understand the toxicity of the scandal.”
Smith said the arrangement called for her and Casada to receive a portion of the money lawmakers spent with Phoenix Solutions based on the number of clients they brought to the company. Ultimately, lawmakers spent about $52,000 with the company from the postage and printing accounts.
A former chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, Smith played a role in Republicans taking the majority from Democrats and then winning a supermajority. Smith described herself as a “den mother” and said she came up with the name “Phoenix” from reading the Bible and Greek mythology and felt Casada and Cothren had gone through “public scrutiny” and, similarly to the mythical bird, would be rising “from the ashes.”
Smith testified after Nick Crawford, a lobbyist with Capitol & 5th Public Strategies who initially handled work done by Phoenix Solutions and its bogus agent, Matthew Phoenix, while he worked as a House Republican Caucus adviser for Chairman Jeremy Faison.
Crawford, the first person to receive a phony W-9 form signed by Matthew Phoenix, said he thought it might have been signed by a computer. He also said he was never able to speak with Matthew Phoenix by telephone or text message, only by email.
Smith pleads guilty to wire fraud connected to shadowy campaign vendor

Smith approached Crawford about directing business to Phoenix Solutions, and he recommended the company to Republican Rep. Jay Reedy of Erin and Republican Rep. Tim Rudd of Murfreesboro because he trusted Smith, who had been a key player in state politics for several years, Crawford said.
In an email, Smith said to Crawford and Cothren, “be introduced.”
Crawford, who was aware of the sexist and racist texting scandal, testified he wouldn’t have recommended Phoenix Solutions if he had known who was running it.
Smith was running a political consulting firm called River’s Edge Alliance when she won election to the House in 2018. After Casada left the speakership following a no-confidence vote by the Republican Caucus, he started Right Way Consulting.
Casada continued to serve in the House, and Smith had been named a committee chairman when the FBI raided them in January 2021. She resigned from the chairmanship, then decided to cooperate with federal authorities instead of misleading them.
Smith told the jury she repented to her pastor and family, then talked to federal agents, and added her goal is to “tell the truth” in hopes of receiving a “favorable sentence.”

In the 2024 survey that recently was released, 77% of local governments reported local law enforcement agencies were utilizing body cameras.
Stark increases in dashboard cameras and public surveillance cameras between 2015 and 2024 were found in the MPPS too, as well as an increase in the usage of drones to 31% of jurisdictions, compared to 3% of the state’s jurisdictions in 2015.

Several local law enforcement agency heads have offered testimony to lawmakers considering additional funding for public safety in the state budget at the moment, explaining the demand for improved technology when it comes to law enforcement.
As public trust in law enforcement has been a large conversation in recent years, with Michigan no exception, demand for tools to preserve accountability is high, said Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford) earlier this month after the state house approved the additional funding for public safety. 
“If we’re going to hold our officers to a high standard and expect them to do professional policing, we have to be willing to invest,” said Harris, who served in law enforcement for more than 20 years in Michigan.
The police surveillance footage of 26-year-old Patrick Lyoya, an immigrant from the Congo being fatally shot by former Grand Rapids police officer Christopher Schurr in 2022 is circulating again this week as the trial for Schurr, who is charged with second-degree murder, begins. The footage caused public outcry for accountability for Lyoya’s death back in 2022, similar to the police killings of George Floyd in 2020 and Daunte Wright in 2021.
But while there have been clear increases in usage of surveillance by law enforcement and appetite for surveillance technology by the public, in terms of accountability, when it comes to usage of artificial intelligence technology in that sector, law enforcement and local government leaders have concerns.
About a third of leaders of local law enforcement agencies report that their departments have adopted or intend to adopt artificial intelligence or predictive technology, according to the 2024 MPPS.
Newer technology like automated license plate readers and facial recognition technology are not widely used, with 26% of agencies saying they use license plate readers and 10% reporting they use facial recognition. Only 3% of agencies said they used artificial intelligence or other predictive tools.
“AI is still in a bit of a Wild West phase,” Debra Horner, senior project manager on the survey said in a statement. “However, over a third of sheriffs and police chiefs saying they are currently using or soon to adopt predictive tools for policing and around half of prosecutors saying they at least somewhat trust AI or other automated applications for certain applications. That suggests it is a good time for the state of Michigan and individual local governments to consider developing formal regulations around transparent and responsible use of AI in law enforcement.”
The MPPS conveyed that there was interest from different levels of the criminal justice system in utilizing AI with 50% of elected county prosecutors who responded to the survey stating that at least somewhat trust AI applications that work to identify high-risk neighborhoods.
However, 66% of those county prosecutors said they were unsure if predictive policing tools made more or less accurate assessments than human-created assessments and 59% of the responding sheriffs felt the same way.
Alarm bells have also been rung by stakeholders, such as the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, or MDCR, who believe some automated technology has been programmed with racial biases across different fields, with some research reflecting that facial recognition technologies lead to disproportionate arrests of Black people.
“…all law enforcement agencies in the State of Michigan should review their current and future uses of Artificial Intelligence policing tools to determine their efficacy and tendencies to perpetuate, incorporate or facilitate bias and discrimination,” said a 2024 resolution by the MDCR.
Ferris State University Professor Greg E. Gogolin, who created the undergraduate Artificial Intelligence degree at the school, told the Michigan Advance that Michigan is not adequately creating a workforce prepared to best utilize AI or compete with other country’s expertise.
Many companies and industries want to jump on the “AI bandwagon” but few have taken into consideration that there isn’t significant investment into educating workers in this emerging technology, Gogolin said.
In the few higher education programs in Michigan that permit focuses in AI, Gogolin said many of those taking the courses are international students who will benefit industries in country’s abroad. However, he says if the state of Michigan wants law enforcement and other sectors to be versed in AI tools, it has to start with education and also an entire infrastructure to accommodate the technology.
Security on the data from the AI technology is another major concern point, Gogolin said. Michigan’s legislature is currently facing the task of legislating cyber crimes utilizing AI and the state currently doesn’t have a criminal justice system best equipped to handle the prosecution of such breaches so there is a lot of room for improvement to foster an environment prepared for AI.
Expecting law enforcement agencies to quickly be able to masterfully use AI would be similar to handing officers firearms without significant training, Gogolin said. 
“We’re not even training our own citizens, right? Expertise is growing much, much faster outside the United States,” Gogolin. “Something has to change very, very soon. Or we’re going to be so far beyond the ticking point that we’re never going to be able to catch up.”

(Photo courtesy of Richard Prodgers)The Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Yellowstone to Uintas Connection filed a federal lawsuit this month to stop a proposed pipeline corridor that would cut through six roadless areas in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest in Idaho.
The area is habitat for imperiled species like the greater sage grouse, grizzly bears, lynx, and wolverine, and the pipeline would result in a permanent 20-mile road across otherwise roadless public lands. The new permanent pipeline corridor could be used for additional pipelines in the future, and will undoubtedly increase illegal ATV use in the region.

The U.S. Forest Service authorized a special use permit in March to clear-cut a 50-foot wide, 18.2-mile-long corridor through six National Forest Inventoried Roadless Areas for construction of a private company’s pipeline from Montpelier, Idaho, to Afton, Wyoming. The decision allows a 50-foot right-of-way that will be clearcut during construction, and a permanent 20-foot right-of-way to maintain the pipeline.
In addition to the pipeline itself and the utility corridor, there will also be above-ground facilities such as valves and staging areas. But since the project violates a number of federal laws, the Alliance and Yellowstone to Uintas Connection have filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service to stop construction of the pipeline.
This pipeline would create a road through designated roadless areas, further fragments security habitat for deer and elk, and further degrades already impacted habitat for the threatened Canada lynx.
This is the second time the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Yellowstone to Uintas have sued to stop this pipeline. We filed our first lawsuit in April of 2020, and two years later the Forest Service tucked its tail and ran, pulling its decision without even waiting for a final court order. But now it’s trying again, and the simple truth is that the pipeline corridor will actually be a permanent road through national forest lands despite the fact that these public lands have been classified and protected as federal Inventoried Roadless Areas.
That means motorized vehicles will be allowed to permanently use this corridor to maintain and inspect the pipeline. Which will cause permanent vegetation removal, increased sight-lines for poaching, increased noxious weed introductions, and abundant new opportunities for illegal motor vehicle use in these currently roadless areas.
The basis for our lawsuit is that the Forest Service failed to disclose and demonstrate compliance with its own Forest Plan requirements for sage grouse. The agency also failed to analyze the cumulative effects on sage grouse as required. In this case, the Forest Service also failed to demonstrate that the new pipeline corridor is in the public interest; is compatible and consistent with other forest resources; that there is no reasonable alternative or accommodation on national forest lands; that it is impractical to use existing right-of-ways; and that the rationale for approving the new pipeline corridor is not solely to lower costs for the energy company. This violates the Forest Plan, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Forest Service Manual, the National Forest Management Act, the Mineral Leasing Act, and the Administrative Procedures Act.
National forests were designated for the benefit of all Americans, not to maximize the profits of the oil and gas industry. Instead of needlessly destroying this rare habitat for endangered species on publicly-owned lands, the private company should use existing right-of-ways or private lands.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)GREAT FALLS, WYOMING — A federal jury in Great Falls unanimously found CoreCivic liable for failing to protect a former inmate who was “nearly beaten to death” at its Shelby prison and awarded the man $27.75 million, according to court records and an account from his lawyers.
CoreCivic, a private company that manages the Crossroads Correctional Center in Shelby, said Friday it will appeal the decision.
The victim, Nathaniel Lake, was convicted of a crime he maintained he did not commit, and he was transferred to CoreCivic’s prison in Shelby, according to a news release Friday from the law firm representing him, Heenan and Cook of Billings. The Montana Supreme Court later overturned that conviction.
“While there, Mr. Lake was assaulted by another inmate serving a double life sentence without parole for deliberate homicide who had previously assaulted 11 times,” the news release said.
The original complaint filed in Toole County District Court in December 2021 said CoreCivic had been named in multiple lawsuits around the country with allegations based on “inmate injuries and deaths inflicted by other inmates.”
The lawsuit said a 2016 U.S. Department of Justice audit found CoreCivic routinely had insufficient staffing.
It also said a 2021 presidential order prohibited the DOJ to renew contracts with private prison operators, including CoreCivic, “noting that such facilities do not provide safe living or working conditions” compared to publicly operated ones.
CoreCivic maintains it takes safety seriously. In January 2025, the Brennan Center for Justice said the Trump administration reversed the order against private prison contracts.
According to the news release, the assailant “buzzed” out of his own locked pod and into Lake’s locked pod in the 2018 attack.
“He then went to Mr. Lake’s cell and beat and choked him for over 3 1/2 minutes undetected by any jailers,” the news release said. “A jailer found Mr. Lake at lockdown count and he was life-flighted to a hospital in Great Falls.”
The complaint said the assailant moved quickly, “no CCC staff intervened in the attack on Lake,” and he was allowed to “freely roam the prison between units without staff intervention.”
Lake was in a coma for 33 days and spent four months in the ICU, the lawyers said. Lake is also represented by Bechtold Law in Missoula.
The complaint said Lake had a “significant history of mental health issues” and was designated as a sex offender at the time, which made him more vulnerable to an attack.
But it said Lake maintained his innocence of attempted sexual intercourse without consent, and the news release said the conviction didn’t stick.
After being released from the hospital, Lake returned to CoreCivic for six months, but was released when the Montana Supreme Court overturned his conviction.
The complaint said the Missoula County Attorney’s Office declined to refile charges, and Lake has no criminal record.
U.S. Department of Justice opens investigation into CoreCivic Trousdale County prison

In a statement, lawyer John Heenan said the award delivers on the request of the team’s client. The lawyers said the jury found “deliberate indifference” on the part of CoreCivic.
“In the face of a company that flatly refused to accept any responsibility for its conduct, we told the jury that Mr. Lake didn’t want sympathy, he wanted justice,” Heenan said. “The jury resoundingly rejected CoreCivic’s excuses and delivered justice.”
Based in Tennessee, CoreCivic describes itself as one of the largest corrections operators in the country. In an email, spokesperson Ryan Gustin said CoreCivic will appeal the decision.
“We take the safety and well-being of every person in our care very seriously,” Gustin said. “We respectfully disagree with this decision, don’t believe it reflects the facts of the case, and will appeal it on several legal grounds.”
The complaint said the prisoner who assaulted Lake was criminally charged with two counts of aggravated assault, pleaded guilty to the first count, and was sentenced to 15 years at the Montana State Prison with no time suspended.
Lake suffered a traumatic brain injury under CoreCivic’s negligent supervision, which had severe and permanent consequences, the complaint said: “He will likely require care for the rest of his life.”

Tate Reeves vetoed eight bills that lawmakers sent to his desk during the 2025 legislative session. 
Legislators, during their next regular session, could override the vetoes if a two-thirds majority of lawmakers in each chamber votes to do so. Such a supermajority vote is hard to attain, and veto overrides are rare. Lawmakers have only overridden one of Reeves’ previous vetoes, and that was the first override of a veto since 2002.
The governor can also line-item veto appropriation bills, but lawmakers adjourned their session without adopting a budget to fund the state government. 
Here’s a list of bills that Reeves vetoed this year:
House Bill 569 
This legislation would have changed when medical facilities were required to apply for a “certificate of need” from the Mississippi State Department of Health before opening or adding new services. 
Reeves vetoed the bill because he argued it unlawfully attempted to circumvent an ongoing court case by granting a certificate to a single psychiatric hospital in Jackson.  
House Bill 924
The legislation would have granted the Legislature’s watchdog committee the authority to conduct a review of new state agency regulations and determine if those regulations conform to what the Legislature intended for the agency to do. 
Reeves vetoed the bill because he argued that it greatly expanded the power of a legislative committee and may have exceeded the constitutional authority of the legislative branch. 
House Bill 1085 
This bill would have removed a grant program for Main Street projects in the state from under the Mississippi Development Authority, an executive agency directly under Reeves’ control, to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, an agency governed by an independent board.  
Reeves argued that the legislation was unconstitutional because it combined general legislation with an appropriation bill, which the Mississippi Constitution prohibits. The governor compared the legislation to a “duck-billed platypus that defies both logic and classification.” 
House Bill 1126 
The bill would have set a maximum local match requirement for counties and municipalities that receive Gulf Coast Restoration funds to fund projects. Currently, the Mississippi Development Authority sets rules and regulations for a local match. 
The legislation capped the local match at either 20% of the total cost or the value of one mill of taxable property in the area, whichever is less, but Reeves vetoed the measure because it mandated requirements instead of allowing an agency to set flexible rules. 
Senate Bill 2386 and Senate Bill 2867  
These two bills made technical amendments to the state’s Medicaid program, often referred to as the “Medicaid tech bill.” The main thrust of the two bills was to lock in place supplemental payment programs that have been a lifeline for hospitals. 
Reeves said in his veto message of Senate Bill 2867 that locking the supplemental payment program in place is in contradiction with another of the bill’s mandates, which would change the program to allow out-of-state hospitals that border Mississippi to participate in the supplemental payment program. 
“Complying with both requirements is a legal impossibility and places the Division, like Odysseus, between Scylla and Charybdis,” Reeves wrote. 
Reeves vetoed Senate Bill 2867 while the Legislature was still in session. Instead of overriding the veto, the Legislature passed Senate Bill 2386, a new Medicaid technology bill that addresses only some of Reeves’ concerns. The governor also vetoed that bill. 
Senate Bill 2573 
This bill would have created the Mississippi Department of Tourism, but Reeves vetoed the bill because legislative leaders failed to pass a budget during their regular session. The governor argued it would be irresponsible to create a new state agency without an accompanying budget. 
Senate Bill 2840  
This bill would have allocated money for various projects around the state.

She found that many people still have soggy carpets and wet basements after more than two months. Houses are filled with mold. Trash is piled up outside. Some residents say they haven’t seen anyone from the state or federal government in their small towns offering help.
And McDowell is one of the few counties that actually received federal funding for flood response. 
In late February, the federal government approved Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s request for federal  aid. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has so far approved nearly 3,500 applications for individual assistance, and more than $25 million has been awarded to residents in Logan, McDowell, Mercer, Mingo, Raleigh, Wayne and Wyoming counties.
Residents who receive that money can use it to cover the costs of temporary housing and home repairs. 
About 94% of West Virginia communities are considered “Special Flood Hazard Areas,” which means the more than 84,000 structures in those areas are at a high risk of flooding, according to a 2023 report by researchers at West Virginia University.
However, President Donald Trump has suggested that FEMA, which is the only agency currently that administers disaster relief funds, might “go away.”
Last week it was announced that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency would cut 1,000 employees — or 20% of the workforce — from FEMA, just ahead of hurricane season.
On Wednesday, Morrisey announced that FEMA denied individual assistance grants to Boone, Cabell, Greenbrier, Kanawha, Lincoln, Monroe and Summers counties, and public assistance grants in Cabell and Kanawha counties for the February floods. 
“Despite today’s notification, I am grateful to the Trump Administration for their strong support for Southern West Virginia’s recovery following the February floods,” Morrisey said in a statement. 
We know you’re not a native West Virginian, governor, but please stand up for your adopted state.
Alex Brown from Stateline, one of West Virginia Watch’s sister newsrooms, reached out to the White House about states being denied FEMA funding, and received a statement that said the agency is focused on “truly catastrophic disasters,” and that states need to have a better “appetite to own the problem.”
West Virginia has no appetite, as shown during the legislative session.
On April 4, about three weeks after the devastating February floods, Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, proposed adding $50 million to the state budget for flood prevention. 
“We have the ability to do something earthly,” Hornbuckle said. “The power that we have — not just the divine power — but with a button and a pen that we all have to help out neighbors in the great state of West Virginia.”  
The amendment was rejected 75-19.
Remember the 2016 floods — the deadliest in the state’s history? Former Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat born in Logan County, declared a state of emergency for 44 of the state’s 55 counties.
Since November 2019, FEMA has given West Virginia more than $424 million in funding in response to the 2016 floods. More than $42 million was given to 4,949 individuals and families, and more than $172.8 million was given to local and state governments and some nonprofits. FEMA also provided more than $209.8 million to replace Herbert Hoover High, Richwood Middle, Richwood High, Summersville Middle and to relocate Clendenin Elementary.
Herbert Hoover High School was destroyed, and students were taught in portable classrooms until their new school was completed in fall 2023. Clendenin Elementary School didn’t reopen until fall 2024. Construction hasn’t started on the schools destroyed in Nicholas County. 
In response to that flood, the West Virginia Legislature created the State Resiliency Office. Its purpose is to “Minimize the loss of life and property, m​​aintain eco​nomic stability, and improve recovery time by coordinating with stakeholders to implement disaster resilient strategies.​​
The state Legislature created the West Virginia Disaster Recovery Trust Fund in 2023 with Senate Bill 677. The fund sits empty. No money was allocated to that fund during the 2024 legislative session. The FY 2026 budget, which Morrisey has signed, doesn’t include any money for the fund either. 
There were only three bills related to flooding during the session — House Bill 2858 and Senate Bill 502 were the same bill, meant to allow counties to regulate floodplains under National Flood Insurance Program guidelines. They both died. House Bill 3502, sponsored by Hornbuckle, would have allowed a one-time allocation of $100 million from the state revenue shortfall fund and $150 million from the state’s income tax revenue fund for the West Virginia Flood Resiliency Trust Fund. It died in the House Government Organization.
West Virginia needs FEMA, but with FEMA potentially out of the picture, it’s time the state whet its appetite and take a bite out of the problem. 
Morrisey has already said he plans to call a special session this summer to deal with the Public Employees Insurance Agency and education funding. Sounds like the perfect time and a good use of tax payer money to move some funding over to the West Virginia Disaster Recovery Trust Fund.

Angie Craig D-MN, speaks at a news conference on January 29, 2019 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Zach Gibson/Getty Images)Democratic U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, who has won a string of victories in the closely divided 2nd Congressional District, is running for U.S. Senate to replace Sen. Tina Smith, who recently announced her retirement.
Craig, who has represented the 2nd District since 2019, will battle Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, in what is expected to be a grueling and expensive Democratic-Farmer-Labor primary. 
The contest will split the party along ideological lines. Flanagan has long been a champion of progressive causes while Craig has garnered attention for breaking from her party on issues like law enforcement and immigration. 
Craig’s press release announcing her campaign leans on popular issues like lowering the cost of prescription drugs; stopping corporate concentration; banning members of Congress from trading stocks; and addressing the nation’s mental health and addiction problems. 
“We all know Washington’s not listening to you — and that’s got to change,” said Craig, who’s been in Washington for six years. 
In a video announcement, Craig drives a Jeep adorned with rubber ducks and speaks to the viewer while standing in front of a tractor.
She frequently refers to her upbringing in a mobile home park, raised by a single mom. She went on to become successful in the medical device industry. 
Craig is Minnesota’s first openly lesbian member of Congress and is married and has four adult sons and three grandchildren. 
She was the victim of random violence in the elevator of her Washington, D.C. apartment building in 2023, fending off the attacker with her hot coffee before escaping. 
Her campaign release uses the phrase “fought like hell” twice, once referring to her family’s battle to adopt children, and again referring to her work on “behalf of family farmers.” 
Craig’s centrist politics have helped her win four consecutive elections in the purple 2nd District in the south metro, with her margin of victory expanding until she won a blowout in 2024 despite Republicans’ nationwide success at the ballot box. She’s a vocal proponent of law enforcement, has voted on Republican-led border security bills and is the top Democrat on the House Committee on Agriculture. 
In recent months, Craig seemed to be making moves to appeal to the DFL’s progressive base, perhaps in preparation for a statewide run. She invited Denise Specht, president of the state’ influential teachers union Education Minnesota, to be her guest at the State of the Union address. She joined with well-known progressive Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington, to form a new caucus, known as the Monopoly Busters Caucus. 
A spokeswoman for Flanagan sought to draw a contrast, though without naming Craig. 
“In Peggy you have a lifelong Minnesotan who has spent her entire career fighting for and delivering economic wins and stability for kids and families. And she’s building a formidable campaign powered by actual people, not corporations,” said campaign spokeswoman Alexandra Fetissoff.
Flanagan announced her bid for Senate in February. Last week, she released a list of endorsements from lawmakers in Craig’s district, including DFL state Sens. Lindsey Port and Erin Maye Quade, and Reps. Kristi Pursell, Jess Hanson and Mary Frances Clardy. She’s also won the endorsement of Attorney General Keith Ellison, former U.S. Sen. Al Franken and State Auditor Julie Blaha. 
Craig’s departure in the 2nd District is expected to set off a competitive race to replace her — on both sides. Potential candidates include 2024 GOP nominee Joe Teirab; 2020 and 2022 GOP nominee Tyler Kistner; DFL state Sens. Matt Klein and Erin Maye Quade; former state Sen. Matt Little; and Minneapolis businessman and internet impresario Mike Norton.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/minn.-craig.jpg,,,2025-04-29 06:00:33.008936

So I reported the sham account to Facebook and texted my friend, who knew about it and had already alerted Facebook. The fake “friendvite” was one of many I reject and report every week.
In deepening Va. GOP crisis, Reid accuses Youngkin PAC of extortion. Is a legal battle ahead?

Having a large social media following is not unusual for people like my friend, who spent most of his career in the public eye during decades of distinguished service at top levels in state government. They’re also prime targets for digital impostors.
The very next day, another friend of mine — longtime Richmond morning radio talk show host and Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid — was the focus of lurid accusations stemming from posts on a dubious social media account.
A page on a platform known as Tumblr used a name that matches Reid’s usernames on other social media. The story was first reported Friday in The Richmonder by former Mercury reporter Graham Moomaw, who viewed the images before the Tumblr page was taken down. The story said the pornographic pictures of men were reposted, random photos that had appeared elsewhere. Reid was in none of them.
Reid is the first openly gay candidate for statewide office in Virginia history. I’ve known him for the better part of 30 years, and he’s never hidden his orientation from anyone. People who know him know that he’s eight years into a committed, monogamous relationship.
I am not privy to all the facts, but there’s more than enough reason to be highly skeptical of what has all the earmarks of a clumsy, hateful political takedown. It’s also clear that a quarter of the way through the 21st century, some people will do anything to keep a gay man from being part of the most diverse ticket in Virginia history alongside the first Black woman and Hispanic man elected to statewide office.
This was already a difficult year for Republicans. President Donald Trump has lost convincingly all three times he’s been on a Virginia ballot. The GOP is winless in every statewide election when he was either president or a candidate. His second administration’s chainsaw approach to severing federal employees and contractors who are a significant part of Virginia’s economy makes this year’s climb steeper.
The GOP caught a break by avoiding primaries for statewide office. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, running for governor, and Attorney General Jason Miyares, running for reelection, secured their nominations weeks ago. On April 21, Reid became the default lieutenant governor nominee when longtime Fairfax County Board of Supervisors member Pat Herrity withdrew citing health concerns.  
That’s when the threats began, Reid said in a Monday interview with the Mercury.
“Then I got a call from a religious group in Henrico saying, ‘We’re warning you that your life is going to be ruined, so don’t run,’” he said. “Yesterday, they told my campaign guy that if I step aside, this will all go away.”
If that sounds to you like blackmail talk more befitting mob bosses than political operatives, you’re not alone.
“I think they — not everybody but some people — decided they don’t want a gay man on the ticket after the primary didn’t work out the way they expected. They thought that Pat would crush me in money and in northern Virginia votes,” Reid said.
Leading the chorus of Republicans pressuring Reid to retreat is Gov. Glenn Youngkin, whom Reid has unabashedly supported and who was often a guest on Reid’s dominant Richmond region morning radio talk show on WRVA.
I know from bitter personal experience the disastrous consequences of being insufficiently skeptical; of feeling time-pressured to believe a finding rather than awaiting a fuller accounting. Has Youngkin done the same thing?
Imagine you’re a well-known media personality who also has a significant portfolio of service to Republican causes and officeholders. You effectively live in a glass house. Now ask yourself: Would I, in such a situation, post X-rated pictures of strangers on a social media account under my own username? In what world is that sane? At a minimum, it should give you pause.
I wonder, governor, where was your indignance over the lewd behavior of another Republican who once bragged on a hot mic of taking grossly indecent liberties with women, including grabbing their genitalia? Or over unwanted sexual advances against writer E. Jean Carroll for which a New York jury held him civilly liable for battery and defamation. Or over his conviction on 34 felony counts by another New York jury on charges he paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election to silence her claim that the two had sex years earlier.
Did you ask him to abandon his nomination for the presidency, an office he has now won twice? Did it occur to you or your political advisers that the questionable claim against Reid could plausibly be one of those innumerable spoofed accounts that get generated every day by overseas bot farms, soulless scammers and, in the instant case, possibly a few ethically bankrupt political schemers? How much investigation preceded your demand that Reid quit the race? Would you have similarly sandbagged your party’s nominee if that person had been heterosexual?
I have always respected Reid. I don’t agree with all of his politics, but there’s no Democrat with whom I share full concurrence, either. He has always been unflinchingly conservative. He’s never shied from asking tough questions or answering them from others, either as a political aide or as a broadcaster. Nothing he’s ever told me turned out to be a lie, and I can’t say that about many in the realm of politics.
I don’t know how all of this winds up, but history won’t be kind to those who orchestrated or advanced this Machiavellian ambush. As Reid told me, it’s not all Republicans. Many of them have recognized this underhanded play and rallied behind him, as the Washington Post reported from Reid’s campaigning in Virginia’s reddest congressional district over the weekend.
I also know Reid is defiant, hurt, angry and not backing down. He has engaged lawyers to look into what he flatly calls extortion, a felony. He might have a civil defamation claim, something that could compel interesting answers in sworn depositions.
Those who figured Reid would falter and meekly fade away figured wrong. Now they’re in a fistfight of their own making.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)All of Virginia’s educational divisions, except two, have signed Title VI certifications pledging their commitment to treating all students equally regardless of their race, following a mandate by the state education department that builds on President Donald Trump administration’s campaign to demolish diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in federally-funded agencies. 
Two school divisions — in Loudoun and Fairfax, the state’s largest school district — submitted alternative documents that they say signify the same commitment, flouting the certification form created by the U.S. Department of Education. Norfolk signed a modified certification form.
Schools could lose federal funding and face further investigation if they don’t comply with the certification, federal leaders have said.

Loudoun County Superintendent Aaron Spence wrote a letter to the Virginia Department of Education explaining the division would not sign the certification because  it already has policies to ensure Title VI compliance, so “it is not clear what purpose the requested certification serves.” 
“We believe we have complied with the intent of the requested certification by providing the necessary assurances to the Department of Education—both at present and during our annual grant applications, as required by federal law,” Spence said in a statement. “The letter we submitted to the VDOE was intended to fulfill this purpose while also highlighting our concerns regarding the lack of clarity created by the certification document itself.”
Loudoun County schools also published a letter to parents stating that the division has already certified its compliance when applying for federal funding and claiming that the federal agency’s request is also “vague” and “overly broad.” 
Spence said the school division will await further guidance, since courts in New Hampshire and Maryland recently issued injunctions on the collection of information regarding diversity, equity and inclusion programs. 
Fairfax schools sent both a modified certification and assurance document and said in a statement to the Mercury that the school division’s policies continue to be “consistent with all applicable state and federal laws.”
Last week, Fairfax Superintendent Michelle Reid reinforced this by certifying the division’s compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to state education leaders.
“Here in FCPS, we believe our diversity is a strength and that each and every child deserves access to a world-class education,” Reid said in a statement to the Mercury. “The power and promise of public education come to life every day in our schools through the tireless dedication of our staff and the transformative moments of learning that our students experience.”
On April 3, the U.S. Department of Education required the Virginia Department of Education to certify each school division’s compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the responsibilities outlined in the Students for Fair Admissions vs. Harvard case — or risk losing federal funding assistance.
According to records obtained by the Mercury, VDOE’s deadline to submit a report with all of the certifications was extended to April 24.

The agreement stated that the U.S. DOE “will not initiate enforcement action, investigation or otherwise take action” based on any state or school division’s certification, lack of certification, or communication with the federal agency regarding the certification until after the April 24 deadline has passed.
Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for Civil Rights, said in an April 3 statement that federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right. 
“When state education commissioners accept federal funds, they agree to abide by federal antidiscrimination requirements. Unfortunately, we have seen too many schools flout or outright violate these obligations, including by using DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics in clear violation of Title VI,” Trainor said.
The administration’s efforts are facing fierce pushback from the National Education Association as well as civil rights groups including the NAACP. On April 24, a federal judge in Maryland temporarily blocked enforcement of the federal education department’s certification directive, and the same day, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted an injunction to the same effect.

[…]","The North Carolina Legislative Building (Photo: Clayton Henkel) For average citizens whose knowledge of the lawmaking process stems mostly from snippets of TV coverage of Congress, a grade school field trip, or attendance at a city council or local school board meeting, witnessing the machinations of the North Carolina legislature up close and personal for the first time is often a surprising experience.
A congressional committee’s vetting of a single bill often takes more than one meeting of several hours each and features panels of expert witnesses reading pages of lengthy and painstakingly prepared testimony, often followed by lengthy questioning and speech-making from lawmakers and committee staff.
City council and school board gatherings may not be so grand or highfalutin, but they often run late into the night as constituents come forward to oppose or support a proposed ordinance or policy change.
In contrast, the process in Raleigh is almost always remarkably quick and informal.
Indeed, a typical General Assembly committee’s public consideration of a bill – even a proposal of some substance and controversy – often takes just a few minutes. A committee meeting might proceed as follows:
First, the members of a committee gather at an appointed one-hour time slot. The meeting often takes place in a small, crowded, sometimes windowless and spartan room that features a narrow horseshoe of tables for lawmakers to sit at arm-to-arm, and a few rows of general seating for the public and media members. Often, legislators trail in after the proceedings have commenced and depart early.
And for the next 50-or-so minutes, the committee chair leads the group of perhaps 10-20 members through the list of scheduled bills. One-by-one, bill sponsors troop to the front of the room, explain the bill in a couple of minutes – sometimes accurately, sometimes not so much — and ask for support. During busy times of the year – like the current silly season that’s underway right now – each meeting’s agenda could include as many as a dozen or more bills.
Sometimes, there are a few questions, comments or a bit of professional staff input, sometimes not. Often, the legislation — almost all of which is sponsored by Republicans since Democratic proposals seldom get a hearing in the GOP-dominated legislature – will be approved on a voice vote in just a minute or two.
Occasionally, a member of the public – a lobbyist, a government agency staffer, an average citizen – will ask to speak. Sometimes they will be granted permission – often with an air of impatience from the chair — and sometimes not. Normally, while they are speaking, a sergeant-at-arms staff person will hover close by, assuring that they do not exceed the time allotted to speakers – usually just two minutes, or sometimes one
Speakers who oppose bills favored by the chair tend to get a faster hook.
Sometimes, amendments or rewritten versions of bills known as “committee substitutes” will be hastily crafted and adopted on the fly. At other times, bills are quickly okayed with a vague proviso directing staff to incorporate “clarifying” amendments before the bill goes to the floor, or when it gets to another committee.
And that’s basically it.
That’s how important and frequently complex new state statutes – statutes that create new crimes, alter which toxic chemicals are and aren’t permissible to release, or amend what can and can’t be done in public schools – are vetted.
And right now, as lawmakers hurtle toward their self-imposed May 8 “crossover deadline” – the date by which many bills must be approved in one house in order to be eligible for consideration in the other one this year – the process is at what is arguably its chaotic worst. In the coming days, look for scores — perhaps hundreds — of bills to be summarily whisked through committee and House or Senate floor votes based on little more than a sponsor’s general description and the hope that the other house may figure out a way to pay more attention.
As the old saying goes, it’s a crazy way to run a railroad. Whether, however, there is a better and truly feasible way to run things is very much an open question.
A legislature that lacked artificial deadlines would presumably have more time to dissect legislation, hear from genuine experts, and better understand what it was voting on – as might a legislature that committed to listening to public testimony for more than 60 or 120 seconds at a time. Mandating detailed explanations from professional legislative staff for every bill considered and requiring a week’s public notice before a bill could be considered would help as well.
But, of course, remedies that promote transparency, hard questions and public input tend to take more time, drive up costs and, most importantly, diminish the power of the people running the show behind the scenes. So don’t hold your breath.
For now, the best chance for many important bills to receive something closer to the thorough vetting they deserve likely rests with the Gov. Josh Stein and, ultimately, the chance that Democrats on Jones Street will stick together long enough to make any vetoes he might issue stick. Stay tuned. A mostly relatively low energy session is about to shift into high gear.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NC_Legislature_PhotoChenkel-1024x720.jpg,,,2025-04-29 06:00:33.008936

(Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)Ohio lawmakers appear to have a deal on a wide-ranging energy bill meant to increase power production in the state. They’re returning from a two-week recess with an amendment sanding off the differences between House and Senate proposals approved last month.
The Senate Energy Committee meets Tuesday to introduce the changes and likely put them to vote. Both chambers will be in session the following day and could presumably vote on final passage in back-to-back sessions.
The proposal offers tax breaks for companies investing in power plants and retools the ratemaking process for energy distribution companies. To further encourage new entrants, the measure reinforces barriers keeping the regulated monopolies running distribution out of the production market.
Where the tweaks land
From the outset, House and Senate lawmakers have worked along parallel tracks advancing similar, although not identical, versions of the same bill. Several core ideas have persisted throughout, like eliminating the coal plant rider from 2019’s HB 6.
Along the way, lawmakers proposed a few sideline initiatives. The House bill included a pilot for small cooperative power generation facilities; the Senate added in a program loaning schools money for renewable energy improvements. The Senate’s idea survived. The House’s didn’t.
For other provisions, the chambers offered different responses to the same question. The proposals incentivize investment with a tax break. Tangible personal property tax gets levied on the equipment used to generate electricity. The House proposed reducing the rate from about 25% to 7%. Senators meanwhile suggested eliminating it altogether for equipment brought online after 2025.
The amendment goes with the 7% mark and includes provisions to discourage companies from claiming the reduced rate after making modest changes or upgrades to existing facilities.
Another major element of the legislation has to do with the regulatory timeline. Critics argue Ohio’s ratemaking process takes longer than most other states, so lawmakers proposed a “shot clock” for those decisions. The House set the ceiling at 360 days, but the Senate’s 320-day deadline is the one carried forward in the amendment.
Cutting room floor
A last-minute change to what qualifies as a ‘major’ facility isn’t included in the amendment. House lawmakers lowered the cut-off for electric transmission lines to put more of them under the Ohio Power Siting Board’s authority. Critics argued those investments get very little oversight and offer a path for utilities to over-charge customers for the upgrades.
Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis is urging lawmakers to “reconsider” a different provision related to consumer refunds.
“When we say ‘reconsider’ we mean delete it,” her written testimony states.
If the state Supreme Court determines a charge was unlawful, the legislation allows consumer refunds for any of those charges collected after the court decision. Willis questioned the idea of barring refunds on charges determined to be illegal.
What’s more, she argued “it may have the unintended effect of interfering with consumer refunds in pending appeals where charges have been collected ’subject to refund.’”
One such case against Dayton-area AES Ohio is currently working through the appeals process. Because state regulators approved a $76 million charge — subject to refund, the Consumers’ Counsel case could return more than $300 to each customer. But if the amendment’s cut off is in place, those refunds would be in jeopardy.
“The current refund provisions risk perpetuating past injustices where consumers bore the cost of unlawful utility charges without remedy,” Willis wrote.

Within the commonwealth, however, wealth is common.
Though no fewer than 48 American racetracks have closed since 2000, Kentucky operators continue to invest hundreds of millions in their facilities and are reaping an outsized return, and not only on the first Saturday in May.
For instance:
Churchill Downs Inc. reported record net revenue ($2.7 billion) and net income ($427 million) for 2024.
Keeneland’s September Yearling Sale netted a record $427.9 million.
The 2006 races run in Kentucky in 2024 paid an average purse of $112,648, 20% higher than the second most lucrative state (Arkansas).
September’s seven-day all-grass meet at Kentucky Downs in Franklin paid out $490,789 per race, easily the highest total ever recorded at a North American track.
“Retreat to Kentucky if you want a future in racing,” California horseplayer Andy Asaro tweeted on April 15. “Things are moving fast.”

Beyond the Bluegrass, things are moving mostly in reverse. Jockey Club data shows the number of Thoroughbred races run in the United States has dropped by more than 50% since 1995, and the size of the national foal crop has been falling even faster, from 34,358 in 2007 to an estimated 16,675 last year. The Sonoma County Fair recently announced it will forego live racing for the first time since 1936 because of a shrinking supply of horses in Northern California. Last month, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled the state’s historical horse racing machines unconstitutional, prompting Churchill Downs Inc. to project a 25% cut in purses at its Fair Grounds racetrack.
 Slots-lite a double-edged sword

Meanwhile, “decoupling” legislation that could free Florida gaming operators of the obligation to stage live racing as a condition of their licenses has been stalled, but may only represent a temporary reprieve from redevelopment of major tracks. The Stronach Group’s 1/ST Racing, which owns Gulfstream and Santa Anita, has threatened to sell both tracks while showing a pronounced inclination to divest rather than invest in its properties. Last year, the company closed Golden Gate Fields near San Francisco and cut a deal that turned over Baltimore’s Pimlico, the home of the Preakness Stakes, to the state of Maryland.
Against this gloomy backdrop, and in contrast to its own contentious closure of Arlington Park near Chicago, Churchill Downs Inc. continues to spend aggressively on its flagship track. Plans for new capital projects with a projected cost of $920 million were put on pause last Wednesday, ostensibly in response to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and trade disputes,  but recent improvements to the paddock and the addition of Homestretch Club and Turn One Experience cost in excess of $300 million and speak to management’s long-term bullishness.
While these investments are largely attributable to the singular appeal of the Kentucky Derby, they also reflect the thoroughbred industry’s political influence in Frankfort and, in turn, the gushing revenue stream historical horse racing (HHR) terminals have unleashed.
Since their 2011 introduction at Kentucky Downs, the slot-like historical horse racing terminals have reinvigorated racing in the state. Programmed to pay out based on the results of races previously run, Kentucky’s HHR machines generated more than $9.6 billion in handle during the 2024 fiscal year, accounting for $99 in bets for every $1 wagered live at the state’s thoroughbred and standardbred tracks.
They contributed $55.5 million to Kentucky’s Thoroughbred Development Fund during that 12-month period, fueling the growth of purses that have more than doubled since 2017. Consequently, Eric Hamelback, CEO of the National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, refers to HHR’s proliferation as racing’s “golden ticket.”

When HHR’s legality was challenged in 2018, Ellis Park General Manager Jeffery Inman said the loss of that revenue would “likely threaten the very survival of one of Kentucky’s iconic racing venues.” Though opposition was vocal, it was handily outvoted. Attorney Ryan Roark, in an article published in the Kentucky Law Journal, wrote that the legislature settled on a definition of pari-mutuel wagering “not shared by anyone outside Kentucky … to allow for the powerful horse industry to exclusively run their slot-like gaming systems.”
The result, says Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen, has been a “juggernaut.” According to the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, gross HHR commissions for Churchill Downs’ two Derby City Gaming locations exceeded $224 million for the 2024 fiscal year, nearly 12 times the total commissions from on-track wagering at all of the state’s racetracks.
To the extent this disparity underscores the industry’s reliance on revenue sources that require no physical horses, it inevitably raises questions about racing’s sustainability and the best use of its real estate.

“Racing is on life support in Southern California, Florida, Delaware, Pennsylvania etc. and exists almost everywhere else only with the support of non-racing revenues from slots, casinos and state supplements,” Kenwood Racing founder H. Robb Levinsky wrote in a January letter to Thoroughbred Daily News. “Instead of embracing innovative ideas to make the sport more attractive to a new generation of racing fans and owners, the focus continues to be on protecting those non-racing revenues. An industry where 80-90% of purse money comes from slots instead of wagering on the core product is simply not viable in the long run.”
 Signs of progress in New York, Maryland

In the short run, at least, the growth of Kentucky’s purses has led to a higher quality of horses competing in the state, more interest among bettors and a breeding boom running contrary to national trends. As Ed DeRosa documented for Horse Racing Nation, Kentucky passed both California and Florida in total handle in 2024 after trailing both states annually since 2007.
“We’re the only jurisdiction (among the top four states) that has grown since 2020,” said Chauncey Morris, executive director of the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association. “The rest have contracted.”
And as cash incentives for Kentucky-breds have increased, so has the state’s share of registered foals. When HHR was introduced at Kentucky Downs in 2011, Kentucky produced 29.2% of the national foal crop. In 2023, the most recent year for which statistics are available, it was 42.2%.
  Damon Thayer (LRC Public Information)
“In states where racing has a good relationship with state legislators, racing is in good shape,” said consultant Damon Thayer, formerly the Kentucky Senate’s majority floor leader. “In states where they have not cultivated a long-term relationship with the legislature, horse racing is either in a declining state, a crisis state or a questionable state.”
In addition to Kentucky, there are pockets of progress. New York and Maryland have committed nearly a billion dollars to renovations at Belmont Park and Pimlico. Multiple industry executives cited developments in Wyoming, the nation’s last populous state, as a basis for bullishness. Yet their optimism is tempered by unsolved problems in larger locales, including the most populous state, California.
Without supplemental income from other forms of gambling, California’s racing and breeding businesses have been contracting for decades. Efforts to enhance purses through HHR remain at the discussion stage in view of Native American tribes’ virtual monopoly on the state’s casino gaming. Unless some accommodation can be reached, racing columnist Ray Paulick warns, “racing in California is history.”
“You can put 1,000 HHRs in at Santa Anita and it would change California racing overnight,” Thayer said. “They’d be wildly popular. You’d direct the money to purses and breeders reward programs and it would be a huge success. It seems like some sort of attempt should be made to cut a deal with the Indians and convince them that 1,000 HHRs at Santa Anita is not going to damage their land-based casinos. . .
“Like Cyndi Lauper used to say, money changes everything.”

Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”

Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
‘Generational change’ to taxes
While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Blue and red states slash taxes despite warnings of hard times ahead

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
An uneven tax burden
Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

As outside temperatures dropped to the low- to mid-teens Fahrenheit on Feb. 10, 2025, two children died of carbon monoxide toxicity in a family van parked in a Detroit casino parking garage.
We are political scientists who study urban and housing public policies, and in the months since this tragedy, we took a deep look at the trends in homelessness and housing policies that foreshadowed the events of that night.
 More kids are experiencing homelessness

One important trend is that the number of homeless children in the city reached a record high in 2024. This is true even though the overall numbers of people experiencing homelessness in the city is declining overall. 
According to the Point-in-Time count, 455 children were experiencing homelessness in Detroit on Jan. 31, 2024, up from 312 the year before. The count captures data for one night each year.
Most of these children were unhoused but considered sheltered because they had a place to sleep in an emergency shelter or transitional housing, or were able to temporarily stay with family or friends.
Nineteen of the kids were unsheltered – meaning they were sleeping in places not designed for human habitation, like cars, parks or abandoned buildings.
A different set of data comes from the Detroit Public Schools. The district looked at the entire 2022-2023 school year and found that roughly 1 in 19 students were unhoused at some point during that nine-month period — more than double the number in the 2019-2020 school year.

 A lack of temporary solutions

The lack of adequate funding and staffing in the city’s shelter system means unhoused people often struggle to access temporary shelter beds.
That includes kids. Even though the city prioritizes giving beds to the most vulnerable, the number of unsheltered children of school age has nearly tripled in three years, rising from an estimated 48 in the school year beginning in September 2019 to 142 in the school year beginning in September 2022. These figures align with the rise in unsheltered children recorded in the one-night Point-in-Time count, which increased from four in 2016 to 19 in 2024.
The end of COVID-era funding that prevented many evictions is likely to increase the need for shelter and put additional strain on Detroit’s response to the crisis.
 Gaps in a vital system

Children who experience housing insecurity are often caught in the middle of bureaucracy and failed regulation.
The mother of the children who died in February had reached out to the city in November 2024 when they were staying with a family member. The mother noted that she wanted to keep all five of her children together.
According to a report issued by the city, the Detroit Housing Authority did not follow up with her. Her situation was not considered an emergency at the time of contact since she was sheltered with family.
At the time of the call, the family was a Category 2: immediate risk of homelessness – in other words, not the highest priority under the emergency shelter grants guideline. If the city had deemed the situation an emergency, protocol would be to dispatch immediate support for the family.
The mother moved her family to the van after the request for help failed to provide a solution.
The Detroit mayor’s office admitted that the family fell through the cracks and promised to expand available shelter beds and require homeless outreach employees to visit any unhoused families that call for help.
“We have to make sure that we do everything possible to make sure that this doesn’t happen again,” Deputy Mayor Melia Howard told local media.
 More than 8 in 10 placed on wait list

According to records from the Coordinated Assessment Model Detroit, the system responsible for connecting individuals to shelters, 82% of calls do not result in immediate help but rather being placed on a shelter waitlist. Similar to instances across the country, the wait time is long.
Families in Detroit face an average wait of 130 days, while unaccompanied youth typically wait around 50 days.
The long wait for shelter has contributed to the rise in people living on the streets or in their vehicles. The number of unsheltered individuals — including both adults and children — doubled from 151 in 2015 to 305 in 2024. This trend of increasing unsheltered homelessness contrasts with the overall decline in the total number of homeless people in the city, which is down from a peak of 2,597 in 2015.

Children need safety and security to thrive.
Their access to stable housing depends on their parents and what the adults in their life are able to provide. As rents increase in the city, some children are left vulnerable.
 Stricter regulations

Over the past decade, Detroit, like many other U.S. cities, has experienced rising housing costs while wages fail to keep up, particularly for long-term residents.
Since 2021, the number of rentals in the city has increased by 51%.
Rents are also up. Since 2017, the average rent in Detroit has increased 55% for single-family homes and 43% for multifamily homes.
While inflation and increased maintenance costs contribute to this rise, stricter rental regulations like the heightened enforcement of housing codes, expanded tenant protections and higher compliance cost for landlords have played an important role.
Some landlords pass the expense of these regulations on to tenants, making housing less affordable. Others leave their properties vacant, pushing up prices by lessening the supply.
The current average fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Detroit is $1,314 per month. For the typical household in the city, this basic shelter cost, not including utilities, makes up 41% of the household income.
For the lowest-income households, any unexpected expense can disrupt a delicate financial balance and lead to eviction and homelessness. Children in these situations often face major instability, moving between shelters – or, as in the case of the children who died in February, sleeping in cars.
This kind of displacement disrupts education, strains mental health and increases exposure to danger.
Detroit’s stricter housing regulations may have improved conditions for some renters, but a report by Outlier Media shows that only 8% of landlords are in compliance, leaving legacy residents in subpar rentals at higher prices.
And these new rules have victims who are too often ignored until tragedy strikes.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) The Legislature’s Transportation Committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing Tuesday afternoon for a swath of bills related to the Maine State Ferry Service, which has been wrestling with staff shortages, cancellations and other disruptions in recent years.
Last summer, leaders from six island communities wrote to Gov. Janet Mills asking her to help address the frequent ferry service cancellations, which were due in part to ongoing staffing challenges. The state ferry service connects six Midcoast island communities to the mainland. 
The Maine Department of Transportation also raised fares for the first time in five years last August. Though service reliability reportedly improved by the fall, the department was considering another fare hike this coming summer. 
While two of the proposals before the Legislature seek to expand the services to Matinicus Isle and Monhegan Island, there are multiple bills trying to address the operational issues that have plagued passengers in recent years. 
There are also proposals looking to address where ferries are docked each night, such as a bipartisan bill from House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor). LD 1231 would require the department to dock a ferry that carries vehicles overnight in Swan’s Island, Vinalhaven, North Haven and Islesboro for emergency medical, fire and law enforcement needs. 
The bill was introduced after the ferry service announced late last year that it was considering docking all of its ferries on the mainland overnight and instead providing emergency boats to serve the islands during that time. This potential shift from the decades-long practice of having boats spend the night at island ports to help islanders with medical emergencies reach hospitals raised concern among residents. 
The Hancock County Emergency Management Agency submitted written testimony in support of LD 1231, saying that having a ferry overnight on Swan’s Island has been “beneficial in innumerable instances over the many decades, aiding in all public safety operations to and for our at-risk, Hancock County offshore island communities of Swan’s Island and Frenchboro.”
Rep. Ann Matlack (D-St. George) will have a related bill before the committee that would allow a ferry to dock overnight at an island port or the mainland, while allowing the department to require a vessel to dock in a particular location for an emergency situation such as extreme weather. 
Increasing oversight and staff stipends
Several lawmakers are introducing proposals to increase oversight of ferry service operations, which are currently subject to an advisory board made up of one person from each of the islands served by the ferry service and three members representing the mainland communities. 
One bill, LD 1680 introduced by Rep. Holly Eaton (D-Deer Isle), would establish an independent committee that would be charged with ensuring accountability and transparency around key decisions for the ferry service. 
Similarly, Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock) is introducing legislation that would require the ferry service to consult with the Maine State Ferry Advisory Board, which advises the Department of Transportation on matters related to the service, for budget matters, strategic planning and major operational decisions. LD 1731 would also require the ferry service to provide regular reports to the advisory board for review and feedback. 
As for the employee recruitment and retention issues that have plagued the ferry service, Rep. Michael Ray (D-Lincolnville) is proposing an annual stipend to all employees starting January 2026 equal to $5 per hour for the total hours worked in the previous year. LD 1268 also stipulates that the department can’t raise tolls to pay for the stipend. 
This comes after the department has already implemented other stipends and incentive programs providing up to $4,000 in bonus pay and increased overtime for ferry crews to combat the staff shortages. Workers have said they can make more money crewing ferries elsewhere, so there’s little incentive to stay and work in Maine.
Sen. Anne Beebe-Center (D-Knox) has a bill seeking to offer lifetime ferry passes for retired state ferry employees. LD 280 would provide two round trips per month for a passenger and a vehicle. 
The transportation committee is also scheduled to hear from Rep. Gary Friedmann (D-Bar Harbor) on his legislation (LD 1477) to provide an exemption from pilotage requirements for passenger ferry services between Bar Harbor, Maine, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire spends more per public school student than all but five other states, according to a new report. At $22,252 spent per pupil on average in the 2023-2024 school year, it was surpassed by only New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Connecticut. 
It’s a statistic that has been true for years, and one that Gov. Kelly Ayotte has frequently touted. 
“If you put together the total education funding from state and local and other sources, we’re in the top 10 in the nation in terms of funding public education,” she said during a Jan. 15 press conference, responding to a pair of lawsuits alleging the state does not spend enough. 
“… That’s the reality. Shouldn’t we look at the reality of the situation versus an artificial discussion on one piece of the funding?”
But the way New Hampshire raises that money sets it apart. Despite its high overall spending, the Granite State contributed the smallest proportion of state dollars and the largest proportion of local dollars per student of all 50 states in the same school year, the report, released by the National Education Association Tuesday, states. 
New Hampshire spent proportionally less state money per student than Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, Louisiana New York, Florida, Connecticut, Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, the next nine lowest-ranked states. 
The report confirms what residents of all political stripes have long known to be true: New Hampshire’s schools are driven by local property tax collections, not state spending. And it comes against the backdrop of an ongoing fight in the state budget process over how much public school students should receive each year for education — and who should pay for it. 
Democrats and progressives cite the low level of state support as evidence that the state is abandoning its financial responsibilities and downshifting costs to local taxpayers, and say the state should spend more. School districts and taxpayers have filed two separate lawsuits seeking to force the state to do so. 
But conservatives point to the state’s aging population and steadily declining enrollment to question why the school districts should receive more funding at all. And this year, House Republicans have pushed forward proposals to reduce the amount of state tax revenue that is sent to the Education Trust Fund and impose spending caps on school districts to require supermajorities to raise local spending.
Overall, New Hampshire schools spent 6.64% more per student at the start of the 2023-2024 school year than at the start of the 2022-2023 school year, the report shows. 
Each side has drawn different conclusions from the same reality. Those conclusions have inspired competing legislation.
House Republicans have proposed a slight increase in state spending to schools in the state budget. But they have also included a measure in the budget to reduce the amount of revenue that goes to the Education Trust Fund, from the $1.3 billion a year proposed by Ayotte to $937 million per year. That account, which funds public schools and other programs such as education freedom accounts, is currently running a surplus.
House Republicans have also added legislation into the budget that would limit school district budget increases to inflation, except in the case of a certain level of enrollment growth or a supermajority vote by residents at the district’s annual meeting. 
Democrats, meanwhile, have opposed that legislation and pushed for various bills to increase the amount the state would spend per pupil overall, add targeted funding to needier school districts, and require wealthier school districts to redistribute excess statewide property tax revenue to those with lower property values. 
The NEA report shows a number of other comparison points between New Hampshire and other states. 
Across the U.S., New Hampshire saw one of the highest year-to-year drops in enrollment from the start of the 2022-2023 school year to the start of the 2023-2024 school year: a 1.47% decline. In contrast, neighboring Maine experienced a 0.9 percent enrollment decline, Vermont saw enrollment stay steady, and Massachusetts measured a 0.1 percent increase. 
But New Hampshire has the second-lowest student-to-teacher ratio in the country, after Vermont, the report states. There are on average 10.5 students per teacher in New Hampshire schools; Wyoming, in contrast, was last with 12.6 students per teacher. 
In the 2022-2023 school year, there were 10.7 students per teacher. New Hampshire’s 2.19% drop in student-to-teacher ratio is one of the largest in the country. 
Public school teacher pay in the Granite State is nearly at the national median. New Hampshire teachers made an average of $67,170 per year in 2023-2024, which ranked 24th nationally, according to the report. That amount is up by 4.7% from the year before. 
And the report indicates a wide spread of how much per year states spend on public school students. New Hampshire’s $22,252 in the 2023-2024 school year was dwarfed by New York’s $31,514, but came in well ahead of 50th-ranked Utah, which spent $11,289 per student.
Since taking office, President Donald Trump has vowed to dismantle the Department of Education and send the federal grant money back to states in the form of block grants, which has led to mixed reactions in the Granite State. But in New Hampshire, federal spending makes up just 8.4% of per pupil spending, the 45th lowest proportion in the country.

North Carolinians are generally of two very different minds on the gun violence that plagues our society. While polls consistently show that most favor stronger laws to regulate firearms, a loud and determined minority opposes virtually any regulation.
Here, however, is at least one simple prevention step that all sides should be able to endorse: installing inside locks on the doors to college classrooms.
As NC State professor Walter Robinson explained in a recent NC Newsline op-ed, he and his faculty colleagues have repeatedly asked school leaders to install locks in all classrooms and lecture halls so that instructors and students can shelter in place in the event of a campus shooting.
Unfortunately, and amazingly, however, the requests have been rejected. The reason: cost.
And it’s hard to overstate just how absurd this is.
The bottom line: In a multi-billion dollar system, it’s ridiculous that university leaders didn’t long ago invest in such a simple and basic safety precaution. Further delay is inexcusable.

That plant — the Merrimack Power Station in Bow, N.H., just south of Concord — is slated to close in June 2028.
So it stands to reason that President Donald J. Trump’s recent series of executive orders, designed to make greater use of coal for electricity and fire up a rapidly dying industry in the U.S., would elicit a collective shrug from the region.
Not from Connecticut.
Connecticut, more than any state east of the Mississippi, has faced persistent poor air quality. It is caused in large part by emissions from power plants in the central part of the country — especially the more than 200 that are coal-fired, the most polluting form of energy generation.
Paul Farrell, director of planning and standards in the Air Division of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, DEEP, is certainly not shrugging.
Modeling from the Environmental Protection Agency, he said, has shown that on days Connecticut has its worst ozone pollution — the notorious smog and dirty air that occurs in the heat of summer — 90% to 95% of the air that flows into the state is already above the federal standard for pollution levels when it gets here.
“We get that long range transport from the Midwest and Western states and even Texas,” he said. “Then that combines with vehicular pollution coming up the I-95 corridor, and it all comes to a head right over New York City, that adds that pollution load into it. And then it just wafts into our state.”
Indeed, the just-released 2025 State of the Air report by the American Lung Association, ranks Southwestern Connecticut as having the 16th worst ozone pollution in the country. Four of Connecticut’s eight counties receive F grades for ozone, three receive D grades and one manages a C.
The state had 23 days last year with ozone levels above allowable federal standards. That’s the highest number recorded in recent years. Only the northern and eastern parts of the state meets 2008 ozone standards. No part of the state meets the tighter 2015 standards.

The Trump administration has given exemptions to about 70 coal plants to continue operating under the current emissions standards for at least another couple of years beyond 2027, when tighter emissions regulations put in place by the Biden administration are slated to take effect.  Among the plants that are exempt are many of the midwestern and mid-Atlantic plants directly upwind from Connecticut, as well as several plants that are the most polluting plants in the country. 
New Hampshire’s Merrimack is also on the list — a head-scratcher even to its owner, Granite Shore Power; they never requested an exemption because they already have one. With closure slated for 2028, the government didn’t require expensive pollution upgrades for that short time period.
“Without this [earlier] exemption, Merrimack Station would have been forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for monitoring equipment for a plant that will be closing months later,” a spokesman for Granite Shore said in an email statement. 
The spokesman said there is no plan to delay Merrimack’s closing, which the Trump actions would also allow. Plans to transition the plant to a solar and storage operation remain on schedule, and the coal operation will continue to comply with emissions requirements.
In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin issued a series of 31 environmental regulations the administration wanted to revisit and/or rollback. Included among them was one that set stricter limits on mercury and air toxics standards, or MATS, for coal- and oil-fired power plants. The standards he targeted were finalized a year ago by the Biden administration and would have cut emissions of mercury, which is known to cause several human health problems, carbon dioxide — a key climate change contributor — nitrogen oxide, fine particulate matter and a number of metals.
“What I foresee is that this two-year extension is but a first step of a two-step process that Lee Zeldin is orchestrating with the result being that these plants don’t have to make a single more ton or pound of pollution reductions,” said Joseph Goffman, assistant administrator of the EPA Office of Air and Radiation during the Biden administration. He said Zeldin’s plan to “reconsider” the MATS rule “was his way of telegraphing very, very, very unsubtly that his intention was to have the reconsideration process result in the rules being repealed altogether.”
The extension of lifelines to coal is just one of the rule rollbacks and reconsiderations proposed by the Trump EPA that could have an impact on air quality in Connecticut.
Among the most concerning is reconsideration of the Good Neighbor Plan, which would have forced 23 states upwind from Connecticut to reduce interstate transport of air pollution from power plants and other polluting industries. It is currently under a stay the Supreme Court issued last June when the justices sent it back down to lower courts. The federal Clean Air Act itself, now more than 55 years old, contains a good neighbor provision to limit interstate transport of air pollutants.
Another would reconsider the standards for motor vehicle tailpipe emissions the Biden administration tightened for cars, light and heavy-duty trucks. That has DEEP’s Farrell even more concerned than the specter of prolonged coal plant emissions.
“Without a doubt, the biggest public health/air quality impact would come from EPA significantly rolling back the mobile source standards on cars and trucks,” he said. The transportation sector accounts for the bulk of Connecticut’s pollution and ozone problems — about 67%. That’s partly because the region has eliminated coal.
“To address transport, we need a serious federal partner,” Farrell said. “Without the federal government controlling federal sources that are beyond any state’s jurisdiction, we don’t have a hope for meeting our air quality standards for ozone.”
The Trump executive action also opens the door to new coal plants. But the notion that the region would use coal again — even as a backup or in one of the existing power plants that can use more than one fuel — isn’t getting much traction here.
“Absolutely not,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association. “No. And I can underline that and an exclamation point. No. The dual fuel facilities that do exist are now gas and oil.”
The only exception in the region is the Merrimack Plant and its sister plant – the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, N.H., which no longer operates and will be redeveloped as a battery energy storage system.
“I see no future for coal in New England once those facilities permanently retire in the next few years,” Dolan said.
New England began its large-scale pullback from coal in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The last of the plants save Merrimack — the Bridgeport Harbor Station along with Salem, Brayton Point and Mt. Tom stations in Massachusetts — closed more recently.
Coal broadly is on the decline. Its use in the U.S. for power generation has fallen by about 67% since 2007, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. Its use fell below gas 10 years ago and is now only about one-third of gas.
In the last couple of years coal usage has also fallen below nuclear power, with wind closing in and hydro and solar not far behind. Wind and solar combined overtook coal usage last year for the first time, according to the energy think tank, Ember.

The biggest reason for coal’s decline in the U.S. is widely ascribed to one factor — it’s been priced out by cheap natural gas brought on by the fracking revolution which started around 2005.
“This was not the U.S. government saying ‘shut down these coal plants,’” said Michael Oristaglio, an energy expert at Yale University who founded the Energy Studies Multidisciplinary program and more recently is with the Carbon Containment Lab at Yale. “This was utility, power company owners basically looking at it and saying, ‘does it make sense to build coal or even to use coal anymore? You can convert a coal plant to natural gas.’”
Multiple analyses show coal plants to be among the more expensive forms of power. They are also slower to start up than gas, making them less suitable than gas for emergency — so-called peaker — power. 
“I can see the ones that own these old plants … saying, ‘all right, we have a little more leeway to run them.’ But I don’t see anyone building new coal,” Oristaglio said.
The U.S. does have the largest coal reserves, but China continues to use and build the most coal power, some of it in other nations. Oristaglio also said China recently has been adding carbon capture and other filter equipment to its newer plants, something that may be less worthwhile on the much older plants in the U.S. Ironically, China also has more utility-scale solar than any other country.

But with the economic and environmental focus, the issue that often gets overlooked is the outsized health impacts of pollution from coal plants. Research presented in the publication Science determined the number of U.S. deaths from 1999 to 2020 attributable to particulate matter from coal represented a more-than two times greater mortality risk than exposure to the same fine particulates from all sources.
But there are many more pollutants in coal and the effect is cumulative, said Goffman, the former EPA official.
“What’s at stake for public health is the fact that cumulatively, and so simultaneously, people are exposed to multiple pollutants, whether they’re part of fine particles or mercury or other air toxics or ozone,” he said.
“What we’re driving towards is improved public health outcomes. So I think that often gets lost. I think in the air quality story — it’s really about public health,” said Emma Cimino, DEEP’s deputy commissioner of environmental quality.
While DEEP points out that air pollution in Connecticut is vastly diminished from what it was decades ago, with so many rule rollbacks under consideration, the concern is that the strains on health might become more noticeable.
“As you start to see those tools disappear or be pulled back or even threatened, I think it’s possible that the progress slows,” Cimino said. “Hopefully it doesn’t reverse, but certainly it puts the region on a much slower track to meeting our air quality standards.”
Farrell at DEEP agreed. “At the end of the day, really we want to just remind people that this is about public health,” he said. “It’s really an all-the-above sort of solution. We can’t pick just power plants. We can’t pick just cars. You can’t just pick industrials. Everyone needs to contribute to the solution.
“I think people may have taken the environment and public health a little bit for granted, and we really shouldn’t be in a position where we need to wait for rivers to catch on fire again before we wake up and say, ‘wait a minute – this has to stop.’”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP676787172687-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 05:01:17.847767

A new GOP proposal lays the groundwork for digital tokens to become more mainstream.
With the stock market’s volatility, investment experts suggest diversifying your portfolio. Ohio politicians are trying to give more incentives for that, too.
“We are authorizing the use of cryptocurrency as just another way to keep up with the current practices that are generally accepted by the American public and by the people of the state of Ohio,” State Treasurer Robert Sprague said.
Sprague and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose are trying to show the state is “an innovative leader,” eventually allowing Ohioans to use it to pay for state fees and services, like taxes.
The pair is proposing that state agencies be allowed to accept crypto, but it is not mandatory.
Although it could eventually get to taxes, it would start slower with just the secretary’s office, meaning business filings.
“My office is prepared to be the first in state government to begin accepting Bitcoin and to do so immediately,” LaRose said.
So, what exactly is cryptocurrency?
Crypto is a “peer-to-peer digital currency, and it’s outside of an independent central governing authority,” Case Western Reserve University Veale Institute for Entrepreneurship’s Michael Goldberg said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe professor explained that the online “coins” are stored in a digital database known as a blockchain. Like stocks, they can be traded and sold. One Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fluctuates and was worth more than $94,000 as of 6 p.m. on Friday.
“Oftentimes with Bitcoin, there are less fees associated with it,” he said.
Two other crypto proposals are being heard in the Ohio House, with one trying to make sure that fees stay low. Both sponsored by state Rep, Steve Demetriou, R-Bainbridge Twp., one bill would “protect” cryptocurrency from putting certain taxes on it. The other would allow the treasurer to invest in “high value digital assets” in the general or reserve fund.
But because crypto spikes and falls rapidly, Goldberg warned that payments could be hard to calculate.


Government accountability advocate Catherine Turcer, with Common Cause Ohio, said this isn’t safe for the state’s finances.
“It is electronic money, anything could happen to it,” Turcer said. “Whether it’s hacking, deflation — when you pay on April 15 your taxes, and it nosedives on the 16th — it’s just too volatile.”
The treasurer explained that their system would immediately change the currency format once submitted.
“Our mission here is to have a thoughtful, safe and secure process for accepting this cryptocurrency and converting it immediately into United States dollars for the state treasury to hold,” Sprague said.
In 2024, the FBI reported $9.3 billion in losses due to cryptocurrency cybercrime.
There will always be financial fraud, Goldberg said, but when it’s online, it’s much more difficult to get back.
“Crypto is still a bit of the wild, wild west; it’s basically completely deregulated,” he said. “If somebody gets defrauded, it may be a bit more challenging for them to recoup their assets.”
It’s too risky, Turcer continued.
“Money is worth the money we say it’s worth,” she said.
Bitcoin is based on the dollar’s price, Goldberg said.
Asked whether the putting Bitcoin forward would undermine the U.S. dollar, Sprague paused, then said no.
“Having a digital asset like Bitcoin really doesn’t have anything to do with necessarily the value of the dollar,” he answered. “The number of dollars is fixed. Just because you’re allowing a transaction to occur in Bitcoin and then converting it to dollars will do nothing in terms of the strength or the weakness of the United States dollar.”
Flashbacks
This isn’t the first time the treasurer’s office tried to make crypto work.
Back in 2018, then-Treasurer Josh Mandel decided that Ohioans could pay their taxes in crypto. Within a year, the program was suspended because Attorney General Dave Yost issued an opinion that Mandel didn’t follow correct protocol in setting up the system.
“We’ll have a real process to this,” Sprague said in the recent press conference. “We’ll have a transparent process.”
Turcer is also getting reminded of the early 2000s, she said.
“We had alternative investments,” she said, referencing Coingate. “We were investing in rare coins — and you know what? The state of Ohio got ripped off.”
Coingate was a scam in which the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation invested hundreds of millions in “rare coins.” The investments were run by people aligned with the Ohio GOP. This eventually led to millions of dollars being lost and Gov. Bob Taft being the first Ohio governor charged with a crime while in office.
Crypto isn’t random, Goldberg said, and it’s been around — and profitable — for years. According to Forbes, the global cryptocurrency market cap is more than $3 trillion.
“When Bitcoin came out, I think there were a lot of questions,” Goldberg said. “And it’s held up.”
Why now?
Both Sprague and LaRose were asked if they or members of their staff own assets in cryptocurrency or if they invest in cryptocurrency-related companies.
“I wish,” Sprague laughed, and denied owning or investing in crypto.
“I do,” LaRose said. “I’m somebody that has been curious about this technology and this form of currency for a long time.”
He referenced financial disclosure documents, which are filed in May, that he said would show his financial involvement in crypto.
“I think at this point I own like $10,000 worth of Bitcoin that I’ve been able to amass by putting a little bit of my paycheck aside each month,” he said.
OCJ/WEWS requested his previous disclosures. None showed any crypto investments explicitly. He had only started investing in 2024, his team said on Friday.
LaRose isn’t the only politician who owns crypto and promotes it. President Donald Trump released his own coin, which just got a boost in the market since he offered a private dinner with him to the coin’s largest investors.
“It is interesting that (LaRose is) proposing this — it both curries favor with the president and could actually make him richer,” Turcer said. “The more people participate in the Bitcoin system, the more the value raises.”
The secretary argued that this is just to move the state forward.
“Ohioans have accepted this as a real form of currency, a form of exchange that they want to use,” he said.
Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is also a big fan of the currency. Both LaRose and Sprague have been on the campaign trail with him.
The two were asked how the measure fits in with any interests they have in becoming Ramaswamy’s pick for lieutenant governor. Sprague said he hadn’t talked to Ramaswamy about it.
“This is something that we’re working on, together, through our respective offices, to modernize our offices and make it easier for the people of the state of Ohio… So this is something we’re doing internally,” Sprague said. “We’re not doing this on the campaign trail.”
LaRose was less enthused with the question.

“I’m not gonna dignify any speculation about who Mr. Ramaswamy may or may not pick as his running mate,” he said, also saying he hadn’t spoken to the candidate about his proposal. “The reason I’m supporting him is because I appreciate his intellect and his policy stances and if this is something that he’s a fan of as well, that doesn’t surprise me.”
The Board of Deposit, which includes Sprague, Yost and Auditor Keith Faber, will meet in the coming weeks to review the proposal.

(File photo by Amanda Gokee/New Hampshire Bulletin)When we read or hear a claim repeated over and over again, we are more likely to think it is true even when it is not true. It’s called the illusory truth effect, and it’s why repetition is a fundamental tool used, yes, in politics, but especially in consumer product advertising. And more and more it’s being used by corporations to highlight their sunny side whenever the corporation’s reputation as a good corporate citizen comes into question.
A case in point is Casella’s recent campaign to convince New Hampshire that when it comes to the environment, Casella is one of the “good guys.” The company has unleashed what amounts to a public relations blitz, emphasizing its commitment to environmental sustainability.
Just in the last week Casella offered up a “Special Advertising Section” in New Hampshire Magazine titled “Casella Comes Full Circle for its Anniversary,” suggesting that though it started in the trash business it is now in the sustainability business. That comes on top of a number of other recent actions by the company, including a national press release announcing its “2024 Sustainability Report”; a mailer to residents of New Hampshire’s North Country titled “Driving Sustainability in NH”; and a $1.5 million donation to the University of Vermont for which the University gave it naming rights to establish the “Casella Center for Circular Economy and Sustainability at UVM.”
All this smacks of “greenwashing,” a practice roughly defined as a company using corporate money and its public relations apparatus to mislead people into believing that it is more environmentally friendly than it actually is.
Casella’s management and its directors may very well be committed to sustainability as a concept, but it is a huge stretch for the company to promote itself as being in the sustainability business. Casella’s core business is trash collection and landfilling, essentially the antithesis of sustainability. According to Casella’s most recent filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, only 20% of its revenues come from business activities (such as recycling) that are even remotely connected to sustainability.
And there is little to no indication that going forward Casella will focus on sustainability. It tells its investors that its growth will be fueled by acquisitions of trash collection service territories, necessitating the need for construction and/or expansion of new landfills across the Northeast.
Casella likes to talk about its origin story: It started in 1975 with one truck picking up trash in Rutland, Vermont. In 50 years it has grown to be a $7 billion corporation, with nearly $1.5 billion in annual revenue.
What the company does not like to talk about is all of the environmental problems it has created, and all of the enemies it has made along the way to becoming a $7 billion corporation.
Casella has trash operations all over the Northeast, but it is an especially big player in northern New England. In New Hampshire, it operates one of three major landfills — the NCES landfill in Bethlehem.
The NCES landfill has been beset by environmental problems. It was only recently discovered that holes in the landfill liner were created during the construction of the landfill some 30 years ago; the consequences for contamination of nearby water supplies and groundwater are as yet unknown. And it took Casella two full days to discover that the largest leachate spill in New England (150,000-plus gallons) occurred at NCES in 2021. Now four years later, the extent of soil and groundwater contamination from the accident is still under investigation.
These are not isolated incidents. New Hampshire’s Department of Environmental Services (DES) notified NCES that it had found hundreds of permit violations for leachate management during a recent two-year period. In contrast, DES found only a few handfuls of similar violations at other New Hampshire landfills, including Mount Carberry and Turnkey, which other than management competence are similar to NCES.
With that kind of record, it’s little wonder that Casella would want to use its public relations apparatus to bill itself as in the sustainability business. This is especially true given the fact that it has been trying for six years to bully our state to approve permits for it to build a new mega-landfill (the GSL project) in Dalton. It has even suggested that it would not invest in a newly planned recycling center in downstate New Hampshire unless it gets permits to build GSL.
It’s to our great good luck that we now have a governor who is standing up to that bullying, a redirected DES that is more focused on environmental protection, and an educated populace that is able to recognize greenwashing for what it is.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7508-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 05:01:17.847767

One of the largest utility scandals in U.S. history has remained largely unknown outside Ohio — until now.







Last week, HBO released a documentary that covers the long, sordid saga, which led to the federal criminal convictions of a former speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives and a former head of the Ohio Republican Party.


“The Dark Money Game: Ohio Confidential” follows the story of how utility companies used roughly $60 million in bribes to public officials to secure more than $1.5 billion in ratepayer subsidies for aging, uneconomical coal and nuclear plants.


Canary Media contributing reporter Kathiann Kowalski has spent more than a decade covering the House Bill 6 saga and Ohio utilities’ other efforts to get ratepayer-funded bailouts. Dan Haugen, a senior editor at Canary Media, recently spoke with Kowalski about her reactions to the new film.


The following transcript has been edited slightly for length and clarity.
Haugen: So, you watched this new HBO documentary ​“Ohio Confidential” the other day. What about it is still on your mind today? 


Kowalski: I was struck by the focus they used of how dark money and gerrymandering undermined voters’ will in the wake of a 2010 Supreme Court case that opened the door for unlimited corporate spending on political campaigns, subject to few conditions.


Haugen: Was there any factual information that wasn’t previously reported by you or others?


Kowalski: A lot of it was very familiar, given the fact that I had read through most of the exhibits, read Neil Clark’s book, gone to part of the trial, and been following this for years. There was an interesting scene where they were able to get footage of the FBI observing a private detective that former Ohio GOP Chair Matt Borges and company had apparently retained to follow Tyler Fehrman, who was a witness in the federal criminal case.


Haugen: Did the film change your understanding of the HB 6 story in any way? 













Kowalski: They did a decent job connecting some dots. I had not thought through how former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder’s actions also enabled a far-right coalition in the Legislature to push through an anti-abortion law in 2019. It gave me a broader perspective on the anti-democracy angle of the public corruption, but my understanding of the basic story did not change.


Haugen: Where did the abortion legislation appear on the timeline?


Kowalski: The way that the filmmaker presents it is that once Householder helped these people get the anti-abortion legislation passed, he then had people who felt they owed him something. I looked at the timing, and Gov. Mike DeWine signed the anti-abortion legislation the day before House Bill 6 was introduced.


Haugen: One of the biggest unknowns still today is what, if any, role the governor’s office had in all this. You and others have reported on a December 2018 dinner with FirstEnergy executives, DeWine, and Jon Husted, just weeks before the latter two took office as governor and lieutenant governor. Neither has been charged nor accused of any wrongdoing. Does the film shed any new light on their connections?


Kowalski: The filmmakers include an allegation of $5 million going from FirstEnergy to help elect DeWine. And they note a disclaimer from DeWine’s office that it was all within the confines of what was allowed under the law. That’s basically about all they did. It was not a deep dive into the governor’s actions or Husted, who was recently appointed to fill Vice President JD Vance’s U.S. Senate seat. I think maybe they wanted to keep their story tightly focused on the legislature and what has been proven in the first federal criminal case. That also avoids having to include more disclaimers about how nothing’s been proven against others, everybody denies wrongdoing, etc., etc.



Haugen: So is this something you would recommend that your readers watch? 


Kowalski: Yes. It’s compelling storytelling. It does a good job of explaining things in plain terms. There’s a limited cast of characters, and you can follow the story. If House Bill 6 is new to you, it’s definitely worth watching. And it’s certainly important now as we’re looking at not only the continued use of dark money in politics through either nonprofits or limited liability corporations, but also, with technology, likely more ways to cover up potential bribes. So, yes, people should be aware of this.

(Getty Images)When residents of Wichita’s 29th and Grove neighborhood were told their groundwater was contaminated by carcinogens, it wasn’t just an environmental disaster — it was a breach of trust. It shook the foundation that communities are built on: the right to live safely, the right to breathe freely, the right to know the truth.
After tireless advocacy, $3.5 million has been secured to fund health screenings for those affected. It is a needed and important step. But we must be honest: Screenings alone are not justice.
If we are serious about restoring what has been broken, we have to look deeper. We have to ask hard questions:

How will these funds be distributed?
Who will be prioritized?
Will the process be transparent?
Will the people most harmed lead the solutions?

We’ve seen how mishandled recovery funds deepen harm. The national opioid settlements taught us that when money is moved without community voices, it’s often spent inefficiently, unevenly, and inequitably.
Those closest to the crisis must be closest to the power.
That’s why the response to 29th and Grove must be guided by clear, community-centered best practices:

Center the people most harmed. Focus all abatement efforts around their needs, leadership, and healing.
Prioritize free culturally responsive, and evidence-informed care rooted in best practices.
Establish an independent advisory board made up of affected residents.
Require public reporting of all grant distributions and health outcomes.
Invest in long-term monitoring, not one-time fixes.
Minimize administrative waste so that the majority of dollars reach people directly.

The urgency we face right now cannot be overstated. Every day that passes without real action is another day families in our community live with fear, uncertainty, and preventable harm.
That’s why we didn’t wait. Members of the Safe Streets Wichita Coalition, mutual aid groups, and other local community-based groups came together and moved. While officials debated and delayed, we organized free air purifier workshops — providing real tools to our elders, children, teachers, and neighbors in northeast Wichita to help reduce exposure and create healthier indoor spaces.
It wasn’t a perfect solution — but it was something people could use immediately. It was action rooted in evidence, in harm reduction, and in community care. It was the difference between waiting for permission and answering the call ourselves.
Just like during the overdose crisis and early days of the epidemic, our coalition didn’t stand by.
We organized.
We responded.
We showed up.
Because when lives are at risk, community care cannot wait — and neither will we.
This spirit — the willingness to step up when institutions fall short — has to shape the road ahead. Right now, we have a rare chance to show what real community repair looks like: honest, responsive, and deeply rooted in justice.
If we truly believe that health is a human right, then these dollars cannot be treated like charity. They are just a small down payment on a much larger moral debt — a debt that’s long overdue. The residents of 29th and Grove deserve nothing less.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Just as Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was never really about improving government efficiency – quite the opposite, in fact – the 5,000-plus page biennial budget rewrite the Ohio House slapped together and sent to the Ohio Senate was never really about improving the common good of everyday Ohioans.
It was about advancing the hard-right priorities of powerful politicians who answer to big money – not constituents in gerrymandered voting districts.   
Yet even for the supremely arrogant kingpin of state government, Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, the budget bill passed out of the General Assembly’s lower chamber on April 9 was beyond the pale in cruelty and cunning.
It is the Ohio version of Project 2025 with all the unsparing, exacting hallmarks of the Trumpian blueprint, recklessly destroying federal institutions and agencies that, however imperfectly, protect, serve and promote the welfare of we, the people.
But that’s the MAGA nihilistic way and Ohio Republicans are doing their part in tearing down what made Ohio great. Huffman, the Lima Republican who runs the state under the one party rule he rigged with unconstitutional redistricting, is in the catbird seat calling the shots. The speaker (and former Ohio Senate president) lords over the GOP supermajority in the Ohio House while his political protégé, Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, accommodates the boss.
Huffman, who once said the quiet part out loud about GOP gerrymandering (“We can kind of do what we want”), now has a straight runway to enact his blueprint on Ohioans whether they like it or not. I suspect his budget proposal will survive, largely intact, with the House caucus he controls and the one he led with an iron fist for four years in the Senate.
Local public schools, public libraries, clean drinking initiatives, lead poisoning prevention, pediatric cancer funding, home visits for new mothers, food assistance programs and health care coverage for the poor are all on the chopping block in Huffman’s House Bill 96.
What wasn’t on his slash-and-burn budget list were government handouts (taxpayer-funded vouchers) to upper-income private school families. But doling out unlimited government subsidies to the affluent, whose darlings are already attending and affording elite high schools and religious institutions, is Huffman’s thing.
He is on a crusade to shower hundreds of millions of public education dollars on unaccountable private and predominantly religious schools – despite clear prohibitions against such a diversion of public money in the Ohio Constitution.
“No religious or other sect, or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any part of the school funds of this state,” the state constitution reads.
But Huffman has defied the state constitution before with impunity (on gerrymandering) and did so again by ramrodding his universal voucher bonanza through the legislature for everyone, regardless of income. Never mind that the giant state giveaway – to offset private school costs for the well-off – blew a $1 billion dollar hole in the general revenue budget its first year.
Never mind that public schools in the state, forever cash-strapped and dependent on tapped out property owners, labored under an unequal, inadequate school funding formula (ruled unconstitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court) for 26 years before a bipartisan coalition agreed to a phased-in funding solution over six years. The final two-year phase was expected to be fully funded in the current biennial budget negotiations.
Not under Huffman. Not in a state where the Republican lock on power is absolute and the Statehouse heavyweight has free, unchecked rein to flout the law and grossly defund the public schools that educate the vast majority of Ohio students (approximately 1.6 million) while greatly expanding appropriations for private school tuitions, homeschooling expenses and even unchartered, nonpublic schools with deeply held religious beliefs that are virtually unregulated by the state!
Funding for the “thorough and efficient system of common schools” state government is constitutionally obligated to secure – and that would have been secured under the Fair School Funding Plan from 2021 – shrank by over $400 million. House Republicans added insult to injury by robbing fiscally prudent school districts of surplus revenue for future planning to give uneven, one-time property tax relief in some districts and not others. They also ensured that property tax owners will face more school levies from local districts forced to deplete that surplus operating revenue. Sound policymaking (or genuine property tax relief) this is not.
But it is a gut punch to public schools, just as a $100 million reduction in funding to Ohio’s public libraries is, or cutting over $22 million from the Help Me Grow program is for in-home visits to newborn babies to mitigate the state’s infant mortality problem. But Matt Huffman’s Ohio-centric Project 2025 is also a kick in the teeth to democratic self-governance.
Last budget go-around Republican lawmakers stripped the Ohio Board of Education of most of its power and gave it to the governor. This two-year budget proposes cutting all 11 elected members of the board and shrinking the gubernatorial appointments from nine to five. This is Matt Huffman removing voters entirely from state education policy as he engineers total opaque privatization of Ohio schools.
How is silencing the electorate improving the common good?

(Getty Images)Nebraska stands at a critical juncture, with our economic future increasingly at stake. Recent criticism by State Auditor Mike Foley regarding the fiscal impact of business tax incentives is another troubling example in an alarming trend of attacks undermining economic development.
The Greater Omaha Chamber believes strongly that strategic economic development programs, including robust business tax incentives, are not merely beneficial. They are essential.
Foley’s report casts doubt on the value of these incentives. It overlooked the careful and transparent consideration these programs have received.
Nebraska’s Legislature and the Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board consistently factor these incentives into revenue projections, thoroughly assessing both costs and returns.
Paying for performance
These are well-established “pay-for-performance” incentives. Nebraska taxpayers incur no cost unless recipient businesses fulfill predetermined benchmarks including job creation and major capital investment.
We currently over-perform in economic development wins with a very limited number of tools for this purpose. Thus, far from being fiscal liabilities, incentives tie to proven economic outcomes and benefits for our state.
Unfortunately, the auditor’s critique fuels a narrative that disregards the competitive nature of today’s economic landscape. Nebraska now ranks 40th nationally in incentives awarded, according to Site Selection Group. This position places us well behind more aggressive neighboring states with targeted incentive programs. If we continue down this path, we risk falling further behind, jeopardizing not only potential economic opportunities but also the stability of existing businesses that drive our state’s economy.
Economic development matters
Economic development is not an abstract luxury. It is the engine that powers every aspect of our quality of life in Nebraska, from job creation and infrastructure to education and property tax relief.
Yet a disturbing climate at the State Capitol increasingly dismisses the importance of these development tools, labeling them as optional or expendable. This short-sighted view poses threats as companies weighing Nebraska for investment and expansion consider how supportive and stable the business environment is.
Every day, the Greater Omaha Chamber and economic development organizations across Nebraska witness firsthand how economic incentives attract new businesses, encourage local expansions and create thousands of jobs for Nebraskans.
These jobs provide economic security and stability for families, generate substantial new tax revenues and create vibrant communities capable of supporting quality public services and education.
Fighting brain drain
It is these opportunities that serve as plug in our brain drain challenge.
Let us be clear: Transparent oversight and accountability for public funds are indispensable. No one disputes the importance of regularly assessing the effectiveness of economic programs.
However, we strongly oppose political attacks that distort the record and ignore the essential role these incentives have played in Nebraska’s growth.
Nebraska’s elected officials, business leaders and communities must rally around our proven economic development programs. We must recommit to a vision of strategic, forward-looking growth, ensuring Nebraska can effectively compete and thrive.
Now is the time to bolster — not undermine — our state’s competitiveness through strategic incentives that foster sustained economic growth. Our businesses and all Nebraskans deserve nothing less.

More than 3 million people with Medicare could be eligible for the difficult-to-find and expensive weight-loss drug under new guidance which can cover the medication for patients who are obese or those who have a history of heart disease and are at risk of a heart attack or stroke.  (Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.














I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University







GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Anthony Brown (D), left, with then-Attorney General Brian Frosh (D) at a 2018 event in Annapolis, after Brown was elected to succeed Frosh, who stepped down. (File photo by Bruce DePuyt/Maryland Matters)Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) didn’t wait until President Donald Trump (R) was inaugurated on Jan. 20 to start preparing a defense against likely actions by the incoming administration.
When it became clear last year that Trump would secure a second term, Brown said he and his team immediately began researching executive orders and policies the administration pushed in his first term, from 2017 to 2021.
Now, as Trump approaches 100 days in office, Brown has led or joined more than two dozen lawsuits filed by Democratic attorneys general across the country challenging the rapid-fire policy pronouncements of the new administration.
Brown’s office created a tab on its website called “Federal Actions Response,” which provides Marylanders resources and other information on immigration, human rights, LGBTQ and federal employment for those impacted by Trump administration actions.
“I made a commitment that I would bring or join only those actions where I believe Marylanders are harmed or impacted in a way that’s important and meaningful to them,” Brown said in an interview Friday. “So, we’re going to protect the interest the Marylanders talk about every day around their kitchen table.”
Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore County) said Friday he had not reviewed any of the current suits against the administration, but he’s certain of one thing.
“There’s no question that this attorney general and the prior attorney general are politically in tune with the mission of the national Democratic Party,” West said. “They’re going to file lawsuits against Republican presidents and not … against Democratic presidents, unless absolutely forced to. Ultimately, the taxpayers are paying for all these lawsuits, for the legal resources needed to bring these lawsuits.”
HHS workers show up at Maryland offices Tuesday to find they were fired overnight

Brown said the complaints filed have nothing to do with politics.
“I would challenge anyone to point to an action that I have either joined or brought where I cannot connect that action to what it means for Marylanders in their day-to-day lives,” he said.
“These are not political statements,” Brown said. “These are challenges to practical issues and problems that are being created by the Trump administration.”
Lawsuits include one filed Friday, with 18 other states in a federal court in Massachusetts, challenging the administration’s threat to withhold funding from school systems that do not comply with its ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. The suit said that action would “unlawfully imperil more than $13.8 billion that are spent to educate our youth” that includes children in high-poverty communities and those with special needs.
Brown was the lead attorney on a suit that challenged the firing of thousands of probationary federal workers. A U.S. District judge in Greenbelt on April 1 issued a preliminary injunction in the case, ordering 20 agencies, including the departments of Agriculture, Labor, and Transportation, to give workers their jobs back while the case was tried.
He was also co-lead on a brief supporting a challenge to Trump’s executive orders on transgender rights. One declared that the federal government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, and another ordered institutions that receive federal funding to stop gender-affirming care for transgender people.
But Brown doesn’t take all the credit for setting a roadmap to challenge the Trump administration. He gives some credit to his predecessor, Brian Frosh (D), who served as att0rney general in Trump’s last term.
In 2017, the General Assembly passed a resolution authorizing the attorney general to “take specified actions regarding civil and criminal suits” against federal actions that negatively affect Marylanders. That effort was hampered by the fact that any legal action would have to be reviewed by Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who did not allocate the $1 million for legal work the resolution called for, Frosh said.
“I’m envious of Attorney General Brown who gets resources and support from Gov. [Wes] Moore,” Frosh said in an interview Friday.
“I had to cobble together resources to play each case, and we got pro bono assistance from law firms. We had people in the office working overtime, volunteering to work on cases that weren’t in their normal portfolio,” he said. “We worked hard.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Still, Frosh said his office either led or joined in about 95 suits against the administration during Trump’s first four years in office, well below the blistering pace set by Brown and the other attorneys general in the first few months of Trump’s second term.
Frosh defends the lawsuits, saying the attorney general “goes after bad actors every day of the week. This was just a bad actor [Trump] at the very highest level of government, no different from somebody who’s cheating, stealing or abusing people in Maryland. It’s just from a much higher perch.”
‘Challenging environment’
Frosh said he and other attorneys general notched some important wins against the Trump administration, defending the Affordable Care Act, challenging the delay to an Obama-era rule that let student borrowers get loan forgiveness if a predatory school engaged in deceptive conduct, and blocking the separation of immigrant families at the southern border.
But Frosh said he’s most proud of the emoluments lawsuit filed in 2017 by him and former D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine (D). The suit said Trump illegally profited off his presidency by accepting payments from foreign and domestic officials who stayed at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., and patronized other Trump family businesses.
In the face of appeals from Trump and the Justice Department, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the suit could move forward. By the time it reached the Supreme Court, it was declared moot because Trump was out of office. But Frosh notes that, “We didn’t lose that case. We won it. Then the Supreme Court said, ‘OK, well, it doesn’t matter anymore because he’s not president.’”
He remains concerned about what might happen with current Supreme Court and it 6-3 conservative majority of conservative justices. He pointed to the court’s decision last year that U.S. presidents have full criminal immunity for their official “core constitutional” acts, but not for unofficial acts.
Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative returns to reiterate its points

“If you look at the Constitution, the word immunity does not appear in Article 2, which is the article about the president,” he said. “No Supreme Court has ever suggested a president had blanket immunity for official acts. It’s Trump’s dream come true.”
But still, Frosh hopes the Supreme Court will assess the rule of law when it comes to Trump.
“I’m hoping that even this Supreme Court will have the guts to stand up. It’s a much more challenging environment than it was eight years ago,” said Frosh, who now consults with Bloomberg Philanthropies on climate issues and the Maryland Bar Association on criminal justice issues.
‘Our day job’
Both Brown and Frosh stress that, despite the attention they garner, the suits against the Trump administration are not the main focus of the office. The attorney general is the state’s top prosecutor, but he also helps direct and act as a legal adviser for various state agencies, boards and offices.
Under Brown’s leadership since January 2023, and thanks to a Democratic-majority General Assembly, the office has received new responsibilities or expanded authority to include:

Statutory authority to enforce federal and state civil rights laws, but also bring class action lawsuits in working in conjunction with the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights;
Expand authority of the Independent Investigations Division to prosecute police-involved deaths and near fatal injuries;
Establishment of the “Environmental and Natural Resources Crimes Unit,” previously called Environmental Crimes Unit, which can now investigate and prosecute those who break state criminal environmental and natural resources laws; and
Creation of nohomeforhate,md.gov, the Civil Rights Division’s portal to track hate crime and identify trends.

Besides making history as the state’s first Black attorney general, Brown partnered in October 2023 with Public Defender Natasha Dartigue to co-chair the Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative (MEJC). The group released a report last month with 18 recommendations to eliminate racial discrimination in the criminal justice system.
“We’ve got a new president and a new administration in Washington which challenged us. We’ve got to step up our game, but we still have our day job,” Brown said.
“I tell my team, ‘You’ve got to maintain your work life balance. You’ve got to take care of yourself, your personal well-being, your family,'” he said. “I’m proud of my team that’s getting the job done.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Anthony-Brown-Brian-Frosh-192018-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-29 03:59:39.653858

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)While D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was saying, “Welcome home,” Monday to the Washington Commanders, Maryland officials were already saying their farewells and looking forward to what’s next for the team’s current home in Landover.
Few seemed surprised by the move, which has been discussed for several years. That discussion picked up when the team was bought two years ago by a new ownership group that said it was looking to replace the isolated and outdated Northwest Stadium.
The team talked to officials in Maryland, the District and Virginia about a move. Despite putting together what Gov. Wes Moore (D) called “a very competitive offer” to keep the team at its current site, most were like House Majority Whip Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s), a lifelong fan, who said he understands the historical connection some fans have to the team being in D.C.
“We’ve known that since the new ownership got control of the team, they were interested in exploring going back to D.C.,” said Lewis, whose district includes the stadium site. “We’ve also known that a lot of the fan base use that as their ancestral home.
“We’re going to start preparing to move forward,” he said.
The team played in Washington from 1937 to 1996, with last 35 years at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium. It has a lease at Northwest Stadium through 2027, but is not expected leave until 2030, when a new D.C. stadium is ready.
Even as the state worked to keep the team in Landover, it has been “responsibly preparing for the possibility of the Washington Commanders choosing to return to Washington,” Moore said in a statement released by his office Monday.
Nearly $4 billion deal reached to bring Washington Commanders back to D.C.

In December, team owner Josh Harris signed a memorandum of understanding with Moore and Prince George’s Acting County Executive Tara H. Jackson that said team would begin demolition of the Landover stadium within 90 days of playing its first game at a new stadium. After demolition, the agreement calls on the team to work with state and county agencies to transform the site into “a vibrant mixed-use development,” to include residential, retail “and other allowable uses.”
Moore said the goal is to ensure the area “will not create blight in the community” and not be “another RFK Stadium,” which has sunk into disrepair and become a blight on the neighborhood since hosting its last event in 2017.
“What’s important going forward is that the Landover community receives the investment that it deserves,” he said. “Currently we have a nearly 200-acre property that gets used eight times a year for a few hours, and I have said from my earliest days as governor that the people of the area deserve better.”
The state has already work to improve the area, approving a $400 million investment in 2022 for redevelopment of areas around the county’s four Metrorail Blue Line stations, which include the Morgan Boulevard Station, walking distance from the stadium.
Federal, state and county officials held a groundbreaking ceremony April 9 for a new Civic Plaza near the Wayne K. Curry Administration Building, down the street from Largo Town Center Metrorail station. That project, scheduled for completion in December, calls for an enclosed dog park, a playground and an area for community events.
It represents one of five planned and the first ever with investment from the Maryland Stadium Authority.
The money, approved in 2022 by the General Assembly, did not require any of the funds to be used for a new stadium, but as a boost to revitalize those communities inside the Beltway instead.
Longtime fans such as Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) were around when the team moved from RFK Stadium to Prince George’s in 1997, when the stadium was named for then-team owner Jack Kent Cooke — who also labeled the area “Raljon” for his sons, Ralph and John.

It became FedEx Field when Daniel Snyder bought the team in 1999 and kept that name until Harris and his partners two years ago for about $6 billion. The stadium was called Commanders Field for a few months in 2024, before the team secured a deal to call the site Northwest Stadium named after Northwest Federal Credit Union.
In addition to Commanders games, the stadium has hosted international soccer matches, concerts for performers including U2, Taylor Swift and the Beyoncé Renaissance World Tour, and last year’s 125th Army-Navy college football game.
Alsobrooks, who helped secure state funding and private investment toward the Blue Line corridor as county executive in 2022, pushed to improve the Landover community whether or not the team remained in Maryland.
“I know this area will continue to transform before our eyes with housing, retail and so much more,” she said in a texted statement Monday. “Our continued investment will revitalize our Landover community and energize our entire state.”
Belinda Queen, president of the Coalition of Central Prince George’s County Community Organizations that includes Landover, said there’s one business residents aren’t interested in: data centers.
“Virginia has data centers. Virginia is bigger and has more land,” she said. “I get it. Data centers bring some source of income, and we do need some source of income, but they need to be in places where there’s plenty of land and not close to where people live. Put them where warehouses are.”
As for the team going back to D.C., she said, “Can’t cry over spilled milk. That whole big [stadium site] can be an indoor shopping mall, or a big place where people can live, work and play. It’s time to move the county forward.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/04/Northwest-Stadium-4-28-2025-1024x617.jpg,,,2025-04-29 03:59:39.653858

Meanwhile, larger lawsuit payouts are affecting Los Angeles coffers, creating politically unusual positions.","One of the state Capitol’s perpetual conflicts, dubbed “tort wars,” pits personal injury attorneys and their allies, such as labor unions, against business groups and their insurers over laws governing which activities can be subjected to damage-seeking lawsuits.
Over the years, as one side seeks to expand the universe of civil wrongs (torts) that can be brought to court and the other seeks to freeze or even shrink such opportunities, titanic political clashes have erupted either in the Capitol or the ballot arena.
One highlight — or lowlight — of the never-ending duel occurred in 1987 when private negotiations over a tobacco war truce moved from the Capitol to Frank Fat’s restaurant, a Sacramento political hangout. Then-state Assembly Speaker Willie Brown hopped from table to table. The result was the infamous “napkin deal” that gave something to each faction and suspended hostilities for a few years.
Overall, tort wars have been something of a standoff as each side claimed occasional victories and suffered occasional losses. But they continue because the potential stakes are many billions of dollars. Well-heeled participants will spend millions on lobbying fees, campaign contributions to legislators and ballot measure battles to prevail.
Three years ago, the warring factions were headed for a very expensive showdown with dueling ballot measures. The pro-litigation side had qualified a measure for the 2022 ballot that would, if passed, have virtually repealed a 1975 law limiting pain and suffering damages in medical malpractice suits to $250,000.

Special interests poured more than half a billion into California lobbying last year 

by Jeremia Kimelman 





In response, the Civil Justice Association of California, an umbrella organization of business and insurance interests, proposed a countermeasure that would have limited lawyers’ shares of personal injury damages to 20%.
The standoff resulted in a quickly enacted compromise that preserved the cap on malpractice damages but gradually raises it. The two ballot measures were shelved.
Legislative sessions usually see at least one effort by one or both of the factions to change tort law. This year’s example is Senate Bill 799, carried by Sen. Ben Allen, an El Segundo Democrat, and backed by trial lawyers, labor unions, local governments and Attorney General Rob Bonta. SB 799 would extend California’s False Claims Act to high-dollar tax disputes, thus allowing lawyers to go after taxpayers deemed to be scofflaws and collect fees if they win.
Its introduction sparked an intense effort by business and insurance groups, via the Civil Justice Association of California and the California Taxpayers Association, to strangle the measure.
The bill easily cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee but opponents prevailed in a showdown hearing in the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee last week, with just two of the committee’s five members (both Democrats) voting for it. Two other Democrats refused to vote, which had the same practical effect as voting “no.”

The civil justice and taxpayers groups hailed their win, declaring, “SB 799 would have unleashed shakedown lawsuits against business owners and outsourced the state’s responsibility for tax enforcement to the plaintiffs’ bar.”
There was an ironic coincidence on the issue. As SB 799 was being rejected, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass was visiting Sacramento to plead for state help in dealing with her city’s huge budget deficit, citing a huge increase in payouts from liability lawsuits as a major factor.
“Liability settlements have tripled from backed up lawsuits during the pandemic in uncapped damages,” Bass said.
City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto accompanied Bass to seek a limit on damages from suits against cities. “We’re trying to bring California more into the mainstream and make sure that we don’t pay taxpayer dollars out unnecessarily or in disproportionate amounts,” Feldstein Soto said.
Their position is a little odd, given that the League of California Cities had supported SB 799.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Health care is built on trust — between patients and providers, families and caregivers, communities and the systems that serve them.
Every day in Maryland, nurses, doctors and health care staff show up with skill, compassion and commitment to keep us well. But there’s a growing concern within the walls of our hospitals, clinics, emergency departments and urgent care centers, nursing homes and assisted living facilities: an increase in workplace violence directed at those providing care.
These incidents don’t define our health care system, which remains a safe and healing space for patients, but they do represent a critical challenge we must address to protect the workforce behind it.
At the Maryland Patient Safety Center, we’ve launched our “Care Flows Both Ways” campaign to show the need for more respectful interactions in health care facilities. Our organization and the health care workers we seek to assist are grateful to the Maryland General Assembly for their support of and commitment to this effort.




Your opinion matters
Maryland Matters welcomes guest commentary submissions at editor@marylandmatters.org.
We suggest a 750-word limit and reserve the right to edit or reject submissions. We do not accept columns that are endorsements of candidates, and no longer accept submissions from elected officials or political candidates.
Opinion pieces must be signed by at least one individual using their real name. We do not accept columns signed by an organization. Commentary writers must include a short bio and a photo for their bylines.
Views of writers are their own.




At the heart of our campaign is a simple but powerful truth: Care must flow both ways. Our health care professionals dedicate their lives to caring for others; they deserve care, compassion and protection in return.
When we support the well-being of our health care workforce, we reinforce the entire system of care that touches every Marylander’s life. Respecting and safeguarding those who care for us ensures they can continue to do what they do best — deliver exceptional care to patients and families across the state.
Most people will never witness the kinds of stressors and confrontations that health care workers may face during high-pressure moments, but their impact is real. Addressing this issue is not about sounding an alarm; It’s about strengthening the foundation of our health care system. There are benefits to every patient at the hospital when violence against health care workers is prevented.
Our campaign website, ItTakesPatients.org, provides tools and resources for patients and families, plus hospitals, physician offices, urgent care and other settings of care. Through the website, as well as on billboards and buses, TV and digital ads, Marylanders can hear and see directly from health care workers who have been impacted by workplace violence in medical settings.
Their stories are real, raw and emotional.
It’s not easy to talk, or hear, about any workplace violence, but what Marylanders will also hear is their love for their work and their gratitude for the opportunity to help others.
To the health care professionals who show up every day with courage and compassion: We see you, we thank you and we are working to ensure your safety is a priority.
To the public and our elected leaders: This is an opportunity to stand with the people who care for us — to build a stronger, safer health care system that supports the well-being of both patients and providers. Together, we can ensure that Maryland leads the way in protecting our health care workforce while maintaining the trust and care our communities count on.
Since the Maryland Patient Safety Center was created by the Maryland General Assembly in 2002, we have worked for a future where health care is safe and equitable for every patient, family member and health care worker, across the care continuum. The Care Flows Both Ways campaign continues and expands that commitment to our state’s health care family.
Our aim is to keep healing the central part of the workplace for our health care heroes. We invite everyone to join us as we learn how to make “Care Flow Both Ways.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-52212092-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-29 03:00:18.825887

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA bill aimed at boosting safety in Georgia schools and another banning transgender girls from girls’ school sports teams were among a raft of priority education legislation signed into law by Gov. Brian Kemp Monday.
“As the parents of three daughters, (First lady Marty Kemp) and I know just how important it is to keep our children safe and to give them the best possible start in life,” Kemp said. “That’s why I’m proud to sign these bills that will further safeguard our classrooms, both from those with violent intentions and from out-of-touch political agendas.”
As Kemp signed House Bill 268, he was backed by Winder Republican Rep. Holt Persinger, the bill’s sponsor, and other members of the Barrow County community, which includes Apalachee High School. Apalachee High saw Georgia’s deadliest school shooting last year, in which two teachers and two students were killed and another nine were injured.
The bill was crafted as a response to the shooting and contains a number of provisions intended to decrease the likelihood of a similar attack. It requires schools to implement a panic button system that would allow employees to instantly contact authorities in case of an emergency. Apalachee began using a panic button system just a week before the shooting, and some have credited the devices with allowing law enforcement to react quickly enough to prevent more people from being killed.
The bill also requires schools to share data when a student transfers within five school days. The accused teenage shooter at Apalachee had allegedly been interviewed by the FBI in connection with shooting threats at another district more than a year before the attack, but those allegations did not follow him to Barrow County.
The most controversial element of the bill was stripped out before it passed the Legislature. Originally, it would have created a statewide database of students who might pose a threat to school safety. Opponents cited privacy concerns, saying that a student who made an idle threat against a classmate or another immature but harmless mistake could have their future opportunities threatened.

Education bills signed by Gov. Kemp Monday
Senate Bill 1 – Prohibits student athletes from playing on teams designated for the other gender and requires restrooms, locker rooms and sleeping areas to be single-gender at sporting events.
House Bill 81 – Establishes an interstate compact for school psychologists to make it easier for professionals from other states to work in Georgia.
House Bill 307 – Consolidates existing statutory requirements for dyslexia screening to reach students earlier.
House Bill 235 – Allows education workers to receive a leave of absence to donate organs or bone marrow.
Senate Bill 82 – Encourages local school boards to approve charter school petitions.
Senate Bill 123 – Mandates the creation of review teams for school systems with high rates of chronic absenteeism.
House Bill 268 – Requires schools to have up-to-date mapping and panic buttons, requires school records for transfer students to be transferred within five days, requires districts to provide anonymous safety reporting programs, creates new safety positions and new offenses for making threats against a school.

The panic button portion of the safety bill was originally titled Ricky and Alyssa’s Law after Richard Aspinwall, a teacher and coach who died in the Apalachee shooting and Alyssa Alhadeff, who was killed in the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
Members of both families were on hand for the signing.
Aspinwall’s father-in-law Kevin Zinke said the ceremony was bittersweet.
“We’re happy that the governor decided to sign it, but this whole thing has been a rollercoaster ride,” he said. “You’re just happy about something like this, but none of us should be here right now. None of us should be here for this. This could have all been prevented.”
Alyssa’s parents, Lori and Ilan Alhadeff, have been traveling the country advocating for panic button mandates. Georgia is the eighth state to pass such a law. Ilan Alhadeff called the buttons his daughter’s legacy.
“She was inherently very protective of everyone around her. She always brought the crowds and was always defensive of everyone in her circle, and this is so nice to see and so vitally important to see that we’re able to save lives. In the Apalachee shooting, it saved lives. A panic alert went off, and if it was not for that, more children and staff could have been killed that day. So this is just a clear example of how it saved lives. If it was there in 2018, our daughter would be here with us today.”
Coach Aspinwall’s father, who is also named Richard Aspinwall, said he’s glad for the provisions that passed, but he said he hopes to see the database portion become law as well.
“We’re going to keep working on that. You can’t expect somebody to be blindsided with a problem,” he said.
Senate Bill 1 was one of the most controversial bills of this year’s session, which ended early this month.
Also known as the Riley Gaines Act after a college swimmer who lost a tournament at Georgia Tech to a transgender swimmer, the bill bans transgender athletes from playing on team sports designated for their gender identity at all grade levels, including college. It also requires separate restroom, locker room and sleeping facilities for men and women at athletic events and sets up a way to legally challenge schools that violate the law.
Supporters say the measure will ensure women and girls can find safety and fair play on the field.
“This common sense legislation is about what is fair and safe for our children,” Kemp said. “Girls should not have to share a playing field, a restroom or locker room with boys. I know I learned a lot of valuable lessons about life on the football field and the baseball diamond growing up, and it’s not right to ask kids today to forgo those lessons when facing someone biologically stronger and faster than them.”
Opponents call the bill and other legislation taking away rights from transgender people attempts to score political points by going after a vulnerable group.
The Georgia High School Association and NCAA already ban transgender athletes from playing in women’s sports, and President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year banning transgender participation in women’s sports.
Bentley Hudgins, state director with the Human Rights Campaign, said GOP legislators shot down Democratic efforts to boost girls’ sports, including Senate Bill 41, which aimed to equalize funding, access and equipment between girls’ and boys’ school sports.
“Instead of addressing the real problems young women and girls face on the playing field, they chose to bully trans kids and put all girls in harm’s way,” they said. “Their absurd attacks on kids are tired and don’t help anyone. While Republicans play political games and bully transgender children, they cannot and will not steal our joy.”

(Photo by Ronen Tivony/NurPhoto via Getty Images)After years of legal wrangling, former Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes is free of any state ethics violation charges.
The Executive Branch Ethics Commission, which brought charges against her in 2021, has decided not to try to appeal to the Kentucky Supreme Court last month’s unanimous decision by the Kentucky Court of Appeals to uphold a lower court order that cleared Grimes of any wrongdoing.
With no appeal to the state’s highest court from the commission within 30 days, the appellate court finalized its decision on April 21.
“There are no legal charges any more against her, and there never should have been any,” her attorney, Jon Salomon of Louisville, said Monday night.
The end of the legal case could opens the door for a possible run for another political office. The Democrat is seen by some Kentucky political observers as a possible candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2026 or Central Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District next year.
Grimes is a Lexington lawyer who was secretary of state from 2011 to 2019 and was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2014 against Republican Mitch McConnell. She is the daughter of the former state Democratic Party Chair Jerry Lundergan of Lexington. The Lundergan family is close to former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Grimes did not return phone calls seeking comments about her legal victory and political future.
Susan Clary, executive director of the ethics commission, had no comment Monday night when asked why the commission did not ask the Kentucky Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals’ decision.
The commission had been investigating Grimes for several years.
In November 2021, the commission fined Grimes $10,000 for two ethical violations pertaining to handling of voter data.
As secretary of state, Grimes was the state’s chief elections officer. In her position, she had access to data from the state voter registration system in the State Board of Elections.
The commission had alleged that Grimes violated the ethics code by sharing voter information without requiring a request under the Open Records Act or other “established process of government.”
Grimes responded that all the voter data at issue was information in the public domain and that she had full legal authority and discretion as secretary of state to access and share such information. She claimed no statute or regulation was violated by the sharing of such public information. She claimed the commission’s charges were barred by the five-year statute of limitations and that the record did not support a finding of any violations of the state executive branch’s code of ethics.
The commission argued that it was not bound by any statute of limitations and claimed that a limitation could hamper its work on other cases.
The only allegations pursued by the Ethics Commission were that Grimes allegedly acted unethically in accessing public information in the voter registration system by downloading voter information onto a thumb drive when she was a candidate for reelection.
The commission also looked at whether Grimes improperly shared information on new voter registrations for certain Kentucky House of Representative districts in response to a request made informally through the office of the House speaker without requiring a formal open records request or charging a fee.
Grimes fought the charges in Franklin Circuit Court and Judge Phillip Shepherd ruled in her favor.
Then the three-member appellate court said last month that the Executive Branch Ethics Commission missed its statutory deadline to charge Grimes with improperly ordering the downloading and distribution of voter registration data from her public office while she was Kentucky’s secretary of state.
“The Franklin Circuit Court reversed the commission’s decision, finding it was arbitrary, not supported by substantial evidence and time barred. Due to the statute of limitations alone, we affirm,” said the appellate court decision. The three appellate judges were Susanne M. Cetrulo, James H. Lambert and Jeff S. Taylor.
Salomon, Grimes’ attorney, noted that the final order contained a “To Be Published” provision, meaning that the case sets precedent in law.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-824504630-594x594-1.jpg,,,2025-04-29 01:01:26.451939

FRANKFORT, Ky. – A big reason why Congressman Andy Barr swamped former Attorney General Daniel Cameron in the first phase of fundraising as each seeks the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate is that Barr got a windfall of contributions from traditional political action committees —particularly from bank PACs.
The numbers can be found on Line 11(c) of the reports Barr and Cameron filed recently with the Federal Election Commission detailing their contributions between Jan. 1 and March 31.
That line on the Andy Barr for Senate report shows $733,000 in contributions from PACs.
The same line on the Cameron for Senate report shows $1,000.
Barr’s PAC windfall represents 40 percent of the $1,853,000 in total receipts he reported for the three-month period. Cameron reported total receipts of $508,000 for the period.
Barr’s lead in fundraising is actually much larger because — in addition to the money raised in the first quarter — he rolled over a balance of about $3.7 million from his House campaign committee to the new committee for the Senate. Barr’s Senate campaign reported having more than $5.3 million on hand at this start of this month while Cameron’s report shows it had $455,000 on hand on April 1.
Barr and Cameron are seeking the Republican Party nomination to succeed Sen. Mitch McConnell who announced in February that he would not seek reelection in 2026. Others may join the race. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported last week that some Republican insiders are saying Scott Jennings, a political consultant best known as a pro-Donald Trump commentator on CNN, is considering getting in the race. And others might get in, including wealthy Lexington businessman Nate Morris.
Barr may need more campaign money than Cameron, who released a poll earlier this month showing he enjoyed a strong lead over Barr — a lead political experts attributed to his higher statewide name recognition that resulted from his 2019 election as attorney general, his four years serving as attorney general, and his 2023 campaign for governor which he lost to incumbent Democrat Andy Beshear.

Barr has won seven consecutive elections as U.S. representative but his name is not well known outside central Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District.
Barr’s strong support from traditional PACs is the result of his years in the House, particularly now as a member of the majority party while holding important committee assignments.
Stephen Voss, an associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky who specializes in Kentucky politics, said most experienced members of Congress, regardless of political affiliation, can expect a steady flow of donations from traditional PACs. “Andy Barr has been influential in the banking and finance sector for years now, and PACs tend to reward longterm relationships,” Voss said.
Traditional PACs — organizations representing corporations, associations, labor unions and other groups  —are limited by law to giving no more than $5,000 per election. The limit is effectively $10,000 because a PAC can give $5,000 designated to a candidate’s primary election, and $5,000 designated to the general election.
Barr is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee and chairs its Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy Subcommittee. He also serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
The website of OpenSecrets, a non-profit organization that tracks and analyzes political contributions, shows that in the past four years Barr’s campaign committee has gotten the largest share of its contributions from the “securities and investment” sector of the economy and the second largest share from “commercial banks.”
PACs of many corporations and associations within those sectors also gave generously to Barr in the first three months of this year. Kentucky Lantern’s review of Barr’s recent report shows that 17 PACs of banks or financial services associations gave the maximum $10,000 during the period.
Those are the PACs of: American Bankers Assn.; American Financial Services Assn.; Ally Financial Inc.; Barclays Group US Inc.; Fifth Third Bancorp; Financial Services Institute; Goldman Sachs Group Inc.; Investment Company Institute; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Managed Funds Assn.; Nomura Holding America Inc.; PNC Financial Services Group; Securities Industry and Financial Markets Assn.; Truist Financial Corp.; UBS Americas Inc.; U.S. Bancorp; and United Wholesale Mortgage.
Many other PACs of banks and financial institutions gave smaller amounts. But Barr got lots of contributions from PACs outside the banking sector during the period.

Here are the other PACs listed as donating $10,000 to Barr during the first quarter:

American Institute of CPAs
American Property Casualty Insurance Assn.
Beam Suntory Inc.
Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers
Deloitte
Elevance Health Inc.
Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America Inc.
KPMG Partners/Principals and Employees
Marathon Petroleum Employees
National Apartment Assn.
National Beer Wholesalers
PriceWaterhouseCoopers
Sazerac Company Inc.

Many other PACs gave smaller amounts. Barr’s Congressional office referred questions from Kentucky Lantern to his Senate campaign committee, which did not return an email and a phone message. Cameron’s FEC report lists only one PAC contribution: $1,000 from an obscure political group called Red State PAC, of Nashville.
Guthrie got more PAC money than Barr
Kentucky’s 2nd District Congressman Brett Guthrie, a Republican from Bowling Green who apparently has no current aspirations for higher office, reported getting hundreds of PAC contributions to his campaign committee in the first quarter of 2025 totaling $826,500.

The $826,500 represented 72% of all contributions during the period to Guthrie, who last December was named chairman of the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
Guthrie first won election to the U.S. House in a close election in 2008. Since then he has never seriously been threatened. Last November he won reelection with 73.1% of the vote.
And over time his campaign fund has become less of committee to raise and spend money for his reelection expenses and more of a clearing house that collects contributions from traditional PACs and gives most of it to the Republican National Congressional Committee.
FEC records show that in the 2023-24 campaign cycle it took in $2.4 million from traditional PACs – 74 percent of its total contributions. FEC records also show that in the same period it gave $3.1 million to the NRCC – 64 percent of its total spending.
McConnell Money Machine winding down
U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell’s well-oiled fundraising machine is beginning to shut down. Kentucky’s senior senator announced on Feb. 20 he would not seek reelection. And his campaign committee reported to the FEC last week that it stopped online fundraising and will refund contributions designated for the 2026 general election as required by law.
After those refunds the McConnell for Senate Committee is expected to still have a balance of well over $7 million.
The law prevents retiring senators and representatives from keeping that money or paying for personal expenses. But McConnell has other options, primarily donating the money to political committees or to charities.
McConnell Senate Committee launched in the early 1980s an underdog’s effort to unseat an incumbent Democrat and went on – FEC records show – to raise more than $150 million  that financed seven winning elections to the U.S. Senate.

The committee was the heart and the origin of McConnell’s fundraising machine which – once McConnell secured his seat in the U.S. Senate – also took on the role of raising hundreds of millions of additional dollars (through the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the super PAC Senate Leadership Fund) with the goal of gaining and retaining Republican control of the U.S. Senate.
McConnell likes “The Price of Power”
Among the relatively few spending items listed in McConnell for Senate’s recent report is $4,467.37 it paid on Feb. 26 to the publishing house Simon & Schuster, of New York, for books.
Last fall Simon & Schuster published “The Price of Power, How Mitch McConnell Mastered the Senate, Changed America and Lost His Party” by veteran journalist Michael Tackett. (The book was favorably reviewed in Kentucky Lantern by Kentucky journalist Al Cross.)Kentucky Lantern confirmed the payment was for copies of “The Price of Power.”
The $4,467.37 payment would buy about 130 copies of the book at its list price.
‘Tis The Season

	
It’s that time of year when political committees of politicians include big payments to Churchill Downs.
Hal Rogers for Congress reported three payments to Churchill in February and March totaling $95,979. His report says the payments were for ‘facility rental.”
Friends of Andy Barr, a Barr committee that collects contributions for several Barr committees, reported paying $60,450 to Churchill. It also says the purpose of the disbursement was for “facility rental.”
Study in contrasts: Racing, breeding shine in Kentucky as sport dims across America

Rand Paul for Senate paid $40,026 in February to Churchill for “event tickets.”
No special trips for Sen. Paul, but …
Kentucky Lantern has reported that Sen. Paul’s campaign committee spent $50,000 last summer for a fundraising trip to Scandinavia’s finest hotels and restaurants, and it spent $44,240 for a fundraising stay at Pendry Park City, a luxury ski resort in Utah.
Paul’s campaign fund reported no travel expenses as large or unusual as those during the first three months of this year. However, it did include a couple additional expenses apparently related to last winter’s ski trip: $1,656 paid to Snowbound Transportation, of Park City, and $2,000 to Diego Zapata, a private chef and caterer from Salt Lake City.
The Paul campaign also reported paying $2,879 in March to The Breakers, a resort in Palm Beach, Florida. That was apparently to attend the annual National Republican Senatorial Committee’s winter meeting – a trip Paul takes at his campaign’s expense each year.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-29 04:01:31+00:00,CT Mirror,CT’s psychedelic reform is not cannabis justice,Josiah Schlee,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/29/cts-psychedelic-reform-is-not-cannabis-justice/,"If Connecticut lawmakers want to claim moral leadership on drug reform, then they need to take meaningful action on cannabis — action that centers people, not profit.","Connecticut lawmakers recently advanced a bill to decriminalize small amounts of psilocybin, the psychoactive compound found in “magic mushrooms.” The bill, HB 7065, was celebrated by some as a forward-thinking, therapeutic step toward a more humane drug policy.
And yet, I find myself asking: Why psilocybin? Why now? Why is this bill moving forward while cannabis justice — long overdue and already legally enacted in spirit — continues to stall?
The answer, I believe, lies in a pattern that’s becoming increasingly familiar in Connecticut politics: bold-sounding reform that doesn’t challenge power, doesn’t upset profit structures, and doesn’t truly redistribute opportunity. It’s a recurring script. Progress is welcomed when it’s symbolic and easy. But when it starts to disrupt bureaucratic control or corporate cannabis monopolies, the door quietly closes.
To be clear, I support decriminalization of psilocybin. I support any effort that removes criminal penalties from nonviolent personal use of plant or fungi-based substances. What I don’t support is pretending that psilocybin reform is a substitute for the real, hard work of cannabis justice — particularly when nonviolent cannabis offenders remain incarcerated in our state, medical cannabis patients continue to be overlooked, and communities devastated by prohibition are still being told to wait.
Let’s talk about what’s been buried.
HB 5429 was a modest but important bill designed to protect medical cannabis patients and caregivers. It proposed expanding home cultivation rights, capping excessive lab testing fees, and reinforcing anti-discrimination protections — especially in housing and employment. These are not radical changes; they’re updates needed to preserve a medical program that has been neglected since the adult-use market came online.
Even more critical was HB 6377, a wide-reaching justice and equity proposal. It would have ended ongoing investigations and prosecutions for nonviolent cannabis offenses, automatically expunged criminal records, and created a framework for reviewing — and potentially vacating — sentences for those still behind bars. It also required that 50% of new cannabis licenses go to individuals with past convictions or from communities disproportionately targeted by enforcement. The bill aimed to turn promises of equity into actual policy.
Neither bill received a vote.
Meanwhile, HB 7065 sailed through the Judiciary Committee. And while it may be framed as “decriminalization,” it still allows police to seize and destroy psilocybin and penalize possession with fines up to $500. Cultivation remains fully criminalized. No provision exists for safe access, safe supply, or therapeutic integration. The law creates a new source of revenue through civil enforcement — essentially replacing incarceration with profitable punishment. That’s not restorative justice. It’s a branding exercise.
So why psilocybin and not cannabis? Why did a Schedule I psychedelic advance while more practical  and  familiar  reforms  were ignored?
One reason is simple: there’s less money at stake. Psilocybin doesn’t have a billion-dollar industry behind it — yet. There are no multistate operators competing for licenses, no state departments seeking to regulate therapeutic mushroom clinics, no entrenched financial interests to protect.
Supporting psilocybin costs nothing politically. Cannabis, on the other hand, is already a market — a market controlled by a few and heavily regulated by the Department of Consumer Protection (DCP), which has shown a preference for centralized control over community  empowerment.
Releasing prisoners, expunging records, and opening up the license structure threatens that model. Reforming cannabis policy in Connecticut means redistributing power, not just changing the optics. That kind of reform is much harder to pass — not because it lacks merit, but because it disrupts comfort.
Then there’s perception. Psychedelics have undergone a cultural rebrand. They’re now associated with therapy, trauma healing, mental wellness, and micro-dosing executives in Silicon Valley.
Cannabis still carries political baggage — linked in the public imagination to over-policing, incarceration, and street-level drug enforcement. Lawmakers would rather ride the new wave of psychedelic hype than untangle the mess they helped create around cannabis.
I don’t write this as someone looking to tear down progress. I write this as someone who has supported reform for years — who has watched Connecticut legalize cannabis without ever truly legalizing the people who used it first. I write this as someone who sees the same communities left out of licensing, left out of policy writing, left out of profit, and left behind in prison. That’s not legalization. That’s selective permission.
If we want to be honest about drug policy reform, we have to be honest about who benefits. We have to ask why symbolic legislation moves forward while substantive justice is delayed. We have to be willing to acknowledge when the appearance of progress is being used to cover for a lack of courage.
It’s no longer enough to decriminalize one substance while maintaining punishment for others. It’s no longer acceptable to protect corporations over caregivers or state regulators over patients. If Connecticut lawmakers want to claim moral leadership on drug reform, then they need to take meaningful action on cannabis — action that centers people, not profit.
HB 7065 may be a step. But it is not the step we most urgently need.

I was doing so well at school, but as soon as I got that call in early November, the financial burden of attending college as an out-of-state student loomed very large.
Just a year before, in 2020, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, we all saw a renewed movement advocating for racial justice and equality. I was still in high school, and the event served as a catalyst for my passion for journalism.


I found myself inspired and motivated to express my emotions and thoughts on what could be better, especially as an African American navigating life in a town that was predominantly non-Black. I was determined to study journalism and capture stories that matter, and this ambition quickly became my dream. The price to attend UConn before financial aid and waivable fees is $62,323. My mother and brother stood firmly by my side, encouraging me to chase my dreams and make our family proud. 
But now that my mother was sick, just a month or so into my college career, the narrative had switched. It became a matter of me needing to take care of myself in order to help my family manage in her absence.

Kwasi Osei-Amankwah
Throughout my four years at the university, I’ve worked at multiple jobs to support myself, with my highest-paying positions being at Sally’s Apizza and Haven Hot Chicken. And while I will forever remain thankful to these jobs for taking me in during my time of need, earning about $20 an hour was not even close to enough. My mother’s ongoing illness meant I had to shoulder the burden of my tuition on my own while also supporting my family at home in their time of need, paying for food and managing utilities at 18 years old.
In college, students are encouraged to fully immerse themselves in their studies while at the same time participating in a bunch of extracurricular activities and internships in order to build networks, gain invaluable experience and improve their craft of choice. Yet for those like me, managing a rigorous academic schedule while working nearly full time – especially in an industry that doesn’t have anything to do with my future ambitions – achieving this balance can feel nearly impossible.
Allison Wall, a dear friend and fellow student studying natural resources and the environment at UConn, echoed my struggles. “I have loans that cover a significant portion of my tuition, but I also have car payments, rent, repaying those loans,” she said. “There are days when I barely eat.”
Ageu Dos Santos, another UConn student, often has to work late and can’t get up for classes in the morning. “I have to hope and pray that these customers don’t come in. Otherwise, I have to stay in late and not be able to get up for class; I don’t get paid enough to worry about this.”
Thousands of students share stories like ours, and for the most part, their voices are entirely unheard. These are individuals whose families cannot help them with their education costs due to financial constraints. And no matter what the reason, it can’t be fair to put this strain on a young person straight out of high school. Students should be able to achieve their dreams no matter where they decide to end up going to school.
While the university provides some resources, such as food pantries and clothing initiatives, the outreach to help students find these programs is insufficient. I often found myself scouring UConn’s barrage of Daily Digest emails for any hope of assistance, whether financial or emotional. And when I reached out to the financial aid office for additional support, I was met with so much disappointment. They informed me that I had exhausted my options and could not receive further help. The only option I was given was to take out a private loan. I hadn’t done that during my time at UConn until this year, when I had no choice.
As I prepare to graduate this semester, I take so much pride in the journey I’ve been on. I carry with me the lessons of resilience, as well as acquiring some of the journalism skills I needed. I daily remember the struggles I overcame to get to this point. Yet, I cannot shake the feeling that financing an education should never be this arduous. I can’t help but worry that because of the situation I’ve been in, I won’t find a job easily at all, not because of skills I haven’t acquired but because of the lack of true experience I have.
I want to be someone in this world. My passion and drive make me this way, and while no one can predict these circumstances, the reality of potentially repaying student loans for the entirety of my life feels overwhelming. No one should have to face such daunting challenges.
College costs money for a reason. This isn’t an article about making college free. As a student, I covered many issues similar to this one for class assignments. I always got led to the same statement:
“The things students enjoy cost money.”
I understand that a lot of the things cost money. But I don’t have the time to enjoy said things. There should be something more that universities across the country could do for students like me, who were just dealt a bad hand and couldn’t do anything about it.
The solution of loan forgiveness has been really big in helping students after college, but this is a process that should be expanded upon, not taken away as the Trump administration is threatening – giving students more access to the education they need.
Because of my journey, I’ve missed out on internships and valuable experience that would’ve helped me advance in life. This feeling of hopelessness after all the sacrifices people have made goes to show all the deeper issues in this country. How a student, who’s a person of color, can’t make it during this stage of life because of the lack of connections, the lack of time, and because my parents weren’t born here. I work tirelessly each day to make something of myself because of the promises I made to my mother. The feeling that I’m not getting that fair chance, the feeling of failure, scares me.
My mom is slowly doing better physically, but mentally I worry if she’ll ever be the same. She’s 60 years old now, and many years of working as a single mother have taken their toll. My father told me that they’re planning to retire back to Ghana after reuniting with my mother following her illness. They have completed their attempt at that “American Dream” so many immigrants around the world chase for generations.
I’ve battled and fought through an experience. I will never let something like this hinder me. My mission has always been to make things easier for people like me — first-generation students, people who struggle to pay for college, people of color, anyone that feels like they’re not getting the love they need.
My last shift, I worked 13 hours. During that time, I had a guest visit my job who was touring UConn with their daughter from Long Island. Strangers. When they told me how proud they were that I was graduating, it sparked the brightest smile within me. I hope to make people feel that sense of pride in my writing, perfect my craft, and make my family proud. I need to make all the hard work worth it.

The local chamber announced, in a media release, its participation in the relaunch of the Business for Federal Research Funding Coalition. Nearly 30 states are represented so far.
“Federal research funding is one of the best investments we can make in America’s future,” said Heath Mello, president and CEO of the Greater Omaha Chamber. “It drives groundbreaking innovation, fuels job creation, strengthens our national competitiveness and directly impacts the Omaha region.”

Formed in 2017, the national coalition went dormant during the Biden Administration, a chamber official said, because funding levels for federal research were sufficient.
Now the nonpartisan coalition of business organizations “from red, blue and purple states” will once again engage members of Congress and the Trump Administration to reinforce the stance that research funding “strengthens our nation’s economy and competitiveness.”
The Omaha-area chamber represents nearly 3,000 member businesses. Representatives said the University of Nebraska system last year received more than $113 million, and Omaha-based Creighton University received nearly $8.3 million in National Institute of Health grants.
Investments in research have led to major breakthroughs in innovation, new technologies, life-saving medical treatments and millions of jobs, the chamber release said. 
The BFRF said that nationally, $36.9 billion in NIF grants awarded to researchers in 2024 supported 407,782 jobs and generated $94.5 in economic activity.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s public schools might get more money, after all. 
Nine days after Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed a significant increase to the state’s K-12 public school funding formula, the Alaska Senate has approved a compromise education bill that includes a smaller increase.
The bill includes some — but not all — of the policy changes that Dunleavy said were necessary to prevent another veto.
House Bill 57, originally drafted to restrict public school students’ cellphone use, was amended by the Senate before being approved on a bipartisan, 19-1 vote, and must return to the House for a concurrence vote. 
That vote could have taken place on Monday, but lawmakers found a technical error with the bill, meaning that the Senate must revote on a new text before the House can act. 
The new Senate vote and the House’s concurrence are expected on Wednesday.
When that happens, it will be the third time in two years that the Alaska Legislature has attempted to increase the state’s per-student funding formula.
While the first two attempts were defeated by the governor and Republicans who voted to sustain his vetoes, this third attempt appears to have stronger support among legislative Republicans.
On Monday, five members of the six-person Senate Republican minority hailed the bill, and three said they were prepared to override the governor. Two others said they might do so as well.
“We believe that we have struck the most reasonable compromise we’re going to find this year to get something true that’s going to work,” said Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla.

Included in the bill is a $700 per student increase to the base student allocation, the foundation of the state’s public school funding formula. 
For years, legislators have tried to adjust the formula to keep up with inflation. If the formula were to be adjusted for inflation since 2011, it would have to rise by $1,808 per student. In recent years, districts have had to slash programs and staff, and public school advocates have cited the lack of BSA increases as a cause. During the same period, public-school enrollment has fallen. 
Last year, lawmakers included a one-time funding bonus for public schools in the state budget. That was equivalent to a $680 increase to the BSA. The new funding is only a small year-over-year bump — from $174 million to $183 million, given 2024 class sizes — but it’s particularly important, said Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage, because it’s part of the foundation formula, which means schools can count on that figure when they write their budgets.
“When it’s inside the BSA, not only can they plan long-term … but it also forces this accountability metric,” she said, explaining that districts will be required to account for their spending differently than if they were receiving a one-time bonus.
The bill also includes more money for pupil transportation programs — school bus services, generally — and it designates the proceeds of a proposed corporate tax update for a program intended to improve younger students’ reading skills.
That section of the bill states that schools would be eligible for at least $450 for each student who passes specific skill thresholds.

That provision, plus stronger prohibitions on student cellphones, were important to Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, and caused her to vote for the bill. She had voted against the bill that was vetoed by Dunleavy.
“I don’t want children to miss out on … primarily the cellphone ban. I think that will be a game changer with middle and high schoolers. You will see academic improvements as a result of that one policy. The reading incentives, that will also be a game changer. And for those reasons, I don’t want to hold back,” she said.
Conversely, Sen. Robert Myers, R-North Pole, was the only “no” vote on the bill and said that while he and Hughes have similar views, he thinks the designated funding mechanism is unreliable and may be unconstitutional.
The House-passed version of HB 57 only required school districts to set a policy for student cellphone use. The Senate-passed version says that if a district doesn’t have a policy, students are banned from using them in school.
Other changes:

People who want to propose new charter schools can do so at any time of year;
Local school boards must decide charter school applications more quickly, and if an application is rejected, the state school board must act more quickly to decide whether to overrule local officials;
A school board decision to create a charter school can be terminated only for specific reasons; 
School districts must set targets for class sizes. The target for prekindergarten through grade 6 cannot exceed 23 students per class, and the target for 7th through 12th grades cannot exceed 30 students per class.

Asked on Monday whether the governor was willing to allow the revised bill to become law, Tobin said she wasn’t sure. She also said she wasn’t sure whether there would be enough votes to override a prospective veto.
“I’ve been working my ass off, so I’m hopeful,” she said.

In the state with the fourth-largest proven reserves of oil and gas in the U.S., there is a looming energy shortage.
Above the Arctic Circle, oil producers on Alaska’s North Slope send an average of 465,000 barrels of crude oil south each day for shipping to refineries and users around the country and the world.
But in Southcentral Alaska – Anchorage and the surrounding region, home to 63% of the state’s population – utility companies are warning they may not have enough natural gas from current sources to keep the power and heat on without interruption.
As a professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage who studies the economics of natural resources, I can see this apparent contradiction has a straightforward cause but no simple solution.

Declining oil production
The North Slope region once produced nearly 2 million barrels of oil per day at its peak in the 1980s. Every barrel is transported via the 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to the port of Valdez, where it is loaded onto tanker ships.
The state government collects significant taxes and royalties on oil production. For decades, oil revenue allowed the state to fund all government spending without imposing broad-based income, sales or property taxes. At the height of the oil boom, there was so much money that Alaska established a wealth fund, now valued at over US$80 billion, and began distributing dividends to every resident.
But the Trans-Alaska Pipeline is designed to carry oil, not natural gas. A state law prevents producers from burning off excess gas, or flaring, as happens in many fields. With nowhere to send it, gas extracted from Alaska’s oil fields is reinjected into the ground to boost well pressure and push more oil out.
Significant natural gas potential
Alaska’s gas reserves are significant. State estimates suggest the North Slope has about 35 trillion cubic feet of proven reserves. That’s almost as much natural gas as the U.S. as a whole produced in 2023.
But that is just the beginning: The North Slope also has the potential for another 200 trillion cubic feet that remains undiscovered. And improving technologies and techniques may be able to extract another 590 trillion cubic feet, according to the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., a company owned by the state of Alaska that is trying develop a project to extract and sell the state’s natural gas.
As oil production declines and prices remain uncertain, selling gas could provide a different stream of revenue for the state, potentially providing billions of dollars.
The 800-mile problem
For decades, there have been numerous proposals to develop Alaska’s gas. State agencies and the petroleum industry have collectively spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this effort.
The concept that’s closest to reality is Alaska Gasline Development Corp.’s proposal to build a plant on the North Slope to remove gas impurities, a liquefaction plant near Anchorage that could export 20 million tons of liquefied gas each year – around a trillion cubic feet – and an 807-mile pipeline to connect the two.
The cost is expected to be significant: The corporation’s own estimate is that it would cost $44 billion. But that number was developed before the construction sector saw significant inflation in 2022. An engineering study due for release in late 2025 will provide a more updated figure. Alaskans remember that the Trans-Alaska Pipeline ended up costing 25% more than projected.
Since his first day in office, President Donald Trump has touted this pipeline as part of efforts to expand the nation’s production of fossil fuels. He told a joint session of Congress it was a near-ready project, with Japan and South Korea ready to invest “trillions of dollars each.” In February 2025, he stood alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to announce a “joint venture” to develop the pipeline project, but no specific details have been announced.
2 expensive options
There is a growing need to address Alaska’s domestic energy shortfall.
Southcentral Alaska relies on natural gas for more than 70% of its electric and heating needs. But the gas reserves closest to Anchorage, in the Cook Inlet, which have provided energy to the area since the 1960s, are dwindling, and prices are rising. In 2005, wholesale gas prices were $3.75 per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas. By 2024, the price had more than doubled, to $8.75. By contrast, the rest of the U.S. has seen natural gas prices cut in half over that period, thanks in part to horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking.
In 2022, Hilcorp, the company responsible for roughly 85% of the Cook Inlet gas production, reported that by 2027 it might not be able to supply enough gas for utilities that serve the region.
Solutions other than the pipeline are also slow and expensive. Local utilities estimate that improving energy efficiency and developing renewable power could reduce gas demand by around 10% over the next several years and by as much as 15% after a decade. But retrofitting the area’s aging and energy-inefficient homes will not be fast or cheap.
More than just economics
What remains for Alaska are two main options: get gas from the North Slope to Anchorage, or import liquefied gas from the global market.
Building the pipeline could both meet the needs of Alaska’s people and bring in money from global sales – though how much revenue depends on how global gas markets change over time and how competitive Alaska gas prices would be relative to other suppliers.
Any delays from financial, legal, technical or environmental challenges would balloon costs. But if it succeeded, Anchorage-area customers could see prices drop as low as $2.23 per 1,000 cubic feet – a 75% drop from current prices and 40% lower than in 2005. The savings could significantly bolster the region’s economy.
Importing is a costly option. A study commissioned by the Alaska Legislature found that imported gas would cost $13.72 per 1,000 cubic feet. That’s 60% more than current prices and especially burdensome for Alaska families and businesses, which already pay far higher energy bills than typical American customers.
Beyond the economic questions, there’s something symbolic at stake: the state’s identity. Could a state synonymous with energy production become an energy importer? Many Alaskans see the prospect as an embarrassing paradox – akin to Hawaii importing pineapples or New Mexico importing green chiles.
Independence and globalization
Alaska is not alone in grappling with the tension between energy self-sufficiency and economic efficiency.
Across the U.S., states rich in resources have wrestled with the question of whether to prioritize local production or integrate into global markets. Texas produces more oil than any other state, yet it continues to import crude oil due to mismatches between its production and refining capacity.
Shaped by globalization, few regions can truly isolate themselves from market forces. Energy production and consumption are increasingly interconnected, meaning pursuit of local self-sufficiency comes at a steep economic cost. That’s the question facing Alaska: whether to invest in domestic infrastructure to maintain energy independence, or embrace the flexibility – and potentially lower cost – of global markets.

Legislative Bill 316, from State Sen.

It advances a key priority of Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers to restrict products that exceed 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentrations, the compound most commonly associated with getting a person high.
“These compounds are masquerading as hemp but are in fact dangerous synthetic chemicals that have never been tested for consumption in humans,” Kauth said during debate.

‘We need to do something’
The bill advanced 33-13, though at least two supporters — State Sens. Tom Brandt of Plymouth and Ben Hansen of Blair — said the bill would need to be amended to maintain their support and overcome the 33-vote threshold for a filibuster. Three more centrist Democratic lawmakers declined to take a position on the bill: State Sens. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, Jason Prokop of Lincoln and Dan Quick of Grand Island.
Multiple opponents said they preferred the regulatory regime proposed in LB 16 by State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, the lead opponent to Kauth’s bill. Cavanaugh’s bill would need to hitch a ride on a different bill, or “co-opt” LB 316. Cavanaugh filed more than a dozen amendments to LB 316 to try.
“I’m opposed to hijacking other people’s bills, but I put it on here because I think people in this body will agree that we need to do something,” Cavanaugh said.

Cavanaugh described the goal of attacking only “synthetic” products as a “red herring,” “misnomer” and “misdirection” that would cost more than $1.6 million, at least, in state tax revenue at a time the state faces a major projected budget deficit.
However, he said his bill could generate $7.7 million with an improved regulatory system.
‘Health and safety’
State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, who selected LB 316 as his 2025 priority bill, said he repeatedly asked during a public hearing on Kauth’s bill what ingredients are in delta-8 products — a form of THC that is legal in the state under 2018 federal and 2019 state laws. He also asked where the items come from or who is manufacturing them, but “nobody could ever tell me.”
Hilgers was one of 43 lawmakers in 2019 who voted to enact the Nebraska Hemp Farming Act.
Storm said “effective regulation of this industry is impossible” and that the products are “garbage” attached to a little bit of cannabidiol (CBD) to vape, smoke or eat.

Storm said he would never jeopardize “the health or safety of our citizens of this state, especially children and young adults, for revenue.” State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, chair of the Revenue Committee, agreed.
LB 316 would prohibit raw hemp above 0.3% THC of any concentration and for processed hemp the lesser of 0.3% THC on a total weight basis or 10 milligrams per package, effective Jan. 1. The mature stalks of Cannabis sativa and its fiber, oil, cake and any other naturally derived products would not be considered hemp, leaving a narrow legal path for fibers and textiles.
If the bill passed, it would include a “consumer safe harbor period” through the end of 2025 to give consumers time to discard any “illegal hemp” newly defined under LB 316. Legal products would face an additional 10% wholesale tax.
‘Felons of all the grannies’
Cavanaugh and State Sens. George Dungan of Lincoln and Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, all lawyers, said the bill creates a “gray zone” where it’s unclear what would be legal and what would be a misdemeanor or infraction for possession or a more serious felony crime.
They said it could result in a “de facto ban” as a result.
  State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha. Jan. 23, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, a former lawyer and vice chair of the Judiciary Committee that advanced LB 316 in a 5-3 vote, said LB 316 is part of a “felony factory” where products for lotions, creams or dog chew could lead to felony charges, or in the case of gummy-eating “grannies” who she said might have such products “in the back of their medicine cabinet.”
DeBoer said a cousin recently sent her a recipe from “Taste of Home” magazine for slow cooker cannabutter as a joke as LB 316 was set to be debated.
“We’re going to make felons of all the grannies that subscribe to ‘Taste of Home’ magazine,” DeBoer said.
Brandt said it was “ridiculous” that people could face felony criminal possession charges. While he voted for the bill to move forward, he said that if the possession language was not amended, though he could not say to what extent it would need to be changed, he would not support it again.
Under state law, marijuana possession of more than 1 ounce but less than 1 pound is a Class III misdemeanor, while greater amounts are a Class IV felony. Smaller amounts can be up to a Class IIIA misdemeanor with up to a $500 fine or jailing for up to seven days for repeated infractions.

Brandt said he wanted to target “active ingredients” and protect Nebraskans who might have old CBD products at home that were legally purchased.
“This is hemp. This is not marijuana, guys,” Brandt said.
‘Whack-a-mole’ with regulations
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, chair of the Judiciary Committee and a former prosecutor, disagreed with DeBoer and said it was a “clarification” rather than a new penalty.
“You’re playing whack-a-mole with trying to regulate this drug,” Bosn said, saying she opposed any effort to change Kauth’s LB 316 toward Cavanaugh’s LB 16.
Bosn also read information from the AG’s Office that of an estimated 300 THC stores in Nebraska, visitors to each of the ones the AG’s Office purchased from have found at least one unlawful product. The office has filed at least 15 lawsuits, some settled, in that ongoing push.

Cavanaugh said that was why regulations were needed and why “reputable” shop owners wanted new guardrails. His LB 16, in part, would prohibit sales near schools and require testing.
Dungan repeatedly referred to LB 316 as a prohibition-era law, similar to opposition to whiskey or bourbon, that didn’t prevent sales but instead created a “black market.”
“We all know history is a good predictor of the future,” Dungan said.
Medical purposes
Multiple opponents also tried to describe a link between CBD or hemp and medical cannabis legislation. Storm and others supporting LB 316 have sought to limit permissible medical cannabis forms to manufactured products like tinctures, oils or creams, while outlawing sales of cannabis flowers or buds. Dungan said that was hypocritical.
Kauth, Storm and others said LB 316 had nothing to do with medical cannabis and that even more liberal-leaning states have cracked down on THC, hemp and delta-8.

Hansen, whose LB 677 would help implement voter-approved medical cannabis, said he is working on an amendment to LB 316 to protect medical cannabis products. He said he isn’t swayed one way or another on the bill. But he said that for his support, he wanted to explicitly protect the products.
However, getting Hansen’s amendment over the finish line could be tricky around Cavanaugh’s more than a dozen amendments, and multiple motions to kill the bill if his amendments fail. 
Kauth has filed two placeholder amendments that could offer a path for changes requested by Brandt and Hansen.
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha read a letter from a Nebraskan who reached out that CBD and hemp products targeted under LB 316 gave the person’s grandfather a new life, around sleeping pills or other medications, expressing fear that the alternatives could be threatened.
“These aren’t people looking to get high,” Juarez read from the letter. “These are people looking for relief, for dignity and a better quality of life.”

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Some 112 Wisconsin workers died on the job in 2023, the AFL-CIO reported Monday as labor unions marked Workers Memorial Day to highlight workplace dangers.
“When a union is there at the workplace, injuries go down and lives are saved,” said Kevin Gundlach, president of the South Central Federation of Labor, representing union workers in Dane County and surrounding counties.
Workers Memorial Day serves both to remember those who have lost their lives at work as well as “fighting for the living” to have a safe workplace, Gundlach told the Wisconsin Examiner. The date, April 28, coincides with the anniversary of the date that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act took effect 54 years ago.
The AFL-CIO’s analysis draws on 2023 job fatality, injury and illness data along with workplace safety regulation enforcement data for the 12 months ending Sept. 30, 2024.

Of the 112 Wisconsin worker deaths in 2023, 15 were from assaults and other violent acts, 37 from transportation incidents, 17 from falls, 19 from exposures to harmful substances or environments, and 23 from “contact with objects or equipment,” according to the AFL-CIO.

“Every worker in Wisconsin has the right to a safe job,” said Wisconsin AFL-CIO President Stephanie Bloomingdale. “We need collective bargaining rights and strong unions for all to best ensure that safety concerns are adequately and timely addressed in the workplace.”
Union groups around Wisconsin held events, including in Madison, Milwaukee, Eau Claire, La Crosse and Wausau.
At the Madison event, people working in health care, construction, education and as state game wardens came out. There was also testimony on behalf of immigrant workers in the construction industry.
“Many of these workers are exploited and don’t have a union,” Gundlach said. Recent attacks on migrants have made some “fearful to speak up for workplace conditions.”
The event also called attention to workplace violence as a danger, and the need for employers to address workplace safety issues.
In its report, the AFL-CIO criticized the administration of President Donald Trump, which marks its first 100 days this week, for “totally decimating the fabric of what makes government protections work for people through attacks on job safety, public health, union rights and the independence of federal agencies.”

“What I struggle with most is that this is somehow an act of efficiency,” one stakeholder told WyoFile, adding that $40 is returned for every federal dollar invested in service in Wyoming. 
The post DOGE cuts to Americorps ‘a devastating blow to the state of Wyoming’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Following the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency’s order Friday to cancel nearly $400 million in AmeriCorps grants, organizations across Wyoming are preparing for cuts to a wide range of services including alternative education programs, agricultural extension offices, the state’s conservation corps and one community health clinic. 
As the federal agency for national service and volunteerism, AmeriCorps provides funding for organizations that offer community services. In Wyoming, those grants are administered by ServeWyoming, which also acts as a statewide hub for volunteers. 
With Friday’s announcement, however, the Trump administration is now expected to claw back dollars already appropriated by congress. 
More precisely, Wyoming stands to lose roughly $2.4 million in annual grants and scholarships, ServeWyoming Vice Chair Andrea Harrington told WyoFile. That figure doesn’t include matching state grants and individual donations that will also be lost in the process, Harrington said, nor does it reflect the impact it will have across the state. 
“Terminating funding, and thus annihilating these programs, is a devastating blow to the state of Wyoming,” Harrington wrote in a letter to Gov. Mark Gordon and the state’s federal delegation. 
Last year alone, Harrington wrote, Wyoming AmeriCorps members tutored and mentored more than 2,700 children, provided 75,000 hours of service, recruited and deployed more than 3,000 volunteers, served 200 military families and leveraged more than $1.9 million in outside funding from businesses, foundations and other sources in Wyoming. 
“Needs will go unmet in this state due to this decision,” Harrington wrote. 
The move to cut AmeriCorps grants comes amid a push by the Trump administration to shrink the size of the federal government. Wyoming’s delegation has largely backed the undertaking with its highest-ranking member, Sen. John Barrasso, previously lauding it for “addressing reckless and wasteful Washington spending.” 
Others, like Harrington, don’t see the latest round of cuts as a cost savings measure.  
“What I struggle with most is that this is somehow an act of efficiency,” Harrington told WyoFile, adding that $40 is returned for every federal dollar invested in service in Wyoming. 
“How is it efficient to cut these programs?” Harrington said. 
Neither Sens. Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis nor Rep. Harriet Hageman responded to WyoFile’s request for comment. 
“We are still getting information on the implications and the impacts of this announcement,” Michael Pearlman, Gordon’s communication director, told WyoFile in a statement. “Therefore, the governor is going to refrain from commenting at this time.”
Wyoming-based organizations that rely on AmeriCorps funding include: Agricultural Extension Offices, Phorge, SAE International, Teton Science Schools, The Science Zone, Wildflower Learning Community, Wyoming Conservation Corps, Brain Injury Advocates, The Iris Club House, Rooted in Wyoming, The Nicolaysen Art Museum, Lander Free Medical Clinic, Casper Green House Project and GrowWyo/Slow Food Sheridan. 
Up in the air
If the cuts stick, the impacts on programming will vary from a reduction in services to complete elimination, Harrington said. 
For the Wyoming Conservation Corps, the loss of funding for its AmeriCorps programming could be an unrecoverable blow to the 19-year-old organization.
“We hope not,” said John Koprowski, dean of the University of Wyoming’s Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources, which oversees the corps. “All we know right now is that we’ve been asked to pause.”
The “pause” for the Wyoming Conservation Corps means that the statewide AmeriCorps program will not be hiring a new program director. Koprowski had assumed that duty in an interim capacity to cover for an opening unrelated to DOGE. The same goes for all the other open positions and corps members — none are being filled for now. That includes six crew leaders who would have been overseeing five or six AmeriCorps members apiece, he said.
“So you’re looking at dozens of people who are impacted,” Koprowski said.
The impacts of the pause and likely cancellation of grants — the Washington Post reports it’s a “final agency action” that’s “not administratively appealable” — will extend to the organizations, federal agencies and businesses that worked with the Wyoming Conservation Corps.
“They’re fixing fences, trails, clearing debris from forests, reducing fire risk, all those kinds of good things,” Koprowski said.
Inspired by the work, oftentimes service members have gone on to build their careers and lives in the Equality State, he said. “They often become professionals here in the state,” Koprowski said. “Wyoming grows on them, and they become Wyomingites.” (Disclosure: WyoFile Reporter Mike Koshmrl who contributed to this story served as a City of Lakes Americorps volunteer in Minnesota in 2008.)
That applies to Harrington, who described her time of service with the Wyoming Conservation Corps as setting “the trajectory of my life” in her letter to the governor and the federal delegation. 
“My time of service not only made it possible for me to further my education and work experience in the state, but it also planted the seed that grew into my desire to put roots in this state, to work in this state, and to raise my family here,” wrote Harrington, who now works as an attorney. 
Federal funding for the Wyoming Conservation Corps was administered by ServeWyoming. WyoFile was unable to reach ServeWyoming’s executive director on Monday afternoon.
“It’s funding that’s been awarded already,” Koprowski said. “We’ve been told, ‘No, you should pause and you can’t move forward.’ What this means for us long-term, one can only guess.”

In Jackson Hole, the historic Teton Science Schools is in a similar situation. Since 2009, the place-based education organization has housed AmeriCorps members to help with teaching and to assist with an array of projects in the community.
“We became one of the statewide hubs for AmeriCorps, and part of that is because we have a great program,” Teton Science Schools Executive Director Wayne Turner told WyoFile. “This year we have 19 community partners in the valley.”
On Monday, ServeWyoming informed Teton Science Schools that its grant was “terminated” and that they should “pause the program,” Turner said. “Which we are doing.” 
Teton Science Schools has deployed three cohorts of AmeriCorps members, each about 15 people, annually. Historically, many of those service members have gone on to build careers in outdoor education. Some stick around Teton County and climb the ranks at Teton Science Schools.
“This is the beginning of their career,” Turner said. “Since we’ve been doing this in 2009, there’s been over 500 AmeriCorps volunteers who have come through Teton Science Schools.”

Other organizations across the state often depend on AmeriCorps VISTA members, who serve full time for one year and help with things like fundraising, grant writing, research and volunteer recruitment. This work, Harrington said, fills a costly void for organizations. 
VISTA members currently serving in Wyoming were told their positions have been terminated, effectively immediately, Harrington said.  
“It’s a slap in the face to people who’d decided to dedicate a year of life to serving and bettering their communities,” she said. “Now they’re being hung out to dry.” 
Still, Harrington said she’s cautiously optimistic Wyoming’s delegation will come through, particularly Barrasso who she said has shown repeated support for such programs. 
Plus, she said the Administrative Procedure Act allows for a seven-day objection period, and Harrington said she expects a challenge to be filed. 
“They’re not following the rules,” she said.

(Photos courtesy of the Doña Ana County Detention Center)Federal authorities arrested a former New Mexico magistrate judge and his wife on April 24 on criminal charges of evidence tampering related to the prosecution of an alleged gang member from Venezuela.
The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday announced it had charged former Doña Ana County Magistrate Jose Luis “Joel” Cano with one count of evidence tampering and his wife Nancy Cano with one count of conspiracy to tamper with evidence.
Prosecutors allege that Jose Cano told Homeland Security Investigations agents that he had destroyed a cell phone belonging to Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, a Venezuelan national prosecutors allege has ties to the Tren de Aragua gang.
HSI in February searched the Canos’ home and arrested Ortega-Lopez for illegal possession of guns and ammunition, according to the DOJ’s news release. The DOJ said agents seized three of Ortega-Lopez’s cell phones, but he told them about a fourth one, which prompted another search wherein Cano allegedly admitted to destroying it with a hammer.
“Judges are responsible for upholding our country’s laws. It is beyond egregious for a former judge and his wife to engage in evidence tampering on behalf of a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member accused of illegally possessing firearms,” U.S. Attorney Ryan Ellison for the District of New Mexico said in a statement. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office is committed to dismantling this foreign terrorist organization by disrupting its criminal operations in New Mexico. That starts by prosecuting those who support gang members — including judges.”
The DOJ announced the charges against the Canos in the same news release in which they announced the arrest of a Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan for allegedly allowing a Mexican immigrant charged with domestic violence to temporarily avoid arrest by federal agents.
“The allegations against Judge Dugan and Judge Cano are serious: no one, least of all a judge, should obstruct law enforcement operations,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “Doing so imperils the safety of our law enforcement officers and undermines the rule of law. The Department of Justice will continue to follow the facts — no one is above the law.”
In the New Mexico case, immigration authorities arrested Ortega-Lopez in December 2023 in Texas for unlawfully entering the U.S., and released him in April 2024 because of overcrowding at the detention center where he was being held, according to court records.
An anonymous source in January tipped off the Homeland Security Investigations office in Las Cruces that Ortega-Lopez and two others were living in an apartment behind the Canos’ home, an HSI special agent wrote in an application for a search warrant.
The Judicial Standards Commission on March 5 petitioned the Supreme Court to suspend Cano for allegedly committing misconduct by allowing three members of the gang to live on his property in Las Cruces and to have access to firearms.
In a response, Jose Cano wrote to the Supreme Court justices that Ortega-Lopez told Nancy Cano that the trio “all had their legal papers to remain in the U.S. pending their Asylum Court hearings, which were already scheduled,” and that he had verified their court dates.
Jose Cano resigned as a magistrate judge on March 21, according to court records. The New Mexico Supreme Court on April 22 barred Cano from holding any judicial office or exercising any judicial authority. 
Both Canos are scheduled for preliminary and detention hearings Tuesday morning in federal court in Las Cruces.

UW-Madison Engineering Hall. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)University of Wisconsin international students’ visa terminations are being reversed by the Trump administration after many judges across the country blocked the actions, including in Wisconsin.
Dozens of UW students were part of a group of thousands of international students in the U.S. who had their visas abruptly cancelled without notice from the federal government and without a chance to challenge the decision. 
According to a Politico report Friday, the Trump administration said in federal court it was reversing course and reinstating visas for many international students and alumni. A Justice Department attorney said, according to the report, that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is “developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations, and that the records for students “will remain active or shall be reactivated if not currently active, and ICE will not modify the record solely based on the [National Crime Information Center] finding that resulted in the recent SEVIS record termination.” The attorney also emphasized that ICE still has the authority to terminate a SEVIS record for other reasons.
The American Immigration Law Association estimates there were about 4,700 affected students across the country. 
UW-Madison said in a statement Monday that each of the 27 cancellations for its international students and alumni were reversed as of late afternoon Saturday, and that affected students and alumni will be able to continue their studies or post-graduation training at UW-Madison as a result.
Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin said in the statement that she was “relieved and grateful” for the development. 
“This situation was deeply troubling, upended lives and created both fear and harm,” Mnookin said. “I want to personally thank the many members of our community, along with local, state and federal officials, who worked to assist our students.”
Reported reversals started Thursday and continued through the weekend, according to UW-Madison, and similar to the cancellations, there was no explanation for the records being restored.
The institution said that it has notified the students of the most recent change to their records and that International Student Services and International Faculty and Staff Services are continuing to provide information, resources and support.
“We are pleased to see that all of our affected students and alumni have had their SEVIS records returned to active status, as it has been a difficult period for all involved,” UW- Madison International Division Dean Frances Vavrus said in a statement. “We will continue to follow this evolving situation closely throughout the summer and upcoming academic year.”
Universities of Wisconsin spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in an email that there have been “a number of reversals at our universities” and that the situation remains “fluid.”
Reversals come after judges in cases across at least 23 states had issued emergency orders temporarily blocking the government’s action including in Wisconsin.
In one case, Krish Lal Isserdasani, a 21-year-old computer engineering senior from India, had his SEVIS record terminated less than a month before he was scheduled to graduate from UW-Madison. His case had noted that Isserdasani and his family have spent about $240,000 on his education at UW-Madison and he could lose $17,500 on the current semester’s tuition and would be responsible for four months of rent despite not being able to stay in the country. Isserdasani had also reported a significant psychological impact, including “difficulty in sleeping and fear that he will be placed in immediate detention and deportation.” U.S. District Judge William Conley had temporarily blocked his visa cancellation. 
In another case last week, Conley said that the government had wrongly cancelled Yue “Alison” Yang, a UW-Madison student from China, and granted her protection from deportation. 
Despite the step back by the Trump administration, the ACLU of Wisconsin is calling for injunctive relief from federal courts. The ACLU of Wisconsin filed an amicus curiae brief in two cases challenging the revocations, including Isserdasani’s case and a case recently brought by three anonymous international UW-Madison students, saying the issue isn’t “moot.”
Tim Muth, senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Wisconsin, said that “resorting to the courts is continuing to be an important check on actions that this administration is taking without regard to the human consequences on persons like the student in this case.”
In an amicus curiae brief, Muth wrote that the reversal offers “little protection” for plaintiffs and urged the Court to issue a ruling that “declaring such terminations, without due process and without compliance with applicable law and regulation, to be illegal.”
“It is clear that the recent pivot by the federal government should not moot these 100+ cases pending around the country since they are clearly able to be reversed immediately after dismissal of suits challenging them, and the present likelihood of irreparable injury to the Plaintiffs remains a going concern,” Muth wrote in the amicus curiae.
Muth told the Wisconsin Examiner that the reversals are a sign of the Trump administration’s “losing record” in these cases, but said it’s difficult to trust the Trump administration on immigration matters. 
“It’s not as if the Department of Homeland Security issued a press release or a formal statement announcing a change in policy,” Muth said. “What we had were a couple of attorneys in a couple of different cases saying the government is reactivating student status in SEVIS… Nothing official… has come out from the government. No statement of ‘Oh, we made a mistake on these 4,700 students, and we’re going to correct it. We’re so sorry.’” 
Muth said that during a hearing Monday in Isserdasani’s case Conley asked the government’s lawyer if she was authorized to say that a termination of Isserdasani SEVIS status wouldn’t happen again under the “new policy that supposedly they are developing.” 
“The government’s lawyer was unable to say that it wouldn’t happen again,” Muth said. “That is why the ACLU and… lawyers for international students around the country are saying there continues to be the need for courts to step in until there’s some legally binding correction made by the government.”
Muth said the law is “pretty clear” about when international students can lose their status. Those cases include when someone is no longer a full time student, when someone is engaging in employment that isn’t authorized by the law, lying to ICE or committing a crime of violence. He said things like traffic citations or an arrest for a charge that has been dismissed (as in the case of Isserdasani) are not authorized reasons for terminating somebody’s F1 visa status. 
“It is not something that can just be done unilaterally because the government has decided it wants to have fewer international students,” Muth said. 
The brief notes that students were provided with “vague boilerplate reasons” for their visa termination. In Isserdasani’s case, he received an email that said he was “otherwise failing to maintain status” and that he was “identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.” It states that the reasoning does not satisfy due process requirements because it doesn’t describe a student’s circumstances and students are not provided with the opportunity to defend themselves. 
In the brief, Muth also notes the recent case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident who was erroneously deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, saying that the visa cancellations for international students are part of a larger pattern of the Trump administration ignoring the due process rights — which includes being entitled to notice and the opportunity to be heard — of noncitizens. 
“The due process protections of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution are protections, not just for U.S. citizens, but they are protections for everyone residing in this country — that right not to be arbitrarily arrested, detained, kicked out of the country,” Muth said. 
Muth said he didn’t know what new policy the Trump administration could be developing.
“If they’re talking about coming up with a policy that would allow them to terminate SEVIS records in that situation, I think they would be violating the existing law set up by Congress,” Muth said. “People are entitled to what they didn’t get here, which is, if you’re going to terminate my status, tell me why, and give me a chance to object if what you are doing is contrary to law or contrary to what the facts are.”

Senate File 383, passed 36-14, is the legislation passed through the committee process earlier this year limiting certain PBM business practices. Pharmacy benefit managers are companies that serve as the negotiator between drug manufacturers, pharmacies and health insurance companies for setting prescription drug costs.
The legislation would set new regulations for PBMs, including requiring pharmacies to be reimbursed for the national or state average acquisition cost of a drug — a higher reimbursement rate than many pharmacies are currently receiving, according to several workers and owners of current rural pharmacies.
Many components of the bill deal with PBM practices to pressure or force consumers to use certain pharmacies to fill a prescription. The bill specifically prohibits PBM strategies like setting different cost-sharing rates or implementing financial advantages or penalties for the use of certain pharmacies to fill a prescription. It also restricts other methods of PBMs limiting the use of certain pharmacies if that provider has agreed to participate in a person’s health benefit plan.

Earlier in the legislative session, pharmacists and supporters told lawmakers the bill would help Iowa pharmacies stay in business, linking the closure of many locally owned, rural pharmacies in recent years to PBM practices that favor mail-order prescription refills and certain pharmacy chains.
The bill was amended by the Senate Monday to define “retail pharmacies” and “pharmacy chains.” The Senate amendment also makes some changes to the language about how rebates received by a PBM on drugs are returned to a health benefit plan to reduce insurance premiums.
The bill’s floor manager Sen. Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, said the legislation was important to him because of his own experience having medicine for his father, which could only be filled by a mail-order pharmacy, get lost in the mail. He said ensuring rural pharmacies in Iowa stay in business is necessary to help keep Iowans healthy, saying local pharmacies can help address problems and adjust to the medical needs of people in their community in real time.
“We need to have a conversation about what rural health care looks like in Iowa,” Klimesh said. “And one of those main talking points about rural health care in Iowa is not only just a clinic you go to to get your check up, or the hospital you see, but the next step in that in that phase — which is the pharmacy, the pharmacy to fill your prescription.”
Many local pharmacies have closed in recent years, which Klimesh said was largely due to unfair business practices by PBMs. More than 150 Iowa pharmacies have closed in the past 10 years, and 31 closed in 2024, according to the Iowa Pharmacy Association. Klimesh said if the Legislature does not pass a bill regulating and PBM practices and improving transparency, “we are setting (Iowans) up for having no access to a pharmacy.”
“I lost four alone in my district, and once they close, they’re not going to reopen,” Klimesh said. “So this bill is a great step in the right direction to provide transparency.”
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said she supported a measure to restrict PBM business practices, but said Senate Republicans’ amended legislation would lead to consumer cost increases. She introduced an amendment that would require negotiated drug manufacture rebates exclusively go to reducing health care plan premiums. Her proposal also would require pharmacies with five or less organizations and pharmacies that are the only entity able to fill a prescription in their community receive a $10.68 dispensing fee for every prescription they fill.
Trone Garriott said she believed Klimesh’s amended bill would lead to significantly increased health insurance costs for Iowans, while her amendment would ensure Iowans do not lose access to health coverage because of efforts to regulate PBMs.
“(The amendment) does increase prices on consumers, it does increase prices on Iowa,” Trone Garriott said. “The amendment that I am presenting today has a much smaller increase. When we compare $160 increase to $6 increase, that’s a pretty big difference when it comes to folks who are working so hard to make ends meet. We have to take seriously that the PBMs have promised they’re going to pass the cost along to the consumers, and we want to shield the people of Iowa from increased costs, while protecting our small town and rural pharmacies.”
Klimesh called Trone Garriott’s amendment “PBM reform light.” He said the issues she brought up with rebates were already addressed in his amendment, stating a transparency provision in the bill “forces all rebates to flow back to the plan payer,” and said the Democratic senator’s amendment did not address issues with spread price manipulation, where PBMs charge payers like Medicaid more than a pharmacy is paid for a medication.
Trone Garriott’s amendment failed, while Klimesh’s amendment was adopted. The amended legislation heads to the House for further consideration. The House passed a companion version of the legislation through the committee process in March, but has not yet had floor debate on the measure.

Should the “governor’s mansion” be converted into a roller rink? What about a dorm for legislators with children?
Those were a couple of ideas legislators brought up in the Senate on Monday before the body voted 23-27 against Senate Joint Resolution 45, which called for a study to determine a use for the vacant executive residence.
Historically, the governors of Montana have resided in the “governor’s mansion,” a 12,000 square foot home at 2 N. Carson St. that’s part of the Capitol Complex.
But Gov. Greg Gianforte has his own residence in Helena, the official executive residence has been vacant for at least three years, and it’s in disrepair, according to reports to legislative committees.
In 2019 and 2021, the Montana Legislature appropriated a total $2.3 million for upgrades, but bids for upgrades came in higher, as much as $3.6 million instead, according to state officials.
In the meantime, resolution sponsor Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena, said maintenance is costing taxpayers $100,000 a year, and it’s time for a plan.
Legislators have said interest in the property is high, at least among the citizens of Helena and some history lovers.
“We have, as you recall, $2.3 million sitting in an account that’s not being used to renovate, in some way, this building,” Dunwell said.
In a separate bill that didn’t pass earlier this session, Dunwell had suggested the residence be used as a rental for legislative staff, with priority for those with disabilities.
At the time, at least one member of the Senate State Administration Committee suggested a study might be in order instead.
On the floor Monday, Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, said it’s clear the building just needs to be torn down, and he shared one idea to save maintenance money.
“I’ll do the maintenance for $50,000 a year,” Hertz said.
Sen. Jacinda Morigeau, D-Arlee, reminded the Senate of another related plan.
In January 2024, the Governor’s Office said Gov. Greg Gianforte and Susan Gianforte bought the historic Hauser Mansion in Helena, and they plan to donate it to the state “following my service.”
But Morigeau said legislators can help the governor decide what to do with the Carson Street mansion, and she encouraged senators to vote yes on the study.
“I want to see it turned into – I don’t know – a roller rink?” Morigeau said.
Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, said he thought a dorm for legislators would be great, and he’d call dibs on a room.
Although the Senate opposed the study, Sen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, said the Capitol Complex Advisory Council already meets about the area, the group includes legislators, and the question doesn’t require an entire study.
“It’s not like the legislature does not have a voice in this. We do,” McKamey said.
However, in committee earlier this month, McKamey also noted the history contained in the house.
She mentioned some “two dozen hand needle-pointed chairs,” which she said need to be preserved. Dunwell said she had been advised the chairs were in storage.
In the hearing about the resolution, the Senate State Administration Committee heard the cost of getting the residence in shape — between $3.2 million and $3.6 million.
Director Misty Ann Giles had offered a piece of advice for anyone walking around in the unoccupied “governor’s mansion” owned by the state.
“If you do go over there, please don’t take off your shoes,” said Giles, head of the Department of Administration.
The carpet is from the 1950s, the plumbing is shot, the kitchen is “barely functional,” it needs $180,000 worth of asbestos abatement, and the committee learned more about the general “disarray” at the hearing.
In response, Sen. Bob Phalen, R-Lindsay, had a question of his own to state officials.
“So how much would you take for it?” Phalen asked.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Montana-Gov-Mansion-postcard-1024x632.jpg,,,2025-04-28 21:01:04.682043

This voting location is one of the most popular in the county. (Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)Seattle voters will be asked in August if they want to continue paying for the city’s democracy voucher program — a first-of-its-kind public campaign-financing system that gives voters money to donate to political candidates.
Seattle voters created the program in 2015, along with a 10-year property tax levy to fund it. The voucher program aims to make election financing more diverse and equitable by giving voters four $25 coupons they can give to city of Seattle candidates during elections.
Ten years after it was created, city officials say the program has been a success. On Monday, the Seattle City Council voted unanimously to send a property tax levy renewal to the August ballot that would fund the program for another decade.
If passed, the levy would cost the median homeowner about $13 a year and raise about $45 million over 10 years. The figure is about $15 million higher than the expiring levy to account for inflation and increased candidate participation in the program.
City Council members praised the program across the board, with several saying they’d seen the positive impact firsthand during their own runs for office.
“For me, this specifically meant that I didn’t need to take campaign donations that I felt might have implicit strings attached,” said Councilmember Dan Strauss. “This allowed me to be more independent, and it meant that I actively chose to knock on everyday Seattleites’ doors rather than spending time on the phone, calling political donors.”
Many Councilmembers said the program is especially important in light of threats to democracy at the national level and the growing influence of wealth in politics.
“Our democracy is at risk,” said Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck. “We must take every step here in Seattle to protect it, because in a healthy democracy, billionaires can’t buy elections.”
Most democracy vouchers go unused. A study by researchers at Stony Brook and Georgetown University found that participation among the voting-age population declined from 7.59% in the 2021 election to 4.72% in 2023.
City Council member Cathy Moore noted that there remains a need to educate people about the program, particularly in communities where English is not the primary language.
Candidates in the races for Seattle mayor, city attorney and three Council seats are eligible for democracy vouchers this year.

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa farmers had just over two days suitable for field work last week due to rainy conditions, but the percentages of corn and soybean acres planted remain ahead of average rates, according to the state’s crop progress and condition report.
State Climatologist Justin Glisan said Iowa had “an unseasonably wet reporting period” with the average precipitation for the week above 2 inches and more than 5 inches in some areas of the state. 
The precipitation raised soil moisture conditions, making topsoil conditions 86% adequate or wetter. Subsoil conditions rated 67% adequate moisture.

Thirty-four percent of Iowa’s corn acres and 25% of soybean acres are in the ground, which is up from 18% and 11% respectively from last week. Northwest Iowa has the highest percentages of crops in the group. 
Temperatures for the reporting period of April 21 through April 27 averaged in the mid 50s, which is 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit higher than normal.

Iowa oat farmers are almost finished seeding as more than 80% of oat acres have been planted, though only 41% of anticipated oat acres have emerged, which is three days behind the year prior.
Pastures in Iowa rated 91% fair or better and according to the report, some cow calf pairs across the state were put on pasture.  
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the upcoming warm temperatures and potential break in rain events should “give farmers a window to get in the field.” The secretary also noted the Monday night forecast, which shows a potential for severe weather in the state. 
“This is a good reminder to Iowans to be vigilant, have safety plans in place and be ready to take shelter if needed,” Naig said in a statement.

March 3, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers scheduled three eastern Nebraska public forums this weekend to allow the public to weigh in on medical cannabis and proposed state legislation.
State Sens. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue and Ben Hansen of Blair plan to host the series this Saturday in La Vista, Sunday in Omaha and Monday in Lincoln. Attendants will be able to hear updates on the status of medical cannabis legislation, namely Hansen’s Legislative Bill 677, and “share their thoughts.”
The schedule is as follows:

Saturday, May 3, from 1-3 p.m. at the Carpenters Union Hall in La Vista (10761 Virginia Plaza, La Vista).
Sunday, May 4, from 1-3 p.m., at the University of Nebraska at Omaha Thompson Alumni Center (8800 Dodge St., Omaha).
Monday, May 5, from 5-7 p.m., at Southeast Community College (8800 O St., Lincoln).

The hosts plan to accommodate everyone who wishes to speak during the two-hour events.

In November, about 71% of Nebraskans legalized medical cannabis with a physician’s recommendation, and 67% of Nebraskans voted for a regulatory scheme.
“Since the legislature has failed to act at this point, I want to give the citizens an opportunity to have their voices heard by their elected representatives,” Cavanaugh told the Nebraska Examiner.
General Affairs Committee
Hansen’s LB 677 seeks to help the ballot measures build better guardrails, with help from supporters who put the measures on the ballot.
His bill would delay full implementation of the regulatory law to give the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission time to craft regulations that, without funding, officials have said is near impossible to get done by the voter-set July 1 deadline or begin licensing by Oct. 1.
LB 677 has stalled in the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee that Holdcroft chairs. Cavanaugh is the vice chair.
Holdcroft, who has said he would support a narrowed LB 677, said he is looking for “back and forth” at the public forums, such as whether to allow smoking or how many dispensaries should be permitted.
At an April 17 meeting of committee members, the committee considered a narrower committee amendment that sought to create a list of qualifying conditions, restrict who can recommend medical cannabis, exclude smoking as permissible for medical cannabis and prohibit sales of natural cannabis flower or bud.
None of the eight committee members tried to attach the amendment to LB 677. Advancing the bill as-is failed along ideological lines, 3-5.

Five days later, Hansen filed an amendment to add post-traumatic stress disorder as a qualifying condition and allow sales of flower and bud, the latter of which is a line in the sand for Hansen. Hansen also filed what is known as a “pull motion” that would advance LB 677, with at least 25 votes in the full 49-member legislative body and start the three-round debate.
The latest Hansen amendment would not allow smoking.
Holdcroft and Hansen continue to discuss whether a path forward in the committee exists. Speaker John Arch of La Vista, who sets the daily legislative agenda, declined to say if he would schedule the pull motion as those discussions continue.
‘Uphold the voice of the people’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, said her team is “very appreciative” of lawmakers’ efforts to give voters a chance to voice their feelings on the issue.
“While we find it disheartening that Nebraskans are being asked to ‘clarify their vote,’ we hope this final effort makes it clear: Nebraskans support medical cannabis. They knew what they were voting for,” Eggers said. “They now are demanding lawmakers to uphold the voice of the people.”
LB 677 faces a tight timeline and fiscal situation in the waning days of the 2025 legislative session. Debate on the state’s budget bills — with a major hole to still fill — is set to begin May 6. The final budget must pass by May 15.
Lawmakers are set to adjourn for the year on June 9.
Also co-hosting the public forums are State Sens. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, John Fredrickson of Omaha, Jane Raybould of Lincoln, Victor Rountree of Bellevue, Margo Juarez of Omaha, Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, Megan Hunt of Omaha, Myron Dorn of Adams, Merv Riepe of Ralston, Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, Tom Brandt of Plymouth, George Dungan of Lincoln and Danielle Conrad of Lincoln.

 | ScreenshotWith Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan opting against seeking a fourth term in pursuit of the governor’s seat, Detroit is in need of a new mayor. On Saturday  seven hopeful candidates met at Riverside Marina to introduce themselves and make their case for why they were the best qualified to lead the city. 
Former nonprofit CEO Saunteel Jenkins, attorney Todd Perkins, former police Chief James Craig, businessmen Joel Haashiim, City Councilmember Fred Durhal III, entrepreneur Jonathan Barlow and City Council President Mary Sheffield each took time to flex their qualifications while taking questions on how they would work to support the city’s residents and address its most pressing issues, alongside their plans to maintain vital programs when the state’s American Rescue Plan Act funding expires at the end of 2026. 
Triumph Church Pastor Rev. Solomon Kinloch, Jr. and two-time mayoral candidate Danetta Simpson have also filed to run in the Aug. 5 mayoral primary, though the two were not present at Saturday’s forum.
During the forum candidates were asked to name the city’s biggest problem and what they would do to address it, with candidates pointing to economic opportunity, housing, public safety and empowering residents through education and opportunities within Detroit neighborhoods as the issues at the top of their mind. 
Several candidates also called attention to the need for affordable childcare, following a question on how they would uplift women of color within the city.
“When we talk about some of the issues that our women face, particularly here in the city of Detroit, I will tell you, as a father who drops his son off at daycare, childcare is too expensive,” Durhal said. 
“Paying $2,000 a month to have childcare for your children is crazy. And so imagine if you are a single parent, mother or father, and you have to go to work, you have to take your child to daycare. You have to rush there. You gotta get there before six o’clock and they charge you a premium if you don’t. This is reality,” Durhal said. 
The candidates were also asked how they’d maintain programs, services and jobs created using more than $800 million in COVID-19 relief funds which are set to run out at the end of 2026.

Jenkins said the next mayor will need to dig into the numbers to make sure the city has enough revenues, alongside working with the state and the federal government — “whether they like it or not.”
Perkins called for a full scale audit of the city, as did Craig and Haashim. 
However, Perkins said he wasn’t afraid to take Lansing or the White House to court to ensure the city receives any funding it is due. 
“Whether it be the United States America versus or Perkins Law Group versus, I’ve been on one side of that ‘v’, and I’m not afraid of confrontation because out of confrontation and discord, we get understanding,” Perkins said.
Craig said he would leverage his ties to the White House, with Craig previously drawing praise from President Donald Trump for his leadership amid Black Lives Matter protests in Summer of 2020.
The city later agreed to a $1 million settlement after protestors filed federal lawsuits arguing the Detroit Police Department used unconstitutional and excessive force and prevented the protestors from exercising their First Amendment rights. 
“This is about the city of Detroit. It has nothing to do with the person sitting in the White House or James Craig. It has everything to do with the city of Detroit,” Craig said. 
Amid talk of forensic audits of the city’s budget, Durhal encouraged his fellow candidates to watch him chair the city’s Budget, Finance and Audit Standing Committee, where they will review audits from the auditor general. 
The council has already begun taking steps to convert jobs added through federal funding into permanent positions, Durhal said, but the next mayor will also need to be brave enough to tell people that they must remain fiscally prudent.
Sheffield noted that under her leadership the city had passed 12 balanced budgets, and that she would work with private and philanthropic support to see how the city could continue some of its grant programs.
“Our day one intention is to join a coalition with our local hospitals — because there’s a correlation between health and housing — to create a pot of money that can continue funding home repair grants here in the city of Detroit,” Sheffield said. 
She also said the city needed to diversify its revenues including working with  the federal government and bipartisan leadership in Lansing. 
Barlow touted his business connections and relationships with political leaders like Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens.
“No one behind me can tell you where they sit at on the yachts down in Mar a Lago or down in Miami. I’m the only one who’s taking a yacht from this marina all the way down to Miami. That’s because we play at a different level when we don’t get involved in petty popularity politics at the local level,” Barlow said, later arguing the city could better assess its assets.
Detroit residents will vote in the nonpartisan primary election on Aug. 5, and the candidates with the two highest vote totals will face off once more in the Nov. 4 general election.

Office of Equal Opportunity officially eliminated 
Morrisey approved Senate Bill 837, sponsored by Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, that will formally eliminate the state’s Office of Equal Opportunity by repealing its mandate in state code. The office was tasked with complying with federal disability rights and investigated discrimination and harassment claims from public employees.
While vetting the bills, members of the House of Delegates learned that the OEO seemed to already be gone without lawmakers’ required approval. The office doesn’t have any employees or a website. 
Lawmakers opted to keep the office’s director position within the Division of Personnel, though the position is currently vacant. Rucker said the bill was an effort to streamline state government since the OEO’s work was already being done by the Division of Personnel. 
Morrisey also signed another measure sponsored by Rucker that will terminate the “Employee Suggestion Award Board” by terminating five sections of code, including a program that provides cash or honorary awards to state employees whose adopted suggestions result in substantial savings or improvement in state operations.
“We heard that this is not really helping the state. We were very hopeful when this got passed years ago that employees would be able to give us ideas that would really significantly find waste and we could reduce cost to the state. But that is not what has happened,” Rucker said during bill debate March 20 in the Senate. “Unfortunately, It has been years since there’s been a single suggestion.”
Rucker said they encouraged state agencies to still accept suggestions from employees regarding cost savings. 
New law rolls back teen work permit requirement  
The governor signed Senate Bill 427 that will roll back work permit requirements for 14- and 15-year olds in West Virginia. The bill is sponsored by Sen. Rupie Phillips, R-Logan. 
Current state law requires 14- and 15-year-olds who want to work to get a permit from their school superintendent; the new law, which goes into effect in July, no longer requires that permit. 
Employers seeking to hire the teenagers will still be required to obtain an age certificate verifying the child’s age from the state Division of Labor and the written consent of the child’s parent or guardian. 
The age certificate would include the child’s age, name and date of birth, as well as information about the job they’re seeking, among other things.
Controversial DEI bill not yet signed 
The governor still hasn’t signed off on a number of high-profile Republican-backed measures from this year’s legislative session, including a bill tightening the state’s already-strict ban on gender-affirming care for minors and a measure requiring school employees to alert parents when a child requests to be referred to by a different name or pronouns that are different from the student’s biological sex.
While Morrisey issued an executive order eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs in state government, he hasn’t yet signed a bill that would codify that order. The measure is facing a potential legal challenge after the Senate’s Democratic members said the bill was not legally passed on the final night of session because of a “series of procedural irregularities.”

Greg Gianforte signs House Bill 337 into law, giving Montanans a $756 million income tax cut over the next four years. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Surrounded by three dozen Republican lawmakers on the steps of the Montana capitol, Gov. Greg Gianforte on Monday signed into law a bill cutting income taxes — the third reduction over the five years of his administration. 
House Bill 337, sponsored by House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage, lowers Montana’s top tax rate by .5% over two years, expands the eligibility threshold for filers to pay the state’s lower tax rate, and doubles the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
“Once again this legislative session, we’re putting money back in Montanan’s pockets through permanent, long term tax reductions, and we couldn’t have done it without the legislators that are here with me today,” Gianforte said before affixing his signature to the new law. 
Calling it the “largest tax cut in Montana’s history,” Gianforte said decreasing the top tax rate was a step closer to his goal of having a single, flat rate in the state, which he said will make the state more friendly to businesses and individuals. 
“We still have the highest income tax rate in the region and one of the highest in the nation. It’s a drag on our economy, a wet blanket on job creation and a burden on Montana families,” Gianforte said. 
While the governor focused most of his remarks on the reduction of the top tax rate from 5.9% to 5.4% over the next biennium, Ler remarked that the bill’s “real power comes from how we’ve restructured the entire system.”
The threshold where Montana filers move between the state’s two income brackets is substantially raised under the new law — essentially tripling the income individuals and joint filers can earn before paying a higher rate. The law also doubles the state’s earned income credit, which targets the state’s lowest earners. 
“This is reform that reaches everyone,” Ler said. “We didn’t get here overnight. This bill is a result of careful policy work and a clear vision that is a shared belief that Montanans deserve a tax code that works for them, not against them.”

The three changes made to the state’s tax structure will reduce the revenue flowing to the state’s general fund by roughly $756 million by fiscal year 2029, according to a fiscal analysis of the legislation, which was a major sticking point for detractors. 
Sen. Dave Fern, D-Whitefish, said the bill was “well meaning, but it’s just too expensive,” during debate on the Senate floor. Fern brought his own income tax bill aimed at lower and middle class earners that carried a lower fiscal note but didn’t make it through the House.
The bill passed both chambers with all Democrats in opposition on their initial votes, and just two Democrats voting for the bill overall. 
“Government does not exist to give tax cuts to people who do not need them. Government exists to fund schools, fix roads, and provide public safety. Democrats do not support robbing people of essential services to pay for tax cuts for people who absolutely do not need them,” House Appropriations Committee Vice Chairperson Rep. Mary Caferro, D-Helena, said in a press release. “The public is not crying out for more tax cuts for people at the top.”
Gianforte proposed an even larger tax break in his budget last November, which would have cut the top tax rate by a full percentage point without adjusting the lower rate threshold. The new law emerged as a compromise between the governor’s plan and one championed by the conservative wing of the senate. 
“I’ve heard loud and clear from Montanans in every corner of our state, income tax relief is a top priority, and I’m incredibly proud of each person up here for helping deliver that needed relief,” Gianforte said. 
The Legislature wrapped up its 83rd day in Helena on Monday, and is expected to adjourn later this week after the final details are hammered out on a package of property tax relief proposals.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gov_income_signing-1024x703.jpg,,,2025-04-28 20:06:06.666158

(Photo via Getty Images)Iowa schools would have to show ultrasound videos and computer-generated graphics on fetal development in Iowa classrooms under legislation sent to the governor’s desk Monday.
Senate File 175, approved 33-16, would require human growth and development classes for Iowa students in grades 5-12 include ultrasound video and computer-generated rendering or animations depicting “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization.”
 This measure was modeled after laws in other states and similar bills brought up in previous sessions that referenced the “Meet Baby Olivia” video created by anti-abortion group Live Action, though the 2025 legislation does not mention the video by name.
The bill was amended by the House April 17 to ban materials on fetal development from being shown in classrooms if the entity that created it performs or “promotes” abortions, or if it contracts, affiliates, or makes referrals to organizations that perform or promote abortions.
Democrat in both chambers said this amendment would lead to inaccurate and biased material being shown in Iowa classrooms, as most of the medical organizations that work on issues related to pregnancy and fetal development perform or provide referrals for abortions when medically necessary. The measure only refers to “abortion” at large, and does not exclude entities that only perform medically necessary abortions, such as in cases when the pregnancy puts the life of the mother at risk.
The Mayo Clinic, a Minnesota-based health care provider, was brought up as an organization that would be excluded from school material under the bill despite being a leading professional source on fetal development.
Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, also argued that material from the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics would be excluded, as the UI hospital system performs abortions to save the life of the pregnant person. Wahls also said material developed by other UI entities like the proposed “center for intellectual freedom” would also be excluded, as it is “affiliated” with UIHC.
“I think it’s very clear that by being an affiliate of an entity that performs abortions — and that is something that happens at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics — research, human-based, age-appropriate curriculum that was being developed at the University of Iowa, is no longer going to be acceptable in Iowa classrooms,” Wahls said. “That is just very peculiar.”
Sen. Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, said he preferred the Senate version and felt the House amendment was “probably unnecessary given the parameters of the original bill” — arguing that entities performing abortions would already be excluded from creating school materials under the original legislation, as the material is required to depict “the humanity of the unborn child.”
“Entities that perform or promote abortions are liable to be biased against the humanity and inherent value of human life before birth, which is one of the central components of this bill,” Taylor said. “That is not to say that everything they produce is false, but in order to be unbiased, it doesn’t make sense to use prenatal development information from abortion advocates.”
He said opponents were ignoring the language in the bill requiring the information shown in school classrooms be medically accurate and research-based. However, he said this material could show a “biased” view if they perform abortions or support access to abortions, pointing to guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to use the term “embryo” instead of “baby” or “unborn child” when discussing early stages of gestation.
“Embryo is an accurate scientific term to refer to a specific point in the human development process, but it is important to not leave out that this is a stage of human development,” Taylor said. “Using material from abortion advocates may provide a tainted view of human life before birth, and that is unfair to young learning minds. Embryos, fetuses, babies, adolescents and adults are all human, and that fact should not be hidden — that every life, no matter how small, contains humanity and dignity from the very start.”

,DC,2025-04-28 23:34:06+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump orders list of ‘sanctuary cities’ to target for funding freeze,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-orders-list-sanctuary-cities-target-funding-freeze,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday evening signed executive orders targeting so-called sanctuary cities by threatening to revoke federal funding and providing legal services and national security assets to law enforcement.The signings fell on the eve of Trump’s first 100 days of his second term, during which his administration has enacted an immigration crackdown that has led to clashes with the judiciary branch and cities that do not coordinate with federal immigration authorities, often referred to as “sanctuary cities.""“Some State and local officials nevertheless continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws,” according to the executive order regarding sanctuary cities. “This is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law and the Federal Government's obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the United States.”The order directs the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to publicly list local jurisdictions that limit cooperation with immigration officials, but do not stop immigration enforcement.Jurisdictions on the list will then be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget to “identify appropriate Federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, including grants and contracts, for suspension or termination, as appropriate.”This is not the first time the Trump administration has targeted jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The Justice Department recently filed a lawsuit against the city of Rochester, New York, over its immigration policies after local law enforcement did not assist federal immigration officials in an arrest. The Trump administration argued those ordinances in Rochester were impeding federal immigration enforcement.The president also signed an executive order in January that threatened to withhold federal funding from states and local governments that refused to aid in federal immigration enforcement activities. A federal judge in San Francisco last week blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from 16 so-called sanctuary cities.Republicans have also scrutinized those policies, including during a six-hour hearing of the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that included grilling mayors from Boston, Chicago and Denver, on their cities’ immigration policies. The executive order also aims to curb any federal benefits that may extend to people without permanent legal status.That executive order directed DOJ and DHS to “take appropriate action to stop the enforcement of State and local laws” that allow for students without proper legal authorization to receive in-state tuition, which would include those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.Last week, administration officials cheered the FBI arrest of a Wisconsin judge who they say helped an immigrant in the country without legal authorization escape detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The arrest followed the third appearance by ICE officers seeking to make arrests at the Milwaukee County Courthouse, a practice some experts believe hinders local law enforcement.Law enforcement resourcesA second executive order Trump signed Monday provides legal resources for law enforcement officials “who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law.”The order also directs coordination among the departments of Justice, Defense and Homeland Security to “increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist State and local law enforcement.” Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the executive order relating to law enforcement will “strengthen and unleash America’s law enforcement to pursue criminals and protect innocent citizens.”",,,,2025-04-28 20:06:06.666158

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A retired teacher is the governor’s choice to fill a long-vacant seat on the Oklahoma State Board of Education.
Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Monday he chose Becky Carson for the board position representing Congressional District 5 to a term expiring April 2, 2027. The seat has been empty for almost two years since former board member Trent Smith resigned.
Carson, of Edmond, was a special education teacher for 30 years, serving students in third through fifth grade with mild disabilities.
She also has owned multiple businesses, according to the governor’s announcement.
“I am honored to serve on the state Board of Education,” Carson said in a statement. “Throughout my career, I’ve always believed that every child deserves a chance to reach their full potential. I am committed, dependable and ready to help ensure every Oklahoma student has the opportunity to succeed.”
Her appointment to the board hinges on whether the state Senate confirms her.

She would be the third former educator among the sitting members, following state Superintendent Ryan Walters, who taught history at McAlester and Millwood high schools, and Mike Tinney, who taught history in the small Oklahoma town of Chattanooga before becoming an attorney.
“Her commitment to doing what’s best for students and her proven leadership will make her an outstanding addition to the state Board of Education,” Stitt said.
The governor tried to appoint former Trump administration official Alex Gray to the role last year, but Gray’s home senator responsible for carrying his nomination, Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City, declined to do so, calling him unqualified for the position. Without her support, his nomination never came up for a Senate confirmation vote and therefore failed.
It wasn’t immediately clear which of four possible senators would have to carry Carson’s nomination. Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond; Sen. Kristen Thompson, R-Edmond; Sen. Kelly Hines, R-Edmond, and Sen. Grant Green, R-Wellston, each have Edmond addresses within their districts.
Pugh said the Senate Education Committee, which he leads, and the full Senate have until the end of this year’s legislative session to consider Carson’s confirmation.
“We’ll meet with her privately so the committee has time to get to know her and ask some questions,” Pugh said.

Three other recent appointees to the board — Tinney, Chris Van Denhende and Ryan Deatherage — have taken office but also are waiting for Senate confirmation.
The senators representing Tinney and Deatherage’s home districts — Sen. Lisa Standridge, R-Norman, and Sen. Darcy Jech, R-Kingfisher, respectively — did not immediately return requests for comment on whether they intend to support the appointees’ confirmations.
Sen. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa, is the home senator for Van Denhende. She said her concerns with newly proposed academic standards for social studies have weighed heavily on her decision.
Van Denhende voted in favor of the social studies standards, but he later said he was unaware of controversial last-minute changes made to the final draft before he took the vote. Tinney and Deatherage also said they had no idea of the changes, which included language stating there were “discrepancies” in 2020 election results.
Van Denhende said during Thursday’s board meeting that if he knew then what he knows now, he would have voted against the standards. He told The Oklahoman he wants the Legislature to send the standards back to the board for another review.
“The process is not a good process,” Van Denhende said during Thursday’s meeting.
House and Senate Democrats filed resolutions on March 31 to reject the social studies standards and return them to the board. The Senate GOP caucus is now deliberating a similar resolution.
Goodwin said she and Van Denhende agree on the issue.
“We are in agreement that there was a failure in the standards process and the matter should be returned to the board,” Goodwin said. “Based on (his) recommendation that the matter be returned to the board, I would support his nomination.”

(LDEQ)The top financial officer for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has left the agency, marking the latest in a string of high-level departures under Secretary Aurelia Giacometto.
Theresa Delafosse, the lead administrator at LDEQ’s Financial Services Division, has transferred out of the agency after nine years on the job. The State Civil Service Commission confirmed her transfer but did not yet have any details about her new assignment. 
Delafosse could not be reached for comment Monday. 
A licensed attorney and certified public accountant, Delafosse was the highest ranking fiscal employee at LDEQ and the lone remaining executive in the agency’s Office of Management and Finance. 
Former Undersecretary Christian Griffiths was in charge of that office until he transferred from the agency in September after just a few months on the job. 
Delafosse previously worked at the state Department of Revenue and the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s Office. Her departure comes about a month after Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack published the results of a workplace culture survey that indicated pervasive low morale under Giacometto’s leadership with some employees reporting feeling pressured to violate the law or department policy.

Her exit also comes roughly two weeks after the abrupt resignation of long-time LDEQ ombudsman Roger Ward, who disseminated a scathing seven-page letter detailing what he called “the increasingly erratic and alarmingly vicious behavior” of Giacometto. Ward said he wrote the letter in lieu of providing an exit interview, a long-established LDEQ practice Giacometto ended recently. 
Ward’s missive reinforces a similar departing letter former LDEQ Undersecretary Chandra Pidgeon wrote in March 2024 after a few short weeks of being hired. Pigeon similarly complained about Giacometto’s “harassment of longtime employees” and other actions.
“I have worked for 23 years for the state of Louisiana, and I have never encountered a leader so destructive, calculating, and callous,” she wrote.
LDEQ’s communications division did not respond to a request for comment for this report Monday afternoon.
LDEQ executives and key employees that have left the agency under Giacometto’s tenure include, among others:

Chandra Pigeon, undersecretary
Stacey Holley, chief of staff
Justin Crossie, chief of staff
Meagan Molter, communications director
Christian Griffiths, undersecretary
Jordan Deshotels, undersecretary

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch )The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted an emergency waiver permitting the nationwide sale of a fuel blend with higher amounts of ethanol through the summer months, which fuel and farm leaders say will help farmers, fuel producers and drivers at the pumps.
Midwestern states, including Iowa and South Dakota, already had waivers in place to allow for summer sales of fuel blended with 15% ethanol, also known as E15. EPA’s decision Monday waives the agency’s summer restrictions on the fuel for the rest of the country and follows guidance from the president’s executive order from January, declaring a national energy emergency.
The press release from EPA said the move will “provide families with relief” by providing more options at the pump with lower prices per gallon.
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, said Monday on social media that the decision “supports our producers, gives consumers more options at the pump, and bolsters our energy security.” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, also praised the move on social media, calling it “a positive step for South Dakota farmers and consumers.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig applauded the decision and said Iowa drivers saved more than $38 million by choosing E15 over E10, a lower blend of ethanol fuel, in 2024.
“Today’s E15 announcement by the Trump Administration is a win for consumers across the U.S. and farmers here in Iowa,” Naig said in a statement. “This decision is a big step toward making our country more energy dominant, independent, and secure.”
Iowa Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley both applauded the measure, noting it was an example of “promises made, promises kept” by the president and would be a “big” boost for corn farmers.
“It’s clear (President Trump) is making our farmers, producers, and all of rural America a priority, and I look forward to working alongside him to secure permanent, nationwide access to this cleaner, cheaper choice at the pump,” Ernst said in a statement.
According to National Corn Growers Association, year-round E15 sales throughout the country would lead to an increased demand of more than 2 billion bushels of corn annually, which is why the group has pushed for increased ethanol demand.
Brent Johnson, president of Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, applauded the EPA decision, but noted EPA has consistently issued similar waivers, and urged for a permanent change to the rule.
“Clearly, there is strong consumer demand for a lower-cost fuel option at the pump, and Iowa farmers stand by readily able to meet the growing demand for biofuels,” Johnson said in a statement.
Naig similarly noted the need for a permanent regulation allowing the sale of the fuel. He, along with Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and industry groups have all sent letters to congressional leaders urging the passage of such a law.
“We are tired of waiting,” Monte Shaw, executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association said in a statement. “Consumers and retailers are tired of waiting. E15 could provide a market for 5 to 7 billion gallons of additional ethanol demand at a time when American farmers and rural communities are hurting.”
The EPA waiver is in place from May 1 through May 20, as the Clean Air Act only allows a 20-day waiver, but considering trends from the past several summers, industry leaders expect the waiver will be extended through the other summer months.

Melissa Schmidt, a Republican from Eldridge (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Missouri lawmakers are playing tax cut tennis, and on Monday the state House served its latest offering when it narrowed the differences with the state Senate in a bill that helps wealthy taxpayers and some who are at the bottom of the income scale.
The proposal is the smallest, in terms of revenue reductions, of several bills intended to cut taxes this year. It exempts long-term capital gains — profits on investments or property held for more than a year — from state income tax.
It also boosts the income limits and credit amounts for the refundable tax credit known as the circuit breaker, which helps defer the cost of property taxes for low-income seniors and people with disabilities.
Those provisions mirror the language in a bill that has already passed the Senate but has not received a final House vote. One key difference is that the Senate-passed version would adjust the circuit breaker credit amounts for inflation starting in 2027, while the bill approved Monday does not.
It also does not include the sales tax exemption for diapers and feminine hygiene products included in the Senate-passed bill.
House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins, a Republican from Bowling Green, said the latest plan was intended to send the Senate something it could accept.
“We feel like the Senate will be able to pass our language on this as is,” Perkins said.
The bill began as a proposal to allow the Department of Revenue to forgive interest and penalties when it has to prorate tax credits because claims exceed the annual allowance. For the past three years, people claiming Missouri’s food pantry tax credit found they didn’t get the full value when the state Department of Revenue reviewed their returns.
The bill passed by a 92-58 vote, with 11 Republicans voting against it along with all Democrats. The bill needs only a final Senate vote to send it to Gov. Mike Kehoe.
During debate, Democrats warned that big tax cuts now are a mistake because of uncertainty, both in future support from federal funding and the possibility of an economic recession due to tariff and other policy shifts under President Donald Trump.
“Wait for another year. Let’s see what happens with the U.S. economy before we cut another tax,” said state Rep. Steve Butz, a Democrat fromSt. Louis. “We need to go slow, because you can’t reverse this decision.”
The tax limitations in the Missouri Constitution would require a statewide vote if, in a year or two, lawmakers decided they had cut taxes too much.
The fiscal note for the bill, which gives the official estimate of whether it will increase or decrease state revenue, states that exempting capital gains would reduce revenue from the individual income tax by about $110 million annually, with another $180 million reduction with the corporate cut kicks in.
Outside observers question that estimate, with the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimating that the revenue reduction could be $600 million or more.
Since 2014, when lawmakers enacted a tax cut over the veto of then-Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, Missouri’s top income tax rate has fallen from 6% to 4.7%. Two future tax cuts, to a 4.5% rate, are already in state law and will take effect if general revenue growth hits targets.
The changes in the circuit breaker credit would reduce state revenue by about $75 million annually. 
People 65 and older and those with a qualifying disability are eligible for a credit against property taxes on their residence. Since 2008 the maximum credit for homeowners has been $1,100, while for people who rent their home the maximum credit is $750.
The legislation would increase the credit for homeowners to $1,550 and for renters to $1,055.
The proposal would also increase the maximum income for claiming the credit from $27,500 for single taxpayers who rent to $38,200 and for single taxpayers who own their home from $30,000 to $42,200. For married couples, the limit would be $41,000 for renters and $48,000 for homeowners.
Most of the debate Monday focused on whether the circuit breaker changes were enough to balance the benefits being provided to wealthy taxpayers.
“This is an amendment that our senior citizens need for us to do, as it truly helps those in the lowest income brackets,” said state Rep. Mark Matthiesen, a Republican from O’Fallon. “Also those with disabilities need our help.”
Democrats said the circuit breaker changes were designed to mask the problems that would be created by additional large income tax cuts.

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)An out-of-state group that sued the commonwealth for records it claimed would show “non-U.S. citizens have been registering and voting in Pennsylvania for decades” lost an appeal in federal court.
The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the Virginia-based Public Integrity Law Foundation has no standing to sue the Pennsylvania Department of State for voter registration records under a federal law intended to increase participation in elections.
“While a statute may authorize private suits to compel compliance with the law, private citizens are not deputized as private attorneys general empowered to enforce any and all violations of a statute without regard to their personal stake in the matter,” Circuit Judge Marjorie O. Rendell wrote in an opinion for the court.
A spokesperson said the Department of State is pleased with the decision. A PILF spokesperson said it is considering the court’s opinion and “will be moving forward from there.”
PILF sued the department in 2017 after then-Philadelphia Election Commissioner Al Schmidt said a glitch in Pennsylvania’s electronic driver’s licensing system could allow noncitizens to register to vote, citing 168 such instances in the city. Schmidt is now secretary of the commonwealth.
The Department of State confirmed that it was working to fix the problem but was not aware of the issue before Schmidt alerted them, the Associated Press reported at the time.
The lawsuit claimed the department was required to provide records under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), commonly known as the Motor Voter Law that, among other voting access provisions, required states to provide an opportunity to register to vote when applying for a driver’s license and other state services. 
A U.S. District Court judge ultimately ruled partly in favor of PILF and ordered the Department of State to pay attorney fees and costs to the organization. Both PILF and the department of state appealed.
The 3rd Circuit decision noted while the act provides for public inspection of records concerning programs to ensure the accuracy of voter rolls and remedial right to sue, a recent U.S. Supreme Court case raised the bar for a plaintiff in such a suit to show they have actually been harmed.
In support of its claim of injury and standing to sue under the NVRA, PILF argued that without the records, it could not analyze the department’s activities to maintain voter lists and was unable to carry out its mission of promoting what it calls election integrity and compliance with state and federal election laws.
The organization also claimed the denial hampered its production and dissemination of educational materials and that it had expended considerable time and money seeking the records. 
The 3rd Circuit said there is not a sufficient connection between the consequences PILF identified and Congress’ goals in enacting the NVRA. As an out-of-state public interest law firm that failed to show evidence of concrete harm caused by the secretary of the commonwealth’s refusal to provide the records it requested, PILF has no standing to sue, Rendell wrote.  
“PILF does not represent any Pennsylvania citizens who have been affected by the Secretary’s purported violation of the NVRA,” Rendell’s opinion says. “It has no direct ties to Pennsylvania voters and has not alleged how access to the records it seeks would ‘directly lead to action’ or that its ‘direct participation in the electoral process [has been] hindered.’”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_7425-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-28 20:06:06.666158

(Courtesy of Alora Casper, Executive Director of United Utah Party)Two of Utah’s centrist parties have officially joined forces in hopes of growing a movement to break away from a two-party, “us-versus-them” system.
The United Utah Party and the Utah Forward Party held an unprecedented combined convention on Saturday at Salt Lake Community College in Taylorsville, where both parties voted nearly unanimously to approve a memorandum of understanding to formally merge under the umbrella of the national Forward Party.
An ‘unprecedented’ merger of 2 centrist parties: United Utah Party looks to join Forward Party

It’s the first time two political parties have ever joined together in the state of Utah. Party officials said they’re coordinating with the state’s top election officials in the lieutenant governor’s office to facilitate the merger, for which no legal process exists in state law. 
Still, the parties are charting their own path for the merger, for which the now-approved memorandum of understanding lays out a process that will take place over the next several months. 
The new party’s name, the MOU stipulates, “shall be the ‘Utah Forward Party,’ the ‘United Forward Party’ or such other name selected and approved by the National Forward Party.” 
On Saturday, both parties voted independently to approve the merger before combining in a joint session, where leaders gave speeches applauding the merger as a momentum-building move for Utah’s moderate and centrist movement.

Speakers included newly-elected Chair Michelle Quist — who last year ran as United Utah’s candidate for attorney general — and Sen. Dan Thatcher, a former Republican from West Valley, who recently announced he’d left the GOP to join the Utah Forward Party. 
“There are real problems that Utahns are facing, but our leaders aren’t listening because they’re too busy trying to win their partisan blood sport,” Quist said. “The two-party system has not served us well. … We cannot see beyond the us-versus-them mentality. So it’s time to move beyond that psyche and look to do what’s best for Utahns.” 
Former New Jersey governor and EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman — who co-founded and co-chairs the national Forward Party alongside businessman and onetime presidential candidate Andrew Yang — also spoke Saturday, encouraging Utahns to break the stranglehold of the two-party system, which she said is more focused on winning than representing Americans. 
“I honestly believe that we are within a hair of losing our democracy,” Whitman said. “There is, to me, an unconscionable lack of respect for the rule of law, the lack of respect for the Constitution. … It’s not about solving problems, it’s about staying in power.”

She pointed to states like Utah, where most districts are largely controlled by “one party,” the GOP, resulting in elections where “voters don’t have a choice. There’s one candidate, and that’s it. And that has never served the public.” 
“When all an incumbent has to do is worry about their base in the primaries, they don’t care about the rest of the people. To heck with it, and they don’t represent the rest of the people when they get in,” Whitman said.

Yang also issued a prepared statement in a news release issued by party leaders, pointing to Gallup polling that shows roughly 60% of Americans agree that the U.S. needs a third major party because the Republican and Democratic parties “do such a poor job” of representing Americans. 
“It’s no wonder why,” Yang said. “The existing parties have failed to address the biggest issues facing voters. People want job security and to plan for their retirement; they want their kids to be safe, they want to live in a nation of laws that protect them, they don’t want to be told they need to hate their neighbors if they disagree with them on some policy position. They want their representatives to pay attention to their lives and listen to their needs.”
Instead, Yang said, “the legacy parties are focused on maintaining power and the ‘us versus them’ fight that keeps their fundraising totals high.”
Yang said Utah is at the “forefront” of the Forward Party’s effort to build a “50-state movement.” So far, the Forward Party or an affiliate party is recognized in 13 states, Whitman said, compared to just five states two months ago. Plus, she said the party has 50 elected officeholders who have affiliated in some way with the Forward Party. Their goal, she said, is to be “on the ballot in all states” by the next presidential election, in 2028. 
“We are growing,” she said. “We’re growing fast. We’re growing big.”
Thatcher, when he took the podium, told the crowd of roughly 250 that came to Saturday’s convention that, “you’re not crazy.”

“You’re not imagining it. Things are really, really bad right now,” said the former Republican senator — who in recent years became no stranger to bucking the GOP party line before he unaffiliated last month. “The absolute contempt coming from the (Utah) Legislature this year just completely blew my mind.” 
Thatcher said for years he had been “concerned about the direction” the Republican party was heading, “but I always believed that the GOP would come back to its founding principles.” 
However, when lawmakers tried to amend the Utah Constitution to weaken voters’ ballot initiative powers and give the Legislature the ultimate and final say on all types of ballot initiatives with Amendment D — a ballot question the courts ultimately voided because its language written by GOP legislative leaders was misleading — Thatcher said that “completely made it clear that it’s not going to happen.”

“Because I believe the GOP has ceased to uphold the rule of law, because they are no longer grounded to the Constitution, and because they’re not even following their own platform, which was why I joined them in the first place, they are no longer entitled to my support,” Thatcher said. 
Instead, he said the Forward Party better “respects my principles of rights, of reason, and of respect.” 
“The Forward Party is different from anything I’ve ever seen before,” Thatcher said. “It is why I feel so at home in this place that feels clean. I feel safe in this room. I feel respected in this room. I feel like I can disagree with someone and not have any name-calling or our tables flipping.”
More than anything, Thatcher said he joined the Forward Party because he wants “to fight for people, for decency, for representation.” 
“It is so freeing to stop saying ‘we’ as I talk about the completely crazy things that the (Republican) party is doing to people,” he said. “But moreover, it feels so good to say ‘we’ as I talk about the crazy things the Forward Party is doing for people.

Senate File 288 would require state universities and community colleges to allow pregnant students or new mothers to take leave without penalty, reschedule tests and assignments and utilize other accommodations.
The Iowa House sent the bill back to the Senate last week with amendments to specify qualifying students as “biologically female” and removing set timeframes for certain accommodations.

Despite his opinion that the House “watered down” the bill by changing the language and removing the 12-month timeframe for accommodations, Sen. Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, said he’d still like to see it passed.
The legislation would require universities to publicize their policies and accommodations for pregnant students and those who recently gave birth, Taylor said, ensuring instructors cannot decide for themselves whether to work with these students and provide support.
“For that reason, I think there continues to be merit to this bill,” Taylor said.
The Senate concurred with the House legislation and passed it with a unanimous vote.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — All three University of Nebraska-Lincoln students whose visas were revoked over the past two weeks have had them restored after the Trump administration backed off its initial efforts to cancel some visas held by international students.
UNL officials confirmed that the third student’s visa was restored Monday, following the restoration of the other two last week. 
Earlier this month, UNL announced that three international students had their visas revoked by the U.S. State Department. UNL has 1,654 international students, according to a university census.
The Justice Department announced the national reversal in federal court last week. The change came after the Trump administration began revoking visas and launching deportation proceedings against a number of students who had participated in demonstrations against Israel during campus protests last year over the war in Gaza, or who had faced criminal charges while a visiting student, including driving under the influence. 
It is unclear why the UNL students’ visas were revoked. The university hasn’t said.
A Justice Department lawyer, Joseph F. Carilli, said immigration officials have begun developing a new system for reviewing and terminating visas for international students. Until the process is complete, Carilli said, agencies would not make additional changes or pursue additional revocations, according to The New York Times.

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA 43-year-old Barre woman was charged Monday with involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of a 45-year-old Barre man last week. The Vermont State Police arrested Donna Robinson last week for allegedly shooting Franklin Driscoll at a home on 879 N. Main Street in Barre on Thursday around 5:25 p.m., the state police said in a press release. Robinson pleaded not guilty to the charges against her and is being held without bail at the Chittenden County Correctional Facility. Driscoll was admitted to Central Vermont Medical Center with a gunshot wound to the abdomen and died early Friday morning, the release said. The state police said the death appeared to be an “isolated event” between people who knew each other, so it did not pose a threat to the general Barre community. Initial witness interviews indicated that Robinson was taking the gun from Driscoll during an altercation with a different person when it went off accidentally, according to the state police affidavit. Robinson was arraigned in Washington County Superior Court Monday afternoon for involuntary manslaughter, along with charges of five counts of reckless endangerment, one count of simple assault and two counts of possession of a firearm while having a felony conviction. Robinson was convicted for selling heroin in 2017 and for a stolen-property-related crime in 2012. She appeared at the hearing virtually from the women’s prison in South Burlington.Justice Michael Harris denied the state’s request to also charge Robinson with burglary. At the arraignment, he said there was no evidence that Robinson had not received permission to be on the property, where at least six other people were apparently present at the time of the incident. Harris, defense attorney Michael Shane and prosecutor Talon Wendel discussed the nature of the evidence for each charge, which was primarily witness testimony from people at the house during the time of the shooting. Shane said the case was “thin” and that Robinson had every intention of fighting it, noting that key charges appeared to rely on the statement of a single witness. Wendel argued that the evidence was bolstered by statements from several other witnesses, who provided corroborating testimony although they had not personally seen the actual shooting. Harris said, “I think there’s going to be a lot more the state’s going to have to show as to how it occurred,” but that the evidence was “enough” at this point to justify having Robinson held without bail. He also cited the seriousness of the manslaughter offense, which could lead to a life sentence. Harris and the attorneys plan to schedule a weight-of-evidence hearing within the week. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Woman charged with manslaughter in shooting death of 45-year-old Barre man.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/washington-court-1-20230807.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 19:05:41.025639

On Monday, Democratic Reps. Corey Paris of Stamford, Eleni Kavros DeGraw of Avon, Gary Turco of Newington and Manny Sanchez of New Britain, held a press conference at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford, where they denounced the Trump administration’s plans and called for more state funding to help beleaguered borrowers.
“The fact that the federal government has made this decision is going to harm families across the nation and especially in Connecticut,” Kavros DeGraw said.
The Office of Federal Student Aid plans to resume collecting defaulted loans on May 5, ending a five-year pause that began during the COVID-19 pandemic and was extended several times since. Tax refunds and other federal benefits could be withheld from borrowers as soon as next month, and some could see their wages garnished by up to 15%. 
The lawmakers at Monday’s event said that could put people already facing financial hardship in an even more difficult situation, and they said the state needs to increase assistance to students seeking higher education. 
“It is time for us to wake up and realize that the time is now,” Turco said. “We are looking to continue our current student loan reimbursement program. We also want to look for more funding from the budget to provide relief,” he said.
In an emailed statement, Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, warned that more state support for student borrowers could mean breaking the state’s fiscal guardrails. “That means they want to raise your state taxes,” he said.
“Ever notice how we never see CT Democrats hold daily news conferences on cutting state government waste and actually lowering our cost of living?’ Harding added.
Federal officials say the move to collect defaulted student loans is intended to protect taxpayers and fix a system they say was confusing for borrowers. 
“American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,” Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement released by her office last week. “The Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear.” 
Students and teachers at Monday’s press conference expressed concern about the personal financial implications the policy could have. 
Christina Barmon, a sociology professor at Central Connecticut State University, said, “It is difficult to console students when I can’t afford to pay either. I am still paying off debts. Students are expected to pick up the slack.”
Syafira Azzahra, a senior at Central, shared her concerns about paying off loans once she graduates. “It is impossible for us to live within our means and simultaneously worry about our debt,” she said.
Last Wednesday, President Donald J. Trump issued a related executive order directing reforms to the higher education accreditation system. The order says accrediting bodies that grant student loans and Pell Grants are biased because of their focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. The order called for establishing new accreditors that are solely merit-based and don’t factor race or gender into decisions.
Democratic leaders of the Connecticut Senate issued a joint statement last Thursday on the order expressing their disapproval. “Through attacking accreditors, Donald Trump continues his witch hunt to quell educational freedom in favor of advancing his own political agenda,” Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff and Sen. Derek Slap said in the statement.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25113784490343-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 19:05:41.025639

The murder trial against Seth Brunell ended in a surprise plea deal after a sheriff’s deputy had an unsanctioned conversation with the defendant. It was not the first mistake in the case.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  How a high-profile Vermont murder case fell apart.","Seth Brunell frowns as he listens to testimony during his murder trial in Lamoille County Superior criminal court in Hyde Park on Tuesday, April 15. Brunell is accused of killing Fern Feather in 2022. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIn April 2022, the stabbing death of Hinesburg transgender woman Fern Feather shocked and saddened the state of Vermont. In the days after the killing, as the investigation progressed, it emerged that Feather had had an altercation with another man a year prior — a man who, Vermont State Police said, was the son of then-suspect Seth Brunell.That connection could have added key context to the murder case. But, in fact, the man had no relation to Brunell, and state police retracted the claim a day later. The misstep was just one of several mistakes that occurred during one of Vermont’s highest-profile murder cases in the past few years. Earlier this month, after a particularly grave error, that case culminated with a surprise plea deal and a sheriff’s deputy on administrative leave. Brunell pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and will serve a decade of probation with no additional prison time — a far lighter sentence than a murder conviction would entail.  “It’s devastating. I can say that,” said Aliena Gerhard, the Lamoille County state’s attorney. “I was pretty angry.”Even before it reached a trial, the case was a tangled one. Last fall, the case became embroiled in a controversy over evidence, after it emerged in late September that prosecutors had failed to turn over a 3D rendering of the crime scene to Brunell’s defense attorney. The state had mistakenly given the defense a model from a separate case, an error that Gerhard apologized for. Jessica Burke, Brunell’s attorney, asked the court to throw out the case based on that mistake. Presiding Judge Mary Morrissey, however, allowed the trial to go forward, with a postponement to allow the defense to prepare. Still, she wrote, “the court neither minimizes nor excuses the failure of the State” to turn over the 3D model. Morrissey levied a stronger penalty against prosecutors over the handling of another piece of evidence: a 20-page letter, allegedly written by Brunell while he was in prison in 2023. That letter allegedly laid out a plan to have sex with his defense attorney, then accuse her of sexual assault, with the goal of getting his case dismissed, according to court filings. In a court filing at the time, Assistant Attorney General Sophie Stratton sought to admit the letter as evidence in the case. Stratton wrote that prosecutors had only recently learned about the document, even though Vermont State Police had been aware of it for months.But Morrissey ruled that the state had violated time limits for introducing evidence and that the letter could not be admitted. She wrote that “the late disclosure prevented Defendant from conducting depositions, gathering information on the chain of custody, or litigating whether this evidence was properly obtained.” Defense attorney Jessica Burke said last fall that the case was the most disorganized she had ever experienced. Gerhard, the Lamoille County state’s attorney, declined to comment on that letter. Burke declined to comment last week. READ MORE





 


Seth Brunell reaches plea deal in death of Fern Feather with no additional prison time

‘Beyond belief’ The trial finally began in mid-April, three years after the killing of Feather. In her opening statement, Burke, Brunell’s attorney, laid out the defense’s argument that Brunell had acted in self-defense. The case, she argued, was botched from the start. Law enforcement charged Brunell with murder even before they completed processing all the evidence, Burke said. She argued that law enforcement had failed to thoroughly collect evidence, and that officers had allowed Feather’s dogs to roam freely around the crime scene for roughly an hour after the killing, potentially contaminating the scene. But the jury never got a chance to make a decision on those arguments. On May 15, the second full day of the trial, the attorneys learned that Brunell had an unauthorized conversation with a Lamoille County Sheriff’s deputy one day earlier while being driven from the courtroom to Southern State Correctional Facility after jury selection.In testimony, it emerged that Vermont State Police Detective Sergeant Isaac Merriam had asked the sheriff’s department to use a body camera to create a recording during the drive.  “I wanted to make sure that that transport was recorded in case Mr. Brunell made statements about this case,” Merriam told the court. Lamoille County Sheriff’s Department Detective Kevin Lehoe testified that he had passed along Merriam’s request to Sheriff’s Deputy Christopher Turner, who had been assigned to the transport.Although he instructed Turner to record the trip on his body camera, Lehoe said, he had not told him to ask specific questions about the case. The recording was just intended to capture any “excited utterance” that Brunell might make, Lehoe told the court.  Had Lehoe explicitly warned Turner against asking questions? Burke, the defense attorney, asked.“I didn’t at the time, no, and I didn’t expect that I would have to,” Lehoe replied.  But, according to a transcript reviewed by VTDigger, at least one law enforcement officer in the car during the transport did, in fact, ask Brunell questions. Two sheriff’s deputies, Turner and a Rutland County deputy whose identity was not clear, were assigned to the transport. Although the transcript of the conversation is not exact, the document clearly shows that Brunell was questioned about Feather’s car, the knife used in the killing and his relationship with his attorney.Jared Carter, a constitutional law professor with Vermont Law and Graduate School, said that questioning a defendant outside of the presence of their lawyer is a clear violation of the constitutional right to an attorney.“Once a person has been read their Miranda rights, they have the right to an attorney,” Carter said. “And certainly, once that happens, law enforcement is not allowed to continue to question a suspect or a defendant or somebody who’s been arrested.”For the questioning to happen on the eve of a trial is “quite frankly, beyond belief,” he said.Turner, the sheriff’s deputy who conducted the transport of Brunell, was placed on administrative leave while an outside law enforcement agency conducts an investigation, Lamoille County Sheriff Roger Marcoux said earlier this month. READ MORE

‘Gross negligence’On the second night of the trial, Burke filed a motion for a mistrial. In court the next morning, describing the transcript from the body camera, both Burke and Gerhard described the incident as “egregious.”By the end of the next day, with the specter of a mistrial looming, the attorneys had hashed out a plea deal. Prosecutors said that day that they were concerned that, in the case of a mistrial, they would not be able to refile charges against Brunell and that he would ultimately walk completely free.But the 10 years of probation was a far cry from the possibility of the decades in prison Brunell faced if convicted of second-degree murder. And the sentence elicited anger and dismay from Feather’s family and friends. “The only reason you’re getting out now is because of the gross negligence of the Lamoille County Sheriff’s Department,” Lisa Barbeau, Feather’s mother, told Brunell in an emotional statement at the conclusion of the trial. “Because you are a murderer.”In his own remarks, Jean-Francois Barbeau, Feather’s father, condemned the “slap on the wrist” Brunell received.“This isn’t justice.

(Photos courtesy of the Doña Ana County Detention Center)Federal authorities arrested a former New Mexico magistrate judge and his wife on April 24 on criminal charges of evidence tampering related to the prosecution of an alleged gang member from Venezuela.
The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday announced it had charged former Doña Ana County Magistrate Jose Luis “Joel” Cano with one count of evidence tampering and his wife Nancy Cano with one count of conspiracy to tamper with evidence.
Prosecutors allege that Jose Cano told Homeland Security Investigations agents that he had destroyed a cell phone belonging to Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, a Venezuelan national prosecutors allege has ties to the Tren de Aragua gang.
HSI in February searched the Canos’ home and arrested Ortega-Lopez for illegal possession of guns and ammunition, according to the DOJ’s news release. The DOJ said agents seized three of Ortega-Lopez’s cell phones, but he told them about a fourth one, which prompted another search wherein Cano allegedly admitted to destroying it with a hammer.
“Judges are responsible for upholding our country’s laws. It is beyond egregious for a former judge and his wife to engage in evidence tampering on behalf of a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member accused of illegally possessing firearms,” U.S. Attorney Ryan Ellison for the District of New Mexico said in a statement. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office is committed to dismantling this foreign terrorist organization by disrupting its criminal operations in New Mexico. That starts by prosecuting those who support gang members — including judges.”
The DOJ announced the charges against the Canos in the same news release in which they announced the arrest of a Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan for allegedly allowing a Mexican immigrant charged with domestic violence to temporarily avoid arrest by federal agents.
“The allegations against Judge Dugan and Judge Cano are serious: no one, least of all a judge, should obstruct law enforcement operations,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “Doing so imperils the safety of our law enforcement officers and undermines the rule of law. The Department of Justice will continue to follow the facts — no one is above the law.”
In the New Mexico case, immigration authorities arrested Ortega-Lopez in December 2023 in Texas for unlawfully entering the U.S., and released him in April 2024 because of overcrowding at the detention center where he was being held, according to court records.
An anonymous source in January tipped off the Homeland Security Investigations office in Las Cruces that Ortega-Lopez and two others were living in an apartment behind the Canos’ home, an HSI special agent wrote in an application for a search warrant.
The Judicial Standards Commission on March 5 petitioned the Supreme Court to suspend Cano for allegedly committing misconduct by allowing three members of the gang to live on his property in Las Cruces and to have access to firearms.
In a response, Jose Cano wrote to the Supreme Court justices that Ortega-Lopez told Nancy Cano that the trio “all had their legal papers to remain in the U.S. pending their Asylum Court hearings, which were already scheduled,” and that he had verified their court dates.
Jose Cano resigned as a magistrate judge on March 21, according to court records. The New Mexico Supreme Court on April 22 barred Cano from holding any judicial office or exercising any judicial authority. 
Both Canos are scheduled for preliminary and detention hearings Tuesday morning in federal court in Las Cruces.

Republican leaders in the House and Senate continued Monday to make offers back and forth on spending levels and tax relief, but it wasn’t clear whether the Legislature will have to extend its regular 2025 session to get their work done or adjourn on Friday as planned and come back in a special session.
The new fiscal year opens on July 1.
In a media availability with reporters, Senate President Ben Albritton said his goal is for the Legislature to reach an agreement on overall spending and tax relief and extend into next week and “be able to get everything done.”
To that end, Senate Budget Committee Chair Ed Hooper said the Senate had made an offer to the House Monday afternoon and was waiting to hear back. Hooper did not disclose details of the offer, other than to say it was the seventh one he has made to the House.
The Senate had not heard back before Albritton and Hooper addressed reporters.
“You know what the priority of the speaker is, and we are trying to meet him at an affordable number,” Hooper said, adding, “We’re very close on the number.”
Dispute over taxes
The House on Friday voted, 78-29, to pass a $5 billion tax relief package, with most of the opposition involving changes to the collection of tourist development dollars.
Albritton supports tax relief but earlier this session floated a more modest $2.1 billion tax plan, centered around a permanent elimination of the sales tax on clothing and shoes costing $75 or less. Other parts of his plan include a permanent reduction in the business rent tax from 2% to 1%, a one-time credit for vehicle registration fees, and several sales tax holidays.
The difference between the House and Senate proposals for fiscal year 2025-26 is $4.4 billion. Albritton said people shouldn’t focus on the disparity between the chambers and instead focus on the fact that both the House and Senate support large tax cuts.
“We’re contemplating historic tax relief for Floridians. I don’t want that message to be lost. We’re just trying to figure out how it all comes together and everybody gets a piece of it to where they can feel comfortable that the thing they want to address gets addressed,” Albritton said, calling it “great news for Floridians.”
The legislative impasse on spending and tax relief has also slowed down the chambers’ deliberations on substantive policy issues, a reflection that how the chambers negotiate differences on substantive policies can be tied to the budget.
‘Nothingburgers’
Meanwhile, with less than one week left to go just 54 bills have made it through the legislative process, clearing both the House and Senate. Gov. DeSantis has signed 10 of them into law.
The House had passed 230 bills as of April 28, of which 49 have also been passed by the Senate.
The Senate had passed 156 bills, of which five have been passed by the House.
“Very little has passed and everything that has passed is nothingburgers,” one longtime lobbyist told the Florida Phoenix.
One high-profile bill that hasn’t passed but Albritton is optimistic will wind up making it through this week is a condominium bill by Sen. Jennifer Bradley.
Albritton said Sen. Jennifer Bradley, chair of the Regulated Industries Committee, is having conversation with the House, “making great progress,” on the condo bill and he is “very optimistic” about it. That measure involves relief for condo owners burdened by high assessments to improve building safety.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas environmental regulators updated the state Pollution Control and Ecology Commission last week on efforts to help storm-stricken areas of the state recover from multiple rounds of severe weather.
The commission also gave final approval to state water quality standards that address surface water pollutants and are up for review.
Bailey Taylor, director of the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality, said the agency issued an emergency order to address a large spill of red dye diesel in Craighead County. The tanks storing the fuel were severely damaged after being struck by one of the many tornadoes that have touched down in the state over the last month and a half, Taylor said.
The emergency order, which was posted on DEQ’s website, said the fuel leaked into ditches that “flowed through a nearby residential area and near the Monette Manor nursing home,” with the potential to reach the St. Francis River. The order noted that heavy concentrations of the diesel were seen in the ditches by a government inspector who visited the site.
“Given the extent of the storm impact and damage, imminent heavy rainfall and the forecast for additional severe weather and heavy flooding in the area, it was apparent that immediate action was required to protect human health and safety as well as to mitigate further impact to waters of the state including the St. Francis River,” the emergency order read. 
Taylor said she ordered remediation contractors to the site, and authorized use of funds from the Remedial Action Trust Fund to address the spill if it was necessary to protect public health, safety or the environment on April 3.
Additionally, DEQ staff has been working with local and county officials to set up debris burn sites for trees and other plants, Taylor said, and has been doing additional outreach to areas not impacted by recent storms to plan where a burn site could be, should those communities be affected by storms in the future.
Taylor also updated commissioners on legislative activity, saying that 12 bills proposed by the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment had been signed into law, most of them bills aimed at cleaning up language in existing law.
Later, commissioners voted to give final approval to Rule 2, which governs the state’s water quality standards and is going through a federally-mandated triennial review. The rule will now go to the Arkansas Legislative Council’s rules committee, and then to the council itself, for review.
Rule 2 water quality standards apply to the concentrations of pollutants in surface waters themselves, such as lakes and rivers, rather than the concentrations of pollutants in discharges from permitted facilities. They are also separate from drinking water regulations, which rely on a different set of rules and laws at both the federal and state level, and are regulated by the Arkansas Department of Health rather than DEQ.
The changes proposed by DEQ to Rule 2 include the addition of five new regulated pollutants: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and phenol. Two of those — benzene and ethylbenzene — are known or suspected carcinogens, respectively. The other three are known to have other detrimental health effects in humans in sufficient concentrations.
In documentation included with the rulemaking, DEQ said the new water quality standards were necessary to protect human health.
In addition to the new standards, DEQ is also proposing updates to existing ammonia and chromium standards.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ALP_0026-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 19:05:41.025639

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A committee of lawmakers on Monday rejected a last-minute bill to make legislators and higher education officials mandatory reporters of child sexual abuse in light of new documents that show a University of North Dakota official may have known about sex crimes committed by former Sen. Ray Holmberg.
Holmberg, who served in the statehouse for more than four decades, was sentenced to 10 years in prison late last month after he pleaded guilty to traveling abroad with the intent to have sex with adolescent boys.
The records, which were released by the Attorney General’s Office on Friday and number over 90 pages, show Holmberg emailed UND entrepreneur Bruce Gjovig in February 2011 about the former senator’s preference for young men and boys. Gjovig founded the school’s Center for Innovation, retiring in 2017. Gjovig also held other prominent roles in the community and the Republican Party.

“What think of my twink?” Holmberg asked Gjovig in the email, using a slang term that refers to young, slim men.
Gjovig emailed back, “too young for me, but thanks.”
“No one is ever to young… remember Prague,” Holmberg replied.
Gjovig’s attorney, Cash Aaland, said in a statement that Gjovig believed the comments were exaggerated, “bawdry, locker room” talk.
“Although Mr. Gjovig knew Mr. Holmberg in a professional and personal capacity, Mr. Gjovig was unaware of the criminal nature of Mr. Holmberg’s sexual conduct,” Aaland said in the statement. “Mr. Gjovig condemns Holmberg’s activities in the strongest terms possible.”
Aaland said that Gjovig fully cooperated with law enforcement during the investigation into Holmberg, and that Gjovig is being painted as an accomplice without evidence.
“As a gay man and a Republican, Mr. Gjovig has been an easy mark for political and media attacks,” Aaland stated.

The records also show that Holmberg emailed former state Sen. Nick Hacker in August 2016 about a sexual encounter Holmberg had with someone in Taiwan. Hacker was a State Board of Higher Education member at the time.
Holmberg did not say in the email that the person in question was underage, or that it was commercial sex.
Hacker, who served in the Senate from 2005 to 2008, said that the email was unsolicited and that he did not reply.
“I don’t even recall getting that email,” he said.
Hacker said he met with the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation in 2022 and cooperated with the agency’s investigation of Holmberg, including giving investigators full access to his messages.
“Until I met with BCI in 2022, I was unaware that Mr. Holmberg was a predator of underage children,” Hacker said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor. “Individuals like him should be fully prosecuted under the law.”
Others employed by the University of North Dakota also received emails from Holmberg, records show.
Sen. Tim Mathern and other North Dakota Democratic lawmakers in a Monday morning press conference urged the Legislature to greenlight a delayed bill to make lawmakers and higher education employees mandatory reporters of child sex abuse.
“In the future, if this comes to your attention and mine, we will know that it’s our responsibility. I think each one of us needs guardrails to help us make good decisions,” Mathern told other senators in a Senate Delayed Bills Committee hearing that afternoon.
The committee voted 4-1 not to forward the proposal, arguing a mandatory reporting requirement is not necessary and that it is too late in the session to accept the bill. Mathern was the only no vote.
North Dakota Senate kills mandated reporter bill spurred by Holmberg case

Mathern’s peers on the Senate Delayed Bills Committee said they did not feel the bill would make a difference because they did not know of Holmberg’s crimes until he was charged. 
“If we would have known something, we would have said something,” said Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden.
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, and Sen. Scott Meyer, R-Grand Forks, suggested taking up the proposal next legislative session.
“Who knew or didn’t know, even in the last 90-page report, is just hearsay,” Myrdal said. 
The other member of the committee was Sen. Cole Conley, R-Jamestown.
The communications in the report were found on electronic devices seized by law enforcement belonging to Ray Holmberg and another subject, Nicholas Morgan-Derosier. Morgan-Derosier was an associate of Holmberg’s who was sentenced in May to 40 years in prison on child pornography charges.
Members of the committee also said that the higher education system may already have mandatory requirements in place. 
A spokesperson for the North Dakota University System said there is no blanket requirement for employees to report sexual abuse, though certain kinds of officeholders and staff have their own reporting mandates. For example, members of the higher education board and employees must report any suspected violations of laws or institutional policies to a designee within the University System.
Statehouse Democrats said during the press conference it is unacceptable that some officials knew or may have known about Holmberg’s conduct years before he was charged with a crime. They said that North Dakota law does not do enough to prevent officials from engaging in, or covering up, crimes against children. 
“It’s obvious that just trusting these people to do the right thing is not good enough,” Mathern said. “We owe it to Holmberg’s victims to do something about it.”
The Senate previously defeated a resolution sponsored by Rep. Nico Rios, R-Williston, and the North Dakota Young Republicans that would have called on the 2027 Legislature to make lawmakers mandatory reporters.
It’s not yet clear whether the University of North Dakota has investigated or plans to investigate Holmberg.  
“If a report is filed with the university, it would be investigated,” David Dodds, a university spokesperson, said in a statement to the Monitor. 
“We are aware and deeply troubled by recent media reports regarding previously sealed federal court documents that were unavailable to the University and were used in the criminal conviction of Ray Holmberg,” Dodds said. “We strongly condemn the actions of anyone who may have enabled Mr. Holmberg’s criminal behavior.”
The University System is drafting a child safety policy that would apply to minors participating in programs that take place on property regulated by the higher education board or are sponsored by the University System, spokesperson Billie Jo Lorius said in an email to the North Dakota Monitor. She said the policy has yet to be approved.
Rep. Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks, said during the press conference he hopes the state Legislature isn’t the only body that implements reforms in response to the Holmberg case.
“I think this is a time for all individuals and institutions to carefully reflect on where their failures were in this process,” Ista said.
Mathern also called on his colleagues to put more money in the North Dakota Ethics Commission’s budget for the 2025-2027 fiscal year. He is chair of the conference committee tasked with workshopping final amendments to the budget, Senate Bill 2004.
“This would be a step forward toward justice as we continue to process Holmberg’s vile crimes and uncover more information on what has become the most egregious scandal in our state’s history,” Mathern said.
The Senate initially set aside money for an additional full-time employee for the commission, which would have brought the board’s number of staff up to four. The House cut the funding and also added a new 180-day deadline for the commission to process ethics complaints.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)  While Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Senate Republicans said Monday they have reached a “budget compromise” on how to fund the state heading into the 2026 fiscal year, House Republicans are asking for more money in some areas.
Passing the state budget through a series of appropriations bills is one of Iowa Legislature’s largest jobs, and the final step before lawmakers can adjourn for the year. In Iowa, the goal is for state legislators to wrap up their work by the 110th day of session — this year on Friday, May 2. There’s a financial motivation for lawmakers to finish their work by or near this date, after which they will no longer receive payment for expenses other than mileage between their homes and the State Capitol.
As of Monday, four days before the May 2 deadline, only one budget bill, Senate File 628, has passed through the committee process. The Senate’s transportation budget bill was approved by the chamber last week, but has not yet been taken up in the House. But there was movement Monday to kick off public discussions on the rest of the budget as House Republicans released their spending targets for the upcoming fiscal year.
Also on Monday, Reynolds and Senate Republicans issued a news release stating they had reached a “budget compromise” that leaders said will continue the Republican trifecta’s work of lowering costs for Iowans.
“We cut taxes to ensure Iowans could keep more of their hard-earned money, and we must maintain spending discipline to ensure it stays that way,” Reynolds said in a statement Monday. “Iowa remains on a strong fiscally sustainable path, and we should continue our focus on putting taxpayers first.”
House Speaker Pat Grassley said in a news release the House Republicans budget also follows conservative fiscal beliefs while providing needed state financial support for services Iowans care about.
“Our caucus is committed to delivering a budget that follows responsible budget practices, while funding the priorities Iowans care most about,” Grassley said in a statement. “Iowans expect to see their tax dollars used wisely to fund important services like nursing homes, paraprofessional pay, support for human trafficking victims, and more of that sort, and that’s what this House Republican caucus is fighting to deliver.”
The House plan would give Iowa a state budget of $9.45 billion in FY 2026, an increase of $506 million, or 5.65%, from FY 2025. It’s a higher target than the $9.41 billion budget agreed upon between the Senate and Reynolds.
Comparing the two budget proposals, the differences are:

A roughly $1 million difference for the Administration and Regulations budget, the appropriations for the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals, and Licensing (DIAL), the departments of Administrative Services and Revenue, as well as other state agencies and offices including the Secretary of State’s Office. The Senate target is $73.5 million, and the House’s is $74.5 million.
The House also set a $1.7 million higher budget target in the Agriculture and Natural Resources budget than the Senate and governor are proposing. This funding, going to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, Department of Natural Resources and related outdoors and farming services, has a Senate GOP target of $45.6 million and House GOP target of $47.3 million.
For Economic Development appropriations, the House is asking for $450,000 more, a total of roughly $40.6 million, compared to the Senate and Reynolds’ $40.2 million target. This pot of funding goes to the Iowa Economic Development Authority, Iowa Finance Authority, Iowa Department of Workforce Development and related entities.
There’s a larger difference in the Education funding goals between the two chambers projections — House Republicans are asking for $15 million more in the education appropriations bill than what the Senate and governor’s plan provides. This funding is separate from State Supplemental Aid, the per-pupil funding going to Iowa’s K-12 schools. This money heads to the state Department of Education, public universities governed by the state Board of Regents, the Department for the Blind and other education-related services. The Senate’s budget goal is set at $1,026,386,031, and the House at $1,042,264,716.
Health and Human Services is the one of the two funding categories where the Senate and Reynolds’ plan has a higher funding target than the House’s plan. The Senate and governor are asking for nearly $500,000 more for the appropriations bill that goes to the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Veteran Affairs. The Senate’s budget target is $2,468,992,645 and the House’s is $2,468,514,264.
For the Justice System and Judicial Branch, the House is asking for roughly $3 million more in funding, with the Senate goal set at $925.9 million and the House at $928.9 million. These funds will go to the state’s judicial system, as well as state law enforcement entities, the Iowa Department of Justice and Department of Corrections.
The chambers’ goals for standings appropriations — typically a grab bag of other state funding obligations that includes the state SSA funding — public K-12 school funding — is the other area where the Senate has a higher target set than the House. The Senate is asking for $4,836,758,719 in standings, while the House is asking for $4,851,312,672. A majority of this money has already been designated through SSA for K-12 funding, but there is still a $3 million difference between the two budget goals for the measure.

As of Monday afternoon, the House budget bills have not yet been released, and not all the specific items causing disagreements between the Senate and House Republicans’ on spending priorities are public. House Republicans said in a news release that budget subcommittees “will continue their work to finalize their individual budgets.”
However, Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, the House Appropriations chair, highlighted increased funding for community colleges and continued support for the paraeducator pay increase included in last year’s bill making changes to the state’s Area Education Agencies system as priorities for House Republicans.
“As Iowa House Republicans, we have built our reputation on passing responsible budgets that have allowed us to lower the tax burden while funding Iowans’ budget priorities,” Mohr said in a statement. “… We are prepared to deliver once again on the promises we make to our constituents.”
Democrats criticized Republicans’ spending goals, stating the GOP budgets provide more money to wealthy Iowans while cutting funding going to those in need. Rep. Timi Brown-Powers, D-Waterloo, denounced Republicans’ budget for including a 44% increase for the state Education Savings Account program, providing state funds for private school tuition and associated costs that will have no income limits beginning in the 2025-2026 school year, and for providing “another $1 billion tax break to corporations that lay off workers.”
“Iowa Republicans have the wrong budget priorities, and plan to spend more than the state takes in forcing the state to borrow money for ongoing expenses,” Brown-Powers said in a statement. “As costs continue to rise for families, House Democrats will fight to lower costs for Iowans and pass a fiscally responsible budget.”
Senate Republicans said they plan to hold subcommittee and committee meetings on their budget bills this week.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch )The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted an emergency waiver permitting the nationwide sale of a fuel blend with higher amounts of ethanol through the summer months, which Iowa fuel and farm leaders say will help farmers, fuel producers and Iowans at the pumps. 
Midwestern states, including Iowa, already had waivers in place to allow for summer sales of fuel blended with 15% ethanol, also known as E15. EPA’s decision Monday waives the agency’s summer restrictions on the fuel for the rest of the country and follows guidance from the president’s executive order from January, declaring a national energy emergency. 
The press release from EPA said the move will “provide families with relief” by providing more options at the pump with lower prices per gallon. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig applauded the decision and said Iowa drivers saved more than $38 million by choosing E15 over E10, a lower blend of ethanol fuel, in 2024. 
“Today’s E15 announcement by the Trump Administration is a win for consumers across the U.S. and farmers here in Iowa,” Naig said in a statement. “This decision is a big step toward making our country more energy dominant, independent, and secure.” 
Iowa Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley both applauded the measure, noting it was an example of “promises made, promises kept” by the president and would be a “big” boost for corn farmers. 
“It’s clear (President Trump) is making our farmers, producers, and all of rural America a priority, and I look forward to working alongside him to secure permanent, nationwide access to this cleaner, cheaper choice at the pump,” Ernst said in a statement.
According to National Corn Growers Association, year-round E15 sales throughout the country would lead to an increased demand of more than 2 billion bushels of corn annually, which is why the group has pushed for increased ethanol demand. 
Brent Johnson, president of Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, applauded the EPA decision, but noted EPA has consistently issued similar waivers, and urged for a permanent change to the rule. 
“Clearly, there is strong consumer demand for a lower-cost fuel option at the pump, and Iowa farmers stand by readily able to meet the growing demand for biofuels,” Johnson said in a statement.
Naig similarly noted the need for a permanent regulation allowing the sale of the fuel. He, along with Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and industry groups have all sent letters to congressional leaders urging the passage of such a law. 
“We are tired of waiting,” Monte Shaw, executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association said in a statement. “Consumers and retailers are tired of waiting. E15 could provide a market for 5 to 7 billion gallons of additional ethanol demand at a time when American farmers and rural communities are hurting.”
The EPA waiver is in place from May 1 through May 20, as the Clean Air Act only allows a 20-day waiver, but considering trends from the past several summers, industry leaders expect the waiver will be extended through the other summer months.

Glenn Youngkin's request that he drop out. (Photo courtesy of John Reid)The internal drama roiling Virginia Republicans deepened over the weekend as John Reid, the party’s embattled nominee for lieutenant governor, accused Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s political action committee of extortion — escalating an already explosive rift just months before November’s elections.
In a defiant video posted Sunday afternoon on X, formerly Twitter, Reid alleged that a representative of Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC told his team the organization would purchase damaging opposition research and “the lies and threats against me would suddenly stop” if he agreed to drop out of the race. 
The allegations come just 48 hours after it became public that Youngkin had personally asked Reid to withdraw over concerns about a social media account linked to explicit content.
Reid, a conservative radio host and the first openly gay statewide candidate from either party in Virginia, said he had hoped the controversy would settle, but instead the pressure had intensified.
“I had certainly hoped that we could put the bigotry and ugliness of last week behind us and unify our Republican ticket this year,” Reid said in the video. “But shockingly, once again representatives of my campaign have been told by the leader of Governor Youngkin’s political organization that the attacks on me will continue unless I drop out of the race for lieutenant governor.”
Spirit of Virginia is headed by political consultant Matt Moran, vice president of Creative Direct.
Under Virginia law, it is a crime to threaten a person’s reputation, safety, property, or immigration status in order to extort money, property, or any financial benefit. Specifically, the law classifies it as a Class 5 felony to use threats, accusations of criminal conduct, or the misuse of immigration documents as leverage for financial or personal gain.
However, Eric Claville, a political and legal analyst at Norfolk State University, urged caution before drawing any legal conclusions from Reid’s allegations. 
“This is politics, and politics is all about perception, and with that being the case, I would not want to speak on the legality of it, because we don’t have all the evidence,” Claville said. “We can only speculate, and that’s what both sides are doing now.”
Claville noted that while Reid’s accusations may stir public outrage, proving criminal conduct would require far more than speculation. 
“When you take a look at what has transpired, it is all speculation and hearsay. Therefore, in the legal court, that would have to be tried out and also go through the legal process in order to make a determination,” he said. “However, in the court of public opinion, which is different from a legal proceeding, it basically comes down to the rules of what is reality and what is not, as it relates to the audience, or the public at large.”
For now, Claville said, Reid appears to have the stronger public narrative. 
“You have candidate Reid making a strong case on his end, and there really is not a strong rebuttal on the other end,” he said. “So at this point, that’s going to have to go through the legal proceedings and of course, the court of public opinion.”
Ultimately, Claville emphasized that the larger issue is mostly political. 
“At the end of the day, the question is, what is the impact upon the ticket – and that impact is massive, and they’re going to have to determine if this is a viable path forward to be competitive in the upcoming election,” he said. 
As of late Monday afternoon, Republican leadership remained notably silent. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears — the party’s nominee for governor and the headliner of the statewide GOP ticket — has yet to weigh in on the controversy. 
A spokeswoman for Earle-Sears’ campaign and a spokesman for Spirit of Virginia did not respond to multiple phone calls and text messages. Neither did Ken Nunnenkamp, the party’s executive director. Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, the newly elected chair of the Republican Party of Virginia, declined to comment Monday.
Adding to the signs of turmoil, an event scheduled for Wednesday at Atlas 42 in Henrico County featuring the statewide Republican ticket — with Youngkin billed as a special guest — has been canceled, according to a report by Virginia Scope.
Even as the controversy swirled, Reid was set to appear Monday evening at a rally hosted by the Loudoun County Republican Committee in Sterling. Loudoun GOP Chair Scott Pio told The Mercury that the event would go forward as planned and that Reid continued to have his support.
“The Republican Party has been removing staunch Republicans for the past three years from elected office all across the state because they’re unhappy with conservatism being pushed,” Pio said, voicing his frustration with efforts to boot Reid off the ticket.
In his video, Reid did not mince words about the pressure he said he faced. 
“This is extortion and it is illegal in Virginia, and I am more outraged now,” he said of the proposal his campaign received from Youngkin’s PAC. Reid added that he has engaged legal counsel to “pursue all options” and slammed what he called the arrogance of party insiders trying to oust him after he became the legal nominee.
“The insiders in Virginia politics made a big miscalculation if they thought that I would bow down to anyone or run away scared,” he said. “I’m a conservative Trump supporter and I’m gay, and everybody knows it because I’ve told you in person and in the media for decades.”
The latest twist follows days of escalating conflict that first broke into public view Friday when The Richmonder reported that Youngkin had privately urged Reid to withdraw after a Tumblr account — bearing the same username Reid uses elsewhere — surfaced featuring sexually explicit content. A spokesperson for Youngkin’s PAC said the governor learned of the account late Thursday and called Reid the next morning.
“The governor was made aware late Thursday of the disturbing online content. Friday morning, in a call with Mr. Reid, the Governor asked him to step down as the lieutenant governor nominee,” Spirit of Virginia said in a statement.
Reid denied the account was his, countering in an earlier video that “anyone on the internet can open accounts with the same or similar names as other people,” and saying he had never publicly performed or posted pornographic material.
Reid said while he expected “harassment and vulgar attacks” from “radical” Republicans and “angry leftists,” he did not expect Youngkin, whom he had long supported, to call for his resignation “without even showing me the supposed evidence or offering me a chance to respond.”
“I did not accept that and I deeply resent it,” he said.
Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said the turmoil surrounding Reid’s candidacy highlights deeper challenges for Virginia Republicans heading into a critical election cycle.
“The biggest challenge that you have as a first-time statewide candidate is getting your name out there in the public,” Farnsworth said. “That’s not going to be a problem for John Reid.” But, he cautioned, the downside is significant: “This controversy won’t help Reid or the Republican ticket.”
Farnsworth noted the predicament reflects broader tensions within the GOP. 
“It is a very difficult situation for Republicans to both keep the enthusiasm of evangelical Christian voters and reach out to an increasingly visible gay segment of the electorate in Virginia,” he said. While Republicans have long struggled with balancing those constituencies, Farnsworth said, “it is certainly a more intense one right now, particularly given the governor’s rebuffed efforts to avoid a bigger controversy.”
Ultimately, Farnsworth argued, the situation adds yet another complication to an already challenging election year for Virginia Republicans. 
“The Republican party did not need another problem this year,” he said.
Reid’s unexpected ascent to the ticket came after Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity dropped out for health reasons last week. Had Reid agreed to withdraw, the Republican Party of Virginia’s state central committee would have been tasked with picking a replacement, Peake previously confirmed.
The controversy also unfolds against the backdrop of a broader debate over LGBTQ rights, as the General Assembly advances a constitutional amendment to erase a now-defunct ban on same-sex marriage — an issue that has divided Republicans, with many in the House and Senate either voting no or abstaining.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong vetoed a bill Monday that opponents worried would lead to state employees paying health insurance premiums.
Senate Bill 2160 would have moved the state’s insurance to a plan that offers benefits compliant with the federal Affordable Care Act.
Supporters of the bill said it would have given more flexibility to the state over health insurance plan options and would have provided better coverage of preventative care. Opponents said it could lead to employees paying health insurance premiums, which they don’t currently.
North Dakota House approves change to state health insurance plan

In Armstrong’s veto message to the Senate, he said the state’s health plans are one of the most valued benefits for state employees. He added it was one of the state’s “strongest and most useful recruitment and retention tools.”
“Senate Bill 2160 disposes of that tool and replaces it with a more expensive alternative,” Armstrong wrote.
The health plan switch was estimated to cost at least $25.8 million every two years, according to the governor’s office.
“The current health plan is better for state employees and employees of political subdivisions,” Armstrong wrote. He added, if the bill were to become law, state employees and employees of political subdivisions would have been put in separate health insurance pools, which would have raised the cost on both groups.
The vetoed bill will now go back to the Senate. It would take a two-thirds majority vote to override the governor’s veto.
The Senate passed the bill 44-2.

SB 1270 was one of a slew of bills that the Florida Senate chose to temporarily pass. That means the chamber puts the debate over a bill on hold for the time being. Senate leaders said they intend to vote on the health bill time permitting as the session enters it’s final scheduled week and the state budget for next fiscal year still subject to House-Senate negotiation.
Sen. Jay Collins is the bill sponsor.
The bill amends the existing “Florida Patient’s Bill of Rights” to permanently permanently enshrine policy changes regarding vaccinations that DeSantis put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The bill is problematic for Sen. Gayle Harrell, who worries that it opens physicians to increased medical malpractice lawsuits because it requires physicians to treat patients regardless of whether they reject their advice to be vaccinated. 
Another section of SB 1270 includes a fix to a 2024 law to allow the Florida Board of Medicine to approve an applicant’s licensure by endorsement in certain circumstances, a move that the board supports. That’s the route for any doctor who holds a medical license in one state to apply to practice in another.
The 2024 law law quashed the board’s ability approve by endorsement any physician applying for Florida licensure who:

 Has a complaint, an allegation, or an investigation pending before a licensing entity in another state or territory.
Has been convicted of, or pleaded no contest to, any felony or misdemeanor related to the practice of a healthcare profession, regardless of adjudication, 
Has had a healthcare provider license revoked or suspended by another state,
Has voluntarily surrendered any license in lieu of having disciplinary action taken against the license.
Has been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank, which includes medical malpractice settlements.

The National Practitioner Data Bank includes information on medical malpractice settlements.
SB 1270 allows the Board of Medicine to approve an applicant’s licensure by endorsement as long as the offense reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank “would not constitute a violation of any law or rule in this state.”

Phil Bryant to FEMA Review Council as state awaits ruling on tornadoes,Geoff Pender and Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/04/28/trump-appoints-phil-bryant-fema/,"Trump wants to shift disaster relief from federal to state governments, and has denied FEMA aid to several states.","President Donald Trump has appointed former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant to the FEMA Review Council, which Trump has tasked to “fix a terribly broken system” and shift disaster response and recovery from federal to state government.
The appointment comes as Mississippi awaits a response from the Trump administration on whether it will approve Gov. Tate Reeves’ request for a federal disaster declaration for deadly tornadoes in mid-March. The federal declaration, which Reeves requested April 1, would allow families and local governments devastated by the storms to receive federal assistance. Trump recently denied a similar request for Arkansas.
Trump has said states should shoulder more of the burden for disaster response and recovery, and he and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have threatened to shut down the Federal Emergency Management Agency altogether.
“I am proud to announce the formation of the FEMA Review Council, comprised of Top Experts in their fields, who are Highly Respected by their peers,” Trump wrote on social media. “… I know that the new Members will work hard to fix a terribly broken System, and return power to State Emergency Managers, who will help, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.”
Trump listed other members of the council, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia.
Bryant, a longtime political ally of Trump, on social media wrote he is, “Honored to receive this appointment …” and that “Unfortunately, we’ve earned a lot of experience with natural disasters and recovery in Mississippi. Let’s Make America Safe Again.”
Mississippi saw seven deaths and an estimated $18 million in destruction from multiple tornadoes on March 14-15, the same storm system that caused damage in Arkansas. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency reported that 233 homes were destroyed across 14 counties, and hundreds more were damaged.
During the initial aftermath, Reeves told reporters he believed there was a “high likelihood” the state’s damages from the March tornadoes would meet the threshold for FEMA’s Individual Assistance, which provides direct payments to disaster victims.
The Trump administration’s FEMA has denied federal assistance for flooding in West Virginia, tornadoes in Arkansas and a storm in Washington state, and refused North Carolina’s request for extending relief after Hurricane Helene.
After Hurricane Katrina’s devastation in 2005, Mississippi received nearly $25 billion in federal relief spending, which state leaders have credited with saving the state from ruin and allowing communities and families to rebuild.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/07041842/AP_17343600123362-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-28 18:07:23.906936

Dave Rader after a Senate Republican Caucus meeting at the state Capitol in Oklahoma City on Monday. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — After a private meeting with state Superintendent Ryan Walters, Republican lawmakers made no promises that a leading state senator’s resolution would succeed in rejecting new academic standards proposed for social studies and science education.
Senate Education Committee chairperson Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, filed the resolution Thursday afternoon after half of the Oklahoma State Board of Education said they weren’t aware of changes made to the social studies standards before they approved them in February. Pugh declined to comment while exiting a closed-door Senate Republican Caucus meeting Monday.
Walters joined the caucus meeting midway through. Afterward, he declined to share details of what he discussed but said he had a “great conversation” and “appreciated the invite.”

Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said after the meeting the GOP majority is still discussing whether it will put Pugh’s resolution up for a vote by the full Senate. In previous weeks, he said there hadn’t been “a whole lot of movement to reject those standards” among the caucus.
Both the Senate and the House must agree on a resolution by Thursday to take any action on the standards. State law gives lawmakers 30 legislative days after receiving academic standards to consider them and vote. If the Legislature doesn’t pass a resolution, the standards will take effect as written. 
Academic standards dictate the topics that public schools must teach to students. They are reviewed and updated every six years.
Five House members signed on as co-authors of Pugh’s resolution on Monday, including the chamber’s No. 2 Republican leader, Speaker Pro Tem Anthony Moore, R-Clinton. 
The group of co-authors also includes Common Education Committee Chairperson Dick Lowe, R-Amber; the committee’s Vice Chairperson Danny Sterling, R-Tecumseh; Rep. Tammy West, R-Oklahoma City; and Rep. Mike Osburn, R-Edmond, who is listed as the principal House author.
Lowe said lawmakers are troubled by the review and approval process that took place with the state Board of Education, rather than about the contents of the standards. Many of the constituents living in their House districts are concerned, as well, he said.

“We see the process was probably not as transparent as we’d like to see in state government,” Lowe said.
Pugh’s resolution similarly notes that “questions exist regarding the transparency of the subject matter standard adoption process.”
Whether the House has the chance to vote on the resolution depends on the Senate passing it first. Lowe said it then would be “a leadership decision” whether the resolution would get a hearing in the House.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, will comment on the resolution if it passes the Senate and comes over to his chamber, his spokesperson said.
Gov. Kevin Stitt and one of his recent state Board of Education appointees, Ryan Deatherage, said they would like the Legislature to send the social studies standards back to the board for another vote. Stitt raised doubts about whether Walters’ administration handled the process with the proper integrity.
Walters denied the governor’s claims that the Oklahoma State Department of Education emailed board members a different version of the proposed standards from what they ultimately approved. 
The Education Department provided email records indicating board members received a copy of the final draft at 4 p.m. the day before they met the following morning of Feb. 27 to vote on the standards. The board voted 5-1 to approve the standards and send them to the Legislature for final review.
The only board member who voted against them, Deatherage, said he hadn’t had enough time to read through the lengthy document.

He and two other board members, Chris Van Denhende and Mike Tinney, said Thursday they weren’t aware at the time of the vote of changes made from the original draft of the standards, which were posted publicly in December.
Some of the changes include the addition of language stating there were “discrepancies” in 2020 election results, including “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”
Walters said he made the final decision to add the new language after his administration received public comment and input from focus groups. National conservative media personalities and Republican policy advocates made up the leading committee that reviewed the social studies standards.
Pugh’s resolution points out the short timeframe that the board had to review the updated version. It also noted that the governor and board members requested the standards be returned to the state Board of Education “for proper review and consideration.”
  Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, speaks at a Jan. 27 news conference at the Oklahoma State Capitol. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
Given “the magnitude of the decision” and the $33 million cost to implement the new standards, the resolution proposes the Legislature reject them in full for both social studies and science.
House and Senate Democrats filed resolutions last month to reject the social studies standards. Last week, they again urged their Republican colleagues to take action before Walters’ proposal becomes mandatory teaching in all public schools.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, thought of how the new language would mix with the social studies homework her eighth grader brings home from public school.
“This week we talked about Brown v. Board of Education,” Kirt said during a news conference Wednesday. “We talked about Plessy v. Ferguson. We’re talking about very important concepts in history and social studies, and thinking about teachers having to try to present some of these (new) standards and my children trying to analyze them and understand the angle of them and to have critical thinking around them really deeply concerns me.”

The survey, titled the “First 100 Days Bipartisan Poll of the Hispanic Electorate,” was conducted by BSP Research for UnidosUS, Voces Unidas, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), and Climate Power en Acción. Pollsters conducted interviews in English and Spanish of 1,002 voters nationwide, and 158 in Florida.
The survey of those Florida Hispanic voters shows that 57% believe the country is going in the wrong direction, with 70% of those saying that President Trump and his administration are responsible.
The cost of living/inflation and jobs and the economy were the most important issues for voters surveyed in Florida, although they gave Republicans a one-point lead, 36%-35%, on which party is best equipped to address those issues. Another 18% said neither party, while 12% said both parties.
Regarding immigration, only 17% of Florida Hispanic voters support deporting all undocumented immigrants, no matter how long they have lived in the United States, while 56% support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have been here a long time.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced on Saturday that the agency and state law enforcement in Florida arrested nearly 800 people over four days in a “massive, multi-agency immigration enforcement crackdown,” a move celebrated by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Of the 158 Florida voters surveyed in the poll, 49% said they voted for Trump last fall and 47% for Democrat Kamala Harris. Trump defeated Harris, 56%-43%, in Florida, and Florida Hispanics went for Trump by that same breakdown, according to an exit survey of 500 voters in Florida conducted by the 2024 American Electorate Poll of Hispanic Voters.

Now, affordable housing providers are looking at a much more austere funding landscape: one where they fear deep federal cuts to housing programs are soon in store.“Federal resources will likely no longer be available in the future, and low-income people who rely on a very shaky safety net will soon see that net cut into pieces,” said Michael Monte, the CEO of the housing trust, at a ribbon-cutting event on Monday.Vermont’s housing sphere has seen the initial impacts of the Trump administration’s sweeping staffing and spending cuts, from clawbacks of grants for anti-discrimination work and the sudden terminations of voluntary corps workers building homes. Neighborworks, a congressionally-chartered nonprofit that helped fund the Colchester apartments, has recently come under the security of the Department of Government Efficiency. But housing leaders worry that deeper federal cuts to affordable housing funding and rental assistance programs could be coming – and they fear the state wouldn’t have enough capacity to backfill potential cuts. Nearly a third of the Colchester project’s $31.6 million price tag came from pandemic-era federal funds, said Nancy Owens, president of Evernorth, a co-developer of the project. Amid Vermont’s worsening levels of homelessness, she implored state leaders to find new funding sources for subsidized housing.Michael Monte, CEO of Champlain Housing Trust, speaks at a ribbon cutting event for an affordable housing project in Colchester on Monday, April 28th.

During the early 20th century, they served as barracks to one of the first Black U.S. Army regiments in peacetime after the Civil War – who were deployed to clear western lands of indigenous people. The entryways of the buildings have signs documenting that past. More recently, the buildings served as dorms and offices for nearby St. Michael’s College. Studio apartments will rent for $1,100, and one-bedrooms list for $1,250. Eighteen of the apartments have deeper subsidies from the Burlington Housing Authority, meaning rents will be capped at one third of the tenant’s income. (Median rent plus utilities in Chittenden County in 2023 was about $1,600).READ MORE

Only 125 of the 720 homes built in Vermont’s most populous county in 2023 were considered affordable, falling short of housing leaders’ goals. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Affordable apartments open in Colchester as housing leaders fear federal cuts.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CHT_Apts_042825-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 18:07:23.906936

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A coalition of labor groups has cleared a major hurdle in an effort to repeal a controversial bill passed earlier this year that prohibits public unions from collective bargaining. 
The Protect Utah Workers coalition, in its bid to repeal HB267, satisfied two of the requirements to qualify for a ballot referendum on Monday. According to data from the lieutenant governor’s office, the coalition gathered signatures from at least 8% of the state’s registered voters — including signatures representing 8% of voters in at least 15 of Utah’s 29 state Senate districts. 
Per the lieutenant governor’s office, county clerks around the state have verified 146,480 signatures, above the roughly 141,000 threshold required to qualify for a referendum. 
Labor coalition shatters threshold to qualify for referendum in effort to repeal union bill

And data analyzed by political consulting and public affairs firm Morgan & May shows that the 8% threshold has also been met in 15 Senate districts. 
If those numbers hold up, it’s likely HB267 will be put on hold until the general election in November 2026, where voters will decide whether the controversial law should take effect. 
“Today, Utahns made history,” the coalition said in a statement on Monday, noting there are still “tens of thousands more signatures awaiting verification.” On April 16, the coalition announced it submitted 320,000 signatures gathered in the 30-day window required under Utah law — if accurate, it would be the most successful referendum effort in state history. 
“The message is clear: Utahns still believe in checks and balances, accountability, and the power of the people to lead,” the coalition said on Monday. 
According to Morgan & May, the coalition met the threshold in the following Senate districts: 

Republican Sen. John Johnson’s District 3, which includes North Ogden, Huntsville and parts of Summit County like Wanship and Coalville. 
Republican Sen. Ann Millner’s District 5, which includes Ogden, South Ogden, Riverdale, Sunset and Clearfield. 
Republican Sen. Jerry Stevenson’s District 6 in parts of Layton and Kaysville. 
Republican Senate President Stuart Adams’ District 7, which includes Layton down to Centerville.   
Republican Sen. Todd Weiler’s District 8, which encompasses North Salt Lake, Woods Cross, Bountiful and parts of Salt Lake City. 
Democrat Sen. Jen Plumb’s District 9 in Salt Lake City
Democrat Sen. Luz Escamilla’s District 10 in Salt Lake and West Valley cities. 
Democrat Sen. Karen Kwan’s District 12 in Kearns, West Valley City and parts of Taylorsville. 
Democrat Sen. Nate Blouin’s District 13, which includes parts of Salt Lake City, Millcreek, South Salt Lake and Murray. 
Democrat Sen. Stephanie Pitcher’s District 14 in Salt Lake City, Millcreek, Holladay and Murray. 
Democrat Sen. Kathleen Reibe’s District 15, which includes parts of Sandy, West Jordan and Cottonwood Heights. 
Republican Sen. Wayne Harper’s District 16 in Taylorsville and West Jordan. 
Republican Sen. Lincoln Fillmore’s District 17 in South Jordan. 
Republican Sen. Dan McCay’s District 18 in Herriman, Riverton and Bluffdale. 
Republican Sen. Kirk Cullimore’s District 19 in Sandy and Draper. 

“Many of the qualified districts are represented by the very politicians who actively pushed (and sponsored) HB 267,” the coalition said. “Now, their own neighborhoods are standing up for public workers’ rights.”

County clerks still have until the first week of May to verify outstanding signatures — once a signature is verified, it’s made public, opening a 45-day window where the voter can choose to rescind their support for the referendum, if they choose.
When the county clerks are done, the lieutenant governor’s office will then review the process. Assuming the coalition has complied with state code and gathered enough valid signatures, ballot language will be crafted for the 2026 general election. The law will be put on hold until then. 
HB267 was one of the most controversial bills to come out of the 2025 legislative session, prohibiting public sector unions from collective bargaining. Once it takes effect on July 1, 2025, a public union, like a teachers union, will no longer be able to negotiate an employment contract with an employer, like a school district. 
Lawmakers say HB267 will protect taxpayer dollars while giving all public employees a voice, not just union members. The bill’s sponsors — Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, and Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy — said unions shouldn’t be negotiating terms of employment if they don’t represent a majority of the employees. 
But labor groups and members of the public opposed the bill, speaking out during committee meetings, protesting in the Capitol rotunda and urging the governor to veto. Despite concerns that it would erode their rights and eliminate leverage unions have when meeting with their employers, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed it on Valentines Day.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado House of Representatives will not vote to override Gov. Jared Polis’ veto of a bipartisan bill to regulate users who illegally sell drugs and firearms on social media platforms.
The chamber voted 51-13 on Monday afternoon to lay over the override vote until May 9, which is after the legislative session ends. That means the veto will stand and the bill will not become law.
“We have accepted the fact that the governor has exercised his authority to veto this bill, that the Senate has exercised their constitutional authority to override that veto, and that today, the votes are not here in this chamber to do the same. That is a statement of fact,” bill sponsor Rep. Andrew Boesenecker, a Fort Collins Democrat, said.
He said he would bring the bill back in the future.

Senate Bill 25-86 aimed to protect vulnerable young people from predatory social media users who try to sexually exploit them online or sell them drugs or guns. It would have required social media companies, such as X and Meta, to investigate and remove users they determine violate policies around those behaviors. It also would have required companies to hand over related materials to law enforcement within three days of a request.
The bill originally passed the Senate on a 29-6 vote and the House on a 46-18. Polis, a Democrat, vetoed the bill last week, but the Senate voted to override the veto, which requires a two-thirds majority from both chambers. The House would have needed 43 votes to override.
If successful, it would have been the first override against a Polis veto.
“This law imposes sweeping requirements that social media platforms, rather than law enforcement, enforce state law,” Polis wrote in his veto letter. “It mandates a private company to investigate and impose the government’s chosen penalty of permanently deplatforming a user even if the underlying complaint is malicious and unwarranted. In our judicial proceedings, people receive due process when they are suspected of breaking the law. This bill, however, conscripts social media platforms to be judge and jury when users may have broken the law or even a company’s own content rules.”
Polis said he looks forward to working with lawmakers to achieve the bill’s goals, but he said “the approach set forth in SB25-086 risks undermining efforts to protect the right of free speech and dissent, and empowers social media companies with police-like powers to make or break someone’s lives and livelihood in a time when free expression is absolutely critical.”
Groups from across the political spectrum, including the ACLU, Working Families Party and Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, urged Polis to veto the bill, primarily on First Amendment concerns.
Bill supporters saw it as a way to protect children who use social media. If a person sold drugs to young people near their school, they would be punished, they argue, and social media is the modern equivalent of that scenario.
Polis also vetoed a bill that would set a different timeline for open records request responses for non-journalists. Sponsors have floated trying to override that veto as well, but the Senate delayed a vote on it until later this week. The legislative session ends May 7.

Chris Murphy takes his ’emergency’ message on the road,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/28/chris-murphy-ct-emergency-message/,"As other Democrats grasp to respond to Trump, CT Sen. Chris Murphy is channeling his own frustration and anger into a blitz of appearances.","SAXAPAHAW, N.C. (AP) — Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy isn’t drawing arena-size crowds like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are as he tours the country talking to voters. But in a packed concert hall in rural North Carolina, people are starting to view the Democrat as worthy of the national spotlight.
Murphy and Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., have been staging events in Republican congressional districts in recent weeks, trolling GOP lawmakers such as Rep. Richard Hudson, who represents the area they visited Thursday. Hudson, the chairman of the House GOP campaign arm, has discouraged Republicans from holding town halls, so Murphy and Frost decided to hold one on his home turf in North Carolina.
“We are doing the job that these Republican congressmen and senators won’t do,” Murphy told the hyped-up crowd of mostly older voters at the event, while acknowledging that Democrats need to do more to soothe their anxiety and counter President Donald Trump. “I want to make sure that everywhere, in every corner of this country, people are willing to stand up and fight.”
As other Democrats grasp for a response to Trump’s election, unsure of how to confront him, Murphy is channeling his own frustration and anger into a sustained blitz of television appearances, fundraising appeals, Senate floor speeches and events like the one in North Carolina. He also is talking directly to voters on social media, including through lengthy live videos on Instagram where he sits in his kitchen with a cocktail and tries to explain what he sees as “the central story” of Trump’s presidency — “the billionaire takeover of our government made possible by the destruction of our democracy.”

It’s a methodical approach for Murphy, 51, a serious-minded legislator who has been most well known for his yearslong fight to stem gun violence in the aftermath of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that killed 20 first-grade students and six educators.

While the kitchen talks on Instagram seem to come more naturally to Murphy than riling up a crowd, his message is clearly resonating with his party’s base of voters, many of whom are angry at Democrats in Washington for inaction. He raised around $8 million in the first quarter of the year, a significant sum that could rival the totals for Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, who have been drawing much larger crowds on a tour together.
“I mean, I’m not Bernie Sanders,” Murphy said in an interview after the event in Saxapahaw. “I’m not going to draw 70,000 people. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t still have an obligation to try to go out and support a national mobilization.”
Frustration with the Democratic Party’s leaders came to a boil last month, with most of the anger directed at Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York after he voted for a Republican bill to keep the government open just as the base was hoping to see more fight from their elected officials. Murphy was strongly against the bill, even if opposing it meant Democrats would trigger a government shutdown.
“When people see us engaged in risk-adverse behavior, then they are much less likely to show up for rallies to ultimately engage in the kind of civil disobedience we might need to save the democracy,” Murphy said.

His fundraising haul, and his barrage of media and events, raises questions about his future ambitions. But it is unclear where Murphy’s moment might lead. He insists that he is not thinking about a presidential bid or a future in Senate leadership after the No. 2 Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, announced this week that he will retire next year.
“It’s probably not a coincidence that my content is breaking through and more people are listening to me at a time when I’m not getting up every day thinking about my personal political future,” said Murphy, who was reelected to the Senate last year. “There’s not going to be an election in 2028 if we don’t win this fight right now.”
The answer isn’t a cop out, he says. “It seems kind of silly to think about anything other than the emergency that exists today,” he said. “That is legitimately what drives me.”
Ron Osborne, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Alamance County, where Thursday’s event was located, said he had not previously considered Murphy a major contender for the presidency in 2028. But “he’s doing the right things,” Osborne said.
“He is speaking out where others could do the same thing and have not,” Osborne said, and “that takes courage.”
Terry Greenlund, a 78-year-old Democrat who was also in the audience, said he thinks Murphy “has a way of talking with people.”
“I think it’s time for a new generation to move in with some new views and insight and energy,” Greenlund said, echoing many others in the room.

A spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee said Hudson would not comment on the event in his central North Carolina district. The spokesman, Will Kiley, said Murphy had “parachuted in” and his “extreme, far-left values couldn’t be more out of step with these communities.”
Murphy, 51 and the father of two teenagers, seems to be enjoying the attention. He joked at the event that he may not be as “cool” as Frost, who is the youngest member of Congress at 28. But Murphy is still decades younger than Schumer, Durbin and other Democratic colleagues who have controlled the party for years.
“I’m trying to be dad cool,” Murphy said.
Murphy, who did a similar event in Missouri on Friday, is not the only Democrat venturing into red states. In addition to Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 vice presidential nominee, and Rep. Ro Khanna of California have also recently traveled to talk to voters in Republican areas.
He said he does not want to “reinvent the wheel” with his fundraising haul, but he does not want to sit on it, either. Murphy said he plans to help organizations mobilize voters before the 2026 midterm elections and also put pressure on Republicans as they try to push tax and spending cuts through Congress.
“The only way that history tells us that you stop an elected leader from converting a country away from democracy is mass mobilization,” he said.
“Our party has made mistakes, and if we don’t learn from those mistakes,” Murphy said, “we’re cooked.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Almost 100 days into his second term, President Donald Trump has seen his approval in South Carolina dip slightly, according to a Winthrop Poll released Monday. Still, favor for Trump in the state outperformed his ratings on the national stage.
The poll, published on the eve of his 100th day in office, found that 49.8% of people who had an opinion approved of Trump’s work thus far, a more than three percentage point drop since March.
Scott Huffmon, a political science professor at Winthrop and the poll’s director, told the SC Daily Gazette that the rapid slicing of the federal government, a slew of executive orders and tariffs increased Trump’s polarization, especially as some start feeling the direct impact of those decisions.
“We’re seeing more people get used to Trump the president and not Trump the candidate,” he said.
Whether or not respondents looked favorably upon the president’s performance to date tracked heavily along party lines.
Among self-identified Republicans, who made up roughly a third of all respondents, Trump’s approval rating sits at 80% — largely unchanged since March. Meanwhile, disfavor among self-identified Democrats, who made up a quarter of all respondents, grew four points to 85%.
The remaining 42% of all respondents identified as independent or declined to name a political affiliation.
(Voters don’t register by party in South Carolina, and the poll was not limited to likely voters.)

Similarly, the Winthrop poll found that 47% of South Carolinians believe the country is on “the wrong track.” Eighty-one percent of Democrats hold that sentiment. Inversely, Republicans think the opposite, with 69% of respondents saying it is trending in the right direction.
“People’s opinions on the direction the country is headed depend heavily on whether their side holds power,” Huffmon said. “This is true at both the national and state level.”
More popular in the Palmetto State
Despite increased skepticism, Trump, who received more than 58% of the vote in November in South Carolina, remains more popular in the Palmetto State than he does nationwide.
A survey from Pew Research Center released on April 23 found the president’s national approval rating to be at 40%. Gallup has Trump at 44%, according to its most recent poll.
“South Carolina approval for President Trump among those with an opinion is notably higher than his national support but struggles to break into a clear majority,” Huffmon said.
On average, Trump’s approval rating sits at 44% as of Monday, according to a New York Times aggregation of numerous polls around the country. On Feb. 17, the president had an average approval of 50%.
In a Truth Social post Monday morning, Trump said not to believe the numbers. He specifically criticized a trio of polls, saying they should be investigated for election fraud.
He mentioned a joint survey done by ABC, The Washington Post and Ipsos, which concluded Trump had a 39% approval rating. He also railed against a New York Times-Siena Poll where 42% of respondents approved of him, as well as a Fox News survey that placed his favorability at 44%.
“They are Negative Criminals who apologize to their subscribers and readers after I WIN ELECTIONS BIG, much bigger than their polls showed I would win,” Trump wrote.
Graham lags among GOP
The Winthrop Poll also took South Carolinians’ temperature on other GOP politicians — notably U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is seeking his fifth term in the Senate in 2026.
At 44%, Graham’s approval rating among partisan Republicans who expressed an opinion was noticeably lower than two other statewide officials included in the poll — U.S. Sen. Tim Scott and Gov. Henry McMaster.
McMaster and Scott, the co-chairs for Graham’s 2026 re-election campaign, had a 58% and 56% approval rating among Republicans.
Graham has $15.9 million cash on hand, according to the latest FEC filings and already secured Trump’s endorsement for next year’s election.
“Senator Graham has a large campaign war chest and is not underwater approval-wise with his party,” Huffmon said. “This is a decent foundation upon which one could build a strong re-election campaign. Still, many on the right may view the fact that Graham’s numbers are substantially lower than those of his GOP colleagues as an invitation for a primary challenge.”
Graham has drawn multiple primary challengers in his last two Senate bids.
Mark Lynch, a Greenville businessman, announced a bid to challenge Graham in February. He moved more than $5 million of his own money into his campaign account in March, according to FEC filings.
The latest Winthrop poll was conducted online and via telephone between April 4 and April 12 from a sampling of South Carolina adults; 1,546 people responded.
The results were weighted to align with South Carolina’s demographics for race, sex and age based on census data. Findings using all respondents have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.49%. The margin of error increases to 4.29 points with Republican respondents and 5.05 points with Democratic respondents.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2211668489-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 18:07:23.906936

Sitting in his living room, the 78-year-old explained how much his community of manufactured homes means to him — and how frustrated he is with the state. Along the curved roads of Williston Woods Homeowners Association, most residents like Cook are seniors who get by on a fixed income. They can’t afford to make home improvements, Cook said. And some renos, like bathtub railings, are especially important for seniors, he said. Usually someone who lives in a manufactured or mobile home park can apply for state money to help pay for home-improvement projects. But Cook’s community, as a homeowners association, isn’t a mobile home park under Vermont law — so the state won’t list it on the registry that opens up those funds.Cook is one of 47 residents in the neighborhood, a designated affordable housing community for seniors. As a member of the association, he can afford a multi-bedroom house adorned with matte white siding — and, uniquely, ownership of the land it sits on.That’s why the state says the residents don’t face the same challenges, or need the same support, as people in traditional mobile home parks. Cook and his neighbors disagree. “The issue is that we’re not on the state registry — and it’s causing us a lot of grief,” Cook said. A note outlining grievances from Williston Woods Homeowners Association over its exclusion from the state registry for mobile home parks. Photo by Catherine MorrisseyAssociation leaders have been pressuring the state for years to recognize their community. After talks this spring, Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast, wrote to the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, which manages the registry. She asked them for an exception and never heard back. “They are the only mobile home community that’s come forward in the state where they own their homes, they own the land underneath them and they own the park collectively,” Ram Hinsdale said. The agency told Community News Service that state assistance is meant to help people more vulnerable than the residents. Officials don’t plan on recognizing the park under current laws but said they will continue to work with residents on other ways to help them. The state offers grants for making repairs, installing foundations, hauling away abandoned homes and more. The manufactured home program has paid over $6 million in awards, the agency says.READ MORE





 


Vermont is pouring millions into manufactured homes and mobile home parks

To fit the state’s definition, at least two mobile homes have to sit on a piece of land owned by one owner. Right next door to Williston Woods Homeowners Association lives Williston Woods Cooperative Housing Corporation, a manufactured home co-op that functions almost exactly the same as the homeowners association. But the co-op itself owns the whole park, while the association parcels land out for individual ownership. And the distinction earns the co-op a spot on the registry. Most of the homes in Cook’s community were built in the 1980s, he said, and manufactured homes need more weatherization and frequent maintenance than traditional homes. Many people in the community can’t afford the repairs, said Cook, and getting maintenance done is often harder for older folks. Joe Yandow, a 73-year-old who joined the community a few years ago, said his house needed major improvements when he moved in. An older woman with mobility issues owned the house before him, and she just couldn’t keep up with the repairs, Yandow said. Gary Nowak, a leader and resident of the association, in discussion in April 2025. Photo by Catherine MorrisseyHe said he had to renovate parts of the house and was denied funding at every step. Now he has a leak in the roof and needs the insulation in his attic replaced — but he’s not sure how to afford it.“The state’s going to have to step up,” Yandow said, speaking for himself and his neighbors.  Cook said recently a number of residents helped a woman walk up the stairs outside her home. She should be able to build a ramp or install a stairlift device without having to cover the cost, Cook said. Legislators tried to tackle the issue last year by proposing a bill to expand the definition of a manufactured home park. But officials at the Agency of Commerce and Community Development voiced concerns that a definition change would open the door for people who didn’t need the assistance. The bill was never passed. One of the main streets in Williston Woods Homeowners Association. Photo by Catherine MorrisseyThis February, Cook and another community leader, Gary Nowak, told a Senate committee about their frustrations. The men stayed in contact with their senator, Ram Hinsdale, and asked her again to take action.

Levenson, who represents the Diocese of Camden, listens to arguments before the New Jersey Supreme Court about clergy sex abuse on April 28, 2025, at the Richard J. Hughes Justice Complex in Trenton. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey Supreme Court heard arguments Monday in a long-fought case about whether a state grand jury can call out a private entity like the Catholic Church and recommend reforms for its public harms, like clergy sex abuse — or if such presentments are permissible only when they involve public entities and ongoing harms, as church attorneys contend.
The Catholic Diocese of Camden has been battling the state to prevent a presentment since 2019, when former Attorney General Gurbir Grewal vowed to investigate clergy sex abuse. He acted after a Pennsylvania grand jury returned a presentment against hundreds of priests who victimized more than 1,000 children over seven decades
Lower-court judges sided with the diocese and sealed the New Jersey case, so while the legal fight has continued for six years in secrecy, abuse victims were left wondering what happened to Grewal’s investigation. The Attorney General’s Office appealed to the Supreme Court for the final word, and the state’s top court agreed last month to consider the case and ordered some records unsealed.

Monday, Michael L. Zuckerman, the state’s deputy solicitor general, told the justices that trial and appellate judges erred by taking a “front-end, stop-the-presses approach” in preventing prosecutors from even taking the case to a grand jury and ruling on a presentment that does not yet exist.
“My frontline argument to you is that it is highly premature, inconsistent with the rule, for the trial court to have short-circuited this process before it could even start,” Zuckerman said. “And so for that reason, this court should simply reverse and remand for the process to go forward, possibly clarifying along the way that presentments can sometimes talk about non-governmental actors too.”
Any concerns about outing private individuals could be handled after a presentment is returned and before it is publicly disclosed, with a judge redacting or striking whatever they find concerning, Zuckerman added.
But attorney Lloyd D. Levenson, arguing for the Camden diocese, said clergy abuse was “long-ago conduct by private individuals that impacted only a fragment of the population.” Presentments must address “imminent” harms against a broad swath of the public perpetrated by public actors, such as government entities or public officials, so the lower courts were correct to thwart a presentment, Levenson added.
“If this court expands the scope of a grand jury presentment to include private individuals and private entities, conducting investigations in secret under the sole influence of a prosecutor with no opportunity to present a defense, the grand jury’s authority will be unlimited,” Levenson said. “Presentments were never intended to call attention to private conduct within private entities. We ask, respectfully, that this court affirm.”
He dismissed Zuckerman’s claim that barring a hypothetical presentment is premature.
“You’d have to be Rip Van Winkle to not realize what is going to come out of this,” he said. “I can tell you what’s going to come out of it: They’re going to say that from 1940 to the present, because that’s what the subpoena included, that there was problems in the Catholic Church with child sexual abuse.”
Abuse victims already have multiple avenues for justice — prosecutors can seek criminal indictments, and victims can sue for civil damages, Levenson said. He also cited a 2002 agreement between the state and New Jersey’s dioceses that required them to report all abuse allegations to public authorities. The state had five years to raise concerns about that agreement — but didn’t, proving that church has effectively “eradicated” the problem of sex abuse from its clerical ranks, he said.
Levenson also accused the state of “partisan” motives, questioning why prosecutors singled out the Catholic Church for investigation instead of other religious or private groups. He warned the justices that allowing the grand jury to weigh private entities’ conduct is “a slippery slope.”
“Where do you end this? Is the local rotary club, because it doesn’t admit women or minorities, subject to a presentment?” he said.
Several justices appeared unpersuaded by Levenson’s arguments.

“If the presentment does not exist, it’s hard to know if it’s based on partisan motives,” Justice Rachel Wainer Apter told him.
A presentment might not even have been returned had a grand jury heard the case, Justice Fabiana Pierre-Louis added.
“It’s really difficult to speculate as to what a presentment — if 12 grand jurors even vote on a presentment — will look like, and trying to determine how to assess something that has not yet come into existence,” Pierre-Louis said.
The justices also mused over what counts as “public affairs or conditions,” which presentments are meant to address. Court rules and precedents don’t specify that “every single member of the public” must be impacted for a harm to rise to the level of a public affair or condition, Wainer Apter said.
Chief Justice Stuart Rabner prodded Levenson about his complaint that Grewal announced his intention to secure a presentment in 2019, instead of just presenting the case to the grand jury without any public notice.
“Would we be here if the state had simply first started summoning victims to testify?” Rabner asked him.
State prosecutors have asked for an expedited review, with the Supreme Court expected to recess for the summer in June until October.
 Victims react
Several clergy abuse victims watched the arguments from the packed gallery. Outside the courtroom afterward, many were cautiously optimistic about how the court will rule.
“I am hopeful. That’s the best I could say,” said Toni Latario of Alpha.
Latario said she was 11 when she first met her abuser, a Catholic missionary. Now 66, she’s a retired sergeant from the Warren County Prosecutor’s Office, where she ran the special-victims unit. She went public with her childhood abuse as an adult because she was concerned her abuser might have preyed on other children too, she said.
Kathy Leddy-Callahan of Bergen County, who said she was abused as a child, objected to shielding the names of abusive priests and any church leaders who hushed up abuse. Anyone else credibly accused, charged, or convicted of abuse would be publicly named, she added.
“Absolutely, the name should be revealed. Without question. That notion of a heavenly umbrella that protects is absurd, and it also attracts people who do that,” Leddy-Callahan said.

Mark Crawford, the New Jersey state director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, condemned the Camden diocese’s secrecy.
“They’re out there standing on that podium saying: ‘We’ve done all this for victims, we’ve put the truth out there, there’s nothing hidden.’ Then why is it they have worked so hard to suppress this investigation?” Crawford said.
He also disputed Levenson’s claim that clergy abuse no longer is a problem.
“That’s just not true. It’s accepted science that children who are abused don’t generally come forward for decades, if ever. So how can you say in the present, ‘Oh, nothing’s going on?’” Crawford said. “The whole truth has not been told, and that’s why it takes society and a grand jury investigation to one, expose what they still have hidden, and two, to help those victims who were abused heal.”

The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services will participate in the SUN Bucks program again this summer, although Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration was at first reluctant to do so a year ago. The state agency is proactively telling families about the program, though it says nearly all participants are already signed up to receive the one-time benefit of $120.
“Most eligible children will be automatically enrolled and do not need to apply,” Sammy Guillory, DCFS assistant secretary for family support, said in a statement.
The summer benefits will be added to SNAP recipients’ EBT cards or the SUN Bucks card they were issued last summer. The money is available to use for 122 days after it is issued. It will be doled out starting in the second half of May for children already enrolled in the program. 
To be eligible, children must be born between Aug. 8, 2006, and July 1, 2028 and have received income-based food, financial or Medicaid support since July 1, 2024. The threshold for families to receive the assistance is a household income below 185% of the federal poverty level, which comes to $59,477 for a family of four.
Families who no longer have EBT or SUN Bucks cards should call 1-888-997-1117 or visit www.LifeInCheckEBT.com to request a replacement. Families who need to apply for SUN Bucks can do so online.
SUN Bucks evolved from a federal COVID pandemic food aid program that the Biden administration chose to keep in place in 2024. But when states were asked in late 2023 whether they would continue to participate the following summer, Louisiana Education Superintendent Cade Brumley opted out. His department determines eligibility for the program that DCFS administers.
Brumley explained at the time he thought it wasn’t fair to approve a program the incoming Landry administration would have to shoulder without any say-so.
Shortly after his appointment in early 2024, Landry’s DCFS secretary, David Matlock, also said his agency wouldn’t offer the Summer EBT program because “families deserve a pathway to self-sufficiency.” He insisted existing programs would cover food needs over the summer, although critics said many families lacked transportation to pick up the “grab-and-go” prepared meals Matlock was promoting.
The secretary later told state lawmakers his priority for any public resources would be addressing staff shortages within his department affecting child welfare.
The Landry administration ultimately caved under pressure from Republican lawmakers who noted for every $1 Louisiana spent to administer the summer food program, the state received $1.60 in federal funds. All told, the state stood to miss out on $70 million from Washington.
Louisiana was the second poorest state in the nation with a poverty rate of 18.9% in 2023, the most recent data available from the Census Bureau.  
Last year, nearly 670,000 Louisiana children received SUN Bucks benefits, and almost 100% were automatically enrolled, according to Guillory. Families who have changed their home address are encouraged to update their records with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and other assistance programs to avoid delays with receiving food assistance this summer.
In 2023, incorrect addresses prevented more than 124,000 children in Louisiana from receiving pandemic food assistance. Several states reported similar problems, but Louisiana was too slow to rectify the issue and lost $16 million in federal aid as a result.

A Tallahassee administrative judge on Monday recommended the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) deny a permit to drill for oil and gas in the Apalachicola River Basin in Northwest Florida.
Administrative Law Judge Lawrence P. Stevenson wrote that he might have ruled differently had Clearwater Land and Minerals LLC, the company intending to drill, presented a better plan for stormwater containment on the site, located in rural Calhoun County.
On April 26, 2024, the DEP issued the proposed permit to Clearwater, authorizing the company “to drill a directional exploratory well.” That permit was challenged in June 2024 by Apalachicola Riverkeeper, a nonprofit dedicated to the protection, restoration, and stewardship of the Apalachicola River and Apalachicola Bay.
The drilling site is within the 100-year floodplain of the Apalachicola River basin.
Riverkeeper has said that that if a spill were to occur at the site, it would have catastrophic consequences due to the proximity of the proposed well to the nearby streams, wetlands, and bodies of water, which would compound the difficulty of cleaning up the spill.
In testimony during an administrative hearing held in December, William K. Jones, described by the judge as an expert in the field of civil engineering and hydrology, was critical of the stormwater management design proposed by Clearwater. He described it as adequate for “a Dollar General in Blountstown,” but not to contain the toxic materials involved in the oil drilling process. (Blounstown is the Calhoun County seat).
“Mr. Jones’s detailed criticisms, set forth in the Findings of Fact above, established persuasively that the stormwater management plan originally proposed was inadequate,” Judge Stevenson wrote.
The judge also was critical of the DEP’s contention that, “because no commenting agency identified it as such, the proposed location by definition cannot be a ‘sensitive environment.'”
“First, DEP is abdicating its own duty to identify and protect sensitive environments by relying on what were, for the most part, very cursory reviews by the commenting agencies,” Judge Stevenson wrote.
“The more reasonable way to read the rule is that it allows commenting agencies to supplement DEP’s analysis, not replace it or absolve DEP from examining environmental issues. If DEP has previously found that an area contains a sensitive environment, it makes no sense that the rule would allow the Calhoun Board of County Commissioners to negate DEP’s finding.”
The order comes as the Florida Legislature was moving on a proposal (HB 1143) to ban oil exploration and drilling near the Apalachicola River. Last week, the Florida Senate took up and passed the House version with an amendment prohibiting drilling, exploration, or production of oil, gas, or other petroleum products in counties designated as “rural areas of opportunity” within 10 miles of a National Estuarine Research Reserve — meaning Gulf, Liberty, Franklin, and Calhoun counties.
Deepwater Horizon
In advocating for the bill, the co-sponsor of the measure in the House, North Florida Republican Jason Shoaf, noted the recent 15th anniversary of of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, an event that led to miles of oiled beaches in the Florida Panhandle.
“During the oil spill, just the threat of oil coming to our area completely crippled our economy and now we face another threat that is starting to really scare the entire community,” Shoaf said.
Because the bill was amended, it needs to go back to the House again for a final vote. The regular legislative session is scheduled to end this Friday, May 2. If the bill is passed, it would then go to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ desk.
Stevenson’s recommended order released on Monday now must go back to the Department of Environmental Protection for a final order.
Administrative judges in Florida are employed by the Division of Administrative Hearings (DOAH) within the Florida Department of Management Services. They serve as independent adjudicators, presiding over formal administrative hearings, where they act as both judge and jury to resolve disputes between state agencies and individuals or entities affected by agency decision.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Landmark College selects interim leader as new president.","Newly appointed president of Landmark College, Jim Dlugos. Photos courtesy of Landmark College.Jim Dlugos has been appointed the fifth president of the Putney-based Landmark College, the first college in the nation specifically designed to serve neurodiverse students, the college announced on Monday. Dlugos was named interim president of Landmark College in July, after a decades-long career in postsecondary education, including an 11-year role as president of St. Joseph’s College in Maine. Dlugos said he welcomed the opportunity to help Landmark College during a transition period and now in a permanent capacity because the mission of the college aligned with his individualized, learner-centered approach to education.Barbara Epifanio, the chair of Landmark College’s board of trustees, said in a written statement that the board realized during the search process that Dlugos had the “right vision and demeanor” for the position. “As we’ve gotten to know Jim as Interim President, and he’s gotten to know us, we came to realize there was an ideal fit for his experiences and the opportunities our institution presents,” Epifanio wrote. Landmark College, founded in 1985, offers six bachelor degree programs and five associate degree programs and serves approximately 500 students with dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism or executive function challenges.With Dlugos at the helm for most of the past year, the college moved forward on several initiatives, such as adding three majors in history, health sciences and media arts production next fall, he said. “At a time when most news from colleges and universities is about closing programs or shutting programs down, the fact that Landmark is adding programs is a really positive sign about our future,” Dlugos said. In January, Landmark College was named the primary recipient of a federal National Science Foundation grant geared toward bolstering educational and professional opportunities in science, technology, engineering and math in the southern Vermont region. Dlugos said the grant is moving forward, and the college is in the hiring and strategic planning phase of implementing projects made possible by the grant. READ MORE
“It’ll allow us to develop infrastructure for research, and research is the backbone of emerging businesses,” Dlugos said. “It’s really about economic development and strengthening the economy in southern Vermont, and so it’s going to end up with tremendous benefits for everyone who lives in southern Vermont.”Josh Moyse, associate professor of theater arts and the faculty senate chair, called Dlugos a “visionary and creative thinker” who engages in a holistic way with faculty to help steward the institution. The college was originally established as a certificate and tutoring program and began offering four-year degrees more than a decade ago, he said. “Our student profile has continued to evolve over these decades, and what that means is that we are often transitioning to new territory from within,” Moyse said. “Jim brings a wealth of experience in higher ed that is beyond Landmark and is able to see certain areas that we can simplify that may have become a little bit more cumbersome, which allows us to be more nimble as we move forward.”Grace Nelson, the president of the Student Government Association, said Dlugos has maintained an open dialogue with students and considered student perspectives during his stint as interim president and that she is grateful that Dlugos will remain the leader of Landmark College.“He’s done a lot of things that have improved some of my experiences with the school,” Nelson said. “With certain meetings, he’s changed some of the formats to make it more of an open conversation.”Nelson also pointed to weekly emails Dlugos sends out about national affairs and the potential impacts for Landmark to engage students, faculty and staff. “It’s more easily accessible for us and puts it in context,” she said.Last fall, the college acquired the defunct Windham College’s former gymnasium and field house building and is beginning renovations to transform the space into a “college community hub,” according to Dlugos.“Part of my hope for Landmark over the next number of years is that we become clear in our advocacy, developing neuro-inclusive communities, and part of that is having neuro-inclusive spaces,” Dlugos said. “The renovations really are going to be aimed at creating spaces that are going to be the best possible for people to learn differently, and the reality is we all learn differently.” Along with creating inclusive learning and gathering areas, Dlugos said one of his goals as president is to develop a strategic plan in the coming year to foster ongoing engagement with the school’s neighbors and the broader community.“We’re looking to really develop and strengthen our relationships with Putney and with the rest of Windham County,” Dlugos said. “I really want Landmark College to be seen as an anchor institution in Windham County, and so it’s important that we plan for the future, that we know what is important and on the mind of everyone in the area.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Landmark College selects interim leader as new president.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/landmark-college-composite.png?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

The statement was made in a Thursday video posted to X […],"Micah Beckwith, now Indiana's lieutenant governor, speaks to a crowd on Saturday, Oct. 26, 2024, in Greenwood. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith’s defense of the Three-Fifths Compromise — which he called “a great move” by the country’s founders toward ending slavery — has thrust the Republican official into the national spotlight and triggered sharp pushback from historians and civil rights groups.
The statement was made in a Thursday video posted to X in which Beckwith argued that the 18th century-era compromise limited the political power of pro-slavery states by not allowing them to count enslaved individuals as whole persons for congressional representation. 
The video, shared on the last day of Indiana’s 2025 legislative session, was a response to Statehouse debate around Senate Enrolled Act 289. The heart of that measure, authored by Republican Sen. Gary Byrne, limits diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in schools, state government and health profession licensing. The bill advanced to the governor on Thursday but has not been signed.
Beckwith took aim at Senate Democrats, specifically, for likening the bill to historical policies — like the Three-Fifths Compromise — that “dehumanized” marginalized groups. Sen. La Keisha Jackson, D-Indianapolis, who invoked the compromise and its history during her chamber testimony, called the Republican-backed legislation “a fight against racial equality.”
 Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith explains in his stance in defense of the Three-Fifths Compromise in a social media video posted Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Screenshot from a video posted to the lieutenant governor’s official X account)
“They were saying this is a bad bill because it actually just encourages discrimination, just like the Three-Fifths Compromise, going all the way back to the foundations of our nation,” Beckwith said. “I would like to share with you, the Three-Fifths Compromise is not a pro-discrimination compromise. It was not a pro-discrimination or a slave-driving compromise that the founders made. It was actually just the opposite. It was a compromise that the North made with the South.”
Beckwith’s official X account also doesn’t allow users to reply to the post.
Critics have since accused Beckwith of rewriting history and downplaying the horrors of slavery. 
In a joint statement issued by the Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis, the Indiana Chapter of the National Action Network and the Alliance of Baptists, the groups labeled Beckwith’s interpretation as “historical revisionism” and called for a formal retraction. They emphasized that the compromise was about consolidating control and political power while denying enslaved individuals their humanity and rights.
The groups further urged Gov. Mike Braun to publicly denounce the comments, but the Republican governor has yet to comment on the matter.
The pushback was highlighted in news stories by The Washington Post, Fox News, Newsweek and other major outlets.
Also on Monday, the Indiana Senate Democratic caucus released a statement denouncing Beckwith’s comments.
“No compromise that counted human beings as fractions can ever be anything but a stain on our nation’s conscience,” it said. “The Three-Fifths Compromise entrenched the enslavement of people, empowered oppression and delayed justice by generations.”










The argument that the Three-Fifths Compromise was actually passed with the intention of destroying or undermining slavery is just, frankly, laughable.


– Indiana University history professor Alex Lichtenstein


Neither Beckwith nor his office have released an official statement about his remarks on the Three-Fifths Compromise, but the lieutenant governor continued to defend his position in the days following the video’s posting.
Alex Lichtenstein, a history professor at Indiana University, described Beckwith’s retelling of history as “a confusion between intention and long-term consequences.”
“The intention of the compromise was, quite frankly, to sell out Black people. That is to lock them into slavery for longer term in the interest of creating the union,” Lichtenstein said. “The argument that the Three-Fifths Compromise was actually passed with the intention of destroying or undermining slavery is just, frankly, laughable.”
In 1787, during the Constitutional Convention, the nation’s founders included “multiple concessions” in the U.S. Constitution to Southern states, “designed to preserve and protect the institution of slavery,” Lichtenstein said.
The most significant was the Three-Fifths Compromise, which allowed Southern states to count three-fifths of their enslaved population for congressional representation — effectively giving them more political power and preventing the union from easily abolishing slavery.
The history professor described Beckwith’s comments and the ensuing debate as “a much broader assault in the country, but particularly in this state,” on universities like IU, and on faculty’s ability “to recognize and teach a complex American history story.”
“They’d much rather have a simple, straightforward story. ‘Oh yeah, the founders were perfect. They might have held slaves, but fundamentally, they were themselves opposed to slavery, and in their infinite wisdom, they built in these clauses that they knew could be used to defeat slavery in the long-term.’ Apparently they just didn’t really tell anyone, nor did they count on a civil war to have to make it happen,” he continued. “They want a particular form of history which makes them feel comfortable, but unfortunately for them, it’s wildly inaccurate.”
‘Rewriting’ the nation’s history
In the video posted on the lieutenant governor’s official X account, Beckwith admonished Senate Democrats for saying on the chamber floor that Byrne’s bill “embodies something to the effect of the Three-Fifths Compromise.”
His remarks continued into a history lesson, of sorts:
“At the time, there were basically 13 independent nations. They had not really created a constitution. They were sort of a European Union-esque nation, and they were saying to the pro-slave states, ‘Hey, if you want to count your slaves to have representation — more representation — in Congress, we’re not gonna let you do that,’ because they knew that that would codify things like slavery into our nation. 
And the North stood up to the South, and they said, ‘We’re going to count your property,’ because the South says, ‘Hey, this is our property, but we want to count them in the congressional representation. We want to count them in the census.’ At the time, 30,000 people would equal one member of Congress. And so they said, ‘We’re going to count our slaves. We’re going to get more members of Congress in the South.’ The North said, ‘You can’t do that.’ So when they came back to the South and they said, ‘Fine, if you want to count your property, your slaves, as whole people, we’re going to count our property. We’re going to count our tables, we’re going to count our chairs, we’re going to count all the stuff that we have in our house.’ And the South said, ‘Well, you can’t do that.’ And they said, ‘Well, you’re doing it with your property. We’re doing it with our property.’
Anti-DEI bill cracking down on ‘unlawful discrimination’ en route to governor’s desk

So what they did is they came up with a Three-Fifths Compromise. They said you will only get three-fifths of a vote when it comes to your slave. And what that did, it actually limited the number of pro-slave representatives in Congress by 40%. This was a great move by the North to make sure that slavery would be eradicated in our nation. They knew what they were doing, but now, here you have Senate Democrats in today’s American Republic who do not understand that.”
Beckwith’s take on the compromise’s history appear to echo interpretations by David Barton, an author and political activist revered in evangelical circles for promoting the idea that the United States was founded as a Christian nation. His interpretations of U.S. history have been met with significant criticism from many historians and scholars, however, who argue that Barton’s work contains inaccuracies and misrepresentations and proliferates the spread of “pseudo-history.”
Follow-up posts on Beckwith’s personal X account included a 2010 interview clip from Glenn Beck’s Fox News show, during which Barton described the Three-Fifths Compromise as a means to “cut the slavery representation in Congress in half.”
“When Frederick Douglass read that, he said, ‘The Three-Fifths Clause has nothing to do with worth. That has to do with representation. It makes it harder to get a pro-slavery representative in Congress. The Constitution’s an antislavery document,’ Barton said. “It was Frederick Douglass who points that out.”
Beckwith agreed with Barton, saying on X that “the great abolitionist, Fredrick Douglass, recognized the strategic value it gave our new nation in ultimately ending the evils of slavery and racial discrimination.”
He reiterated that “(w)ithout the 3/5ths Compromise there would be no United States” and “slavery would likely still be a normal part of the developed world.”
“It was a great step in the right direction which ultimately laid the foundation for the eradication of the evils of slavery and racial discrimination,” he said in on the social media site.
Intent vs. consequences
Lichtenstein said Douglass initially aligned with radical abolitionists who viewed the Constitution as “entirely pro-slavery.” In the 1840s, abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison, for example, “wanted to burn the Constitution and saw it as a “compact with the devil.”
But by the 1850s, Douglass shifted his stance. He began to see the Constitution as a potential tool to challenge slavery and recognized that the Three-Fifths Compromise “could be strategically used to undermine the institution of slavery,” turning a clause originally designed to protect slavery into a potential weapon against it.

Importantly, Lichtenstein emphasized, Douglass’s approach was “tactical” — not a wholesale endorsement of the original intent of the compromise.
Additionally, the abolitionist never denied the the Three-Fifths Compromise was initially passed to benefit Southern slave-holding states. Instead, Douglass strategically reinterpreted the clause to advance abolitionist goals.
“Frederick Douglass was the most woke person you can imagine in the 1850s,” Lichtenstein said. “These folks who heroicize Frederick Douglass either are being disingenuous or don’t know what they’re talking about.”
The professor made clear, as well, that there is “no disagreement” among historians and academics about the original intent of the Three-Fifths Compromise.
There were other pro-slavery provisions, too, like the Slave Trade Clause, which prohibited Congress from ending the slave trade until 1808.
“That meant there were 20 more years to bring in as many slaves from Africa as you like, which amounted to over one-third of the total slave imports to the colony (and later the United States) over the entire period of the slave trade,” Lichtenstein said.
Separately, the Fugitive Slave Clause required the return of escaped enslaved people to their owners.
“These were deal breakers for the South. They weren’t deal breakers for the North,” Lichtenstein noted.
Historians suggest that without these compromises, slavery might have been constitutionally abolished as early as the 1820s. The concessions were so effective at strengthening slavery that they ultimately emboldened the South to secede and go to war in 1861.
That framing of past events is “universally understood” among historians, Lichtenstein said, although there continues to be “vigorous discussion” about whether the Constitution could ultimately be considered an anti-slavery document, and about how abolitionists like Frederick Douglass strategically reinterpreted constitutional clauses.

Historians like Sean Wilentz contend that the Three-Fifths Compromise, while morally flawed, was a necessary limitation on slaveholder power and helped leave open a path toward slavery’s eventual abolition.
Other historians, including, Nicholas Guyatt, argue instead that the compromise strengthened slavery’s hold on national politics from the start and was not a tactical anti-slavery measure, but a structural embedding of racial injustice into the Constitution.
“What I find so ironic or peculiar about this is that the the extreme right-wing is always insistent on original intent of the Constitution. … But here, all of a sudden, when it comes to the three-fifths clause, they don’t seem to care about the original intent. For this, it’s the living document and how it was put to use later on,” Lichtenstein said. “You can’t have it both ways. If you believe in original intent, then you have to believe that the Three-Fifths Compromise was a concession to slavery in the Southern states.”
“We don’t glorify the founders because they had the magical crystal ball to realize that the Three-Fifths Compromise was going to be anti-slavery. No, they made a flawed compromise with the institution of slavery,” he added. “But we are fortunate enough that people came later on to recognize that that tool could be used for justice instead of injustice.”

(Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)A proposal to more than double the tax placed on sports gambling in Louisiana – and dedicate some of that revenue to Division I athletics programs – is moving forward in the state legislature.
The House Appropriations Committee voted Monday to advance House Bill 639 by Rep. Neil Riser, R-Columbia, to increase the tax on sports gambling from 15% to 32.5%. The higher rate aligns with the tax the state places on video poker. 
The proposed increase in sports gambling taxes has support from conservative and progressive corners, both saying the revenue should be used to offset the “social ills” of gambling. The new rate would generate another $2 million for addiction programs.
But Riser’s bill goes further, altering the tax revenue split and putting 25% into a Supporting Programs, Opportunities, Resources and Teams (SPORT) fund that would benefit student-athletes at Louisiana’s public universities that compete at the NCAA Division I level. They include UL Lafayette, UL Monroe, Louisiana Tech, LSU, Grambling, McNeese, Nicholls, Northwestern, Southeastern, Southern and the University of New Orleans. 
The committee also tied Riser’s legislation to House Bill 594 by Rep. Chance Henry, R-Crowley, which creates a flat tax on insurance premiums. Riser’s bill can only take effect if Henry’s does. 
Rep. Jerome “Zee” Zeringue, R-Houma, was the only lawmaker on the committee to vote against Riser’s bill, saying he was concerned about the potential budget impact of Henry’s bill. Precise details of the bundled bills’ fiscal impact will be made clear in the next version of the fiscal note, which should be made publicly available before Riser’s bill is debated on the House floor.

Sports gambling companies opposed Riser’s bill, arguing that Louisiana’s 15% tax rate is already higher than the 14% national average. Lawmakers were skeptical of this concern, noting the companies are based out of state and have no physical infrastructure or employees in Louisiana, unlike the casinos here that pay the much higher tax rate of 32.5%.
Riser’s bill has wide support from college athletics department leaders, who packed the committee room at the State Capitol. 
“The need is so high,” Riser said in an interview with the Louisiana Illuminator and Tiger Rag. “When you start talking about the SEC, talking about any level of athletics right now, it’s changed so dramatically.” 
“Even like ULM … just to be competitive [in recruiting], it takes facilities, when you’re dealing with [athletes] they require you to have all those things,” Riser said. 
Riser’s bill was amended to equally split revenue in the SPORT fund among eligible institutions. 
The fund is expected to receive more than $31 million in dedicated funding annually, according to a fiscal note for the bill. Each school would receive approximately $2.8 million annually. 
That’s a small drop in the bucket for LSU, which has an athletics budget of over $200 million. But it would be a significant lifeline for schools such as Southern, Nicholls and ULM, which each spend less than $20 million a year on their sports program. 
Presently, the state’s split for sports gambling tax revenue calls for 25% to go toward early childhood education, 10% to local governments, 3% to gambling addiction programs, and the rest to other priorities and the state general fund. 
Under Riser’s bill, childhood education, local governments and addiction recovery would retain their existing share of tax proceeds. In addition to the 25% that would now go to college athletics, another 3% would be dedicated to the Louisiana Postsecondary Inclusive Education Fund to finance programs for students with disabilities. The rest goes into the state general fund for a variety of government needs.

(File photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The state’s prisons director was officially sworn in as acting U.S. attorney Monday.
With Bryan Stirling tapped as the state’s lead federal prosecutor, his deputy director of operations, Joel Anderson, will take over leadership of the state’s 21 prisons, according to a news release from the governor’s office.
Stirling started working as head of the Department of Corrections in 2013. That job, which involved overseeing more than 3,700 employees and a prison system with more than 16,000 inmates, was “the privilege of a lifetime,” Stirling said in a statement.
SC prisons director to become interim U.S. attorney

“I look forward to continuing to serve the people of South Carolina and pledge to uphold the high standards set by those who came before me,” Stirling said.
Stirling’s appointment by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi means a formal nomination from President Donald Trump is likely. Stirling will then need confirmation by the U.S. Senate to officially become the state’s top federal prosecutor. Bondi’s appointment means Stirling will oversee 120 prosecutors and about 20 support staff on an interim basis as he awaits confirmation.
Trump’s administration removed Adair Ford Boroughs, the state’s U.S. attorney since 2022, in February. Boroughs’ assistant attorney Brooks Andrews has filled the role since.
As corrections director, Stirling cracked down on contraband coming into prisons, including a push to change federal law that would legalize signal blocking technology to make inmates’ illegal cellphones useless. He implemented personal development programs for inmates that led to the state having one of the lowest rates in the country of inmates re-offending and returning to prison. And he successfully pushed for higher employee salaries in an effort to recruit and retain correctional officers.
Stirling also guided the department through a 2018 prison riot that left seven inmates dead and the restarting of executions after 13 years, including the first conducted by firing squad in state history.
“Director Bryan Stirling is widely recognized as the best corrections director in the country, and his relentless spirit has turned SCDC into a model for other states to follow,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a news release.

Before becoming director of the state’s prison system, Stirling was then-Gov. Nikki Haley’s chief of staff. Prior to that, he was deputy attorney general during McMaster’s two terms as the state’s head prosecutor.
Stirling’s name was among those floated for the position during Trump’s first term, though Trump eventually nominated Columbia attorney Sherri Lydon instead. Two years later, after Lydon’s departure, Peter McCoy led the agency for eight months before stepping down after former President Joe Biden took office.
Anderson, who will act as interim head of the prison system, has overseen security, maintenance and food service for the corrections department since 2019.
Originally from Texas, the 66-year-old started working in prisons in 1978 as a correctional officer for the state of Texas. He rose through the ranks, becoming a major by the time he left in 1996, according to his agency bio.
Anderson came to South Carolina that year to lead the state’s inmate work programs and prison food service. After a brief stint working for Florida’s prison system, Anderson returned to the South Carolina Department of Corrections in 2004, where he worked as a prison warden and in several other leadership roles.
“It is my honor to leave the South Carolina Department of Corrections in the very capable hands of Joel Anderson,” Stirling said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_6871-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) State officials are curious about how Rhode Islanders are using artificial intelligence (AI).
The Rhode Island Artificial Intelligence Task Force and Gov. Dan McKee launched a new survey Friday asking Rhode Islanders how they feel about AI and how they’re using it. The survey is open through May 9 and takes about 10 minutes to complete, but can take longer depending on the length of one’s responses to write-in questions.
“We’re positioning Rhode Island as a national leader in AI, cybersecurity, and other emerging technologies,” McKee said in a statement. “Our goal is to harness the benefits of AI for our local economy while mitigating potential risks through thoughtful policy and planning. It’s important to hear from Rhode Islanders as we continue to shape the future of AI in RI.”
McKee assembled the AI Task Force in February 2024 to investigate how the Ocean State can responsibly use and build policy around the rapidly expanding and increasingly popular set of technologies colloquially referred to as AI. The rise of generative AI since 2022 has especially shaped widespread consumer and industry use of programs that can create text and images, analyze data, or perform an assortment of mundane tasks. The group includes representatives from multiple sectors including state government, tech, health care, education, business and other sectors.  
The committee is chaired by former U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, who also chairs the Institute of Cybersecurity and Emerging Technologies at Rhode Island College, another McKee-led project. Chris Parisi, the founder and CEO of Trailblaze Marketing in Providence, serves as the task force’s vice chair.
“The AI Task Force is hard at work to identify the most effective ways Rhode Island can harness the power of this emerging technology while minimizing the risks it brings,” Langevin said in a statement. “As we create our roadmap, we’re asking the public to offer their insights on if and how they’d like to see artificial intelligence implemented across the state, as well as to share any concerns about the future of this technology.”
The survey has five sections, from queries about respondents’ basic familiarity with AI to how people use AI in their job. Questions about on-the-job usage are tailored to the industry selected from a list, which includes government, finance, education, health care, manufacturing/trade/defense, and small businesses/nonprofits/start-ups.
Questions across the survey include “How has AI changed your job in the past 2 years?,” “What do you believe are the biggest opportunities AI brings to Rhode Island?” and “Do you believe AI should be regulated?”
A final section, “AI and the Future of Rhode Island,” invites respondents to muse on whether Rhode Island should or should not “position itself as a leader in AI.”
Respondents can include their email address to receive future updates and information about events, including those with potentially more opportunities for public feedback, from the AI task force.

Marti, R-Broken Arrow, whispers with Rep. Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, during a special legislative hearing probing the finances of the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services on Monday. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The state’s mental health department should go back to budgeting basics and build out guidelines for the services it must provide, the head of a legislative fiscal oversight agency said Monday.
Regina Birchum, executive director of the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency, said the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services is treating its appropriations as “fungible,” or interchangeable, making it difficult for officials to make sense of how it is being spent.
Of the 195 accounts the Department of Mental Health budgeted for in fiscal year 2024, a LOFT analysis found that 115 were over budget, while 66 were under budget. In all, over $29.3 million was overbudgeted, while about $57.6 million was underbudgeted.
“I would say this is an agency that has a long-standing issue with proper accounting of funds,” Birchum said. “We’re not saying anything improper was done. We’re saying that funds are not properly accounted for in such a way that an outsider can determine what they were spent on, and it’s our hope that we can make some recommendations that will bring some clarity to them.”
Birchum made her comments under oath during the third day of testimony during a special hearing at the state Capitol where House lawmakers continue to probe reports of financial disarray at the mental health agency as well as why some provider contracts were abruptly cut or canceled. Lawmakers were frustrated at a lack of answers from mental health officials during the first two days of testimony. But at the conclusion of Monday’s hearing, some said LOFT helped shed some light on spending and budgeting practices.
Birchum said her agency has been investigating the mental health department at the Legislature’s request since early March. In particular, it has been probing the mental health department’s reported $43 million deficit and whether the agency’s $6.2 million supplement request will be enough to finish the fiscal year.
LOFT assists the Legislature in finding factual information about budgets to hold agencies accountable for properly spending funds. 
Birchum said the mental health officials initially believed they had a $63.7 million shortfall, but later found $19.6 million that could be used for Medicaid reimbursements and another $10.5 million in contract savings. That reduced the overall deficit to $33.6 million.
LOFT records indicate investigators were unsure where the remaining $27.4 million would come to reach the $6.2 million figure, but noted the mental health department continued to work on its budget review.
She said the agency’s $6.2 million supplemental request includes funding to bridge revenue shortfalls for two different facilities and $4.1 million to cover costs related to the recent mental health competency restoration settlement agreement. The later funding was already appropriated by lawmakers, she said.
Birchum said LOFT was also told that all initial cuts to providers have been restored.
Rep. T.J. Marti, R-Broken Arrow,  said after the hearing that lawmakers expect to have some firm budget numbers this week from the mental health department, but said putting caps on what providers can charge for some crisis services could help provide more budget certainty.
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, who chairs the special committee, said LOFT provided needed detail about the mental health department’s “poor accounting practices” that “lends to the inability to produce real numbers.”
Lawmakers only have 22 working days left in session. Lawson said the committee needs to quickly determine the current financial picture of the mental health department, if a $6.2 million supplement appropriation will be enough, and what sort of budget the agency needs moving forward.
“I feel much more confident that we could work together to put something together that we feel like has some fidelity to it, but it’s certainly concerning that we’re this far into session, and we don’t have the clarity that we need to do our job,” he said.
Lawson said there likely will be some legislation that emerges from the hearings. Some additional testimony may be conducted behind closed doors because it “may be of a protected nature” under non-disclosure agreements, he said.
If time allows, the committee may require the state’s mental health commissioner to testify again.

Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.
GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

For many years, Eric Wunderlin’s health issues made it hard to find stable employment.
Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-time, minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.”

He said he sometimes found it difficult to afford food for himself and his cat, Annabelle.

Using health programs to encourage work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women and disabled people.

Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.
The hunt for results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A day after telling lawmakers it wouldn’t hire a chief financial officer until it “gets through” its budget situation, a state agency said it is moving forward with filling the position permanently.
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ job posting Friday came a day after House lawmakers questioned the qualifications of Skip Leonard, the agency’s interim CFO. During an extensive grilling, he was unable to answer basic questions about the agency’s financial irregularities.
Leonard, a former city manager, said he has no experience overseeing finances for a state agency and is not a certified public accountant. Lawmakers said he was being paid $165 an hour to serve as interim or as much as $343,000 a year.
Leonard told lawmakers that the mental health department was waiting to hire a permanent CFO until it “gets through” its current budget situation. 
Lawmakers are trying to determine why the agency has a $43 million shortfall and why mental health officials believe a $6.2 million supplemental appropriation would be enough to fill the gap.
Leonard, who oversees the agency’s over $610 million budget, was unable to answer many of the questions, leading some lawmakers to focus instead on his own qualifications and pay rate. 
The agency said in a statement to Oklahoma Voice on Monday that it posted the position on Friday “as part of our ongoing operational readiness and succession planning.”
The agency did not provide a responsive statement as to what changed between Leonard’s testimony Thursday and Friday when the job was posted.
“The agency wants to ensure it is positioned for success in the future,” the agency’s statement said. “We remain committed to making staffing decisions only when they are fully aligned with both fiscal priorities and operational needs.”
Rep. T.J. Marti, R-Broken Arrow, who was among the legislators who questioned Leonard’s qualifications, said Monday that hadn’t heard that the agency had launched a search for a new CFO, but said it’s “great news.”
“I think they need to launch a search for a CFO, somebody that can dig deep into the numbers and that is trained for the position,” Marti said. “It sounded like they were going to name Skip the CFO, and I’m not so sure that that’s something that many of us in here would be on board with.”

Assistant coach Justin Parker will serve as interim head coach for the remainder of the season.
Mississippi State made the announcement in a press release Monday afternoon. 
“A change in leadership is what is best for the future of Mississippi State baseball,” State athletic director Zac Selmon said. “We have not consistently met the standard of success that our university, fans and student-athletes expect and deserve. I want to thank Coach Lemonis for his work and the time he gave to our program, including a national championship in 2021. We appreciate his efforts and wish him and his family all the best moving forward.”
A national search is underway to identify the program’s next head coach, Selmon said.
“In a team meeting moments ago, I expressed to our student-athletes the confidence we have in their abilities and the potential they have for the remainder of the season,” Selmon said. “I encouraged them to compete with pride, resilience, and intensity. With the hard work, preparation, and talent already within this group, we are committed to putting them in the best position to finish the season competing at the highest level.
“Mississippi State is the premier job in college baseball. The tradition, the facilities, the NIL offerings and the fan base are all second to none. Dudy Noble Field is the best environment in the sport, period.”
The current Bulldogs have a 25-19 record and are 7-14 in the SEC. Most recently, the Bulldogs lost two of three weekend games to Auburn, the nation’s 11th-ranked team. State has lost its last two SEC series and five of seven this season. The Bulldogs are currently No. 45 in the nation in ratings percentage index (RPI) and are in danger of not making the NCAA Tournament for the third time in four years.
Lemonis’ MSU teams won 232 games and lost 135 in his six-plus seasons. Hired by former MSU baseball coach and athletic director John Cohen from Indiana, Lemonis has an overall coaching record of 373-226-2.
“This program is built for success,” Selmon said. “Our history proves it, and our future demands it. We are one of only four programs in NCAA history to reach the College World Series in six consecutive decades. With 40 NCAA Tournament appearances, 12 trips to Omaha, 11 SEC regular season titles, and a national championship, our program has always been a national contender. That is the bar. We’re going to find a leader who will embrace that, elevate our program and compete for championships.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06184656/AP_21182116611315-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

The landfill is expected to reach capacity in 2028. (Photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)As the state’s largest landfill nears capacity amid concerns about the environmental impact of possible expansion, two legislators that represent its neighboring communities are seeking greater legislative oversight for the state-owned Juniper Ridge Landfill.
The Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee held a public hearing Monday for a series of bills related to waste management, including two that seek to address and increase oversight of future use of the landfill, which straddles Old Town and Alton. The facility is owned by the state through the Bureau of General Services, which has an operating contract with NEWSME Landfill Operations, a subsidiary of the waste management company Casella. 
When Rep. Jim Dill (D-Old Town) knocked on doors before last November’s election, one of the biggest complaints he heard from residents was the poor quality of the garbage bags they must purchase to dispose of their trash. That’s why LD 1782 would require the operator of a state-owned landfill to provide free disposal of household waste for the local residents. 
However, Dill explained that his bill also seeks to address what he described as the “crisis” of the landfill soon reaching capacity by imposing new fees on the operator and requiring state agencies to develop a solid waste management plan that addresses the issues associated with Juniper Ridge. 
The committee also heard bills seeking to increase recycling of construction materials, reduce the volume of solid waste and better manage waste from wastewater treatment plants. 
The Departments of Environmental Protection and Administrative and Financial Services opposed Dill’s proposal. Since the DEP is already required to submit a waste generation and disposal capacity report in January, the department argued the additional reporting requirements in the bill would be burdensome. 
Just over half of Maine’s landfill waste ends up in Juniper Ridge, which is expected to reach capacity in 2028. The state has signaled its support for expanding the facility despite objections from environmental advocates, the local community and the Penobscot Nation, whose reservation sits just five miles from the landfill.
The Bureau of General Services has not submitted an application to expand the landfill, but Deputy Commissioner Anya Trundy said during the hearing it intends to. However, the site expansion is separate from an extension of the current 30-year operator agreement that expires in 2034. 
Trundy said that building out the landfill to its maximum capacity should allow it to operate until 2040. That is why the expanded capacity would also necessitate extending the contract with Casella so that both line up with the 2040 timeline. 
The committee also heard a bill from Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot) that, if passed, would shape the process of extending that contract. While the executive branch has so far handled the negotiations, LD 1349 would require approval from two-thirds of the Legislature for contract or contract renewal to operate Juniper Ridge. 
Maine opens door for landfill expansion despite community objections

Though the Department of Administrative and Financial Services would normally advocate for contracts to go out to bid, Trundy said doing so could sever the indemnification clause in the existing contract. Rather than giving Casella a “sweetheart deal,” Trundy said continuing the agreement holds them accountable to that clause that would leave them responsible for financial and environmental liability down the road. 
Committee members also voiced concern that requiring two-thirds support from the Legislature would be insurmountable; however, environmental organizations who testified in support of the bill were open to changing that to a simple majority because they have concerns over Casella’s operation of the landfill and welcomed more opportunity for public input. 
Maulian Bryant, executive director for the Wabanaki Alliance, spoke in support of LD 1349 over similar dissatisfaction with the landfill’s management. She said changes to air and water quality that can be affected by the landfill isn’t communicated to neighbors who can often smell the facility from their front yards. 
However, the Maine State Chamber of Commerce opposed the bill, saying that it could politicize the contract process and deter companies from doing business with the state.  
Tipping put forward another proposal that was heard Monday seeking to address forever chemicals from landfill leachate entering groundwater and surface waters. 
The legislation would require entities discharging wastewater to annually report to the DEP the origin, volume and final disposition of solid waste leachate, sometimes referred to as “trash juice.” It would also prohibit discharging any wastewater containing leachate from a solid waste landfill unless the discharge satisfies department limits to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, and require third-party testing of leachate for PFAS.
Last session, the Legislature passed a bill that would have required Casella to treat PFAS in a way that ensures levels don’t exceed established drinking water standards, but the measure was vetoed by Gov. Janet Mills. The DEP later mandated that Casella install a department-approved system for treating landfill leachate for PFAS before expanding operations.

One person died at a Casper home Monday after police received a report of an armed burglar. Court files reviewed by WyoFile show she was listed as a legal resident of the house.
The post Woman killed when Casper police responded to burglary report lived at the home, court documents show appeared first on WyoFile .","A woman killed Monday morning during an encounter with police responding to a burglary report at a Casper residence is listed in court documents as living in the home.
Police have declined to say if the person killed was a criminal suspect or the resident of the house, but court records examined by WyoFile indicate the woman, 37-year-old Jody Cobia, legally resided at the home.
Casper police officers responded to the 1600 block of South McKinley Street, a residential neighborhood in the central part of the city, around 12:36 a.m. Monday. They were responding to a report of an armed burglar in the residence, according to a police statement. 
The officers “made contact with a subject armed with a firearm,” shots were fired and the woman was then taken to the hospital, where doctors declared her dead, the statement said. 
The statement is not explicit about whether officers shot Cobia. “During the encounter, shots were fired,” it reads.

A department official declined to provide WyoFile with additional information Monday morning, including whether the person who was shot lived at the home, citing the early stages of the investigation. 
Early Monday afternoon, the Natrona County Coroners’ Office identified the dead woman as Cobia. Court records reviewed by WyoFile indicate she had sole legal possession of the home as part of a protection order granted in August, though tax records put the home in her husband’s name.
According to the filings, Cobia was the mother of three children and was in the early stages of a divorce from her husband. Court records indicate Cobia petitioned a judge for, and received, a protection order from her husband in August. 
That protection order, reviewed by WyoFile, granted Cobia sole possession of the house, 1623 S. McKinley Street, until August of this year. Multiple court documents list the McKinley Street address as her residence.
Mid-morning Monday, a WyoFile journalist observed that the door of 1623 S. McKinley street remained slightly open, though there was no other evidence of an active crime scene investigation nearly 12 hours after the shooting. 
On Monday, Casper Police Capt. Jeremy Tremel declined to say whether the person shot was the home resident or a burglary suspect, or whether there was a burglary suspect on the scene. “All I can tell you right now is we responded to a report of a suspected burglary,” he said.
He did not immediately respond to a second request for comment after the coroner published its identification. 
Cobia’s husband, Aren Cobia, indicated he was a resident of the home in a divorce petition filed earlier this month. But the court record also indicates Jody Cobia was served with the divorce petition, in person, at the South McKinley Street address on April 15. 
Reached briefly by WyoFile, Aren Cobia asked for time to grieve Jody Cobia’s death and declined to otherwise comment. Aren Cobia told a reporter from another news outlet, Cowboy State Daily, that there was no burglar in the home and police had killed his wife. 
The Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation will investigate the shooting. After police shootings, it’s typical for DCI to conduct an investigation and then provide the findings of that review to an elected county attorney. The prosecutor then decides whether or not to charge officers with any crimes. Prosecutors, in some cases, refer that decision to an outside county attorney to bring an additional level of independence to the investigation.
The officers involved in the shooting are now on administrative leave, according to the department’s news release. 
Officials did not describe the person shot as a suspect in that news release, only as a “subject armed with a firearm.” Because of the ambiguity of the official statement, commenters on social media, as well as two Wyoming news outlets, described the deceased as a criminal suspect.
“Suspected burglar dead in Casper Police shooting,” was the headline on an initial Cowboy State Daily story that was online throughout the morning Monday. By the early afternoon, the news site had updated that headline to “One dead in officer-involved shooting during Casper burglary response,” and the site had issued a correction. 
“Suspect dead after Casper police respond to armed burglary,” Casper-news site Oil City News reported. 
On Facebook, a large number of commenters commended the officers who responded to the home and in several instances suggested a burglary suspect deserved to be killed. “Finally a story with a happy ending,” one commenter wrote. “Clearly he valued their stuff more than his life and got what he deserved,” wrote another.

  Sen. Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin Examiner, 2024 photo)
The letter, led by Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin and two colleagues,  follows a funding halt in late January and early February; the closure of Head Start regional offices in April and the termination of those offices’ employees; and a subsequent report that the program has reduced payments in this first half of 2025 compared with a year ago.
“It is abundantly clear that these actions are part of a broader effort to ultimately eliminate the program altogether, as the Administration reportedly plans to do in its fiscal year 2026 budget proposal,” states the letter sent by Baldwin, Sens. Patty Murray (D-Washington) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), and 39 other Senate members.
Head Start has already been appropriated $12.3 billion for 2025 — the same amount as in 2024 — and has a formula for allocating funds, the senators wrote, leaving “no justifiable reason” for funding delays, while there has been no explanation from the administration.
Earlier in April it was reported the Trump administration’s 2026 budget proposal included no funding for Head Start. The senators’ letter notes that the Office of Management and Budget directed the Department of Health and Human Services to set aside funds from the 2025 budget “to close out the program” in budget documents leaked 10 days ago.
“If this explains any of the delay in awarding fiscal year 2025 funding, we want to be clear, no funds were provided in fiscal year 2025 to ‘close out the program,’ and it would be wholly unacceptable and likely illegal if the Department tries to carry out this directive,” the senators wrote.
The letter is directed at U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“You promised ‘radical transparency’ as Secretary, yet it is unclear how these actions will improve Head Start programs, and you and your staff refuse to respond to basic inquiries and requests for information,” the senators wrote.
The letter cites additional Trump administration actions involving the program over the last three months.
The federal Office of Head Start has told local programs that funding would not be approved for “training and technical assistance or other program expenditures that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives,” but the agency hasn’t provided any guidance “for what would be considered ‘DEI,’” the letter states.
Nevertheless, the senators add, that could conflict with requirements for the program under federal law, such as one that programs provide appropriate instruction for English learners.
Programs submitting documentation for payment of expenses that they have incurred and are authorized under their federal grants are now being asked to provide additional justification, which the letter states “creates an illusion of improving oversight but only serves to add unnecessary red tape. “
The five-page letter asks Kennedy to answer a series of questions, including whether HHS will reverse the regional office closures and reinstate fired Head Start personnel, when Head Start agencies will receive confirmation that they can access their additional grant installments for the year and whether the administration will distribute all of Head Start’s funds for the 2025 fiscal year “as required by the Head Start Act.”

The bill was debated over multiple conference committee meetings in recent days. The Senate version contained a Jan. 1, 2023 start date for the term limits, while the House version advanced a Nov. 7, 2022 start date.
North Dakota voters in 2022 approved a ballot measure that limits lawmakers to serving up to eight years in each chamber.
Previously, Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, chief sponsor of House Bill 1300, said the bill was to provide clarity on the start date for term limits approved by the voters. 
Term limits bill reconsidered, headed to North Dakota conference committee

Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, said the House reconsidered its actions after previously voting against the bill and sent the measure to a conference committee to see if senators would agree to the House’s start date.
“It didn’t look like we kept our position, so I’d ask for a red vote,” Vetter said before voting against the bill. 
The failure of the bill in the House leaves Senate Resolution 4008, which passed both chambers of the Legislature, as the only term limit resolution passed by lawmakers during the 2025 session. If approved by the Secretary of State’s Office as a valid resolution it would go to the voters as a ballot measure during the 2026 general election.
The resolution would allow lawmakers to serve four terms, up to 16 years, in a single legislative chamber. It also clarifies that a partial term does not count against the limit.

In a statement from Thanedar’s office, he pointed to “sweeping abuse of power, flagrant violations of the Constitution and acts of tyranny that undermine American democracy and threaten the rule of law” as his reasons for introducing the charges.
“[Trump’s] unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service. We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act,” Thanedar said.
Each article alleges a separate violation of the Constitution, with Thanedar’s office offering the following breakdown of his resolution:

 Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power: Including denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, and misuse of the Department of Justice.
Usurpation of Appropriations Power: For dismantling congressionally established agencies and impounding federal funds.
Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression: Including imposing economically damaging tariffs and threatening military invasion against sovereign nations.
Violation of First Amendment Rights: Through retaliatory actions against critics, media and attorneys exercising constitutionally protected speech.
Creation of an Unlawful Office: By establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and unlawfully empowering Elon Musk to unilaterally violate the Constitution.
Bribery and Corruption: Involving dismissing criminal cases, soliciting foreign emoluments, and extortionate settlements for personal and political gain.
Tyrannical Overreach: Seeking to consolidate unchecked power, erode civil liberties, and defy constitutional limits on presidential authority.

“This is not about partisanship. It’s about protecting our democracy and ensuring that no one, not even a President, is above the law,” Thanedar said in a statement.
Thanedar’s effort is likely to face an uphill battle in the House, where Republicans hold a seven seat majority. The Senate, which conducts the trial should the resolution receive a majority of votes in the House, is also held by Republicans, with a two-thirds vote needed in order to convict the president.
Thanedar’s introduction of the articles comes the same day that his second primary opponent, state Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit), announced he would seek his 13th District seat in the 2026 primary.

McHENRY — John Gerend, a Vietnam War veteran from Lake Villa, Illinois, was exposed to Agent Orange while on duty. Suffering from diseases associated with exposure to the toxic chemical, he said he still considers himself fortunate.

“I've had some issues with it — diabetes, some heart issues and so on — but there are many more that have suffered a lot more than I have and need the care a lot more than I do,” said Gerend, 77. “It's very upsetting to think that the people who have served their country and have lost limbs or mental health might now lose the benefits, all the support, both for mental health and physical health, and the doctors and medications available.”

“I am mad about what’s going on. I’m angry,” he added.

A retired U.S. Army first lieutenant, Gerend was among the 200 people who gathered outside the McHenry Veterans Affairs clinic Sunday to protest the Trump administration’s plans to slash the agency’s workforce, sparking fears among veterans over the prospect of worsening care and growing unemployment.

Across Illinois, protests have been gaining strength since the proposed cuts were revealed. They range from veterans protesting last month at the Capitol in Springfield to demonstrations by nurses and staff at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago, who are concerned about the dangers to proper care and risk for veterans.

In an internal memo to senior agency leaders on March 4, VA chief of staff Christopher Syrek said the agency's initial goal was “to return to our 2019-end strength numbers of 399,957 employees.” VA Secretary Doug Collins later confirmed the department’s target is to fire roughly 80,000 employees later this year, but he insisted the agency would strive for more efficiency while not cutting benefits and care to the 9 million veterans it serves. According to the Pew Research Center, a quarter of the workers at the Department of Veterans Affairs are themselves veterans.

The move comes after the VA expanded during the Biden administration, fueled by the passing of legislation like the 2022 Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics, PACT, Act, expanding medical benefits for veterans who were exposed to toxins from burn pits of trash on military bases.

“I'm getting later in my years, so it's gonna affect some younger folks possibly more than me, so I'm more afraid for them than I am for myself,” said Gerend, who has used VA services for 12 years.

VA workers in distress

The VA attempted to lay off at least 2,400 probationary employees in February. According to the department,  those in “mission-critical” positions — including Veterans Crisis Line responders — were not affected. Yet, several crisis line staffers received a notice, according to union leaders.

Some of the department’s Illinois workers were axed, too, and U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth said the ensuing “chaos” had left the VA less efficient with longer wait times and more backlogs in service.

“I was almost finished with my two-year-long probationary period when I received an email saying I was terminated because of my performance effective that day, (Feb. 24),” said one Illinois-based VA employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “I had outstanding performance reviews, but the fact that they labeled it as a performance-based solution meant that I couldn't get unemployment (benefits).”

The employee was rehired in March after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the fired probationary employees at several departments, including the VA.

In April, however, the Supreme Court halted the federal judge's ruling, allowing the federal government to keep thousands of probationary federal employees it attempted to fire off the payroll while lower courts weigh whether the downsizing efforts are legal.

“Everybody is nervous and on edge,” the employee said. “Their jobs are not secure. Nobody's jobs are secure.”

With the threat of more cuts looming, some Illinois facilities have already started laying people off, causing health care workers more distress.

Heather Fallon, a VA nurse in the Chicago area, said one of her colleagues returned to the facility as a patient after learning that their job “was being eliminated.”

“The person had a conversation with family over dinner about how they are going to pay for their daughter’s college,” she recalled. “The patient ended up developing some pain related to the stress, coming to the emergency department and being admitted because of the health problems that were precipitated by the stress that that person was under.”

“That really affected our staff quite a lot,” Fallon added.

Some fear that the upcoming mass layoffs, especially in smaller towns across rural Illinois, are going to negatively impact populations at large.

“Danville is a small town. It consists of about 29,000 people, and if we lose 400 good-paying government jobs, that will devastate our economy here,” said Mickensy Ellis-White, a veteran of the Iraq War from Vermilion County and chair of the Vermilion County Democratic Party. “Where are those people going to go to get new jobs? That's going to negatively affect all of us.”

The level of care diminishes 

Even before the cuts were announced by the Trump administration, it had been difficult for health facilities within the VA system to maintain enough staff and resources, like beds, available. According to the 2024 VA Office of Inspector General report, 86% of all Veteran Health Administration medical facilities reported severe staffing shortages of medical officers, whereas 82% reported severe shortages of nurses.

The mass slashes to the department’s workforce will only worsen the preexisting lack of personnel, according to Fallon, who said she knows of several nurses who have already submitted job applications to other places in the private sector as the threat of the layoffs looms. “A friend of mine at the St. Louis VA had her care appointment canceled because they didn't have a provider, and that's a direct result of the cuts,” said Jessica Motsinger, a disabled U.S. Navy veteran living 12 miles east of St Louis in the Metro East. “It really is devastating, and if it hasn't really affected somebody, it will very shortly.”

This is not an isolated incident.

“We had a patient yesterday who needed services that we didn't have open beds at our facility. The solution was that they were going to send him to a different facility, more than an hour away, and he was very upset about that,” Fallon said. “He wasn't able to go home to get his belongings, and he didn't feel like his belongings were safe where they were, and his family wouldn't be able to visit him there, so he would be very isolated.”

According to the official data, 247,140 Illinoisians were enrolled in the VA health care system in fiscal year 2023, and the state’s veteran medical facilities provided services to 162,366 unique patients. Although the impacts of the layoffs are likely to extend throughout the state, the cuts would hit northeastern Illinois the hardest, the counties with the highest percentage of veteran population.

Many veterans are fearful of what is to come — but also angry.

“They think that, since we use the word ‘disabled,’ somehow we're receiving benefits that we're not entitled to,” Motsinger said. “But people don't get this just because we somehow scammed somebody or paid something, we've totally earned this. We raised our hand; we offered to sacrifice our lives.”

“I'm sorry America decided to have war for over 20 years. Now you have veterans, an entire generation that you owe us to care for us, not asking for anything other than what we've earned,” she said.

in Miami. (Photo courtesy of Alvaro Perpuly with U.S. Rep. Wilson's office)U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement added a semi-permanent structure to house migrants at a detention center in Miami following reports of overcrowding.
An ICE spokesperson acknowledged the structure on Monday, after South Florida U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Democrat, said she saw a “tent city” at the Krome North Service Processing Center during her visit Thursday. Wilson decided to visit the detention facility after hearing that people had to sleep on concrete floors.
“The new multi-use facility is a climate-controlled structure with beds, showers and bathrooms to house detainees,” ICE public affairs officer Nestor Yglesias wrote to the Florida Phoenix. “The facility complies with detention standards in accordance with ICE policy. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not provide population or capacity numbers due to operational tempo and security concerns.”
Yglesias described the structure as hard-sided but didn’t provide information about the number of beds or whether ICE had added other semi-permanent buildings in other detention centers in the state.

After her visit to Krome, Wilson told reporters that she had seen a “tent city” that she estimated could house 400 people and that officials told her had been built in 14 days. The ICE spokesperson declined to confirm how long it took to build the structure. Wilson also said she hadn’t seen overcrowding that immigrant rights groups, detainees, and attorneys have reported.
“This is not my first rodeo. I was down at Homestead when the children were there, and I’ve been to Krome before, and I’ve been to prisons all across Florida, especially female prisons,” Wilson said. “So, I know what they do. They take them on a field trip, so you won’t see who is actually in there, but they did admit that they are building a tent city.”
Juan Agudelo, field office director for ICE in Miami, said some detention centers experienced temporary overcrowding but that conditions Wilson saw in Krome were not staged.
“What Congresswoman Wilson saw today is what ICE does on a daily basis,” Agudelo said in a statement. “Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.”
A four-day large-scale operation in which federal authorities and local police claimed they had arrested nearly 800 people subject to deportation could lead to increased population numbers at Krome.

Trump has invoked the centuries-old law for just the fourth time in U.S. history in an attempt to expedite the removals of hundreds of people […],"A view of the Alfred A. Arraj U.S. Courthouse in downtown Denver on May 30, 2023. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)President Donald Trump’s administration is asking a panel of appellate judges to overturn a lower court’s order temporarily blocking the deportation of detainees in Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act.
Trump has invoked the centuries-old law for just the fourth time in U.S. history in an attempt to expedite the removals of hundreds of people the administration claims are part of an “invasion” of the United States by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. It was used last month to send 137 detainees to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador before multiple federal courts, including one in Colorado, ordered a halt to such removals over due process concerns.
U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney’s temporary restraining order against Alien Enemies Act removals from Colorado is set to remain in effect until at least May 6, but Trump’s Department of Justice promptly appealed Sweeney’s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.

The government has asked the three-judge panel hearing the appeal — Judges Harris L. Hartz, Gregory Alan Phillips and Joel M. Carson — to rule on its motion to overturn Sweeney’s TRO by no later than Tuesday afternoon, arguing that the order’s “impositions interfere with the President’s core authority to protect the nation.”
The case, D.B.U. v. Trump, originated earlier this month as a petition for habeas corpus and proposed class action by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of two Venezuelan nationals held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora. The plaintiffs, who are identified by their initials, D.B.U. and R.M.M., say they have been falsely identified as Tren de Aragua members by the Trump administration and fear imminent deportation to the CECOT facility, criticized by human rights groups for its crowded and abusive conditions.
Sweeney’s order also provisionally certified the class that the two plaintiffs seek to represent, blocking the removal of “all noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to” Trump’s March 14 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act. ACLU attorneys estimate that could apply to more than 100 detainees held at the Aurora detention center.
About 90% of the deportees sent to CECOT last month had no criminal record, according to Bloomberg. At least one, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members for other deportees say that they were falsely identified as TdA members because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team. Trump has openly floated plans to send American citizens to CECOT next.
DOJ attorneys continued to argue in a Court of Appeals filing Sunday that the courts lack jurisdiction to hear the case because the “Petitioners have not been designated as alien enemies under the AEA.” At the same time, they rejected widespread due process concerns and defended the administration’s practice of providing as little as 12 hours’ notice to detainees to indicate they wish to contest their designation as alien enemies.
“The AEA permits the Executive enormous discretion to establish the conditions and processes the Executive will use to implement a Presidential Proclamation, and does not impose any particular notice time period,” the DOJ’s filing says.
Sweeney’s order requires ICE to provide at least 21 days’ notice, written in a language the detainee understands. But Trump’s DOJ argues that providing an English-language form that is “explained orally in another language, if necessary,” is sufficient.
In a response to the DOJ’s appeal, attorneys for D.B.U. and R.M.M. again accused the Trump administration of failing to comply with a Supreme Court opinion earlier this month requiring greater due process for AEA designees.
“The Supreme Court made unequivocally clear that individuals designated under the AEA are entitled to ‘due process’ and ‘notice and opportunity to be heard,’” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “In short, 12 hours would be unreasonable under any circumstances but it is especially unreasonable here given the nature of the class and the consequences of ending up in a Salvadoran prison for the rest of their lives.”

In November 2020, a federal grand jury indicted Chelsea Gless, then 31, of Princeton, Iowa, on multiple counts of mail fraud. Prosecutors alleged Gless, as part-owner and manager of Royal Metals Group, offered prospective clients an opportunity to purchase and sell precious metals, such as gold and silver, through the company for an agreed-upon fee.
Gless pleaded guilty to one count of felony mail fraud, punishable by up to 20 years of imprisonment, and six other charges were dropped. She was sentenced to three years in prison, plus three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $2,935,906 in restitution.
Gless was released from prison in November 2023, and in 2024 was awarded an associate’s degree in nursing from Scott Community College.
In October 2024, she applied for an Iowa registered nurse’s license and was denied on the basis of her felony conviction. She appealed that decision and requested a hearing. Board records indicate the hearing was scheduled for April 10 — but on that day, Gless and the board entered into consent agreement in which the board agreed to issue Gless a license to work in Iowa as a registered nurse, subject to monitoring and three years of probationary status.
As part of that agreement, board has barred Gless from working in any setting, such as a nursing home, “where patients are particularly vulnerable to exploitation,” and where she might have access to patients’ financial information.
In her criminal case, prosecutors alleged that between May 2014 and February 2018, Gless devised and carried out a scheme to defraud clients of Royal Metals Group, in part by using their money to make personal credit card payments.
When clients inquired as to the status of payments they were owed, or the delivery of precious metals they had purchased, Gless allegedly sent them falsified tracking numbers for deliveries, sent them unsigned checks or checks made out for the wrong amount, or sent them checks that later bounced due to insufficient funds, court records show.
At least 71 clients were defrauded a total of more than $2.9 million, prosecutors claimed. Assistant U.S. Attorney Rachel J. Scherle told the court Gless’ conduct was “financially and emotionally devastating” to the victims.
“Chelsea Gless was running the business, and she was in charge,” Scherle said. “Chelsea Gless had the power to stop the manipulation, but she continued to lie and lie over and over again until there were no more metals or money – leaving the victims high and dry.”
Court records indicate one of Gless’ victims lost their entire retirement savings of $260,326, telling prosecutors, “I am a very quiet, non-confrontational person. Just the thought of contacting the FBI was so stressful to me that my daughter had to step in and do the contact for me.”
Gless’ attorneys characterized her as a pawn in the business which was initiated by her husband, Richard Gless, who was 20 years older than Chelsea. Richard Gless died in 2012, before the alleged fraud occurred. Court records indicate that as of January 2025, Gless had paid $14,201 toward restitution, leaving $2,921,391 still owed.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BON-1024x459.jpg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

Ray Holmberg, left, served 45 years in the North Dakota Legislature. Wayne Stenehjem, right, served as attorney general for 22 years. The two Republicans were close associates who began their political careers at the same time. (Photos provided by Sherburne (Minn.) County Jail, Office of Attorney General)Newly released call logs show the late Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem communicated with former Sen. Ray Holmberg as the lawmaker was being investigated for sex crimes, including calls the day Stenehjem sat for a law enforcement interview.
Yet Stenehjem only told law enforcement about one phone conversation with Holmberg, according to Attorney General Drew Wrigley, who succeeded Stenehjem after his January 2022 death.
“That’s a pretty troubling log,” Wrigley said late Friday after his office made the call logs public. “The attorney general was asked about contacts with Ray Holmberg. He said that he had spoken to him once, and that was not accurate.”
There also is evidence that Stenehjem and the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation knew years earlier about a sexual assault allegation against Holmberg but no criminal charges resulted from that report.
Holmberg was sentenced late last month to 10 years in federal prison for traveling out of the country with the intent to pay for sex with underage boys. That conviction largely resulted from a federal investigation that began in 2021.
Holmberg sexually exploited others, including people in North Dakota, witnesses say in court

But a man who spoke at the March 26 sentencing hearing came forward to the FBI years earlier to report sexual exploitation by Holmberg.  
Handwritten notes in a former Grand Forks prosecutor’s file obtained by the North Dakota Monitor indicate Stenehjem knew in 2015 about that report.
David Jones, former Grand Forks County state’s attorney, wrote in an Aug. 31, 2015, note:  “A.G. office doesn’t want T.F. involved at all. (Wayne decision.)”
Jones said he used the initials T.F. as shorthand for a multi-jurisdictional law enforcement task force. The state BCI, within the attorney general’s office, is part of the task force.
Jones’ notes indicate that federal investigators were looking into reports of overseas trips. Jones said he did not talk to Stenehjem directly and does not know why he didn’t want the task force involved.
“If it’s a federal investigation, part of the thing is, we don’t want to step on their toes as they’re going forward with something,” Jones said. “So anything beyond that, it’d just be speculative on my part.”
Holmberg and Stenehjem were known to be friends, both beginning their time in public service in 1977 as Republican state legislators from Grand Forks. Stenehjem went on to become North Dakota’s longest-serving attorney general, and Holmberg spent 45 years in the Legislature, rising to the powerful role of Senate Appropriations chair.
Beth Stenehjem defended her husband in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor.
“It is nothing short of unfortunate that after the release of Wayne’s emails, text messages, and interview with the BCI, there remains misguided focus to find a connection between him and Mr. Holmberg’s criminal activity. As everything has shown, there is none,” she wrote. “This misguided effort is especially disappointing in the fact that Wayne is not here to defend himself against these baseless assumptions and accusations that are nothing but pure speculation.”
Call logs
Call logs show communications between Holmberg and Stenehjem in December 2021 and January 2022, including connections made on three dates. Holmberg called on Dec. 9, 2021, and they had a 43-second conversation. Holmberg left a 16-second voicemail on Dec. 19, 2021, which law enforcement did not recover, records show. Holmberg called Jan. 10, 2022, and they talked for 11 minutes, the logs show.
A report also shows that federal prosecutors asked law enforcement to compare what messaging apps Holmberg and Stenehjem had on their cellphones that could be used for communication. Both had WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook Messenger and others, documents show. 
The logs show 11 phone text messages between Holmberg and Stenehjem during December 2021, but not about the investigation. The texts primarily discussed state politics, including who was going to be appointed tax commissioner.
Stenehjem did not report the communications to law enforcement, Wrigley said. 
“You’re talking to a guy who is the subject of a very serious investigation,” Wrigley said. “That you’re talking to him at all is an outrage, and on top of it you’re not telling law enforcement that ‘he continues to call me, I talked to him, and he said the following things.’”
Former ND Sen. Ray Holmberg sentenced to 10 years in prison for sex crime

Stenehjem, who oversaw the BCI, had not recused himself from the Holmberg case, according to Wrigley.
On Nov. 17, 2021, after law enforcement seized Holmberg’s phone and electronic devices while executing a search warrant at his home, Holmberg asked for Stenehjem’s phone number, Dan Casetta, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, said during Holmberg’s sentencing hearing.
Stenehjem received two calls that day from a number identified in his contacts as “Holmberg Burner Phone,” records show. Both calls were rejected and Holmberg left one voicemail, records show.
Holmberg told Stenehjem in the voicemail that he was in “big trouble,” Casetta testified. Holmberg also tried calling Stenehjem at his office that day and left a message with an assistant. Stenehjem did share that voicemail with law enforcement at the time.
On Dec. 1, 2021, Stenehjem was interviewed by Homeland Security Investigations about the November voicemail, records show. 
That same day, call logs show five phone calls between Stenehjem and Holmberg, though the logs do not indicate they spoke. The documents show Stenehjem calling Holmberg once but the call was not answered. Holmberg initiated the other four calls, which were all rejected, documents show. Holmberg left a 14-second voicemail, which law enforcement did not recover, records show.
Holmberg also texted “Hi from Ray” on the day of the former attorney general’s interview with law enforcement, but the records do not indicate Stenehjem responded.
A report detailing the law enforcement interview with Stenehjem has not yet been made public. 
Wrigley said he learned from law enforcement that Stenehjem told investigators about one phone conversation he had with Holmberg. When asked what Holmberg said about the search warrant, Stenehjem said it never came up and the conversation had only been about politics, according to Wrigley.
When investigators later reviewed Stenehjem’s phone data, they discovered that the voicemails from Holmberg had been deleted, including the one from the day of the search warrant, Wrigley said.
“Nobody can understand why anybody, let alone an attorney general, would delete evidence that has been collected in the furtherance of a criminal investigation,” Wrigley said. “But that’s what happened.”
Beth Stenehjem said her late husband dedicated decades to North Dakota in a career of public service.
“I am saddened by the current attorney general’s persistent campaign to malign Wayne’s legacy,” she said in a statement. “I’m proud of him, all he accomplished, and the integrity that Wayne brought to the ND Office of Attorney General.”
Mark Friese, Holmberg’s attorney, did not immediately respond to questions related to the call logs. Earlier this month, he declined to comment when asked about Holmberg’s connection to Stenehjem.
2015 report
Ahead of Holmberg’s sentencing, federal prosecutors revealed for the first time in a sentencing memorandum that a victim had come forward years earlier to report sexual exploitation. The man, who gave a victim impact statement at court, said “for reasons unknown to me” nothing ever came of his report. 
Mike Ness, a retired BCI agent, said in a statement he received a report from the FBI in 2015 or 2016 that a victim wanted to talk about sexual acts involving Holmberg, but the man wanted a letter of immunity.
Ness said he sent the information to the director of the BCI, which at the time was Dallas Carlson. Ness, who worked in the BCI’s Grand Forks office, said he also put the FBI in touch with a local state’s attorney.
Carlson said he does not remember whether the BCI received a report about Holmberg. 
“I’ve been racking my brain, and I just do not remember,” said Carlson, who is now the U.S. marshal for North Dakota. “Protocol at the time in a situation like this, it would have been ran through the attorney general.”
He added that sensitive cases were referred to the attorney general.
“I don’t recall a letter, to be quite honest, I do not recall a letter. And if there was a letter, which I don’t recall, it would have gone to Wayne,” Carlson said, referring to the former attorney general.
Former North Dakota lawmaker pleads guilty to traveling for sex with children

Jones, who was Grand Forks County state’s attorney at the time, kept handwritten notes about the information he received. A note dated July 29, 2015, identifies Holmberg as a suspect and indicates sexual assault allegations from the early 1990s in Grand Forks. The note mentions Holmberg’s role as a state senator and retired school counselor. Jones’ notes also indicate concerns about the statute of limitations.
The document also mentions that the man told investigators Holmberg is “not dealing with local boys” and was now going overseas. The note indicated that Holmberg’s travel was being tracked by the FBI.
Another note in the file indicates the FBI found the man’s report to be credible. “High probability he’s telling the truth,” the note says.
Jones worked with an assistant attorney general on a letter of immunity for the man. The man, who spoke during the sentencing hearing, said he took money from Holmberg at times in exchange for his silence. The North Dakota Monitor does not identify victims of sex crimes.
Acting U.S. Attorney Jennifer Klemetsrud Puhl said she looked into the man’s report but did not determine that a federal offense occurred, so she was unable to pursue it. 
At the time, she had a conversation with a BCI agent who told her the case had been referred to South Dakota for investigation, Klemetsrud Puhl said.
When Wrigley became attorney general, he said he also was told that the 2015 report about Holmberg had been referred to South Dakota for investigation.
But a spokesperson for the agency in the neighboring state that would have handled the referral — the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation — told the North Dakota Monitor the agency has no record of such a request.
Jones said his role was primarily to assist with the letter of immunity and he didn’t receive any additional law enforcement reports about Holmberg.
“I assumed that they were going to do their investigation and move it along, which obviously they did,” Jones said.
Child sex tourism fuels demand for human trafficking, expert says

Ness said the BCI was not asked to investigate. He said he later learned from a county official that the statute of limitations had expired.
But one allegation the man told the FBI involved a sexual assault that occurred in Bismarck in 2012, according to the prosecutors’ sentencing memo. It’s unclear if this information was shared with local authorities. Jones’ notes only mention the 1990s allegations.
A spokesperson for the FBI said the agency doesn’t comment on how it handles complaints.
Burleigh County State’s Attorney Julie Lawyer said her office has no record of Holmberg as a suspect at any time. The Bismarck Police Department has no record of any investigations involving Holmberg, said Lt. Luke Gardiner.
Lori Cohen, an attorney who leads the organization known as PACT, or Protect All Children from Trafficking, said she’s seen a pattern in which predators are often given a pass, particularly if the predator is in a position of power.
“There is a tendency to protect the predator rather than the victim, and that then allows the predator to continue to harm other victims,” Cohen said. “I think this conviction sends a message that it has to stop, but we need to stop it earlier. We need to stop it before more children are harmed.”
Klemetsrud Puhl said without the man’s early report about Holmberg, “it would have been very difficult to proceed” with the investigation that ultimately led to his federal conviction.
“He’s the first one that came forward and it was him affirmatively reporting to law enforcement about what happened at a time when nobody suspected anything,” she said.

(Dean Hanson/Albuquerque Journal)As an advocate for children in foster care and a former foster parent myself, I was heartened to see lawmakers prioritize reforms to the state’s Children, Youth, and Families Department (CYFD) during the recent legislative session, and grateful to see several critical reforms signed into law. These new laws will help bring much needed transparency, accountability, and oversight to the troubled agency, so it can better serve New Mexico’s kids and their families. 
But I am deeply troubled that Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham line-item vetoed crucial funding for one of these important reforms: the Office of the Child Advocate, a new, independent office that will oversee child well-being in the state.
Earlier this year, the governor pleasantly surprised me by acknowledging the need for significant change at CYFD in her State of the State speech. For several years now, her administration has resisted calls from advocates like me, members of the public, and lawmakers for greater oversight of the agency. I felt like maybe our calls were finally being heard. 
Since then, however, her words and actions tell a different story. While the governor signed the legislation creating this office, House Bill 5, she wrote a poison pen message as she did so, accusing those who championed the bill of pursuing a “vendetta” against her and attempting to “intimidate” CYFD staff. She even told a reporter that she was concerned the bill’s supporters were using children and families “as some sort of political effort to harm or discredit another elected official.” 
The harms we should be worried about are not political. Too many children have already paid the price for CYFD’s mistakes and failures. Too many kids have been harmed or even killed on CYFD’s watch. Those of us who are pushing for change are doing it for one reason only: to better protect our kids. 
While I know that most of the agency’s frontline staff are hardworking individuals who are dedicating their careers to helping kids, the agency has long been plagued by a culture of secrecy and defensiveness. That culture has undermined CYFD’s ability to accomplish its mission and resulted in a loss of public trust that makes it harder to hire new caseworkers and recruit foster families. 
The Office of the Child Advocate will help restore that trust by giving kids a stronger voice within the system that is supposed to keep them safe. The Child Advocate will investigate and resolve complaints from children and families involved with CYFD and report on the agency’s progress and challenges to help us understand what else needs to change. 
Legislators allocated $1 million dollars in this year’s $10.8 billion dollar state budget to help the Office of the Child Advocate get off the ground. That’s a small price to pay to improve the well-being of the most vulnerable children in our state and help CYFD begin to earn back our trust. 
Thankfully, New Mexico’s Attorney General has indicated that the state’s Department of Justice can help make up for the vetoed funding. By vetoing this funding and taking efforts to reform CYFD personally, the governor has only proven the necessity of outside oversight.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CYFD-1024x522.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

(Ken Coleman/MIchigan Advance)This story originally appeared on Michigan Advance.

U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Michigan, brought seven articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on Monday, saying the president has “repeatedly demonstrated that he is unfit to serve,” and “represents a clear and present danger to our nation’s constitution and our democracy.”
In a statement from Thanedar’s office, he pointed to “sweeping abuse of power, flagrant violations of the Constitution and acts of tyranny that undermine American democracy and threaten the rule of law” as his reasons for introducing the charges.
“[Trump’s] unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service. We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act,” Thanedar said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Each article alleges a separate violation of the Constitution, with Thanedar’s office offering the following breakdown of his resolution:

Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power: Including denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, and misuse of the Department of Justice.
Usurpation of Appropriations Power: For dismantling congressionally established agencies and impounding federal funds.
Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression: Including imposing economically damaging tariffs and threatening military invasion against sovereign nations.
Violation of First Amendment Rights: Through retaliatory actions against critics, media and attorneys exercising constitutionally protected speech.
Creation of an Unlawful Office: By establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and unlawfully empowering Elon Musk to unilaterally violate the Constitution.
Bribery and Corruption: Involving dismissing criminal cases, soliciting foreign emoluments, and extortionate settlements for personal and political gain.
Tyrannical Overreach: Seeking to consolidate unchecked power, erode civil liberties, and defy constitutional limits on presidential authority.

“This is not about partisanship. It’s about protecting our democracy and ensuring that no one, not even a President, is above the law,” Thanedar said in a statement.
Thanedar’s effort is likely to face an uphill battle in the House, where Republicans hold a seven seat majority. The Senate, which conducts the trial should the resolution receive a majority of votes in the House, is also held by Republicans, with a two-thirds vote needed in order to convict the president.
Thanedar’s introduction of the articles comes the same day that his second primary opponent, state Rep. Donavan McKinney, D-Detroit, announced he would seek his 13th District seat in the 2026 primary.

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds’ lawsuit against the Des Moines Register is both unusual and dangerous for open government in Iowa.
Reynolds announced last week that she was filing suit seeking to stop the Register “from demanding production of the documents protected by executive privilege.”
That’s strange and alarming. Typically, a government agency – including this governor’s office – has simply denied requests for records they believed could be kept confidential (or just didn’t want to release). Until now, it’s been up to the requester, in this case, the Register, to decide whether it’s worthwhile to go to the time and expense of challenging a denial in court.

That was how it worked when Iowa Capital Dispatch and other media representatives and advocates sued the governor and her staff for withholding public records, in some cases as long as 18 months. The case went to the Iowa Supreme Court, which reinforced that the governor’s office is subject to Iowa’s Open Meetings and Records law and that indefinitely withholding public records was a violation.
In this new case, Reynolds is forcing the issue and dragging the Register into court over four emails and claiming “executive privilege” for refusing to release them.
The dispute relates to public statements Reynolds made about Lutheran Family Services, a not-for-profit organization engaged in refugee assistance.
Reynolds had been asked at a U.S. House Oversight Committee meeting whether she agreed with a former adviser to President Donald Trump, Michael Flynn, who claimed Lutheran Family Services was connected to a “money-laundering operation.”
Reynolds refused to respond directly at the hearing but days later, she said she “absolutely” did not agree with Flynn’s statement, according to the Register, and praised Lutheran Family Services for its charitable works.
According to the governor’s lawsuit, the Register requested emails to and from several of Reynolds’ advisers that referenced Lutheran Family Services. Reynolds’ office says it turned over more than 800 pages of documents, while withholding four documents that it said contained “candid, private advice and counsel from her most senior advisors.”
Because the governor did not send nor receive any of the emails, the Register argued that any executive privilege would not apply. The governor’s office claimed the Register’s position means that the governor “may not communicate with, or privately correspond with, her most senior advisors without those communications being open public records. That is not — and cannot be — the law.”
It’s not the law. There is absolutely nothing in Iowa law that prevents the governor from picking up the telephone or calling a meeting of her closest advisers and getting all the advice she might possibly want. But Iowa law does state that written communications among executive branch employees are public records. The governor’s office staff – and everyone working in the executive branch – should know this. There are over 60 exceptions in the law, none of which includes “executive privilege.”
The Reynolds administration is the least transparent in 30 years

That the governor is going to court over these four emails suggests there’s more at stake here than one or more of her staff disagreeing with her about a potentially politically charged issue. Reynolds has already announced she’s not running for reelection, so it’s hard to imagine what kind of response would be so explosive as to be worth a preemptive lawsuit to keep it secret.
More likely, Reynolds is trying to carve out or solidify some sort of “executive privilege” for the governor’s office through court precedent. But again, she’s leaving office at the end of next year, so why is that a priority?
The governor’s office statement casts the action as an effort to preserve the constitutional powers of the office: “It is unfortunate that state resources must be used to defend against the Register’s aggressive threats, but it is in the broader public interest to preserve the powers reserved in our constitution for the effective operation of government.”
Let’s be clear.  There’s nothing in the constitution about the governor keeping embarrassing emails secret. It was 100% the governor’s choice to spend public resources to initiate this lawsuit. And it is entirely in the broader public interest to have access to government documents and meetings – including those that may be embarrassing to elected officials.
By going to court against the Register for seeking public records, Reynolds is threatening all media that they may get sued for doing their job. Not all Iowa media outlets have the resources to withstand a taxpayer-funded lawsuit. It’s a direct attack on press freedom and therefore on the First Amendment.
Whether the governor’s lawsuit is successful or not, the citizens of Iowa will be the losers.

Jeff Bridges speaks before Gov. Jared Polis signs the budget for the 2025-2026 fiscal year on April 28, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the state’s $43.9 billion budget for the upcoming fiscal year on Monday, culminating nearly a year’s worth of work to craft a spending plan that appropriately funds public education and Medicaid while cutting enough program spending to fill a billion-dollar gap.
“A lot of hours and time went into writing this document. This balanced, bipartisan budget holds strong reserves for an uncertain future. It makes smart investments to protect what matters most, including education, public safety and health care,” Polis said during a signing ceremony at the Governor’s Residence in Denver.
The budget includes about $16 billion in general fund spending, the portion of the budget over which the Legislature has the most control. The new fiscal year begins in July.

The tight budget conditions were partially a product of ballooning Medicaid costs within the state’s Department of Health Care Policy and Financing and slowing inflation, which impacts how much tax revenue the state is allowed to retain and spend under the state constitution. A cap set by the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights will increase by about 3.6% next year but will be outpaced by health care costs.
That means the six bipartisan members of the powerful Joint Budget Committee had to figure out what to cut in order to create the constitutionally-required balanced budget.
“This is one of the most complicated budgets we have ever put together,” JBC Chair Sen. Jeff Bridges, an Arapahoe County Democrat, said.
Over 60 companion bills ran alongside the primary budget bill, known colloquially as the “long bill,” to shift spending and change state law to balance everything. Polis signed those last week.
More difficulties in future years
The budget makes spending reductions in about a dozen state departments.
One move delays about $70 million this year and $56 million next year in planned transportation spending. Another eliminates about $7 million for the Revitalizing Main Street program and over $70 million in awarded, though not under contract, grants for small-scale infrastructure improvements.
The budget also cuts or reduces many recently enacted programs, such as a Kidney Disease Task Force, free phone calls for incarcerated people, and a bullying-prevention effort in the Department of Education.
There are also instances where the budget bumps funding, including $150 million more to public schools and $21.7 million to the Child Care Assistance Program. It includes a 2.5% across-the-board salary increase for state employees and a 1.6% increase in the state reimbursement for Medicaid providers.
The budget funds the state’s universal free school meal program, approved by voters in 2022, until the end of the year. After that, the program’s financial future could be left to voters again if the Legislature refers to the fall ballot a measure asking to keep additional tax money to pay for the unexpected demand.
Lawmakers expect the difficult budget circumstances to continue in the upcoming years. Some attribute that to the constitutional limit of how much tax revenue the state can keep, and others say it is a spending problem that leads to a structural issue.
“You don’t get out of a structural deficit in a one-year budget. This is a two-, three- and four-year cycle that we have to work on and make sure that we are doing our due diligence,” said Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Weld County Republican.
“We had over $351 million of one-time spending again this year. That’s not good,” she said.
This year’s budget constraints left little room for any new programs and legislation that included spending.
The House voted 44-21 and the Senate voted 22-11 to approve the budget. The JBC’s two Republican members joined Democrats to vote in favor.

The Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education “will not seek to extend” Cheng’s contract beyond June 30, 2026, when it’s slated to end, according to a press release. Starting this July 1, Cheng will “transition” into a new role as a strategic advisor to the board as part of a mutual agreement, the press release stated.
Officials did not announce a replacement to succeed Cheng as the head of CSCU, which includes four public universities and over a dozen community colleges.
In a statement included in the press release, Cheng said, “I am incredibly proud of the work we have done to eliminate barriers to higher education, and increase educational access, equity, and opportunity for students, particularly for first-generation and minoritized students.
“Together, we have opened new doors for students and changed the trajectory of their lives,” Cheng’s statement went on. “I remain deeply committed to this work and will continue to work with the Board of Regents and build on the success of the CSCU system.”
The decision came after some deliberation, according to Gov. Ned Lamont. Speaking to reporters outside of the state Capitol Monday, Lamont said discussions between Cheng and the Board of Regents had been going on for “a while” prior to Monday’s announcement. The governor is responsible for appointing nine of the board’s 15 members, including its chair.
“Look, he’s been a good friend, he’s accomplished a lot there at Connecticut State,” the governor said, pointing specifically to the schools’ consolidation into a single higher education system in 2023, two years after Cheng was hired.
“Applications are up, graduations are up, but we just thought it was time to make a change,” Lamont added. “We did that together and to see if we can continue to speed up the process there.”
Cheng’s tenure also coincided with a time when many colleges are struggling with stagnant or declining enrollment, along with persistent questions about how much money the state should provide to support higher education. 
Those troubles worsened last year when CT Insider reported that the chancellor had charged tens of thousands of dollars to his state credit card on travel and meals — including chauffeured rides to and from his home in New York, despite his contract providing stipends for a car and apartment in Hartford.
A report from the Comptroller Sean Scanlon’s office later confirmed that many of those expenses exceeded certain limits, were missing receipts or violated other rules such a prohibition on purchasing alcohol with public money.
“At a time where we’re trying to manage within our budget, obviously some of the spending was an issue,” Lamont said Monday. “But for me, much more important is the direction of Connecticut State, what it’s going to look like in 10 years. And we’ve made good progress over the last four years, we still have a way to go.”
Marty Guay, the chair of the Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education, thanked Cheng for his service on Monday in another statement included in the system’s press release.
“The future is bright for CSCU as we look to set a new direction for the system,” Guay said. 
“We have a real opportunity to make impactful investments in our system in the best interests of the students we serve and the state as a whole,” he added. “We will continue to create more opportunities and access for students, boost graduation rates, and strengthen our talent pipelines to ensure they are aligned with industry needs and meet workforce demands.”
Richard Balducci, a former House speaker and member of the Board of Regents, said the board had been dissatisfied with the pace of change under Cheng and it was evident for months that his contract would not be renewed when it expired in June 2026.
Issues over Cheng’s personal spending solidified the consensus that a change was necessary, Balducci said. “That kind of set it off,” he said. 
“I think the Board of Regents should use this as an opportunity to refocus on what’s  really important, which is student outcomes, what’s happening in the classrooms,” said Rep. Gregg Haddad, D-Mansfield, who serves as co-chair of the Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee.
Lamont said Monday that the board already has an interim replacement for Cheng ready to announce following graduation ceremonies next month. However, the governor said he couldn’t recall the name of the person.
Samantha Norton, a spokeswoman for the system, said that an interim chancellor has not been selected by the board, “but we hope to make an announcement in the coming weeks.”
Cheng’s current contract is set to expire on June 30, 2026. Norton said Monday that Cheng will continue to earn his base annual salary of $442,187 until then.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0307_SR_CampusSurveillanceHearing_042-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Fallout from the 2025 legislative session remains all over the news, reminding me of my brief time interacting with the Utah Legislature. It marked the most frustrating chapter of my academic and professional careers.
For the past school year I was able to be at the state Capitol during the recent session. I started out excited to cultivate relationships, have meaningful conversations and address important questions. By the end, I felt like an object of pity — and I realized the Legislature has failed to confront two major air quality issues: the literal pollution in our skies, and the air of arrogance within the Capitol each session.
My first interaction with a legislator was quite embarrassing. I patiently waited outside the House of Representatives chamber to talk with my representative about affordable housing.
When the chamber doors opened, my legislator waved in my direction. As we made our way towards each other, I reached out my hand, ready to introduce myself as a constituent. He brushed right past me to speak with someone else. Respectfully, I waited my turn. But after thanking the lobbyist for contributing to his campaign, he brushed past me again and disappeared. I felt my respect for the process disappear with him.
I’ve also spent two semesters interning in Washington, D.C. There was a stark difference between my experience at our state Capitol and my time working in D.C. While in D.C., I was able to meet with members of Congress from all over the country; every office had full-time staff, and several interns, who were quick to welcome constituents into their space for conversations.
I expected an even better experience with our state Legislature. I had always heard that our Legislature is approachable, efficient and constituent-friendly. “The legislative website is amazing!” “It’s easy to contact your legislator!” “Utah politics is so different!” But from my first interaction to my last, I found myself thinking, “Really? Did that just happen?”
Utah has a part-time legislature that meets for only 45 days each year and lawmakers have almost no professional staff. Every year we are shocked at the amount of bills they introduce and pass. But we should be more shocked by what this number says about the quality of those bills.
During committee hearings, it was clear that legislators had not read the bills they were meant to be vetting, much less understand their impact. Later, when the consequences hit their districts, legislators can just say, “well, we didn’t mean for that to happen.” But their affected constituents don’t get off the hook so easily.
There is also a purposeful lack of access-to information, to lawmakers, and to opportunities to be involved in positive policy change. By contrast, in D.C., it was so easy for me to connect with real people, find out about town halls, and get news from each district. While D.C. has its issues, I could clearly feel the passion and professionalism.
Our Legislature exudes an arrogance I did not experience in D.C. They seem to think themselves different from their constituents: more important, more worthy of respect. What I saw, does not back that up.
Our leaders seem determined to govern by nostalgia, as Utah continues to grow and experience new challenges. They cling to a vision of the nuclear family, market self-regulation, and rugged frontier individualism. Those images of “the Utah Way” haven’t been a reality for most Utahns for decades! Following “the Utah Way” and “disagreeing better” are not valid excuses for our legislature’s lack of professionalism and lack of access. They don’t justify ignoring the things Utahns need right now, and in the future.
When it comes to governance and leadership, we deserve better than just a balanced budget and tax cuts. We need something better than “what we’ve always done.” If that includes pushing past constituents to meet with donors, passing bills without serious review, or restricting public access-we should be coming up with a new “Utah Way,” and fast.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020625_HB267_12-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Republicans on the House fraud prevention committee grilled Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on Monday over a 2021 meeting with people ensnared in the massive Feeding Our Future scandal, which took place just a month before the FBI shut down the fraud.
In a recently unearthed audio recording, Ellison can be heard agreeing with the Feeding Our Future participants that state agencies, i.e., his clients, are discriminating against East African state contractors. The recording was made — without Ellison’s knowledge — during his meeting with the vendors in December 2021. One month later, the FBI executed multiple search warrants on Feeding Our Future and other nonprofits. Federal prosecutors say the nonprofit and groups it sponsored fraudulently received $250 million in federal funds to feed hungry children during the pandemic, but the fraudsters used the money on luxury cars, real estate, jewelry and travel.
Republican members of the House Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight and Policy Committee asked Ellison to testify about why he seemed to be siding with the Feeding Our Future participants over the state agencies that were trying to stop the fraud.
Ellison said at the time he believed he was meeting with constituents and didn’t know they were involved in Feeding Our Future. After the 2021 meeting, Ellison said he spoke with his staff, who informed him that they were bad actors. Ellison said he didn’t do anything the Feeding Our Future participants asked of him and refused their fundraising help in the meeting.
“The proof of the pudding is in the tasting. What did I do for these people? Nothing. I investigated after the conversation, and then what did we do? We cooperated (with the federal government) to help get these people found accountable, as they eventually were,” Ellison said Monday.
Republicans on the fraud committee prepared clips of the recording and played them for Ellison, and asked him to respond to some of the most embarrassing parts. They questioned why he didn’t know the Feeding Our Future participants he met with, especially because his office had been representing the Department of Education in its legal battle with Feeding Our Future for about a year prior to the 2021 meeting.
Ellison painted himself as a politician doing run-of-the-mill constituent service and said that he doesn’t know every detail of all the cases his office is working on. He argued Republicans were being unrealistic by expecting him to know who the people were because Feeding Our Future and the fraud were at the time unknown.
“It’s impossible for any individual to know everything about every file that every agency does. It’s simply not how large organizations work. I have highly competent managers working on this … They knew, even if I didn’t know every single detail,” Ellison said. “What I knew was that people in the community said, ‘We feel like we’re not being treated fairly.’”
Republicans on the committee questioned the veracity of Ellison’s explanations, particularly that he didn’t know with whom he was meeting.
“I’ve got to believe that you were aware, unless your office is poorly run, which I don’t believe. I think it’s well-run,” Rep. Patti Anderson, R-Dellwood, told Ellison.
Democrats on the committee argued the hearing was a political hit job. Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, praised Ellison for his work prosecuting Medicaid fraud and said the committee should be focused on working to protect public dollars, not on nearly four-year-old recordings.
“If the work of this committee is actually serious and not political, what we should be asking is, what are we learning to ensure that we are protecting public funds?” Greenman argued.
Ellison closed his remarks Monday by assuring the committee that his office is committed to combatting fraudulent activity.
“I hope we can work together to fight waste, fraud and abuse,” Ellison told the committee. “I’m not naive. I know that we live in a political world, but if we can leave politics aside and try to figure out how to protect the public dollar, you have a partner in me.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MG_8541-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-28 19:27:21+00:00,CT Mirror,Boosting direct care hours at nursing homes would cost $24M,Jenna Carlesso and Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/28/ct-nursing-homes-direct-care-bill/,A bill that would increase how much time nursing home staff must spend with residents would cost $24M as CT is facing financial challenges.,"Legislators intent on boosting direct care for nursing home residents have recommended raising the daily minimum staffing requirement from three to 3.6 hours, a change that would provide about 36 minutes of additional care per resident each day.
But a recent analysis by the state’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis shows the move would come with a hefty price tag: $24.2 million, half of which would be picked up by the state through Medicaid payments.
“It’s going to be very difficult to pass this year,” said Sen. Jan Hochadel, D-Meriden, co-chair of the Aging Committee. “Unfortunately … we cannot afford [it] at this time.”
Hochadel said she continues to advocate for the measure, which her committee voted to advance in March, but “We have a rocky road.”
“This is something we have wanted to do, to increase staffing to take care of our elderly, but in this fiscal climate we have to make some hard choices,” Aging Committee Co-Chair Jane Garibay, D-Windsor, added.
Legislators are grappling with unprecedented challenges to state finances.
More than $500 million in emergency federal pandemic grants that are being used to fund ongoing programs will be unavailable going forward. A series of budget caps that have generated huge surpluses since 2017 have gradually weakened health care and other core programs and must be scaled back, Democratic legislative leaders say.
State officials’ largest concern, though, involves large anticipated reductions in federal aid in the coming months.
Under the staffing bill, nursing homes would be required to provide a minimum of 3.6 hours of direct care for each resident every day. They currently must provide three hours, though some homes already staff at higher levels.
Direct care is defined as hands-on care from a registered nurse, nurse’s aide or licensed practical nurse that includes feeding, dressing and bathing.
The measure also would impose new penalties for violations. Facilities that fail to comply with the increased staffing requirements could face fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill also gives the state health commissioner the authority to suspend a nursing home’s license or certificate or issue citations for lapses.
Nursing home industry leaders oppose the plan.
Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, said the cost is a challenge, as is recruiting staff.
“We have a reimbursement system where costs drive the rates. If you mandate increased costs to the facilities, those have to be reimbursed under the Medicaid program,” he said. “While that’s a challenge in any environment when there’s staffing shortages, it’s especially challenging to come up with the dollars to do it in the current fiscal climate.”
Earlier this year, he testified on the bill: “Because of the ongoing staffing shortages in the sector, nursing homes will inevitably need to unsatisfactorily rely, in increasing frequency, on temporary nursing staffing agencies in an attempt to comply with these highly prescriptive standards.”
Mag Morelli, president of LeadingAge Connecticut, which represents nonprofit nursing homes and adult care providers, said she supports strong staffing but worries about the expense.
“Right now, everyone is very concerned about how much they’re spending and potential cuts to the Medicaid program from the federal side,” she said. “There’s a shortage of workforce, so as one sector needs to increase staffing, it raises the cost of all staffing. There is a limited amount of people to go around in the health care sector.”
House Speaker Matthew Ritter, D-Hartford, said the lack of clarity around federal Medicaid funding makes it difficult to back numerous proposals, including nursing home staffing increases.
“One of the most disappointing things as a state right now, for me, is the uncertainty at the federal level is impacting a lot of our Medicaid decisions,” he said. “Whether it’s an Aging Committee bill or the Medicaid caucus priority bill, we do need to wait for more information from Washington.”
Congress is trying to achieve savings in Medicaid and other programs worth $880 billion over 10 years to help pay for President Donald Trump’s proposed federal tax cuts.
Connecticut expects to spend $11.6 billion this fiscal year on Medicaid. About $4.7 billion of that is the state’s cost, with the other $6.9 billion covered by federal reimbursement.
But state officials fear that if Congress hits all or most of its cost-cutting target, Connecticut will lose hundreds of millions of dollars in annual support at best, billions at worst.
Along with the federal funding uncertainty, lawmakers also are confronting expired labor contracts for nursing facilities’ staff.
More than 6,000 nursing home employees spread among more than 60 facilities statewide are working with expired contracts. And another 3,500 health care workers, most assisting clients with disabilities in group homes, are due for wage hikes.
Though no specific work stoppage date has been announced, SEIU District 1199 New England — the state’s largest health care workers union — has said it wants legislators to expand Medicaid funding to support raises before the regular General Assembly session ends June 4.
“We also have a nursing home contract issue going on, so we have to balance all of the different bills relative to the industry,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee.
“We’ve got to get our arms around the nursing home industry and direct care. We’ve had [several] nursing homes close in the last 12 months. As we continue to move through this process, we have to remember that we want to still have nursing homes, and we’re going to have to grapple with the needs the industry has.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024_0222_SR_NursingHomes_126-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496

How does that affect policy?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Ginny Monk to discuss her article, “Nearly 1 in 5 CT lawmakers are landlords. Could that affect policy?” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Ginny’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Ginny. Why did you decide to investigate whether being a landlord affects Connecticut lawmakers as they craft state housing policy?
GM: So this is something that particularly tenants’ rights advocates have asked me about every legislative session for the past couple of years, and I think this year in particular, we heard a lot of discussion from legislators about their personal experiences as landlords. So I decided to dig into it by looking at their financial disclosure reports.
WSHU: And what did you find?
GM: Based on the reporting from the financial disclosure reports, about one in five Connecticut lawmakers are also landlords, and this varies a lot in scale. So some folks only rent out one additional property. One rents out nearly 60 properties. And there was also sort of a variety in how thoroughly people filled out the forms. So some people listed LLCs that own rental properties, but didn’t list the individual properties on their forms. So there’s still a good deal unknown, but I think we are able to quantify at least a bit how many lawmakers are also landlords.
WSHU: You didn’t take into consideration that many lawmakers are lawyers who have landlords as clients as well, right?
GM: Right, so, many, many lawmakers are also lawyers, like you said, who have landlords as clients. We also didn’t count the number of people involved in real estate, which has some obvious ties to the landlord industry.
WSHU: Now you’ve talked to some of the lawmakers. What did they say?
GM: So it was really a wide variety of responses on how much lawmakers thought that this influenced policy. Some, particularly Democrats, said, yes, absolutely. This is influencing policy. It’s making it difficult to pass bills that are favorable to tenants. It’s watering down these bills. And then some said, of course, landlords should be lawmakers. They have expertise in providing housing.
WSHU: Yeah, you mentioned Rob Sampson (R-Cheshire), the ranking Republican on the committee, and he feels that his experience comes to bear when he makes his decisions, and it’s important to have that experience.
GM: Yeah, and he’s one who often mentions during particularly public hearings and public debates, his own experience as a landlord with some good tenants and some not-so-good tenants, and he’s opposed to many of the bills that tenant rights advocates have championed.
WSHU: Now tell us about the bills tenants’ rights advocates have championed and where they stand this year.
GM: Yeah, so particularly this year, they’re working on a bill that would reform eviction law in Connecticut. It would expand some existing protections that right now are only available to seniors and to people with disabilities. Essentially, it would end no-fault evictions. So these are evictions that typically occur at the end of the lease, and the expansion would apply to larger apartments, so five or more units. This is something they’ve worked on for the past couple of years. It hasn’t passed. This year, it’s gotten through committee. So we’ll see where it lands as we go to the full House and Senate over the next few weeks.
WSHU: You talked with Larry Butler, the Democrat. How’s he looking at it this year?
GM: Yeah, so Larry Butler is a long-standing member. He’s not the current chair of the Housing Committee. He was on one end of the spectrum, saying, you know, I didn’t realize that so many lawmakers are landlords, because I hardly ever hear about it, whereas the current chairs sort of said, you know, I hear about this more frequently.
WSHU: And right now, how does it look as far as passage of the tenants’ rights bills this year?
GM: Yeah, so it’s hard to say at this point. There seems to be a good amount of support, particularly from freshmen lawmakers. There’s a lot of support from folks who have historically been interested in housing and landlord-tenant issues, but there’s still a way to go. It got a couple of no votes from Democrats on the Housing Committee, which isn’t terribly common, and Republicans have been really staunchly against this bill.
WSHU: If this passes, would it be a first for the nation? Is this the first of this kind of bill, or do we have similar bills in other states?
GM: There are similar bills in other states, and I think that’s one of the points that advocates are making to folks who say this would drastically change the landscape of the rental industry in Connecticut. They’re saying other states have done this and made it through, and Connecticut already offers these protections to select groups of renters.
WSHU: Those are the associations that have this provision.
GM: Yeah, there are certain Connecticut folks over 62 and people with disabilities as well as the people that are caring for them, who are not subject to no-fault eviction.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/assembly-24.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 17:11:49.057745

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) The Iowa Board of Medicine has charged an emergency-medicine doctor from Des Moines with sexual misconduct.
Board records indicate Dr. Douglas Selover, 67, has been charged with unprofessional conduct, a charge that includes acts that violate the “standards and principles of medical ethics,” or are “contrary to honesty, justice or good morals, whether the same is committed in the course of the licensee’s practice or otherwise.” Selover is also charged with sexual misconduct, a charge the board says “includes sexual harassment.”
The board has not disclosed when, where or how the alleged violations took place. State records indicate Selover has practiced as an emergency-medicine physician at MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center.
A board hearing on the charges is scheduled for Dec. 12, 2025.
Board records show that in 1991, the board approved Selover’s residency in Iowa pursuant to a consent agreement in which he agreed to abstain from the use of nonprescribed drugs, inform his treating physician of his “previous history of chemical abuse,” and abstain from drinking alcohol. As part of that agreement, Selover also promised to attend regular support-group meetings and submit to periodic testing for drugs and alcohol.
In 1992, shortly after Selover was arrested on a charge of drunken driving, the board alleged that on several occasions Selover had violated the terms of his consent agreement by consuming alcohol. Later that year, the board resolved the case by suspending Selover’s license for 30 days, after which his license was to be placed on probationary status for five years. The arrest resulted in a conviction for second-offense drunken driving, according to court records.
In 1993, the board granted Selover a license to practice osteopathic medicine in Iowa subject to probation and many of the same conditions that were imposed on his residency in 1991. In 1996, the board terminated Selover’s probation and granted him a license free and clear of any restrictions.
In November 2003, Selover was arrested again on a charge of second-offense drunken driving. The charge was later reduced to reckless driving.
Selover is currently a defendant in two separate medical malpractice cases in which he is alleged to have failed to diagnose hydrocephalus in patients he saw seven days apart at MercyOne Medical Center of Des Moines. Both patients — one of whom was a 7-year-old boy, while the other was a 12-year-old girl — subsequently died.
Selover has denied any wrongdoing in the two cases, which are currently scheduled for trial in July and September of 2027.



Dubuque physician faces charges again
The Iowa Board of Medicine has charged a Dubuque physician with unprofessional conduct.
Board records indicate Dr. Barry J. Waack, 59, a doctor of osteopathy, is charged with unprofessional conduct, a charge that includes acts “contrary to honesty, justice or good morals, whether the same is committed in the course of the licensee’s practice or otherwise,” or acts that violate “the standards and principles of medical ethics or rules.”
The board has not disclosed when, where or how the alleged violations took place. According to the board, Waack is a family-medicine physician practicing in the Dubuque area.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Oct. 24, 2025.
In 2018, the board alleged Waack violated appropriate professional boundaries, engaged in improper prescribing, and failed to establish an appropriate physician-patient relationship. The board also alleged Waack failed to perform appropriate examinations and failed to maintain appropriate medical records.
In that case, Waack was accused of prescribing multiple medications — including antibiotics, a corticosteroid and an antidepressant — for a subordinate female coworker with whom he was having a sexual relationship, without ever establishing an appropriate physician-patient relationship.
He and the board later agreed to resolve the case with a warning and a $5,000 civil penalty. As part of the agreement, Waack also agreed to complete a board-approved course on professional boundaries, and his license was placed on probation.
In December 2021, the board restored Waack’s license to full privileges, free and clear of any restrictions.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DOCTOR.jpg,,,2025-04-28 16:05:21.831496

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Hundreds filed past the message “Rest in Peace Pope Francis” on the reader board outside St. Anthony Church in North Providence Monday on their way inside to honor the late Rhode Island Senate President Dominick Ruggerio.
Comparisons between the two titans of their worlds — Ruggerio, of state politics, and Francis of the Catholic Church — were unavoidable during the Mass in celebration of Ruggerio.
Both died on April 21. Ruggerio was 76, and Pope Francis was 88.
The Rev. Edward Cardente, who led Ruggerio’s funeral Mass, called it a “double whammy.”
“Just as Pope Francis was known throughout the world, so was Senate President Ruggerio known throughout the state of Rhode Island,” Cardente said.
Indeed, the crowd for Ruggerio’s Mass spilled out from the Mineral Spring Avenue church, filling a room in the rectory set up with projector screens and folding chairs. Cars lined the streets of the neighborhood around the church, as family, friends, elected officials, judges and union leaders from across the country gathered to pay their respects.
The attendee list included North Providence Mayor Charles Lombardi, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, Gov. Dan McKee, Rhode Island’s congressional delegation and former U.S. Commerce Secretary and former Gov. Gina Raimondo, who traveled from D.C. to attend the funeral.  
“Donny was special, a dear friend,” Raimondo said in comments after the Mass. “We argued a lot. We probably disagreed more than we agreed. But he was always so respectful, a true gentleman.”
The pair of LaSalle Academy alumni, though both Democrats, differed on hot-button social issues like guns and reproductive rights during their overlap on Smith Hill. Raimondo served as governor from 2015 to 2021.
Ruggerio, a former administrator for the Laborers’ International Union of North America representing construction workers, was first elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives in 1980. He served two terms before he successfully ran for the Senate, where he represented District 4, spanning northern Providence and North Providence, for the next four decades. He was elected Senate president by his colleagues in 2017. 
Ruggerio was known for more conservative stances on social issues, while championing worker protections and expanding legal gambling. But colleagues remembered Ruggerio’s willingness to listen to views other than his own, and to change his views as time progressed.

‘Indestructible’
Ruggerio’s son, Charles Ruggerio, said his dad’s once formidable demeanor toward his family eased in his later years, too. In a remembrance given during the Mass, Charles Ruggerio described his father as “indestructible” and “old-school.”
“What he struggled to express in words, he demonstrated in actions,” Charles Ruggerio said of his dad, recalling the countless sports games, graduations and other celebratory events his father attended for his children. 
But, as time went on, the elder Ruggerio’s hard facade softened, and his outward displays of affection towards his family, especially his grandchildren, were numerous.
“It was rare for him to end a phone call without saying ‘I love you,’” Charles Ruggerio said of his dad in his later years. 
The late Senate president was known as a mentor to his colleagues at the State House, eager to pass on the knowledge and expertise he’d developed as the most senior member of the Rhode Island General Assembly and the “dean” of the Senate.
Despite the public nature of his life in politics, Ruggerio kept his personal life, including his health, private even to his family. Charles Ruggerio recalled a family trip to Disneyland Paris five years ago; his father kept up with his grandchildren despite being 71 years old, and having cancer — a diagnosis Charles Ruggerio didn’t know about at the time.
“He had cancer at least three times that I was aware of,” Charles Ruggerio said.
When Ruggerio publicly revealed he was again battling cancer in April 2024, amid visible signs of decline, he refused to say what kind, or when he had been diagnosed. This year, as illness forced Ruggerio to miss a majority of the Senate’s floor sessions, his aides continued to tout his recovery and promised an imminent return to the chamber.
Concern over Ruggerio’s ability to lead the Senate given his health problems divided Democratic lawmakers, with nearly one-third backing Sen. Ryan Pearson for Senate president over Ruggerio in a November caucus. 
Ruggerio’s death has reopened the freshly healed wounds from the contentious leadership battle. Pearson is again vying for the president role while Ruggerio’s second-in-command, Senate Majority Leader Valarie Lawson, has teamed up with Sen. Frank Ciccone as a slate for president and majority leader, respectively.

Leadership elections Tuesday
The Senate, which has been on hiatus since Ruggerio’s death, is expected to elect its new president tomorrow afternoon, Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson said. A party caucus will be held prior to the full Senate session, which is tentatively scheduled for 4:30 p.m.
Lawson, Ciccone and Pearson all attended Ruggerio’s funeral, along with the rest of the chamber and members of the House of Representatives. Rep. Arthur Corvese, a North Providence Democrat and friend of Ruggerio, said the “Prayer of the Faithful” during the Mass.
Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, declined to comment after the Mass.
Pearson, who had a falling out with Ruggerio last year, said he did not hesitate to attend Ruggerio’s funeral.
“Donny was my friend for over 15 years,” Pearson, a Cumberland Democrat, said after the Mass. “Of course, I am here.”
Asked about the comparisons with Pope Francis, Pearson said, “Donny would be loving that.”
Charles Ruggerio also acknowledged the associations between his father and the leader of the Catholic Church.
“He would say, ‘always the bridesmaid, never the bride,’” Charles Ruggerio joked.
“But we know that couldn’t be further from the truth after seeing the tremendous outpouring of love this past week.”
Ruggerio passed the Rhode Island State House one last time around 1 p.m., as his funeral procession drove east on Smith Street en route to St. Francis Cemetery in Pawtucket. 
A handful of state workers started gathering around 12:30 p.m. on the walkway outside the State House. The group swelled to a large crowd, including senators who arrived by bus following the funeral Mass, in time to watch the motorcade pass. 
A lifelong North Providence resident, Ruggerio is survived by his children, Charles and Amanda; his sister Lisa Aceto; and his grandchildren, Ava, Mia, Natalie, and Jameson.

With the addition of the omissions and other accounting adjustments, the base budget’s corrected total is $426,732 more than initially calculated, according to administrators and their updated spreadsheet.As a result, the town selectboard will have to cut nearly a half-million dollars from the new number just to level down to the 12% tax hike defeated last month, leaders have determined.“The budget news is really disappointing,” selectboard Chair Elizabeth McLoughlin said at the start of a special Thursday session on the topic.Five and a half hours later, the board asked Town Manager John Potter to return this week with a plan to cut $500,000 in expenses for the fiscal year that starts July 1. That would allow leaders to present a revised proposal at a special Town Meeting on May 27 that’s lower than the original, if only by about $75,000.“The numbers have been corrected and our task has gotten way more difficult,” selectboard Vice-Chair Oscar Heller said.Heller, newly elected to the board, headed the town’s advisory Finance Committee this winter when it issued a rare public resolution questioning why local leaders, facing double-digit-percentage increases in staffing, health insurance and trash disposal costs, weren’t studying decreases in the biggest single source of spending: personnel.READ MORE





 


In a first, Brattleboro Town Meeting rejects proposed municipal budget

“We recognize that the concept of staff cuts is painful,” the committee said in its statement, “but we believe that considering it is an essential part of the responsible management of the town.” The selectboard at the time — which lost three of its five members in March when the former chair didn’t run for reelection and two incumbents were defeated — chose not to reduce employees. On Thursday, continuing board member Peter Case, who has opposed layoffs, asked how the town would achieve $500,000 in savings.Replied Potter: “It’s going to come from positions.”And McLoughlin: “Nothing is off the table.”The selectboard is scheduled to receive and review proposed reductions at a special session this Thursday. Leaders so far have chosen not to fill two open administrative jobs: assistant town manager and finance director. But they are considering the addition of three firefighters after determining that station overtime is so high — currently upward of $700,000 or more annually — that hiring help would be less expensive.“I don’t see any way to reduce that number,” new Fire Chief Jay Symonds said of the overtime spurred by vacancies and contract requirements, “other than adding staff.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brattleboro rejected a $25M municipal budget as too high.

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Just two years after Minnesota became the first state to extend unemployment insurance to school bus drivers, cafeteria workers and teachers’ aids, Democratic legislators are considering eliminating the benefit after summer 2028 to reach a budget deal with Republicans.
The law continues to face stiff opposition from school districts, which say paying for unemployment benefits for hourly school workers takes critical funding away from the classroom while making it harder for them to find workers to fill part-time summer positions.
Advocates say the benefit provides a critical lifeline to workers, who make around $17 an hour, while helping school districts retain experienced staff year after year.
The Republican and DFL co-chairs of the House Education Finance Committee on Monday presented a budget agreement (HF1388) that provides additional funding for school districts to pay for unemployment benefits in the coming year but repeals the benefits in four years.
Democrats tried to amend the education budget bill to maintain unemployment benefits for hourly school workers, but the effort failed on a tie vote in the evenly divided committee. The budget was then laid over to be taken up by the House Ways and Means Committee.
House Education Finance Committee Co-Chair Rep. Cheryl Youkim, DFL-Hopkins, called agreeing to eliminate the benefits her “biggest disappointment” during Monday’s hearing and said she hopes they can find a way to retain it going forward.
Setting the repeal date so far in the future means Democrats could reverse course again and keep the benefits going if they win back control of government.
But some Democrats say they aren’t willing to vote for the deal and bank on a strong election in 2026, which means the issue could divide the DFL House and Senate caucuses and become a key sticking point in budget negotiations over the next three weeks.
The Legislature is set to adjourn May 19; they need to pass a budget by June 30 to keep the government open.
More than half a dozen House Democrats held a news conference on Friday with hourly school workers during which they blasted Republicans for demanding a repeal of the benefits long afforded other seasonal workers like those in construction.
“This is a line-in-the-sand moment for Democrats,” said Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, who authored the bill in the 2023 legislative session.
Kristen Scott, who’s worked as a special education paraprofessional for 20 years in the Elk River School District, said the unemployment benefits have helped her stay afloat during the summer months, when full-time work in schools is hard to come by.
“It also allows us to continue to come back each year to do the important job of helping all of our children thrive,” Scott said. “Cutting unemployment benefits will force many in my field to seek other full-time jobs, leaving our kids wondering who will be there to care for them year after year.”
School districts haven’t had to pay anything toward unemployment benefits because the Minnesota Legislature created a $135 million fund to cover the costs until 2027 or the funds ran out.
Benefits cost an estimated $45 million in 2023 and $57 million in 2024, according to the Minnesota Department of Education. That leaves about half of what’s expected to be needed to pay for the benefits this summer.
Gov. Tim Walz has proposed shoring up the fund with $30 million for this summer to help districts cover the cost, and a DFL-led Senate proposal would provide an additional $70 million the following year.
After that, school districts would have to factor in the cost of unemployment into their regular budgets.
Greenman said they passed the bill in 2023 with the expectation that school districts would eventually pick up the cost without state aid.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-67-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) WEST DES MOINES — Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig announced Monday the state agriculture department invested in 14 urban water quality projects, including one that backs up to the historic Jordan House where he spoke. 
The project in West Des Moines will add bioretention cells, or rain gardens, native plants and a stormwater wetland to the Legacy Woods Nature Sanctuary, as part of its plan to expand to include trails and recreation for the public. This will help to capture and clean stormwater runoff before it reaches Jordan Creek and Raccoon River. 
“Our investment, on the part of the department, is focused on water quality, but we know that projects like this also provide other values for the community, and we love those layered benefits of education and recreation and cultural preservation,” Naig said.

He said the cost-share grants announced are another way to adhere to the state’s Nutrient Reduction Strategy and said visible urban projects like the one at Legacy Woods can be inspiring to visitors. 
“I hope it’ll inspire folks who spend time here to consider what they might do on their own property, but also other cities can come and see how this can be incorporated into the landscape,” Naig said. 
Russ Trimble, mayor of West Des Moines, said he was proud of his city’s continued efforts to improve and preserve its natural resources. 
“Water quality improvements aren’t just the responsibility of rural Iowa farmers,” Trimble said. “It’s incumbent upon all of us to do our part to clean up and improve our water.” 
The grants cover up to 50% of each of the 14 projects and are funded, in part, through the state Water Quality Initiative. IDALS invested $250,000 into the wetland project in West Des Moines and overall invested nearly $2.7 million for all of the projects. 
Including the local matches, the urban water quality projects will leverage more than $5.7 million for projects located in: Algona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Cedar Rapids, Clear Lake, Clinton, Decorah, Des Moines, Dunlap, Durant, Evansdale, Mount Ayr, Oskaloosa and West Des Moines.
Projects range from adding permeable parking lots and pavers to infrastructure, landscaping with oxbows and rain gardens or using native species and wetlands to filter runoff water. 
Naig made the announcement during Iowa Soil and Water Conservation week, and said all Iowans have a role to play in soil and water conservation, regardless of where they live or what type of property they own.  
“There’s certainly more work to do, but we’re seeing progress towards achieving our Nutrient Reduction Strategy goals,” Naig said. “Projects like this make a difference.”

Shri Thanedar speaks at his election night party in Detroit on Aug. 6, 2024 | Ken ColemanMichigan Congressman Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) on Monday brought seven articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, saying the president has “repeatedly demonstrated that he is unfit to serve,” and “represents a clear and present danger to our nation’s constitution and our democracy.”
In a statement from Thanedar’s office, he pointed to “sweeping abuse of power, flagrant violations of the Constitution and acts of tyranny that undermine American democracy and threaten the rule of law” as his reasons for introducing the charges. 
“[Trump’s] unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service. We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act,” Thanedar said. 
Each article alleges a separate violation of the Constitution, with Thanedar’s office offering the following breakdown of his resolution:

 Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Executive Power: Including denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, and misuse of the Department of Justice.
Usurpation of Appropriations Power: For dismantling congressionally established agencies and impounding federal funds.
Abuse of Trade Powers and International Aggression: Including imposing economically damaging tariffs and threatening military invasion against sovereign nations.
Violation of First Amendment Rights: Through retaliatory actions against critics, media and attorneys exercising constitutionally protected speech.
Creation of an Unlawful Office: By establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and unlawfully empowering Elon Musk to unilaterally violate the Constitution.
Bribery and Corruption: Involving dismissing criminal cases, soliciting foreign emoluments, and extortionate settlements for personal and political gain.
Tyrannical Overreach: Seeking to consolidate unchecked power, erode civil liberties, and defy constitutional limits on presidential authority.

“This is not about partisanship. It’s about protecting our democracy and ensuring that no one, not even a President, is above the law,” Thanedar said in a statement. 
Thanedar’s effort is likely to face an uphill battle in the House, where Republicans hold a seven seat majority. The Senate, which conducts the trial should the resolution receive a majority of votes in the House, is also held by Republicans, with a two-thirds vote needed in order to convict the president. 
Thanedar’s introduction of the articles comes the same day that his second primary opponent, state Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit), announced he would seek his 13th District seat in the 2026 primary.

Collectively, they form the financial linchpin to the state’s next budget and would generate the revenue needed to erase a chunk of a shortfall Ferguson has pegged at $16 billion over the next four fiscal years. The tax package is expected to net around $9.4 billion over that time.
Democrats drew up the bills. They used their majorities in the House and Senate to pass them over the opposition of Republicans and a few moderate Democrats.
It is not known if the first-term Democratic governor will sign them all. He rejected Democrats’ recent $12 billion package as unsustainable and too risky.
Before that, Ferguson stated his objections publicly to relying on a novel wealth tax that was an original cornerstone of Democratic lawmakers’ approaches. So it got set aside.
He shared his dislike privately of raising the cap on annual property tax growth. It disappeared. As did a payroll tax on large companies.
Below is a breakdown of five tax bills heading to the governor, which would help pay for spending in the two-year $77.8 billion state operating budget lawmakers approved. These measures do not cover the slate of tax and fee increases legislators are relying on for the separate transportation budget.
House Bill 2081 is the most far-reaching, affecting an estimated 191,000 taxpayers, per the latest fiscal analysis. It is projected to bring in the most money of the tax bills, nearly $2.1 billion for the next budget and $5.6 billion over four years. That covers roughly a third of the shortfall.
It permanently increases the state’s two primary business and occupation tax rates on gross proceeds — 0.471% and 0.484% — to 0.5%, starting Jan. 1, 2027. Another provision of House Bill 2081 boosts the tax rate for service businesses with annual taxable revenue exceeding $5 million from 1.75% to 2.1%. 
Financial institutions with annual net income of $1 billion or more would see the rate for an additional tax they pay rise from 1.2% to 1.5% starting Oct. 1. This will impact about 200 businesses, Democrats have said. 
About 400 corporations with more than $250 million in annual revenue would be subject to a 0.5% surcharge for three years starting Jan. 1, 2026. That extra would be levied on amounts above the $250 million threshold. Among those exempted from that surcharge is Boeing. 
There’s also a major change in a levy on technology companies that goes directly toward higher education, including student financial aid. The “advanced computing surcharge” applies to firms with global revenue above $25 billion — think Microsoft and Amazon. It would raise the tax rate from 1.22% to 7.5% and boost a cap on payments from $9 million to $75 million. 
Senate Bill 5814, the other major money-maker for the state, is counted on to raise $1.1 billion for the next budget and $2.7 billion over four years. It would do so by applying the retail sales tax to more services, such as temporary staffing, advertising, security and lobbying. The change would occur Oct. 1 and affect an estimated 35,000 firms, according to a Department of Revenue analysis.
It also contains a provision to begin taxing certain products with nicotine, like Zyn pouches. If it becomes law, this new tax takes effect Jan. 1, 2026.
And an estimated $1.1 billion will flow into coffers of local governments around the state since they receive a share of sales tax.
Senate Bill 5813 will add a layer to the capital gains tax. In addition to the existing 7% tax on gains over $270,000 from the sale or exchange of long-term assets like stocks, bonds and business interests, the bill tacks on another 2.9% for gains exceeding $1 million. About 900 taxpayers would be impacted.
The bill also makes revisions in the state’s estate tax — a tax on the right to transfer property at the time of death. Rates would increase, but the value of property excluded from the tax would climb to $3 million, up from the current $2.1 million. Lawmakers assume this legislation will generate $321.6 million for the next budget, and slightly less in the one after that.
Senate Bill 5794 seeks to bring in revenue by getting rid of tax breaks that the Department of Revenue estimates are used by 15,000 taxpayers. These changes are counted on to bring in $148.5 million for the next budget, according to budget documents.
Among the many tax preferences targeted for elimination are ones exempting sales of precious metal bullion. Another change would make operators of self-service storage facilities begin to pay taxes on the renting or leasing of individual units.
House Bill 2077 would begin taxing the sale of electric vehicle credits between automakers. This has been dubbed the “Tesla tax” because the firm led by Elon Musk is the only automaker with credits to sell in Washington. This brand-new tax is projected to generate $54.5 million for the operating budget.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/money-closuep-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

Keith Jackson, a Democratic lawmaker from Kemper County, can remain in office despite a felony indictment by participating in a pre-trial intervention program, according to court documents. 
A grand jury last year indicted Jackson, a first-term House member, on charges of receiving stolen property – specifically, a 2006 Magnolia timber trailer worth about $15,000. The grand jury also indicted two other people, Fredwrick (sic) Young and William Tate, in connection with the criminal charges. 
Jackson did not respond to a request for comment, and his attorney, Christopher Collins, declined to comment. 
Cassie Colman, the district attorney in the 10th circuit district, told Mississippi Today that the state agreed to let Jackson participate in pretrial intervention because he had no prior criminal record. If Jackson completes the terms of the pre-trial agreement, then the criminal charges will be expunged from his record. 
Going to trial would likely be risky for the lawmaker because, if convicted of the offense, he could lose the right to hold elected office. 
Receiving stolen property is a disenfranchising crime in Mississippi, and if someone is convicted of a disenfranchising crime, they lose their right to vote. To run for office in Mississippi, someone must be a registered voter. 
But Coleman, who prosecuted the case against Jackson, said the legislator’s agreement to enter the program is neither a guilty plea nor a conviction. Instead, he will enroll in the intervention program for at least a year and pay around $3,350 in fees, according to court documents. 
If he fails to meet the terms of the agreement, the district attorney could remove him from the program and prosecute him for the original crime.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/28134326/jackson_45th.jpg,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

Speaking Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press”, Sanders was asked about Slotkin’s suggestion in an interview with Politico that Democrats needed to fight back against the perception that they are “weak and woke” and stop using the term “oligarchy” when criticizing Trump and his allies, such as billionaire Elon Musk, and instead say they are opposed to “kings.”

“Well, jeez, we had 36,000 people out in Los Angeles, 34,000 people in Colorado. We had 30,000 people in Folsom, California, which is kind of a rural area,” Sanders said, referencing recent “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies he and fellow progressive, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), has hosted in opposition to Trump administration policies.
“I think the American people are not quite as dumb as Ms. Slotkin thinks they are,” Sanders said.
A request for comment was made to Slotkin’s office by the Michigan Advance, but has yet to be returned.
Slotkin, who won her Senate seat in 2024 by less than 20,000 votes out of more than 5 million cast, has made her political career out of winning tight races in districts and states that otherwise supported Trump.
Her rising star in the party was exemplified by Slotkin’s selection to give the Democratic response to Trump’s address to Congress in March.

However, in his “Meet the Press” interview, Sanders, who drew an estimated 10,000 supporters in early March to Lincoln High School in Warren, Michigan, said an acknowledgment was necessary about the nature of the forces championing policies that have deepened the nation’s economic inequality.   
“The very rich getting richer, working class people are struggling, 800,000 people sleeping out on the streets. If we don’t address that issue, the American people will continue to turn their backs on democracy because they’re looking around them and they’re saying, ‘Does anybody understand what I am going through?’ And unfortunately, right now, to a large degree, neither party does,” Sanders said.
Slotkin, posting on the social media platform X on Friday, said Democrats needed more than rhetoric if they hope to win against Republicans.

The portal[...],"South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden reads the title of a bill he signed in Sioux Falls on March 17, 2025. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)State employees in South Dakota will soon have a secure web portal to submit allegations of misbehavior by their coworkers.
Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order telling the state Bureau of Human Resources and Administration and the Bureau of Information and Telecommunications to create a “secure standard reporting mechanism” for employees. The portal will deliver reports of malfeasance to the state’s auditor and attorney general.
The order also requires supervisors and encourages employees to submit such reports, and directs the human resources department to conduct training in ethics and use of the portal.
The order is an outgrowth of Senate bills 62 and 63, which tightened the state’s internal controls after a series of 2024 scandals involving former state employees. 
Governor prevails in dispute over penalties for supervisors who stay silent on misdeeds

One such employee, Lonna Carroll, used her position at the Department of Social Services to illegally collect nearly $1.8 million over the course of 13 years. A jury found Carroll guilty of grand theft earlier this month.
Other former employees stood accused of forging vehicle registrations, falsifying food service inspections and using foster family food service vouchers for themselves.
Representatives for Rhoden and Attorney General Marty Jackley sparred during the 2025 legislative session over whether supervisors should face felony charges for failure to report state employee misdeeds. 
Rhoden’s office argued supervisors should face misdemeanor rather than felony charges, particularly if the unreported employee misbehavior isn’t felonious in nature. The kerfuffle over that provision in SB 62 forced multiple rounds of debate, one of which appeared to doom the bill before a revival effort the following day. In the end, lawmakers narrowly sided with Rhoden.
In a press release announcing the creation of the online reporting system, Rhoden wrote that the executive branch took “decisive action” to address the rash of corruption cases.
“Under my leadership, South Dakota will have a government that is accountable and responsible with taxpayer dollars, and this executive order is an important step forward,” he wrote.

“I take issue with what was said last week,” she told her Democratic colleagues at the beginning of the Senate’s business on Monday afternoon. “We may not hold the majority, but we have something just as powerful — a vision, rooted in fairness, in justice, in equality, and in care.”
Her caucus elected Berman on Thursday afternoon, shortly after Pizzo stunningly announced on the floor of the Senate that he was leaving the Florida Democratic Party and would instead become a non-party-affiliated (NPA) voter.
“I am very disappointed about the way things unfolded last week,” Berman acknowledged in a conference call with reporters earlier in the day. 
“I can’t believe with one week left in session we had this huge disruption. But I am moving on, and I think that’s what we in the Democratic Party need to do. I feel that our Democratic Caucus here in the Senate — ‘The Tenacious Ten’ — we are more unified than ever. We are ready to finish this session strong. We are ready to make sure our Democratic values get heard in the bills that we pass. We will be fighting bad bills. We will be making sure that we get appropriations that are impactful for our districts at home.”
She added that she considers herself a unifier.
“I want all my members to shine, and that is going to be my goal, to make sure that each member of our caucus has the opportunity to move forward and do the job that we were are all elected to do, to represent the people of our districts.”
Pizzo’s resignation was the latest in a series of devastating blows that the Florida Democratic Party has suffered in recent years. The party fell into superminority status in both the state House and Senate after the 2022 elections — in which its candidates for governor lost by 19 points and for U.S. Senate by 16 points.
A year earlier, the Republican Party for the first time took the lead in voter registrations in Florida, a lead that has since increased to more than 1.2 million voters. Then, after the Democrats failed to win back any new seats in the Legislature last fall, they saw their numbers in the Florida House dwindle by two more last December to just 33 in the 120-member body after Hillsborough County Rep. Susan Valdés, and then South Florida’s Hillary Cassel, announced that they were ditching the Democrats to go Republican.
Criticism
With Pizzo’s departure and the death of Orange County Sen. Geraldine Thompson before the session began in March, there are now just 10 Democrats in the 40-member Senate.
In announcing his resignation, Pizzo said that the “Florida Democratic Party is dead,” adding that “there are good people that can resuscitate it, but they don’t want it to be me.”
Pizzo added more criticism of his now-former party over the weekend.
“I’ve spent thousands of hours trying to resuscitate something that’s just not there, and we just got so consumed with taking the bait and the opportunity cost lost with going ahead and going down a rabbit hole of socially divisive issues that — there was no plan. If you go on whether it’s the state [web] site or a local site as it relates to party, there’s no policies. There’s no plan,” Pizzo said in an interview aired Sunday on WPLG television in Miami. “There’s just a lot of anger and a lot of hate — which I understand, because it’s been a generation of Republican control.”
Berman and House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell disputed that assessment.
“Unfortunately, we had to be reactive in past years because there were so many bad bills that came through and so much policy that you had to react to, but I think we clearly have an agenda,” Berman said. “Our agenda is to help the working people here in the state of Florida. To make sure that people can get access to health care. To support public education. To make sure that we have a clean environment for everyone to flourish.”
Driskell said that in fact what she calls the party’s “platform bills” have been focused on making life better for everyday Floridians, not on culture war issues.
“They focused on making housing more affordable,  expanding Medicaid so we can help health care be more affordable for all of us, protecting our drinking water and our natural resources. Focusing on commonsense gun solutions, gun reform. … We focus on protecting workers, we focus on investing in our kids in terms of public education, so those are the issues that we center on, but please understand that, as a party of opposition, where we have to stand up and fight for the Constitution and fight for the least among us, we will do it at every time.”
Hope Florida
Berman and Driskell later focused on developments in the saga revolving around Hope Florida, the welfare program started by First Lady Casey DeSantis, which has dominated the second half of the legislative session in terms of news coverage.
A House committee announced last week that it was ending its investigation into reports of $10 million going to the Hope Florida Foundation from a state Medicaid overpayment settlement. Much of that $10 million was later sent to a political committee run by James Uthmeier, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ former chief-of-staff (now state attorney general), that was working to combat last year’s referendum on recreational cannabis.
“I don’t think this issue will fade,” Berman said, “because when everybody goes home to their districts over the summer, they are going to hear about this issue and I really believe that … we need to continue to investigate this issue. It should not be allowed to go without a response, whether it’s a legal response or whether it’s a political response, but we should never allow this kind of graft to happen in our state of Florida.”
Boca Raton Democratic Rep. Kelly Skidmore said that Gov. DeSantis certainly hopes that the controversy over Hope Florida will fade.
“That is why he is going so hard after his own Republican colleagues, because he wants them to be afraid and not focused on this fraud that was perpetrated on taxpayers.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/0-1-1024x598.png,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

(Image via Maine Legislature live stream)A Republican lawmaker who had been censured by her legislative peers for posting personal information about a transgender student on her official social media account is taking her fight to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Rep. Laurel Libby of Auburn said she filed the petition Monday after the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied her motion for an expedited appeal to end the censure by the Maine House of Representatives.
“For over 60 days, my constituents have had no say in actions taken by their government, actions that directly impact their lives,” Libby said in a press release. “Every vote taken on the floor of the legislature is a vote my constituents cannot get back. The good people of our district have been silenced and disenfranchised.”
On Feb. 25, the House voted 75-70 to formally reprimand Libby, preventing her from speaking or voting until she apologizes for the post, which she has so far declined to do.
The post, which included the name, photograph and other details about a transgender student athlete, drew national attention. Days later, President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding to Maine over the state’s transgender policy, arguing it is in violation of federal anti-discrimination protections. Since then, the state has been subject to several funding cuts and probes, culminating in a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Libby is arguing that the censure is a violation of her First Amendment right. Additionally, Libby’s lawsuit against Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) and House Clerk Robert Hunt asserts that their sanction is a violation of her constituents’ right to free speech and that it disenfranchises the voters by depriving them of legislative representation.
On Friday, Justice Melissa DuBois of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine denied Libby’s request for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the censure, arguing that legislative immunity — which largely protects lawmakers from being sued for strictly legislative acts — shields Fecteau and Hunt from the claims in the case.
While acknowledging that the ability to suspend an elected representative’s privileges to speak or vote on the House floor “is a weighty sword to wield,” DuBois determined Fecteau’s actions “ultimately reflected the will of the majority of the House members” and that the sanction “is not of such extraordinary character as to obliterate the formidable shield the courts have provided to legislative acts.”
There have only been four censures in the Maine Legislature since 1820 and three of them — including the ongoing censure of Libby — have come in the past year and a half under Democratic majorities. The first censure was an independent from Auburn in 2001.
Libby appealed that ruling to the 1st Circuit Court, which on Monday denied her motion for an expedited ruling, according to Maine Public.
Seeking immediate intervention, Libby filed an emergency request with the U.S. Supreme Court and said while the broader case continues through the appeals process, she is “hopeful the court will act swiftly” to end the censure.

Free.,Trump border czar defends removal of U.S. citizen children,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-border-czar-defends-removal-us-citizen-children,,"WASHINGTON — White House border czar Tom Homan on Monday blamed the parents of U.S. citizen children the Trump administration sent to Honduras over the weekend.At a Monday morning press conference, Homan defended the government’s actions to remove three young children from two different families alongside their mothers who were in the country without legal authorization but participated in a program that allows otherwise law-abiding migrants to stay in their communities.“If you enter this country illegally, it’s a crime,” Homan said. “Knowing you’re in this country illegally, you put yourself in that position. You put your family in that position.”The children, all under the age of 10, were placed on deportation flights to Honduras on Friday after their mothers checked in with a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in New Orleans as part of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, which allows immigrants to stay in their communities while undergoing immigration court proceedings.An attorney for one of the children, Gracie Willis at the National Immigration Project, said the 4-year-old U.S. citizen with Stage 4 cancer was deported without access to his medication.Homan has argued the mothers requested to be deported with their children, but attorneys for the families argue they were “denied access to legal counsel, and swiftly deported without due process.”Due process concernsU.S. District Judge Terry Doughty, whom Trump appointed to a seat on the Louisiana federal bench in 2018, expressed concern that a 2-year-old U.S. citizen had been deported, despite her father’s wishes she remain in the U.S., according to court filings.Doughty scheduled a May 16 hearing because of his “strong suspicion that the government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.”“The government contends that this is all okay because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her,” Doughty wrote in his order. “But the court doesn’t know that.”Willis, from the National Immigration Project, raised concerns about a lack of due process and how the deportations have separated families.“What we saw from ICE over the last several days is horrifying and baffling,” she said in a statement. “These mothers had no opportunity to speak with their co-parents to make the kinds of choices that parents are entitled to make for their children, the kinds of decisions that millions of parents make every day: ‘what is best for our child?’”Homan has argued the children were deported at the request of the mothers and that the Trump administration was “keeping families together.”“What we did is remove children with their mothers who requested their children depart with them,” he said. “When a parent says, ‘I want my 2-year-old baby to go with me,’ we made that happen. They weren't deported. We don't deport U.S. citizens. The parents made that decision, not the United States government.”Wisconsin judgeMonday’s remarks from Homan come the day before President Donald Trump will mark the 100th day of his second term. His early days in office have centered on carrying out his campaign promise of mass deportations of millions of people in the U.S. without permanent legal status.Trump will sign two executive orders on immigration late Monday: one relating to border security and another to require the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to publicly list so-called sanctuary cities that do not coordinate with federal immigration law enforcement.Homan also stood by the Trump administration’s decision to arrest a federal judge in Wisconsin on the grounds she obstructed immigration officials from detaining a man attending his court hearing. It marked an escalation between the Trump administration and the judiciary branch, raising concerns from Democrats.The arrest of Judge Hannah Dugan was highly publicized after she was handcuffed in public and FBI Director Kash Patel bragged about the arrest on social media.Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Fox News that the Trump administration was going to continue to go after judges who “think they’re above the law.”“When you cross that line to impediment or knowingly harboring, concealing an illegal alien from ICE, you will be prosecuted, judge or not,” Homan said.",,,,2025-04-28 15:13:12.486537

Sara Attleson is the new chair of the Democratic Party of New Mexico, according to voting results announced on Sunday.
Attleson, of Albuquerque, chairs the party’s Labor Caucus, as well as the Albuquerque Teachers Federation’s Committee on Political Education. She defeated Marisol Enriquez, Letitia Montoya and Joseph Weathers to lead the party. Former Chair Jessica Velasquez did not seek reelection.
Attleson said in a statement she wants to work with county-level Democratic parties “to make sure we have a presence in every community.”
“Democrats across the country have our work cut out for us,” she said in a statement. “But here in New Mexico, we have the energy to make sure that MAGA Republicans and Donald Trump are never able to get a foothold here.”
DPNM announced the results at the spring meeting of its governing body, the State Central Committee, at the Albuquerque Little Theater following voting by 466 SCC members via online absentee ballot from April 19-26. The new party officers’ terms end in 2027.
Party members elected Cameron Crawford as vice chair. Crawford, of Santa Fe, defeated incumbent Manny Crespin and Augustine Montoya to win the seat.
“In an era of unprecedented political turmoil, I will go to counties red and blue to rebuild community by showing up for everyone, regardless of who they vote for,” Crawford said in a statement. “Politics is about making people’s lives better, and I’m more than prepared to take that message far and wide.”
The party elected Brenda Hoskie as its treasurer. Hoskie, from Springstead, is an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation and chair of the McKinley County Democrats. She defeated Daniel Alfredo Garcia and Barbara Jordan to become secretary.
Members elected Julie Rochman as Secretary. Rochman, of Albuquerque, defeated Joseph Ortiz to become treasurer.
The Republican Party of New Mexico elected its party officers in December.

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Fire Administration)The state of South Dakota will spend up to $250,000 to clear PFAS chemicals from local areas in the coming year.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS or “forever chemicals,” break down at an exceedingly slow rate in the natural environment. They’re found in products like nonstick cookware, water-resistant items like umbrellas or rain jackets, and cleaning products, among other items. 
Concerns about their prevalence in the environment and their impacts on human health have grown steadily in recent years, as they’ve been discovered in drinking water, fish and food packaging.
SD House defeats bill requiring ‘forever chemical’ labels on firefighting gear

PFAS are also found in a kind of firefighting foam that’s fallen out of favor, but fire departments around the U.S., including in South Dakota, still have some and need to dispose of it.
The South Dakota Board of Water and Natural Resources awarded a $250,000 Solid Waste Management grant to the state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR) last month to help communities collect and dispose of some PFAS sources. The citizen-led water resources board evaluates projects and signs off on funding through the solid waste program.
The grant will allow fire departments with PFAS foam, or schools whose science labs may still have chemicals, to summon the department’s contractor to collect and safely dispose of them at an out-of-state location. The state will also reach out directly to agencies, and has begun to contact fire departments, airports, and other public entities by phone to find out if they have PFAS for disposal.
The money comes from the Inspection, Compliance, and Remediation program, funded by a mix of fuel tank inspection fees and the sale of lottery tickets. Typically, cleanup grants through the program cover 80% of cleanup costs, with the entity requesting cleanup expected to cover the rest.
The South Dakota Legislature approved Senate Bill 33 this year to let DANR put $250,000 of program funds toward PFAS cleanups with no local match.
Andy Bruels with the DANR told the water resources board in March that a previous PFAS cleanup a few years ago cleaned up “a fair amount of material.” The contractor hauled it out of state for disposal, as typical landfills can’t adequately prevent the chemicals from continued seepage into the environment.
The legislation also allowed for the grants to be used in waste tire cleanup, but Bruels said the primary focus will be PFAS and that it’s unlikely much will be left for that secondary purpose.

(Photo courtesy of FEMA)Attorney General James Uthmeier settled a suit Monday accusing the former Federal Emergency Management Agency head and a FEMA supervisor of discrimination against supporters of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump during disaster relief efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton.
The suit came in November, after the supervisor advised relief workers in Florida to avoid houses displaying yard signs favoring Trump in Lake Placid, in Highlands County. Uthmeier agreed to drop the suit in exchange for an apologetic letter on behalf of the federal government, according to the notice of dismissal filed Monday.
“The United States and Ms. Criswell regret the actions giving rise to this case and agree with the State of Florida that those actions never should have occurred,” the letter states. “We are also hopeful that, in light of all we have provided, the State of Florida and its people can be confident that FEMA is striving to avoid a repeat of the events giving rise to this case and that the agency is committed to the fair, compassionate, and even-handed delivery of services.”
The letter from the U.S. Department of Justice also states that FEMA commits to providing political-discrimination training for employees.
Deanne Criswell, the former FEMA head, didn’t admit wrongdoing, and the letter directs responsibility to Marn’i Washington, the supervisor. As part of the settlement, Criswell and the state agreed to pay their own attorney fees, and Uthmeier also dropped the claims against Washington.
Former Attorney General Ashley Moody, whom Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed to the U.S. Senate, originally sought nominal and punitive damages from Criswell and Washington.
Criswell announced on Nov. 9 that the agency had fired Washington and called her behavior a clear violation of FEMA’s core values and principles. Moody’s complaint cited multiple interviews in which Washington said the message she sent to the relief workers, which the Daily Wire published, lacked context and that her supervisors knew about and encouraged her decision to avoid the homes of Trump supporters.
In a letter to the federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Washington wrote that she had received numerous death threats and that she didn’t have knowledge of the suit for months.
“The effort for scapegoating at my expense has methodically been implemented to the point that all of my inquiries and fair treatment throughout this process has been negated and intentionally delayed,” Washington wrote to U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks.
Uthmeier’s office did not immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.

(Photo provided by the Indiana Department of Correction)Clemency hearings for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie will take place in the coming weeks as the condemned man’s legal team fights to delay — or stop altogether — a pending May 20 execution.
Ritchie’s clemency petition, signed by the inmate on April 22, argued that he was “born with a severely damaged brain due to prenatal alcohol exposure.”
 Benjamin Ritchie (Mugshot from the Indiana Department of Correction)
“His mother drank nearly every day during her pregnancy with Ben. She also smoked marijuana daily and took other drugs,” according to the filing. Lawyers additionally noted that a geneticist diagnosed Ritchie with Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS), “meaning his brain damage limits Ben’s functioning to that similar to a person with intellectual disability.”
Ritchie’s team further pointed a recent ruling handed down by the Indiana Supreme Court in which justices “unanimously agreed that Ben has brain damage caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol and other toxins.” But the court was split, 2-2, on whether Ritchie should be allowed to present evidence “of the effect of that damage on his behavior” on the night of his crime.
With clemency, the governor — in tandem with Indiana’s Parole Board — can elect to commute a death sentence to life imprisonment or grant a pardon for a criminal offense.
The parole board announced two upcoming clemency hearings for Ritchie to consider his petition: one on May 5 at the Indiana State Prison, located in Michigan City; and another on May 12 at the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis.
Both meetings are open to the public. The parole board will conduct a 10 a.m. interview with Ritchie at the state prison hearing. During the latter meeting, the board will hear testimony in favor of clemency from 9 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., and testimony opposed to clemency from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
The developments follow a ruling issued earlier this month by Indiana Supreme Court justices to set a May 20 execution date for Ritchie, who was convicted in 2002 for killing a law enforcement officer from Beech Grove.
What to expect
The Indiana Constitution gives the governor exclusive authority to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons for all offenses — including capital crimes — except for treason and impeachment. The parole board is tasked by state law with assisting in that process.
The five-member board, specifically, is responsible for conducting an investigation into the merits of a clemency petition. 
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Shortly after an execution date is set, the board sets a schedule for the filing of clemency petition; submission of supporting materials; an interview and psychiatric examination of the death row inmate; a public hearing; and a public announcement of the parole board’s recommendation.
Story continues below.
Benjamin Ritchie Petition for Clemency (compressed)
 
Members of the press and the general public are permitted to attend the inmate’s interview. 
The subsequent public hearing typically takes place two or three days prior to the execution date and is held in the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis.
Each side — the state and counsel for the death row inmate — is given 90 minutes to present their case for or against clemency. The parole board presides over the hearing, and frequently interjects with questions.
Once complete, board members individually submit their recommendations to the governor, who has final say over the matter.
Defense team seeks a stay
In a separate legal filing last week, Ritchie’s defense team petitioned the state supreme court for a new hearing to reconsider the inmate’s request for post-conviction relief.
They’re also seeking a stay to pause the execution altogether “to permit the full and fair consideration of the issues presented” in the rehearing request. Ritchie’s latest petition, attorneys emphasized, “has asserted unusually complex questions of fact and law that would be aided by oral argument or further briefing on the issues if the Court allows.”
The high court denied Ritchie any post-conviction relief in a decision issued April 15, following a series of exhausted appeals previously filed by the inmate and his legal team.



In 2004, former Indiana Gov. Joe Kernan commuted the death sentence of Darnell Williams to life imprisonment without parole on the basis that his co-defendant initially received a life sentence, making it “unjust” to execute only Williams.
Kernan, a Democrat, commuted another death sentence in 2005 of Michael Daniels, emphasizing doubts about Daniels’ personal responsibility for the crime and the quality of legal process leading to his death sentence.
The most recent was in 2009, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels commuted the death sentence for Arthur Baird, who killed his pregnant wife and her parents in 1985. Although the parole board denied his petition for clemency, Mitch Daniels granted Baird clemency one day before the scheduled execution, in part citing questions about Baird’s sanity.
The former Republican governor additionally noted that life without parole in murder cases was not an option at the time of Baird’s sentencing; it became an option in 1994.



Included in the post-conviction filings were claims that his trial and post-conviction counsel “provided ineffective assistance” by not investigating Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and by failing to “analyze the effect of Ritchie’s childhood exposure to excessive amounts of lead.”
Additionally, counsel emphasized that Ritchie was only 20 years old at the time of the crime, and “recent developments in the law” require the state supreme court to consider his age at sentencing. Ritchie’s team held, too, that the state “engaged in prosecutorial misconduct” throughout his jury trial.
Chief Justice Loretta Rush, who disagreed with the decision to deny further post-conviction relief proceedings, said in her opinion that she believed evidence submitted to the court suggested “a strong likelihood” that Ritchie suffered from FASD when he murdered William Toney, the police officer, in 2000.
Indiana Supreme Court sets May 20 execution date for death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie

Rush noted that Ritchie had recently been evaluated by two FASD experts, and she preferred to hold off on an execution date so the court has more time to “receive and consider” the experts’ evaluations.
But Justices Derek Molter and Geoffrey Slaughter said in their opinion that “what Ritchie’s experts turned up is irrelevant.” The issue before the court “is not whether Ritchie suffered from FASD in 2000 or whether he does so today,” they said. Rather, the justices must decide whether Ritchie’s trial lawyers “were constitutionally ineffective during sentencing for failing to investigate the possibility that Ritchie suffered from FASD then.”
The affirming justices maintained that Ritchie was unable to show a “reasonable possibility” of relief. 
Per court documents, the underlying crime began as a police pursuit of a stolen van on Sept. 29, 2000. Toney, the Beech Grove police officer, later pursued Ritchie on foot. Ritchie ultimately fired four shots at Toney, who did not survive the shooting.
The court set a Monday afternoon deadline for Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office to respond to the defense counsel’s motions.
The Republican attorney general requested an execution date for Ritchie last fall.
Executions were put on hold for 15 years in Indiana until convicted killer Joseph Corcoran was put to death in December. The state paid $900,000 on execution drugs but won’t say how much was purchased. 
Ritchie and six other men remain on the state’s death row at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.

“As it relates to cannabis markets, Missouri is pretty famously the model to follow,” said Mackenzie Slade, CEO and owner of New York-based Cannabis Public Policy Consulting. “So I’m very interested in doing a super deep dive.”
In March, the state issued a request for proposals looking for a vendor to conduct a cannabis market and economic impact study. Currently, Missouri has issued nearly 400 cannabis licenses to operate full-scale cultivation and manufacturing facilities and dispensaries. The state will also eventually have 144 microbusiness licenses, which are limited in size and scope and meant to benefit disadvantaged business owners.

In 2024, Missouri sold$1.46 billion in total marijuana sales in the state’s second year of adult-use marijuana, outperforming states with a longer history of marijuana legalization like Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.
The results of the study will help the state determine “whether or when the state will be required to issue additional cannabis facility licenses and, if so, how many, where, and of what type,” according to a March press release from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
Missouri received three responses that fit the requirements of having at least five years of experience specializing in the economic impact of marijuana, or at least 10 years of experience conducting economic impact studies in general.
The responding agencies were Slade’s firm, St. Louis-based Capital Consulting Services and Oregon-based Whitney Economics. The firm that wins the bid will be awarded the $X million contract. 
Beau Whitney’s company, which conducts studies globally, gathers data monthly on the cannabis industry for each legal state on business licenses, supply capacity and revenues. 
“I have data that goes back multiple years,” he said, “and so I can say, ‘Here’s the progression of the state and its program,’” along with providing future projections 10 years out. 
Whitney calls Missouri a “success story.” In one of his recent reports that looked at investment potential nationwide, he found there’s still opportunities for growth, development and investment into the Missouri market. 
“And that’s unusual,” he said. “In Oregon where I’m based out of, I just gave an update to the Office of Economic Analysis and I basically said, there’s no investment opportunity in Oregon for any new businesses. Zero for the next 10 years.”
That’s because there’s too much supply, an over saturation of licenses and prices are so low that people can’t make any profit, he said. 
“My goal with Missouri is to give them the data that they need to avoid that scenario,” Whitney said.
Slade has seen the same in New York, where her firm has been based for about seven years. 
Her company administers a national survey on cannabis use, which essentially measures and quantifies demand behavior for consumers. One of the things that they use it for, she said, at a national level is to try to understand how states are performing based on their policies. 
“And Missouri continuously outperforms other states, relative to their date of sale,” she said. “…because they were able to stand up a market so quickly.”
Secrecy around ownership records raises questions about Missouri marijuana networks

That was in part because Missouri limited the number of licenses to get operational within just a few months. For the study, Slade proposed to use the state’s track and trace data to identify the efficiencies of the licenses. 
“That’s a prime example of where we would uncover some extremely important considerations for policy,” she said. “And I do believe that the intent of the study is to identify areas of policy that need to be updated.”
Tracey Jeffries’ company, Capital Consulting Services, has helped governments with economic feasibility studies for 15 years on a state and federal level, and she’s a certified Missouri minority-owned business enterprise as a Black woman owner. According to state policy, winners of any state contract must employ 10% minority-owned and 5% women-owned businesses. 
The advantage Jeffries believes she brings to the program is knowing her state and its economy, having led projects throughout Missouri. 
“DHSS has done a great job,” she said, “but it’s timely to have the feasibility study because this will benefit the regulators, the businesses, and most importantly to me, in my opinion, the community.”
State law says the cannabis regulators may “lift or ease any limit on the number of [cannabis] licensees or certificate holders in order to meet the demand for marijuana in the state and to ensure a competitive market while also preventing an over-concentration of marijuana facilities within the boundaries of any particular local government.” 
Experts generally agree that Missouri’s decision to only issue the minimum licenses allowed under its constitution has been the key to the industry’s boom. However, critics have long argued that the decision created a monopoly that’s kept out opportunities for people who were most impacted by the War on Drugs. While the microbusiness license program was included in the 2022 consutitional amendment to address inequities, the limitations on what these businesses can do make it difficult to turn a profit. 
If the department does issue additional licenses, at least half of those licenses must be awarded to owners of cannabis microbusiness facilities that have been operational for at least a year.
The study will also provide information regarding the overall economic stability of the regulated market, including strengths and risks, with a special emphasis on the market’s impact on economically distressed areas of the state. 
Jeremy Washington, spokesman for the Office of Administration, the agency that handles contracting for the state, said there isn’t a “published schedule for the completion of the evaluation process.” 
However, upon completion of the evaluation process, the MissouriBUYS Bid Board will be updated to reflect the changed status.  In addition, the entire procurement file will be published on the Division of Purchasing’s awarded bid and contract document site.

More than 3 million people with Medicare could be eligible for the difficult-to-find and expensive weight-loss drug under new guidance which can cover the medication for patients who are obese or those who have a history of heart disease and are at risk of a heart attack or stroke.  (Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.




I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
States consider high costs, possible savings of covering weight-loss drugs for their workers

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Sean Tarwater, a Republican from Stilwell, convinced the 2025 Legislature to reduce by two-thirds the amount of state income tax credits available to incentivize construction or rehabilitation of low-income housing statewide. Since 2022, Kansas has used the tax credit to make faster progress on addressing the state's housing shortage and advocates of the credit opposed the cutback touted by Tarwater. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Assistant city manager Braxton Copley pleaded with Kansas House members to reject a proposal to end the state’s participation in a tax incentive program shown to be successful in promoting construction or rehabilitation of low-income housing.
Copley, representing the city of Topeka, stood at a microphone in February at the Capitol to address Rep. Sean Tarwater, chairman of the House commerce committee and the sole public proponent of a bill eliminating Kansas’ low-income housing tax credit, or LIHTC, on July 1. Copley wasn’t alone in opposition to the bill. Nearly 40 organizations and individuals offered testimony denouncing details and timing of House Bill 2119.
“Simply put, government cannot afford to construct and manage a sufficient amount of housing to meet the needs,” Copley said. “Developers are unable and unwilling to construct low-income housing because the low rents will not allow them to achieve a market rate of return. The LIHTC program leverages tax credits to induce private developers to construct affordable housing by providing them a market rate of return.”
In exchange for state and federal tax credits, the affordability of the incentivized housing units was assured for terms of 15 years or 30 years with covenants placed on the real estate.
Copley said undercutting the state’s approach to LIHTC would exacerbate homelessness in communities throughout Kansas.
Tarwater, a Republican from Stilwell, listened as a string of community activists, investors and bankers expanded on Copley’s thesis.
“I must say there are 39 opponents and I’m the only proponent, evidently,” Tarwater said. “This is not fair. You guys are going to need more people.”
Fast forward two months, and Tarwater pushed across the finish line on the final day of the 2025 legislative session the contents of House Bill 2289, which included a modified version of the much-maligned HB 2119. Instead of deleting LIHTC in July, the program would survive, on a shorter financial leash, until 2028.
“This is not exactly what we wanted when we set down this road,” Tarwater said. “We took a page out of Ronald Reagan’s book, and we’re going to take what we can get today and fight for the rest tomorrow.”
Tarwater objected to the ultimate cost of a program adding each year to tax credits that had to be honored by the state. Over a 10-year period, for example, the compounding effect of $25 million annual allocations of LIHTC tax credits could result in a state obligation of $250 million. The figure wouldn’t represent a direct expenditure by the state of Kansas, but would reflect the amount of future tax revenue foregone by the state as investors redeemed credits against their state tax liability.
Last week, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly signed the bundled bill rather than veto the measure and push the issue to the 2026 Legislature.
 
Financial haircut
The new Kansas law set a maximum on the amount of state housing tax credits issued this year at $25 million. In the final three years of LIHTC, only $8.8 million in annual credits would be available from the state for investors in affordable housing.
The law discontinued the state’s LIHTC match for investors receiving the 4% federal low-income housing credit, but retained the state match for developments qualifying for a 9% federal low-income housing credit.
Sen. Stephen Owens, R-Hesston, led negotiations on LIHTC legislation for the Senate. He viewed the final bill as a compromise that resulted in a diminished incentive, but provided a window of opportunity to convince lawmakers it should continue.
“This came to us from the House as a complete elimination of the low-income housing tax program,” he said. “Recognizing that there’s also some value to this program, the Senate’s position was to go back in and reduce it by about 70%.”
The program is managed by the Kansas Housing Resources Corporation, a self-supporting, nonprofit public corporation tasked with helping Kansans gain access to safe, affordable housing.
Emily Sharp, of the state Housing Resource Corporation, said substantial reduction in annual tax credit awards and deletion of the 4% program would diminish the state’s ability to fill wide gaps in housing. There will be a bigger scramble for the remaining credits, she said.
The 2028 sunset to the LIHTC should be concerning to communities struggling to meet housing demand, she said.
She said a 2021 state housing survey was conducted in collaboration with the governor’s Office of Rural Prosperity. The first Kansas assessment of its kind in 30 years showed an acute shortage. It was estimated the state needed to add at least 3,800 units annually, but was falling far below that level.
The National Low-Income Housing Coalition estimated Kansas had a deficit of 50,000 affordable housing units.
“We need more houses,” Sharp said. “Nationwide we’re seeing a shortage of housing. Kansas is no exception.”
 
Evolution of thought
In 2022, the Legislature and governor responded with passage of the affordable housing tax credit act that put in place a d0llar-for-dollar match by the state to the federal low-income housing credit.
The objective was to expand the volume of tax credits available to investors. The credits could be sold to generate revenue for construction of housing. The lower debt assumed by developers meant tenants could be offered below-market rental rates.
The state’s rate of housing development through state or federal investment tripled after implementation of the Kansas reform law three years ago. In 2021, state and federal government resources were associated with construction of 1,028 homes in Kansas. In contrast, 6,500 Kansas homes were funded in 2023 and 2024.
Ryan Vincent, executive director of the state Housing Resources Corporation, said the elimination of the state’s tax credit for housing — currently scheduled for 2028 — would mean that Kansas lagged further behind other states dangling lucrative incentives to attract housing investment.
“Eliminating the KAHTC would send a negative message to current and potential investors, signaling that housing development is a risky prospect in our state,” Vincent said. “Potential partners will avoid investing in an uncertain environment.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/P3051340-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-28 14:11:57.316531

Early voting in the city’s election has been underway since April 16. 
Morgantown City Council passed the ordinance in September, joining dozens of cities around the country to prohibit public camping after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a similar camping ban in Grants Pass, Oregon, amid record levels of homelessness. 
Morgantown’s law, which has so far not gone into effect, would prohibit camping on any public property — including streets, parks and trails — and also prohibit storing personal property in public areas. Second and third violations of the law are punishable by fines of $200 and $300 and/or 30 days in jail, respectively. 
After the ordinance passed, Morgantown Coalition for Housing Action successfully petitioned to have it repealed or put it on the ballot during a city election. Council voted four to three for the latter in November. 
According to the city, the camping ban appears on the right side of the ballot under “Ballot issues.” Voting “yes” on “Article 1157 Prohibiting Camping on Public Property” would be a vote to repeal the ordinance. Voting “no” would be a vote in favor of keeping the ordinance in place. 
Voters will also decide their council members in wards two, four and six and a ballot issue to allow the city manager to live outside the city while in office.
Polls open at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday and close at 7:30 p.m.

Witnesses spotted the Otero Fire in the bosque east of Socorro and the Alamo Fire in a neighborhood in Grants on Sunday evening. The Grants Fire is fully contained at between 3 and 5 acres, said Forestry spokesperson George Ducker. Despite progress overnight in Socorro, where crews built a fire line across the northern edge of the 360-acre fire, the Otero Fire is 0% contained, Ducker said. 
The causes of both fires remains under investigation, Ducker said, though they occurred amid high winds and ongoing drought across the state. The National Interagency Fire Center earlier this month warned that most of the state would experience above-normal wildfire risk, and that the risk would spread to the western two-thirds of the state as May approaches. A new forecast is expected in the next few days. 
High winds around 7 p.m. pushed the Alamo Fire on the east side Grants into structures, burning eight structures and six outbuildings and prompting evacuations. Residents are being allowed to return this morning, Ducker said, and crews will focus on watching for hotspots and dealing with the burned structures, now that the fire is fully contained. 
In the Socorro-area fire, crews detected active wildfire burning on the south end of the perimeter. They plan today to hold and increase containment lines.

Only one New Mexico higher-education leader signed the letter — from a small college in Santa Fe.
In the first 100 days, the Trump administration has frozen billions of dollars in research grants and threatened further cuts if universities fail to comply with policies to reshape admissions, curriculum and speech on campus. Broadly, the Trump and Republicans have alleged higher education indoctrinates students with left-wing ideologies, and are using federal funds as leverage to require universities to change campus policies.
Last week, Harvard University sued the Trump administration over its freezing of $2.2 billion in grants after the school refused to comply with federal demands to limit activism on campus.
The letter from academics, released last week by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, pushes back against the Trump Administration, penning a defense of higher education.
“We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight,” the letter states. “However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses. We will always seek effective and fair financial practices, but we must reject the coercive use of public research funding.”
As of Monday morning, the letter had amassed 523 signatures from colleges, universities and scholarly societies.
Leaders from University of New Mexico and New Mexico State University, the state’s largest schools, did not sign on.When reached for comment, Cinnamon Blair, a spokesperson for UNM wrote: “What I can share is that UNM’s participation in any statements is an internal administrative decision, and will be reflected in the public record.”
New Mexico State University spokesperson Amanda Bradford confirmed the administration had not signed the letter, stating: “The university has no further comments on this topic at this time.”
As of press time, Thom Chesney, president of Southwestern College, a private graduate-level school tucked away on Santa Fe’s Southside, remains the only New Mexico school leader on the list.
Southwestern College offers a variety of graduate-level programs and certificates, including: master’s degrees in counseling, art therapy and consciousness in action; as well as a Ph.D in visionary practice and regenerative leadership.
In an interview with Source NM, Chesney said higher education is facing unprecedented threats at multiple levels. Chesney took the position at Southwestern College eight months ago, following three years as president at Clarke University in Iowa and nearly eight years as president of Brookhaven College in Texas, among other academic postings. He’s been in higher education for nearly 30 years and started his work in academia teaching English, American and British literature and the humanities.
“We’ve not seen this before,” Chesney said. “The federal government stepping in and making demands about how we admit, who we admit and what we teach — that flies directly in the face of independence, of building a curriculum.”
Chesney told Source NM that this was the right time for his college to speak out, and said other New Mexican institutions are trying to navigate a difficult position.
“I’m going to defend my colleagues, my peers from the public and private institutions in New Mexico, who haven’t signed the letter,” Chesney said. “They’re not on the sidelines, they’re not silent, in assent or giving in — we can’t assume any of that. They are absolutely, I believe, thinking through where their space is, at this time, for this type of response.”
Chesney said the letter he signed offers the chance to be part of “a collective, unified voice.”
“It fits in with not only the mission of my institution, but also the broader need to respond in a call to action for dialogue, for decorum to come together and recognize we have a shared space, to identify the successes, the flaws — all of that, rather than react reactionarily,” he said.
Chesney noted that all higher education institutions face threats, regardless of size and programs. Southwestern College’s enrollment is just over 320 students. While his institution does not receive federal research grants, some of the students rely on Title IV funds to attend college. The college also offers a counseling center at which its counseling and therapy students receive real-world experience and provide low-cost or no-cost services for 500 Santa Fe residents.
“If someone comes in and says ‘you can’t do that anymore,’ that’s a threat,” he said. “That threatens the wellness of Santa Fe’s Southside, Santa Fe in general and ultimately New Mexico, in my mind.”
Not only did Chesney sign the letter, he hopes his participation in a national dialogue creates an opportunity for students to become more engaged with faculty and administrators in addressing the future of higher education.
And he has a message for prospective students who are considering further training or schooling: “Don’t become cynical.”
“No one should give up on that dream or that aspiration to do the kind of learning that leads them into opportunities to serve and create and have jobs that are for the greater, common good,” Chesney said.

Laura Kelly, pictured here at a May 14, 2024, event in Topeka, signed 11 bills into law last week following the close of the 2025 legislative session. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly announced Friday she had signed into law 11 bills, meeting a deadline and cementing public education funding, tax incentives for major data centers and a new crime for possessing, creating or distributing AI-generated child pornography.
The bills were bipartisan, Kelly said, as she signed them before the end of the 10-day period she has to take action after the Legislature delivers them to her.
Crime and law enforcement
Senate Bill 186 crafted first-time, clear protections for those who are the subject of AI-generated imagery without their consent. It’s an effort to mitigate the harms caused by technology, “in both the digital realm and the physical world,” Kelly said in a news release.
“Given the rise of AI-enabled crime, enhancing public safety for our fellow Kansans is crucial,” Kelly said.
The law applies to the alteration of real photos or generating new material from scratch, said Rep. Brad Barrett, an Osage City Republican who sat on the House committee that heard and negotiated the original bill. 
“This legislation strengthens our child exploitation laws to protect kids from this evolving threat and also updates our breach of privacy law to shield adults from having their images maliciously altered to appear nude or sexually explicit when they have an expectation of privacy,” he said.
The law adds to the definition of sex crimes within the Kansas Criminal Code to include AI-generated material. It also modifies existing criminal bond-setting procedure to hike up bond rates for any defendant with prior convictions of sexually violent crimes. The minimum bond for those defendants is now $750,000, which Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes said addresses patterns of “predatory behavior.”
“This part of the bill ensures the safety of victims comes first,” Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said. “By requiring the consideration of similar prior acts when setting bond, we can alleviate some of the fear for victims.”
Senate Bill 156 increases the amount of money inmates can receive from the Kansas Department of Corrections for losses, personal injury or property damage.
Senate Bill 204 seals criminal and juvenile cases — meaning information is kept secret — until an arrest warrant is executed. It also creates a new appointment process for trustees of county law libraries.
Senate Bill 237 empowers law enforcement officers to investigate violations of the Scrap Metal Theft Reduction Act, which targets scrap metal dealers. It was initially proposed by the Wichita Police Department.
Industry and development
Kelly said a new law that incentivizes major data center projects in Kansas gives “the state another tool in the toolbox to bring jobs, infrastructure, and prosperity to Kansas communities through economic development.”
Senate Bill 98 creates a 20-year sales tax exemption for data centers investing at least $250 million within five years of opening. The exemption could include land acquisition, development and construction, equipment acquisition and permitting, design, engineering, labor for installing and maintaining data center equipment, and lease payments.
Businesses that receive the exemption must by law conserve, reuse, and replace water, pay for electricity from a public utility for 10 years and maintain at least 20 new jobs at the data center within two years of launching.
Kelly also signed into law House Bill 2289, which was championed by Stilwell Republican Rep. Sean Tarwater and enacts limits on housing tax credits. Over time, the law eventually will dismantle the state’s affordable housing tax credit program.
Taxes and government
House Bill 2125 reauthorized the 20-mill statewide school property tax levy to finance public schools through the 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 school years. The bill also sets strict deadlines on local taxing entities, enabling county clerks to use a taxing jurisdiction’s budget and tax levy from the previous year if it doesn’t submit budget information by Oct. 1.
House Bill 2231 shifts Kansas to a corporate income tax calculation method that aligns with the majority of states. Kelly said the law evens “the playing field for Kansas-based businesses, making the state more attractive for capital investment, and encouraging job creation.”
House Bill 2335 creates, beginning in January, a new license plate for members of hunting organization Hunter Nation.
House Bill 2007 cleans up statutes that were amended multiple times during the 2025 session.
House Bill 2275 enables a handful of Kansas counties to ask voters whether they favor a sales tax proposal to fund projects. It also creates a tax exemption for custom meat processing sales.
In Finney County, county commissioners want to impose a 0.5% sales tax to finance construction or remodeling projects in the county courthouse, jail, law enforcement center or other administrative building.
In Jackson County, commissioners want to ask voters if they would favor a 0.25% sales tax to support hospital services.
In Pawnee County, commissioners can ask voters if they want to pay an up to 1% sales tax for providing health care services and “furnish” and “equip” public safety operations.
In Seward County, voters will decide if they want to pay a 0.5% sales tax to fund road and bridge projects.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/P5140012-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

Gerry Connolly, D-Fairfax, speaks at a press conference outside of USAID headquarters on Feb. 3, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Fairfax, a fixture in Northern Virginia politics for more than three decades, announced Monday he will not seek reelection after a resurgence of cancer, saying the sun is setting on his time in public service.
In a statement published on his social media accounts, Connolly thanked supporters for their “good wishes and compassion,” crediting their encouragement with giving him strength “in my fights — both against cancer and in our collective defense of democracy.” 
He revealed that although initial treatments had seemed successful, his cancer has returned. “I’ll do everything possible to continue to represent you and thank you for your grace,” he wrote.
Connolly, 75, said he will soon step down as ranking member of the House Oversight Committee and finish out the remainder of his term with “no rancor and a full heart.” He added, “With pride in what we’ve accomplished together over 30 years, my loving family and staff sustain me. My extended family — you all have been a joy to serve.”
The news struck a deeply emotional chord among colleagues and political leaders across Virginia and Washington, D.C.
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., reflected on Connolly’s announcement with admiration, saying, “No one has fought harder when it comes to Virginia’s federal workforce, transportation infrastructure, congressional oversight, and our commitment to critical alliances like NATO.” 
Kaine said he spoke with Connolly on Monday morning, telling him of his “profound admiration for his service and deep love for him and Smitty,” Connolly’s wife.
House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., Connolly’s counterpart on the committee, also expressed his support following the announcement.
“I’m saddened to hear that Ranking Member Connolly’s cancer has returned,” Comer said in a statement Monday. He praised Connolly as “a steadfast public servant who has spent his career serving Northern Virginians with honor and integrity.”
Comer added, “It’s an honor to serve the American people alongside him and I am rooting for him as he battles cancer once again. Our prayers are with Ranking Member Connolly and his family.”
Born in Boston, Connolly’s life reflected a unique mix of scholarship, global expertise, and local passion. He spent a decade with the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, managing oversight on international economics, narcotics policy and U.N. affairs, and publishing reports on U.S. policy in El Salvador, Central America, Israel and the Persian Gulf.
Later, Connolly moved into leadership roles in the private sector at SRI International and SAIC before fully turning to public service in Fairfax County. He was elected Providence District Supervisor in 1995, and in 2003, became chairman of the county’s Board of Supervisors, where he guided Fairfax’s rapid growth while promoting education, environmental stewardship and smart development.
Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, recalled first working with Connolly during those local government years. 
“The congressman was a visionary leader for Fairfax County who moved on to a national role defending federal workers and our democratic institutions,” Surovell said. “Northern Virginia is a better, stronger place because of Gerry Connolly’s tireless advocacy, and our democracy is healthier because of his unwavering dedication.”
Connolly carried that same blend of policy chops and political muscle to Washington after winning election to Congress in 2008. Representing Virginia’s 11th District — anchored in suburban Fairfax County — he quickly built a reputation for mastering the nuts and bolts of government reform.
He co-authored the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act with Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California, seeking to streamline how the government buys new technology and reduces waste. 
Connolly also worked to cut red tape through the Government Reports Elimination Act of 2014, which scrapped about 100 outdated or redundant federal reporting requirements. His commitment to oversight and efficiency earned him recognition as one of the most effective lawmakers in Congress by the Center for Effective Lawmaking.
“Throughout his career, Gerry Connolly has exemplified the very best of public service — fiercely intelligent, deeply principled, and relentlessly committed to the people of Northern Virginia and our nation,” U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Monday. Warner called Connolly “one of the toughest fighters I know” and said he was “keeping him in our hearts and prayers.”
Connolly’s record reflected a consistently progressive bent. He championed abortion rights, voting against the Stupak-Pitts Amendment and supporting federal funding for Planned Parenthood. He campaigned for LGBTQ rights long before marriage equality became the law of the land, backing efforts to repeal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and the Defense of Marriage Act.
He was also a strong advocate for environmental protections, helping to found the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, and supported investments in renewable energy technologies.
Connolly did not shy from political combat, especially during the Trump presidency. He voted to impeach Donald Trump and memorably blasted Republican proposals to rename Dulles Airport after Trump, quipping, “If Republicans want to name something after him, I suggest they find a federal prison.”
State Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, praised Connolly’s fighting spirit and intellect. 
“Congressman Connolly always brings unmatched intellect, wit, and passion to his work,” Bagby said. “Cancer stands no chance against his fighting Irish spirit.” Bagby credited Connolly with making the commonwealth stronger through decades of dedicated service.
In recent years, Connolly continued to dominate his electoral contests, defeating a primary challenger in 2024 with more than 86% of the vote and cruising to reelection against Republican Mike Van Meter. 
Even as health challenges loomed, he maintained an active role in legislative oversight and defending democratic institutions.
Connolly’s retirement marks the close of an era for Northern Virginia, where his leadership became synonymous with effective, passionate advocacy. His colleagues emphasized that his impact would long outlast his time in office.
Former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, also praised Connolly’s legacy and spirit, calling him a model public servant whose impact will be felt across Virginia for generations.
“For more than three decades, Congressman Connolly has stood up for Virginians — dedicating his career to public service and making our Commonwealth stronger,” Spanberger said Monday. “He has responded to the needs of his neighbors, strengthened the communities he represented, and worked to grow the Democratic Party in Fairfax and across Northern Virginia.”

The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.

“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.











I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University



GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.

In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”

In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth endorsed Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton on Monday in the 2026 Democratic primary for Illinois’ open seat to replace longtime Sen. Dick Durbin.

Duckworth’s endorsement comes after Gov. JB Pritzker endorsed Stratton on Friday, one day after she entered the Senate contest. With no other Democratic candidates announcing campaigns for the 2026 primary by Monday morning, Stratton secured the endorsement of two of the state’s top Democrats before fielding any competition.

“Juliana has not only proven to be an experienced and effective Lieutenant Governor — she’s demonstrated time and again that she truly understands and cares for working people,” Duckworth said in a statement. “Their struggles are her struggles. Their wins are her wins.”

Duckworth, a Democrat from Hoffman Estates, will take over as the state’s senior senator in January 2027 after Durbin’s term ends, as he announced last week he plans to retire. An Army veteran who earned a Purple Heart while serving in Iraq, Duckworth was elected to the Senate in 2016.

“Her many years spent in public service, along with her experience as a mom to four daughters and a caregiver to her own mother, have given her the tenacity, grit and perspective to be a true advocate on behalf of working families,” Duckworth said of Stratton.

Durbin told reporters at his Springfield home last week that he will likely not make any endorsements in the primary.

Stratton secured Pritzker’s endorsement Friday. The two have spent the last six years leading Illinois following two successful elections.

Pritzker praised Stratton as a “champion for women’s rights, for job creation, for rural families, for farmers, for criminal justice, for early childhood education,” and credited the lieutenant governor as having played an integral role in his administration.

Asked Friday whether his endorsement tamps down a competitive race for Durbin’s seat, Pritzker said, “Anybody who wants to run should run. But I’m telling you this is the person whose best able to serve with integrity, with honor.”

Stratton, of Chicago, has quickly risen through the ranks of Illinois politics after first being elected as a state representative in 2016. She was elected lieutenant governor two years later as Pritzker’s running mate during the 2018 campaign.

It’s still unclear whether other Democrats will announce they are joining Stratton in the primary as whoever enters the race will go in knowing they won’t be endorsed by two of the state’s leading Democrats.

U.S. Reps. Lauren Underwood, of Naperville, Raja Krishnamoorthi, of Schaumburg, Robin Kelly, of Matteson, and state Treasurer Mike Frerichs, of Chicago, all have said they are considering entering the race.

Meet Jennifer and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
It feels like nowadays, you can’t talk about the professionalized world of fighting for entertainment without talking about Donald Trump.
Earlier this month, Trump and several Cabinet members sat cageside at the UFC match in Miami; Trump himself holds a spot in the WWE Hall of Fame, where his official bio page notes that he’s the first WWE Hall of Famer to hold the presidency. Ahead of last weekend’s annual WrestleMania, wrestling news sites were abuzz with rumors that the president might again be ringside. At the same time, one of professional wrestling’s biggest stars, Roman Reigns, made headlines for declaring himself as a Trump supporter. 
The former CEO of WWE, Vince McMahon, is a longtime friend of the president’s and financial supporter of his political endeavors; McMahon’s now-estranged wife, Linda, is also a former WWE CEO and a current member of Trump’s Cabinet. And the CEO of UFC, Dana White, introduced Trump before he spoke on the final night of last summer’s Republican National Convention — Hulk Hogan also spoke, ripping off his shirt to reveal Trump/Vance campaign merch — and attended Trump’s inauguration in January. 
The kinds of theatrics baked into the massive success of professional wrestling have been on display throughout Trump’s ascendency in American politics. On the campaign trail and now in the White House, a Trump event has a distinctive feel, a well-honed blend of spectacle, pageantry and hypermasculinity. It’s a style that feels lifted from the professional wrestling handbook, where aesthetics and narrative device choices are central to the delivery. In professional wrestling, this product is a form of entertainment that lets fans — predominantly young men — openly feel and freely celebrate masculinity. In the second Trump administration, the product is a barrage of new policy measures intent on crafting a very specific version of America where the feelings of men are prioritized and their power is irrefutable. 
Though not a part of the action in the ring, there’s another significant tie between professional fighting and the Trump administration: allegations of sexual misconduct that have stretched back for decades. Vince McMahon, the visionary showman who made professional wrestling into the cultural force it is today, built the persona of “Mr. McMahon” around being a womanizing, vindictive philanderer — and today faces real-life accusations of sex trafficking, which he has denied. Donald Trump, the visionary showman who reshaped American politics in the mold of reality television, built his industry-spanning brand in part around the idea of being the consummate ladies’ man — and won the presidency for the first time just weeks after the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked in which Trump boasted, “And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything….Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.”
Central to the concept of professional wrestling is the practice of kayfabe, or committing to the illusion that clearly staged events are real and true. It’s a narrative device that asks audiences to suspend their disbelief, not in a way of passive acceptance, but rather active participation in the creation of what is possible. 
“It really does matter how well you’re doing the performance, but then what also really matters is how much the audience is going to buy into it. If they’re emotionally connected, that’s where the buy-in comes in,” said CarrieLynn Reinhard, an associate professor of communication arts and sciences at Dominican University and an expert on narrative devices in professional wrestling. “When you look at what Trump does, he is very good at getting to people’s emotions and understanding their emotions and — I’m going to say — manipulating their emotions for his own goals, and in doing so, he focuses on a reality that he believes in or at least he performs to believe in.”
Reinhard pointed to Trump’s rollout of tariffs — which he touted as immediately bolstering the economy even as markets tumbled — as an example of this dynamic. “What’s interesting is that with that little bit of doubt, his followers, his fans, they have the ability to engage in that rationalization that allows them to say, ‘He’s got a plan.’” 
The gimmicks
Professional wrestling is immensely popular in America, one of the most enduring and dominant forms of pop culture of the past three decades. Just last year, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) merged with the WWE under one new parent company, TKO. UFC is now the fourth-most watched sports league in America, after MLB, the NFL and the NBA. 
And the people who made UFC and WWE what they are today are also inextricably intertwined with the creation and actions of the dual Trump presidencies. 
By the time Trump mounted his first campaign during the 2016 presidential race, the McMahons were already major Republican donors. Linda, the former CEO of WWE and the current secretary of education, contributed a total of $7.2 million to two pro-Trump super PACs that cycle — Rebuilding America Now and Future45 — and the couple together donated more than $10 million to outside groups funding Trump’s race for the presidency. The McMahons also supported Trump before he formally entered politics, donating $5 million to the Trump Foundation in 2007.
Linda McMahon’s ability and facility in playing a role — a skill honed during her time as not only a WWE executive but also an on-screen performer — is essential to understanding her nomination within this administration, according to Kelly Dittmar, an associate professor of political science and the director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. 
In naming her to his Cabinet, Trump “chose somebody who was willing to work herself out of a job. He had to find somebody that was willing to go and sit at a confirmation hearing and try to explain how she wanted to be the secretary of education, but also effectively get rid of the Department of Education, which is an incredibly hard position to be put in,” Dittmar said.
It feels not dissimilar to a part she had in what is considered by many fans to be one of the most infamous WWE storylines, playing comatose in a wheelchair for weeks before ultimately rising from her supposed catatonic state inside the ring to kick her philandering husband in the groin on live TV. 
This time, of course, the shock ending isn’t revenge for a titillating affair, but effectively shuttering a major federal agency. 
Dana White, the CEO of UFC, has also been a longtime fixture in Trumpworld. He spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016, 2020 and 2024. When it was clear Trump had won a second term last November, White spoke at the victory celebration, saying, “I’m in the tough guy business, and this man is the toughest, most resilient human being that I’ve ever met in my life.” White has long credited Trump for supporting UFC from its start, hosting UFC matches at Trump properties, attending events cageside, and generally being a champion of the brand of macho entertainment that became explosively popular under White’s watch. 
The accusations
The Trump administration and WWE share another overlapping characteristic: The way leaders of both have faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct and sexual abuse, or of ignoring such misconduct. 
Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women and long surrounded himself with men who have been similarly accused during his time in the public eye, was found liable by a jury in 2023 of sexually abusing and defaming the advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. In his second term, he put forth multiple nominees accused of or linked to sexual misconduct allegations.    
White has offered more tacit support in other ways that underscore the misogyny and allegations of criminal sexual misconduct that proliferate in Trumpworld. In March, White welcomed Andrew and Tristan Tate ringside. The brothers — who face charges in Romania, including rape, human trafficking, trafficking of minors and sex with a minor — returned to the United States in February. They have denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges against them “garbage” and part of a “conspiracy.”  The Financial Times reported that the Trump administration asked Romanian officials to return the Tates’ passports to them and allow them to travel while the criminal case against them proceeded in court. Trump’s presidential envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, raised the Tates’ case with the Romanian foreign minister. Additionally, Paul Ingrassia, a former Tate attorney, is now a White House liaison for the Department of Justice. 
The McMahons are currently facing a lawsuit accusing them of failing to stop abuse by an employee from the 1970s to the early 1990s. The suit, from “ring boys” who helped with setting up and breaking down wrestling matches, was filed in October. It says that a former WWE employee, Mel Phillips, sexually assaulted the ring boys and that the McMahons fired him in 1988 because of abuse allegations and then rehired him six weeks later. In a February statement, Greg Gutzler, the attorney representing the ring boys, said, “My clients’ lives were destroyed by the defendants who allowed and enabled the open, rampant sexual abuse to occur for years. … We will bring light to their truth and fight for accountability and justice.”
In early April, attorneys for Linda McMahon filed a motion to dismiss the ring boys’ lawsuit, saying that she has no connection to the state of Maryland, where it was filed. She also asserts that she has never met or communicated with the plaintiffs, to the best of her knowledge and memory. Vince McMahon has also denied all wrongdoing. Attorneys for Vince McMahon, Linda McMahon and WWE did not respond to The 19th’s request for comment.  
Linda McMahon’s time in the WWE, including the ring boys’ suit, was barely a topic in her February confirmation hearing. 
Tom Cole was the first of the ring boys to come forward with allegations about sexual abuse while employed by WWE, according to his brother, Lee Cole. Tom Cole died by suicide in 2021. 
Lee Cole said that he thinks people have failed to take the allegations against the McMahons seriously because of their ties to wrestling. “This has always been a wrestling story, and people have always known wrestling has been faked. And so they look down at these things, not knowing whether it’s a job — whether they’re pulling a job — or whether it’s real. They don’t know. People don’t take wrestling seriously,” Cole said. 
Cole said he understands that there has been an increase in attention around the McMahons and the ring boys’ lawsuit as a result of Linda McMahon’s role within the Trump administration. Too often, he said, he has seen reporters miss the mark by focusing their stories on the McMahons through the lens of Trump. 
But to understand Trump, you need to understand the McMahons, the way they have used power, fame, and the ability to craft narratives that keep fans invested in the WWE brand and willing to dismiss the naysayers. 
As a Trump supporter, Cole said he can see the appeal McMahon holds for the administration. 
“They’re entertainers. Linda McMahon is an entertainer. She was part of the entertainment world. Why else would Donald Trump love her so much? He’s an entertainer.”
The ring boys’ suit isn’t the only accusation of misconduct against the McMahons. In 2024, Vince McMahon was sued by former employee Janel Grant; in her suit, Grant accuses McMahon of sex trafficking, making her employment contingent on engaging in a sexual relationship with him and being sexually available to others within WWE. WWE and former WWE executive, John Laurinaitis, are named as defendants in the suit as well. All defendants in Grant’s lawsuit have denied all wrongdoing. Attorneys for Vince McMahon and WWE did not respond to The 19th’s request for comment.
When it comes to the allegations of sexual assault against both Trump and McMahon, Reinhard said she sees “the double whammy of the toxic masculinity that still accepts and promotes — something we are seeing more of now since Trump won — the idea that women are supposed to be controlled and then the idea that if you’ve got the money and you’ve got the time, you’re able to essentially spend your way out of these allegations, spend your way out of any charges and essentially wait out the public debate until people forget about it.” 
The feelings
Both Trump and professional wrestling are massive cultural entities that allow men to express their emotions, especially about their own masculinity. In the ring and now in the White House, men’s feelings matter — especially when it comes to defending their own identities and the men who give them that space to publicly feel and perform. “The idea of emotions being antithetical to politics really needs to be addressed, because they’re not just emotions — they’re a motivating force,” Reinhard said.
In the administration, the feelings lead to policies that promote a world where men can not only feel freely, but control the levers of society to make space for these feelings, too. 
Letting voters get caught up in the fandom makes the unprecedented policy decisions all the more possible. From tariffs that threaten to raise daily costs on voters who say they voted because of the economy, to DOGE cuts resulting in job and program losses that are upending economic security for many, to a proclamation for National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month from a sitting president found liable for sexual abuse in 2023, the second Trump administration has taken to operating in a way that constantly asks constituents to not just accept but actively buy in to a reality that runs counter to the facts on the ground. It’s kayfabe for government: Creating a world for men to freely express emotion and set policies with no limits — and no consequences — for violating once accepted standards and norms.
The second Trump administration is showcasing a “much more extreme” version of the first Trump term’s commitment to “dismantling a particular version of politics on the Hill,” said Sarah Banet-Weiser, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania whose research focuses on gender, media and politics. “And if you dismantle those politics, you know, you have to replace them with something,” Banet-Weiser said. 
And what remains is a stoking of men’s feelings in the wake of a slew of public policy decisions that in turn provoke even more emotion — even when the feelings run counter to the facts. The difference between reality television as entertainment and reality television as a political system is the consequences, Banet-Weiser said. “It’s not a group of housewives who fight and are riddled with scandal and then go on with their lives. It’s about the livelihoods of the American people.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Welcome to The Topline, a weekly roundup of the big numbers driving the Minnesota news cycle, as well as the smaller ones that you might have missed. This week: green cities; a stunning decline in Black homeownership; America’s most polluted air; an unusually long stretch without homicides; and Minnesota’s most conservative county. 
The greenest cities (literally)
The Washington Post has used data from the Arbor Day Foundation and the U.S. Forest Service to map tree cover across the country’s urban areas. Tree cover is primarily a function of the local climate — they grow readily in areas that were naturally forested before the arrival of Europeans, and less so in places like deserts.
More than half of Atlanta is covered by trees, for instance. Less than 9% of Phoenix is.
But policy plays a role too, and some cities are taking steps to plant more of them for a variety of reasons, including their cooling effect on the urban environment. 
Here in Minnesota, where the eastern forests meet the central prairie, you can see the gradient in canopy cover as you drive west. Duluth, for instance, is about 40% trees. Minneapolis-St. Paul is closer to 30%. Less than 15% of Fargo-Moohead has tree cover.
Black homeownership nosedives
A recent report by the Minnesota State Demographic Center shows that the overall rate of homeownership since 1970 has held steady at roughly 72%. But there has been a precipitous decline in Black homeownership over the same period.
In 1970, for instance, 42% of Black families were homeowners. In 2022 just 26% were. 
“In other words, since the 1970s, Black or African American householders have been increasingly concentrated into rental housing units,” according to the analysis. “This is a historical trend unique to Black or African American households.” The decline has been consistent across every decade except the 1990s. 
Another interesting wrinkle: The decline happening almost exclusively among U.S.-born Black families. Among Black immigrants, homeownership rates increased. 
The numbers suggest that Minnesota’s well-known racial disparities, among the worst in the nation, owe more to Black families falling behind than to white ones getting ahead. The fact that Minnesota-born Black families seem to be doing worse than their new immigrant counterparts is especially damning, and a sign that policymakers’ efforts to address the state’s disparities are failing.
America’s most air-polluted places
They’re mostly in California, according to the American Lung Association’s latest State of the Air report. But a couple Midwestern cities also make the list, including Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis and Cleveland.
The study finds, overall, that nearly half of the U.S. breathes in unhealthy levels of air pollution. 
“Air pollution is causing kids to have asthma attacks, making people who work outdoors sick, and leading to low birth weight in babies,” said Harold Wimmer, CEO of the American Lung Association. “This year’s report shows the dramatic impact that air pollution has on a growing number of people.”
The findings are especially concerning this year as the Trump administration is taking steps to both weaken federal regulations on air pollutants and to stop collecting much of the data that scientists use to track air pollution around the world.
Minneapolis posts longest stretch without a homicide in more than eight years
The 62 days between February 15 and April 18 mark the longest homicide-free stretch in Minneapolis since at least 2017, the Star Tribune reports. It’s a nice little milestone but bear in mind that homicides are currently falling virtually everywhere in the country, making it difficult to ascribe Minneapolis’ recent dry spell to any particular policy or policing decision.
So far this year, Minneapolis homicides are down by more than 50% from where they were last year at this time. That’s an impressive number, but it remains to be seen whether it’s the start of a durable trend or just the reflection of the regular ebb and flow of violent crime.
Minnesota’s most conservative county
It’s Morrison County in north-central Minnesota, population 34,000, per the Star Tribune. More than 70% of the county’s voters picked Donald Trump in the last three elections, and the overwhelming majority of them remain pleased with their pick despite the economic chaos he’s already caused.
Morrison is virtually all white and in the bottom fifth of the state for household income. Several of the voters who spoke with the Star Tribune appear to be deeply misinformed on basic facts about American society. 
One government employee, who believes antifa was behind Jan. 6 and who is indefinitely postponing building a new home because of Trump’s policies, told the paper he remains 100% devoted to the billionaire convicted felon in the White House: “He’s me, just at a lot bigger level.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1468619438.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The North Carolina Supreme Court seemed to side with the agriculture lobby last Wednesday in a hearing for a case whose outcome could nullify key environmental, civil rights and public health protections for neighbors of the state’s 2,000 industrialized livestock farms.
If the justices uphold an appellate court’s decision in favor of the N.C. Farm Bureau Federation, the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality would not be allowed to enforce three provisions in the state’s general permits for concentrated animal feeding operations that were forged as part of a civil rights settlement.
Instead, those three requirements for certain farms—groundwater monitoring, annual reporting and soil testing for phosphorus loss—would have to go through a more extensive rule-making process led by the Environmental Management Commission.
The EMC is composed of political appointees, whose appetite for regulation varies.
“This case presents a foundational question of administrative accountability whether state agencies may sidestep the safeguards of rulemaking by imposing sweeping regulatory mandates through general permits,” the Farm Bureau Federation attorneys wrote in court documents.
The case stems from several settlement conditions contained within a 2014 civil rights complaint. Lawyers for several environmental justice groups and neighbors of industrialized hog farms had filed a complaint with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, alleging that DEQ, by issuing general permits without adequate protections, disproportionately burdened people of color and low-income residents, who are more likely to live near the farms.
Most of the state’s concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, hold a general permit, which applies to a class of operations. A smaller number have individual permits, whose conditions are tailored to specific farms. DEQ renews and, if necessary, revises general permits every five years, after several public hearings and opportunities to comment.
As part of the settlement, DEQ incorporated three conditions in a 2019 general permit.

All CAFOs must file a two-page annual report summarizing information from existing records, such as the number of animals, permitted lagoons and acres on which waste is applied.
CAFOs whose lagoons or waste collection systems lie within a 100-year flood plain must conduct annual groundwater monitoring; this accounts for fewer than 3 percent of general permit holders, according to DEQ.
Based on soil testing, some CAFOs would have to measure phosphorus loss from their fields where animal waste is applied. This requirement would affect roughly 5 percent of CAFOs.

Groundwater monitoring is important because runoff or leakage from enormous hog waste lagoons can seep into private drinking water wells or rivers and streams. Annual reporting, environmental groups argued, can detect problems at the CAFOs sooner.
Phosphorus loss tests are key because they can indicate erosion or runoff from the farms, which in turn can create harmful algae blooms in waterways.
  This map shows the locations of all permitted concentrated animal feeding operations in North Carolina. In total, these farms raise 86,000 cattle and cows, 9.45 million swine, and 7.19 million poultry where the animal waste is stored and applied as a liquid. The map does not show the millions of poultry on farms that use dry waste systems; those farms aren’t required to obtain a permit. (Credit: N.C. Department of Environmental Quality)
The N.C. Farm Bureau Federation contested those aspects of the general permit before an administrative law judge, who ruled in its favor.
DEQ appealed to Wake County Superior Court, which reversed the administrative law judge’s ruling. The Farm Bureau subsequently won in state appellate court.
For 28 years the state legislature has enacted and revised statutes allowing DEQ and other agencies to write and issue general permits without going through rulemaking, a process that can take years.
Only if a provision has “general applicability” does it need to be a rule.
Associate Justice Trey Allen, a Republican, agreed that state lawmakers granted some permitting authority to state agencies, but said “it’s difficult for me to believe GA’s intent was to enable the agency to avoid rulemaking.”
“These permit conditions do not have general applicability,” said Taylor Crabtree, an attorney with the N.C. Department of Justice representing DEQ. Even though the permits are “general,” farmers can apply for an individual permit instead, Crabtree said, and potentially avoid the three provisions in dispute.
State law also requires every requirement in a general permit to tie back to a specific condition or statute, which the three provisions achieve, Crabtree said.
DEQ’s actions for the three provisions, Republican Associate Judge Richard Dietz said, “sound like rulemaking.”
Dietz said that while the legislature has the authority to delegate some rulemaking to the executive branch, such as DEQ, that power has limits, such as procedural safeguards.
A farm can still challenge the permit conditions in court, Crabtree told the justices. “It’s not accurate to say this regime has no procedural safeguards.”
Jacob Parker, attorney for the Farm Bureau Federation, argued without the guardrails of formal rule-making, “an agency can go off into its black box and make decisions” about what to include in permits, “which we contend is what sort of happened here with the sue and settle issue.”
The “sue and settle issue” is the 2014 civil rights complaint against DEQ, which the EPA determined was valid. The EPA directed DEQ and environmental groups to enter confidential mediation, but those talks broke down in 2016, when agency officials in a conservative administration allowed the NC Pork Council to attend a confidential mediation session. ??
Attorneys for the neighbors and environmental groups asked the pork industry representatives to leave the building. Instead they stayed in the hallway near the mediation room during the talks, according to a second complaint, a move that neighbors alleged was a form of intimidation.
The EPA found the second complaint to be valid and wrote in a letter to DEQ that it had “grave concerns” about the incidents.
Two years later, under new DEQ Secretary Michael Regan, the parties reached a settlement. Regan went on to become EPA administrator under President Joe Biden.
Parker, the Farm Bureau Federation attorney, told the court today that “absent the farm interests, we ended up with a draft swine permit with conditions that had not been adopted as rules.” Unlike rules, the conditions contained no fiscal note, so farmers didn’t know how much compliance would cost, Parker said.
Associate Justice Anita Earls, one of two Democrats on the bench, asked about the possible ramifications on DEQ’s other 21 general permits as well as all state agencies. “If we were to say the conditions for the permitting process here have to go through rulemaking … would these extend beyond DEQ?”
Crabtree, the DEQ attorney, replied that if the scope of the opinion is broad, it could affect all state agencies that issue general permits. “It would work a great deal of uncertainty into the system,” Crabtree said. In that case, any statutory clarifications should fall to state lawmakers, he said. “If there’s a change, it’s an argument for the General Assembly, not the courts.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hog-Farm-eastern-NC-Rick-Dove-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

SPRINGFIELD – The cost to attend state universities has been rising, and some institutions have said they’ll have to continue pushing the brunt of state budget shortfalls onto students and families if there isn’t a change.

Data from the Illinois Board of Higher Education, which oversees public universities, shows university income has had to make up for the steady loss of funding from the state since around fiscal year 2009 as compared to inflation.

Since that point, state investment hasn’t kept up with inflation, and tuition and fees have risen steadily despite the fact that Gov. JB Pritzker’s administration has regularly increased higher education funding. The fiscal year 2026 proposed budget includes a 3% increase for higher education in the general fund for operating costs – which is about the same as the rate of inflation.

The cost of tuition and fees for statewide undergraduates on average has risen 10% higher since FY09 than if it had simply kept pace with inflation. For graduate students, that discrepancy is 16%.

The University of Illinois Chicago is the only school that has seen tuition and fees for both graduate and undergraduate students grow more slowly than inflation.

Administrators from many of the states’ universities have said they’re holding out hope that a new funding formula, contained in Senate Bill 13 and House Bill 1581, will alleviate some financial burden.

The formula as it is currently proposed would use data from the Illinois Board of Higher Education to determine how much money public universities would need on a per-student basis. University officials said the current system for allocating funds to universities isn’t quite as clear about determining why one university gets more funding than any other.

During a Senate appropriations hearing last week, Sen. Michael Halpin, D-Rock Island, and Northern Illinois University President Lisa Freeman each supported a data-based funding formula over the current method.

Administrators for almost every public state university who have spoken to the same committee have said they need to keep asking for more money than what the governor proposed in order to fend off tuition and fee increases.

“We understand funds are more constrictive this year than in the recent past,” said Eastern Illinois University President Jay Gatrell during the committee meeting. “That said, we do have bills to pay, and we only have two real sources of revenue: state appropriations, which cover roughly one-third of our operating costs, and student tuition and fees, which cover the remaining two-thirds.”

During fiscal year 2003, that breakdown was flipped – the state covered more than two-thirds of universities’ operating costs.

“No university really wants to increase tuition cost,” said Corey Bradford, interim president of Governors State University in an interview. “We do it in order to balance our budgets.”

The proposed funding formula hasn’t made its way through either chamber yet, though legislators generally have ways of moving major legislation beyond stated bill deadlines, up until end-of-May adjournment. If it doesn’t move, universities will continue being appropriated funds by standards set from years past.

“Even if there are differences in dollars per FTE (full time equivalency student) after we were to implement this formula, at least those differences would be grounded in this data in the program,” Halpin said. “Right now, we have these discrepancies, but there’s … not necessarily a hard data point, or set of data points, to justify it.”

 

MAP grants

In his February budget plan, Pritzker proposed increased funding of $10 million for Monetary Award Program grants for students to use toward tuition and fees, matching the same increase he made for the previous year’s budget.

MAP grants can go to any student who’s eligible for financial aid across the state. Pritzker’s proposed increase would make the new MAP grants pool total $721.6 million – up from $400 million when he was first elected in 2019.

However, MAP grants don’t directly fund universities the same way money from the general fund does.

“MAP goes to all colleges,” Bradford said. “Community colleges, private colleges, it doesn’t all come to public universities.”

 

University building projects

Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, asked every university president during recent committee hearings if their schools had received any funding for deferred maintenance projects on campuses for the current fiscal year.

Rose said no one has said “yes” yet.

“I think we’d like to know before we get to next year’s budget how we’re spending last year’s budget,” Rose said. The current budget year concludes on June 30.

Ginger Ostro, IBHE’s executive director, said the board is working with universities and meeting with them and the Illinois Capital Development Board to maintain lists about deferred maintenance projects and make sure funding is distributed.

The results were the same for another Fesi bill to authorize the over-the-counter sale of ivermectin at pharmacies without a doctor’s prescription. As with the anti-fluoride bill, ivermectin supporters had ample info to support their viewpoint (we’ll get back to this, too).
Yet despite this apparent pro-science and pro-research mindset, overwhelming evidence of higher rates of cancer and other chronic ailments in communities along the Mississippi River’s petrochemical corridor in Louisiana are routinely ignored – if not doubted – within conservative circles.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Just three years ago, a peer-reviewed Tulane Environmental Law Clinic study found the estimated cancer risk was highest in the River Parish communities right next to point sources of pollution. Most of these settlements are predominantly Black and low-income, inhabited in part by the descendants of slaves who toiled on the plantations where refineries and chemical plants now stand.
The same study found the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) issued permits to allow industrial pollution emissions at rates 7 to 21 times higher among Black communities than in predominantly white ones. 
According to 2024 health data research from Human Rights Watch, people living in areas with the worst air pollution in Louisiana, including much of “Cancer Alley,” had rates of low birthweight more than double the state average (11.3%) and more than triple the U.S. average (8.5%). Preterm births were nearly double the state average (13%) and nearly two-and-a-half times the national rate (10.5%).
State officials are not willing to acknowledge the disparities. 
“LDEQ does not use the term Cancer Alley,” a department spokesperson told Human Rights Watch last year. “That term implies that there is a large geographic area that has higher cancer incidence than the state average. We have not seen higher cancer incidence over large areas of the industrial corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans.”
Now let’s go back to last week’s Senate committee hearing to see if we can’t connect that statement to why state officials can’t – or won’t – acknowledge verified scientific facts that are staring them in the face.
That includes state Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham, who was by Fesi’s side to support both of his bills. Regarding the removal of fluoride from drinking water, Abraham said there “probably is a direct correlation between fluoride intake in pregnant ladies and lower IQs in their babies.” Crowley chiropractor Sandra Marks, who also testified in favor of the bill, made the same claim and cited a Harvard School of Public Health study.
What Abraham and Marks didn’t share was that the Harvard study involved children in China with high overexposure to fluoride. They implied the lower IQs were tied to exposure to permissible levels of fluoride in the U.S. 
Jeanie Donovan, New Orleans deputy health department director, shared details on the Harvard research with lawmakers when testifying against Fesi’s bill. She also pointed out the lack of any reliable scientific research that connects fluoride with thyroid disease. 
“We have many, many health issues in our city and in our state that we should address and that we should be spending time and money to address,” Donovan told the committee, making it clear that fluoride overexposure was not one of them. 
Anne Jayes with the Louisiana Public Health Institute and Dr. Robert Delarosa, a Baton Rouge pediatric dentist for 41 years, both cited a University of Queensland study that found children with access to properly fluoridated water had higher IQs. 
Marks, who said her research was sourced through Meta AI, also sounded the alarm over skeletal fluorosis, which can result in bone density changes and an increased risk of fractures. What she failed to mention was the bone disorder involves exposure to excessive amounts of fluoride. 
Jayes later pointed out the potentially dangerous fluoride levels in the study Marks cited were 21 to 28 times the recommended amount for drinking water systems, and that skeletal fluorosis studies themselves have been “widely challenged for their poor quality.”    
Annette Droddy, executive director of the 1,900-member Louisiana Dental Association, noted to the committee a trend of states reversing their bans on fluoridated drinking water, including Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Tennessee. 
Calgary, Alberta, removed fluoride from its water in 2011 but restored it in 2023, Droddy said. The reversal came after health officials noted a 700% increase in children hospitalized for dental inflections and abscesses.
In Louisiana, only 39% of the population is provided fluoridated water through their public utility – well below the 72% national average, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Removing fluoride will compound issues for the nearly 500,000 children in Louisiana who don’t see a dentist regularly, even though they qualify for dental coverage through Medicaid, Droddy said. Without fluoridated water, she said the state will have to ask the federal government for more money to cover a likely increase in children’s dental problems.
“Why would we take away the best public health measure of the 20th century?” Droddy said.
Yet Fesi stuck to his guns in his closing statement for Senate Bill 2, doubling down on the debunked low IQ and thyroid claims — and adding autism for good measure without any supporting evidence. 
On Fesi’s other bill, Abraham provided what he called a “guesstimate,” saying “a fairly large percentage of the population of the United States takes ivermectin on a daily basis.”
The most recent number available for daily ivermectin use in the U.S. is 185,550 people, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, an arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Hospitals. 
That’s only 0.05% of the national population; it’s not nothing but certainly not “a fairly large percentage” of Americans. That poor grasp of health data might be cause for concern among Abraham’s patients – animal and human.
The surgeon general and other backers of Fesi’s bill frequently mentioned “health freedom” during the Senate committee hearing. That concept apparently doesn’t apply to neighbors of industrial facilities who no doubt would like freedom from toxic exposure linked to chronic ailments and a significantly lowered quality and length of life.
Fesi also referred to fluoride as “toxic waste,” something that communities along the river could probably help him better define.   
If Louisiana leaders are going to pull fluoride out of our drinking water, it stands to reason they should show equal concern for the health of residents in “Cancer Alley.”

It’s hard to believe, but it’s now been nearly six months since the November 2024 election and one race remains officially undecided – the contest for an associate justice seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court. Two recounts have confirmed that incumbent Justice Allison Riggs was the narrow victor, but remarkably, challenger Jefferson Griffin refuses to concede and continues to pursue the audacious strategy of seeking to have thousands of ballots – ballots cast according to the rules in effect on Election Day – thrown out.
The challenge has led to multiple lawsuits and numerous state and federal court rulings and recently, in order to try and get a handle on where things stand, what’s at stake and what might happen next, NC Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with one of our state’s top good government champions, Common Cause of North Carolina Policy Director, Ann Webb.

From the precipitous economic decline, to the mass firings of federal workers, to the rise of an immigrant deportation program that has cast aside traditional norms of due process, the national news has been chockful of unprecedented and highly controversial actions.
So how has this drumbeat of controversy impacted the views of North Carolina voters? A new public opinion survey from the Meredith College Poll indicates that people are very concerned – both about the direction the country is headed and the performance of the Trump administration. And recently NC Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with poll director David McLennan to learn more.

(Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Trump administration this month scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs and allowed federal Medicare to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Instead, state Medicaid programs will retain the choice of whether to cover the high-priced medications for their residents.
The drugs, which have historically been prescribed to diabetic patients, also help patients lose weight and have grown in popularity among doctors and patients. But they are generally too expensive for most people to afford without insurance.
While doctors and patient advocates say these drugs are critical to helping patients struggling with obesity and can save money in the long run by reducing comorbidities such as heart disease, others say the medications are just too expensive for most states to afford. More than a dozen state Medicaid programs have opted to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and the proposed Biden rule would have asked all states to figure out how to pay for them. But now, advocates fear these drugs may continue to be out of reach for many.
“It’s unfortunate that they’re excluding a whole class of medications that seem to have a tremendous number of health benefits to patients,” Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, said in an interview.










I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity.


– Dr. Nicholas Pennings, chair of family medicine at Campbell University


GLP-1s, which stand for glucagon-like peptide-1, are a class of drugs that balance blood sugar levels. They’ve long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. But since the drugs also curb hunger signals, doctors may prescribe these drugs — including popular brands Wegovy and Ozempic — to help patients lose weight.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded program that mostly serves people with lower incomes under the age of 65 or who have a disability. The federal Medicare program focuses primarily on people above the age of 65, no matter their income.
How and whether to cover expensive treatments and drugs can be a significant deliberation for state Medicaid directors. In North Carolina, where 70% of people struggle with being overweight or obese, officials opted to begin covering the drugs for weight loss last year. That coverage has been a game changer, said Pennings, who continues to treat Medicaid patients.
“They are expensive, but there’s a lot of other medications that are expensive too. Why is it that obesity medications and diabetes medications are being selected out?” Pennings said. “I think that’s just part of the inherent bias towards the treatment of people with obesity, feeling like it’s cheating or not necessary.”
The list price for Wegovy is around $1,300 per month, and for Ozempic, around $1,000. Even so, the skyrocketing popularity of these drugs has prompted at least 14 state Medicaid departments to begin covering these drugs to treat obesity in the past decade.
In addition to North Carolina, those states include California, Delaware, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
An annual survey of Medicaid directors from health policy research group KFF recently found that half of the 47 responding states not already covering the drugs were considering doing so.
In January, the National Association of Medicaid Directors told the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that state Medicaid departments had “significant concerns over the fiscal impacts” of the Biden proposal to require coverage of GLP-1s, and “strongly recommend that CMS maintain the current state option to cover or not cover anti-obesity medications.”
But others say covering the drugs will yield long-term savings.
John Cawley, a professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University who has studied the economic impacts of obesity, has found that obesity essentially doubles a person’s annual health care costs due to comorbidities such as heart disease, fatty liver disease and kidney disease.
He’s found that weight loss among those with extreme obesity, with a BMI of 40 or higher, can yield substantial reductions in medical care costs.
Cawley added that state Medicaid programs “have a lot of flexibility” in ensuring costs don’t get out of control, by, for example, covering a newly available generic version of GLP-1s, requiring prior authorization, and asking patients to try behavioral programs before getting a prescription.
North Carolina’s Medicaid department began covering GLP-1s for obesity in August. The state has been able to afford GLP-1 coverage by negotiating rebates, or discounts, with drug manufacturers, and by getting the federal government to cover some costs. Department leaders think lowering obesity will save the state money in the long run, said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid.
He said that one of the benefits of Medicaid is that “we get to choose, as a state, where we want to make kind of those extra investments or not.” He added that covering the medications could be potentially financially feasible for other states.
“Each program is different and has its own pressures. It would be welcome to be able to come together with other states to be able to negotiate broader deals,” Ludlam said. “If North Carolina is able to get a good deal, I don’t know why other states wouldn’t be able to participate in that.”
In 2023, Connecticut enacted a law requiring Medicaid to cover obesity treatment services. The program began covering GLP-1s for weight loss, but costs were significant enough that the state told providers this year that it is now focusing on other obesity treatments instead.
Sean Scanlon, the Connecticut comptroller, said that not covering GLP-1s is “shortsighted, bad policy.” The state health plan, which takes care of teachers and other state employees, has been covering the drugs for weight loss since 2023. The plan controls costs by only prescribing GLP-1s after patients go through some online weight-loss counseling, said Scanlon.
“The most fiscally conservative thing we can do is give people tools that will save the taxpayers money in the long run,” he said in an interview. “And GLP-1 drugs are one of the best tools that we have to ensure that the taxpayers are not going to pay more money for the health care of hundreds of millions of people in the long run.”
It’s unclear whether the federal government will reverse course. In the past, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recommended “three good meals a day” and behavioral changes rather than weight-loss medication.
But this month, Kennedy told CBS News he’s considering a regulatory framework to have Medicare and Medicaid cover these “extraordinary drugs” in the future, once their cost goes down.
“Ideally, over the long-term, we’d like to see those drugs available for people after they try other interventions,” Kennedy said.

Two volunteers pretend to cook over a stove when another pair acting as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents comes knocking at the cardboard cutout of a door.
This is the set up for a skit that undocumented advocates put on at their Know Your Rights training sessions. Rojas helps organize them.
“I am committed to waking my people up so they know that he, she or they can share with others their rights,” Rojas said.
Rojas is an immigrant who is actively involved with the undocumented community in her city. She’s asked to not use her full name for the safety of herself and the undocumented community she works with.
She’s worried because of recent allegations that federal immigration officers have wrongfully detained residents in New England and beyond. At Boston Logan Airport recently, two people with legal immigration status were detained. One had a green card and was detained. The other had a legal work visa and was deported.
“It makes me nervous,” Rojas said in Spanish. “It makes me think of how we can be even more strategic with these kinds of attacks.”
Part of that strategy is teaching people their constitutional rights, because she said it’s now more important than ever for people to know how to use them if they ever interact with an ICE agent.
“Being out and about is scary, but I am committed to planting those seeds, because I know they’ll bloom,” Rojas said.
Blah-blah-blah, cha-cha-cha and practice
The Know Your Rights workshop Rojas and her fellow activists put on has three parts. She calls them the “blah, blah, blah”, the “cha, cha, cha” and then “practice, practice, practice.”
The “blah, blah, blah” is a lecture in which activists explicitly tell audience members their rights. The New Haven Immigrants Coalition has a slideshow presentation with the majority of the constitutional rights that Rojas goes over in her own presentation. It is available in English and Spanish.
Trainees then get to see these rights in action with skits, during the “cha, cha, cha” portion of the workshop.
“The skit is a theatrical way to get as close as we can to reality and to expose our trainees in different scenarios so they can think about it, feel about it, and then practice it,” Rojas said.

Scenarios include what to do when you are at home, in your car, at your workplace and when you’re in a public area.
Rojas and her team provide handout copies of a legitimate court-ordered warrant signed by a judge and an ICE administrative order. With an administrative order, you do not need to open the door, Rojas said, but it is a common tactic immigration agents use to gain entry into someone’s home, so it’s important to know the distinction.
“If [the ICE agents] come with different tricks, just don’t fall for it,” Rojas said. “If [the agents] say, ‘We have here a document that proves that we can get into your house.’ [You should say] ‘Okay, just slide it [under] the door.’”
Then comes “practice, practice, practice.”
Rojas has all the trainees line up in pairs with partners facing each other. With one person as themselves and the other person as an ICE agent, they’ll practice the skills they’ve learned using different scenarios that Rojas poses.
The ‘each one teach one’ approach
This April, Rojas’ advocacy group is starting a new program called “Train the Trainer.” The idea is to train people how to give these Know Your Rights workshops.
“This is intended to be in the safety of your house,” she said. Imagine it like a gathering, she said, where Mexican sweet corn cake and coffee is served.
“We are going to have tomalitos, café and know your rights,” Rojas said. The goal is to offer training sessions to people who are too afraid to go out in public.
“Can you imagine if we can train 40 people this time, and then the next session, they invite one, just one, one of the people that they train to come to another ‘Train the Trainer?’ Now we are going to have 80 people,” she said. “It makes a huge difference.”
Prepare a layered defense
At Castle Church in Norwich, Philip Berns was giving a Know Your Rights presentation with the Latino advocacy group LEAD late into the night in March. The people in the audience either spoke English, Spanish or Haitian Creole. Thankfully, Berns speaks all three languages.
Berns, an immigration attorney based in Stamford, has been giving Know Your Rights presentations since 2006. When President Donald Trump returned to office, Berns ramped up to offer about two presentations a week.
He likes to teach people a strategy for how to use a red card (la tarjeta roja). Think of it like a business card, but instead of your contact information, it has your constitutional rights listed. You can give it to an immigration agent if you’re unable to verbally state your rights, he said.
Holding a “red card,” attorney Philip Berns of Stamford speaks during a community meeting held at Castle Church in Norwich, March 4, 2025. The “red cards,” which were distributed at the event, describe rights guaranteed by the US Constitution to protect people that could be targeted by ICE officials. Credit: Mark Mirko / Connecticut Public
He recommends having at least six red cards on hand at all times and to give them out to each agent you interact with, but he said you should save the last one for the deportation judge to show that if you were detained, it was done while violating your constitutional rights.
“You just have to be ready to have a layered defense,” Berns said.
Knowing which of your rights were violated is the best way to defend yourself when facing a deportation judge if you end up detained, which is why, Berns said, Know Your Rights training is still “absolutely” important regardless of the cases of alleged wrongful detentions.
It also helps to have a video recording of the interaction with the immigration agent, Berns said, another right that Berns teaches people they have.
“They’re going to take your phone away from you, so you’re not gonna be able to record it yourself,” he said. “It’s going to have to be other people.”
That’s where bystanders can act as allies, he said.
Open the door to your community
Both Berns and Rojas agree that these workshops are not just for the undocumented. They’re for family members, friends and neighbors, regardless of immigration status.
“If you know your rights, you know that you don’t have to open the door, and that is the single biggest line of defense you have against [ICE agents] picking up anybody they’re looking for,” Berns said. “For all the other people in the house that [the ICE agents] are not looking for, but I suspect will likely pick up just to drive their numbers up, if they know their rights, then they can protect themselves against deportation [too].”
In Spanish, Rojas and her fellow activists have a saying.
“Close the door on ICE,” she said. “Open the door to your community.”

Norman served as secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment throughout the pandemic. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Five years ago, Lee Norman was trying to dissuade Kansans from ingesting chemical cleaners to prevent COVID-19, preparing for the end of a statewide stay-at-home order and deciding whether to send tests for everyone in long-term care facilities and prisons.
Norman, then secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, jokes that reflecting on those years is like taking “a walk down bad memory lane.”
“We were meeting 24/7, 365,” Norman said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “And trying to figure out — without having enough resources, without having (a) vaccine, without having any medications and without having any testing — what the heck we were going to do with this lethal virus that has now landed in the United States.”


Within two years of the first cases in Kansas, Norman stepped down from his cabinet post at the request of Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration.
The first case was recorded March 7, 2020, and about a week later, Kelly declared a state of emergency.
Less than a week after that, she ordered K-12 schools closed.
By the end of the month, national case counts inched toward 100,000, deaths reached 1,000, President Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion stimulus bill and Kelly issued a stay-at-home order for the entire state.
The first four weeks went “swimmingly well,” even amid uncertainty and shock, Norman said.
But, he said, things quickly became contentious as executive action from the governor, public health recommendations and attempts at understanding a brand new virus unfolded.
“You know, four weeks was pretty unusual to have that kind of engagement,” he said. “And after that, it became distinctly unfun.”
He admitted public health was slow to address the social and psychological impacts of the pandemic. But by the point he and other public health officials realized that, he said, resistance to following public health guidance had already begun to take shape.
The politicization that crept into Norman’s role during the COVID-19 pandemic still exists in public health today. The 2025 Kansas Legislature passed bills in April that hinder the governor’s authority to limit public gatherings and pare back vaccination requirements for children.
Norman, who now works in the private sector, said investing in public health infrastructure is key for preparing for future health crises.
As Kansans faced last year a spike in tuberculosis cases and more recently a growing measles outbreak, Norman emphasized the importance of vaccinations and adhering to public health guidance.
The governor signed into law in April modifications to vaccine requirements for children that make it easier for parents to claim religious exemptions as justification for their unvaccinated children. The governor vetoed another piece of legislation that created a pathway for people to sue state and county health officials for their decisions about quarantines and other public health guidance. The Legislature overrode Kelly’s veto, making the change law.
Masks and limiting large gatherings work, Norman said. They have for centuries, he added.
“Half of everybody, kind of wants to undo the benefits of public health, and mock it even, which is particularly hurtful,” Norman said. “I think that the Legislature needs to, one, respect personal autonomy and responsibility, and then secondly, if people are want to have more autonomy, I think they have to listen to very, very good guidance.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PC303579-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-28 13:12:30.119679

A few weeks after the birth, the two were temporarily separated. Hailey poses for a portrait after being temporarily reunited with her daughter on April 1 in Cuba.

It wasn’t long before he rejected the attention and leapt from her arms in the callous way cats do. She cursed him in the way hormonal teenagers do.
Ash, a gray stray Hailey took in against her great-aunt’s protesting, became the teen’s comfort through a pregnancy and postpartum that spanned 10 foster homes, hospitals and group homes across Missouri.
Hailey entered the state foster system at 2 years old. She’s lost count of how many roofs she’s slept under.
Last spring at 15 years old, Hailey learned she was pregnant.
When she asked the state for an abortion, Hailey was told the possibility wasn’t up for discussion. By the time her stomach started to bulge, Missourians voted to codify the right to abortion in the state Constitution, and Hailey decided she wanted to parent.
But it wasn’t so simple.
By then, Hailey was staying with her great-aunt, Jodi Spradley, but the state remained her legal guardian. Though Hailey took initiative to prepare for motherhood, caseworkers on several occasions during her pregnancy threatened to take the baby after she was born, rolling out examples from Hailey’s long history in the state’s care.
In late February, just a few weeks after Hailey turned 16, her daughter was born. The resemblance is unmistakable: vibrant red locks, pale skin and blue eyes.
From the moment her baby girl entered the world, Hailey feared the state would take her. While that hasn’t happened permanently, the state did temporarily separate the young mother and child, moving them to different cities in different corners of the state.
By eight weeks postpartum, Hailey had slept in two hospitals and four homes.
Desperate to reunite her child with family as she was shuffled around the foster system, Hailey signed power of attorney of her daughter over to Spradley, to whom she also wanted to return.
In early April, after months of protesting the state’s push to move her into a faith-based maternity home, Hailey acquiesced. It allowed her to reunite with her daughter.
A few weeks later, on the eve of a court hearing to discuss her permanent placement, Hailey ran away from the maternity home with her 6-week-old in her arms. Both were quickly found and returned to state custody.
Hailey said she fled, in part, out of fear the state would officially declare she couldn’t live with Spradley. And she was terrified about where they might send her next.
The family’s fate remains uncertain.
Missouri has long been one of the most anti-abortion states in the country, with elected officials and advocates preaching the virtue of supporting young mothers to ensure abortion isn’t their only option.
But Hailey said this sentiment is a far cry from her experience. To her, it felt like the state first made the decision to continue the pregnancy for her, then actively worked to keep her from parenting her child.
The Independent spent months following Hailey and reviewing communications between her, Spradley, their advocates and the state that spanned Hailey’s pregnancy and postpartum.
The record of her struggles in the system illustrate what youth advocates and foster care experts say are repeated failures by the state to support Hailey, and later her daughter.
“Hailey was saying she wanted to parent, so she should have been supported,” said Laura Sullivan, a licensed independent social worker in Ohio who has spent several months advocating for Hailey. “In these states where they’re forcing pregnancies, especially teen pregnancies, they have to be ready to help these moms to parent.”
A spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Social Services, which oversees the state foster care system, said she could not discuss the specifics of Hailey’s case, instead pointing to Missouri’s Child Welfare Manual.
 ‘Don’t get pregnant’

The Facebook message came from a stranger.
“I have a child on my caseload who I believe is a relative to you,” an employee with a Missouri foster care agency wrote the morning of May 21, 2024.
Within hours, the state cleared and authorized Spradley to take her niece in under a temporary arrangement. Hailey was on her doorstep by that evening.
A letter dated that same day stated that while Hailey remained in the custody of Children’s Division, she was being placed with Spradley for an “indeterminate period.”
Though filled with gaps, the aunt and niece have a long history. Spradley used to take Hailey to the St. Louis Zoo, propping her up against the wooden railings to catch a glimpse of the animals. As Hailey got older, Spradley would take her driving around different corners of southeast Missouri to get ice cream or go to a park.
At times they went years without seeing one another. Though another great-aunt of Hailey’s — Spradley’s sister — adopted Hailey when she was 4, Hailey spent much of her childhood shuffled between different foster homes and mental hospitals.

She was a flight risk almost everywhere she went until she landed at Spradley’s.
“Don’t get pregnant,” Hailey recalled Spradley telling her when she moved in.
A few weeks later, Hailey went to the doctor to confirm what she feared. Hailey, who only a few months earlier had turned 15, was pregnant.
She wanted an abortion in the beginning. When Hailey asked her case worker if it was possible, she was told the state wasn’t allowed to discuss it with her. Abortion at the time remained illegal in Missouri with limited exceptions for medical emergencies.
Hailey couldn’t get up the nerve to tell Spradley she was pregnant, so she made a friend break the news instead. But Spradley didn’t kick her out. She doubled down on her desire to help.
Spradley searched the internet for answers. She sent a note to JustChoice — an agency based out of Ohio that helps people create abortion, adoption or parenting plans — saying her niece had been denied an abortion and now wanted to raise her child.
There was just one problem, Spradley said: Though months from her due date, the state was already threatening to take away Hailey’s baby.
 ‘We’re going to remove that baby’

Sullivan, the licensed independent social worker at JustChoice, reached out to Spradley after her organization received her message in late 2024. With Spradley’s permission, she started communicating with Hailey’s case worker to talk about a parenting plan.
Sullivan recalls the case worker in their initial calls telling her: “I don’t think Hailey’s going to be able to parent. We’re going to remove that baby. Her and her aunt, this is not a stable situation; they have a long history with the agency.’”
Most urgent, the case worker told Sullivan, was Spradley’s lack of adequate housing. If she wanted to maintain custody of Hailey through her pregnancy, she needed somewhere else to live.
After staying with a friend in St. Louis, Spradley and Hailey moved into the home and church of a former pastor in Wright City. Some of Spradley’s friends had pointed them to the old building off a rural highway as emergency accommodations.
The house, which abutted woods and farmland, sat untouched after the pastor died months earlier.
In the main room, religious relics crowded the wall. Behind one closed door was what Hailey dubbed the “porn room,” after they found explicit images on an abandoned computer. Hailey slept upstairs beneath old posters of semi trucks plastered to the walls.
The lack of heat became a growing concern as winter approached.
The state began talking of removing Hailey from Spradley’s care; a faith-based maternity home in the St. Louis suburbs that contracts with the state was suggested. Hailey remained adamant she didn’t want to go. When her case worker recommended she have bags packed and by the door the week of Christmas, she listened.
But she also shut down, growing moodier as the looming threat of removal hung over the holidays.
The new year came and went. Hailey’s bags remained by the door. The state never stopped by.
Sullivan, searching for a solution, teamed up with Right By You, an “all options” nonprofit focused on helping pregnant youth, to raise money for Spradley to rent an upgraded apartment.
Within weeks, Right By You raised $5,000 — primarily through Missouri donors and abortion funds — to cover Spradley’s rent through May. Meanwhile, Sullivan worked the phones with Spradley, calling landlords in an attempt to find someone who would accept a pregnant teen, a 52-year-old on disability, two dogs and one cat.
She found a solution in Cuba, a town about 80 miles southwest of St. Louis.
By mid-January, Hailey and Spradley were moved into a small, unadorned two-bedroom apartment.
Spradley reached out to her network of friends, asking if they could help furnish the apartment with baby essentials as a birthday surprise for Hailey, who turned 16 in late January.
They came by the truck-load, dropping off strollers, onesies and a swing. Spradley used some of the disability back-pay she received to splurge on a crib and a bottle sanitizer.
In the end, it still wasn’t enough.
 ‘Where are you going to live?’

Spradley didn’t take Hailey in sooner for many reasons. Poverty and poor health were the most prevailing.
“So what’s your plan for where you are going to live?” Hailey’s case worker asked in a text to Spradley months earlier, shortly after Hailey learned she was pregnant. “Do you have any money saved?”
“I had absolutely no income when Hailey was brought to me,” Spradley replied. “Not a dime. I get SSI disability which is very little.”
But once together, Hailey didn’t want to leave. Finally, someone understood her — a sarcastic and brash teen with a tendency to raise her voice.
“Some people would see what she’s doing and would freak out, but they don’t understand what she’s grown up and what she’s went through,” Spradley said. “That’s why I don’t judge her on that. That’s the big difference between me and other people.”
Unlike a foster parent, Spradley didn’t receive consistent financial benefits from the state for taking Hailey in. Though she attempted on several occasions to get certified as a foster parent through the state, she never received the final approval.
Spradley suspects it’s because she’s poor and sick.
She’s often seized by anxiety, which she said has only worsened since beginning to navigate the state’s hurdles in her attempts to help Hailey. She suffers from agoraphobia, Crohn’s disease, heart conditions and often uses a walker.
Spradley attributed some of her ailments to growing up in Times Beach, Missouri. It’s now a ghost town, beset by a chemical contamination that came to light in the 1980s. The Environmental Protection Agency deemed it “one of the worst environmental disasters in our nation’s history.”
Hailey is as determined as her aunt.
She enrolled in teen parenting classes through Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis as she started her second trimester. Between that and her prenatal appointments, she made weekly trips to St. Louis through her third trimester.
Most weeks, she made the trip without Spradley, booking and boarding a van through MO HealthNet, the state’s Medicaid program. The vehicle usually picked up other patients along the way, stretching what was normally a 90-minute drive into multiple hours.
The state on several occasions expressed concern with this arrangement, telling both Spradley and Sullivan that Hailey needed constant supervision.
Instead, Spradley kept an eye on Hailey’s location from an app on her cell phone.
Every year, Missouri social services agencies seize millions of dollars in Social Security benefits from foster children. Hailey is among them.
When Sullivan questioned how the state was using Hailey’s payments, which typically go toward funding foster care, she was told it was being used to pay for Medicaid expenses and the van rides.
She remains skeptical. That $400 a month could have gone a long way to help Spradley purchase furniture and buy groceries, both of which she said were held against her toward the end of Hailey’s pregnancy.
 Birth, ‘then I was out’

Days before Hailey went into labor, the state followed through on its threat.
Hailey was removed from Spradley’s apartment in Cuba and sent to a private foster home near St. Louis.
The foster mother, a stranger, drove her to the hospital. Once settled into a room, Hailey said the foster parent told her she was running down to the cafeteria.
Instead, she left Hailey at the hospital and never returned.
Hailey’s daughter was born two days later, on Feb. 26. The moment of joy was brief; within minutes, Hailey lost consciousness.
“I had a whole asthma attack, then I ended up throwing up everything in my stomach, and then shaking so bad that my jaw was hurting,” she said. “Then I was out.”
It took two blood transfusions to stem her postpartum hemorrhage.
Hailey ultimately stayed in the hospital for 12 days. Not because of her health, she said, but because the state didn’t know where else to send her.
This isn’t uncommon. In 2024, there were 314 Missouri foster children residing in hospitals. Others were held in hotels, offices and out-of-state residential treatment facilities.

While at the hospital, Hailey learned how to breastfeed. She believes her daughter shares her own lactose intolerance since she doesn’t take well to most formulas.
In many ways the two girls resemble Hailey’s mother, who was found dead in 2011, two years after Hailey had been removed from her custody. She was in the third trimester of pregnancy with a second daughter, who didn’t survive. The autopsy concluded a drug overdose. Spradley still believes it was something more nefarious.
A few months before Hailey gave birth, she asked Spradley if she could see the place where her mom died. They drove 60 miles to the apartment and asked the current tenant if they could look around. Hailey asked lots of questions. Spradley hoped it was healing.
She tries to tell Hailey stories of her mother often. Like the time Hailey’s mother, while pregnant with her, found a free mini fridge at a scrap sale and walked miles home with it. She later did the same with a kiddie pool.
Hailey doesn’t know her father. She hopes her daughter won’t, either.
The line for “father” on the birth certificate is blank, as Hailey intended.
She says little about the 20-year-old other than that they first met at a foster home years earlier, that he beat her and that he was, for a time, homeless.
Multiple warrants are out for his arrest, including for failure to appear in court on trespassing and theft charges.
Throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, one of Spradley’s closest friends, Brandie Coleman, was among her fiercest defenders. When Hailey gave birth, Coleman was by her side, Facetiming with Spradley, who feared the state might punish her for being there.
As Hailey recovered from her hemorrhage, Coleman says a hospital social worker confided in her that a state case worker had been trying to convince her to report Hailey to child protective services so they could remove her baby. But Coleman says the hospital employee refused, not seeing any evidence of abuse or neglect.
Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, the Missouri-based reproductive rights group that helped fundraise for Hailey and Spradley, said the family’s self-advocacy was admirable.
And in a way, she believes, they were punished for it.
She called Hailey’s case “such a blatant example of a pregnancy literally forced by the state, and then a very clear bias against this person and this notion that her child would be better off with a different family, and she was told that explicitly. And I just honestly was a little bit surprised how unveiled that was. There wasn’t really any pretense about it.” 
  Stephanie Kraft Sheley, founder of Right By You, called Hailey a “forceful self advocate,” adding: “It’s really admirable for someone so young, who’s in such a disempowered situation.” (Photo by Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent)
Kraft Sheley, who is also an attorney, said the fact that Hailey had a family member who wanted to take her in — who understood her — was huge. That Hailey was deprived of that support in the days leading up to and after her labor was “such inhumanity.”
“For any person to lose their home and be ripped away from their loved one within three days, four days of giving birth, one of the most formative, transformational experiences of a person’s life, she was treated with such a lack of care,” Kraft Sheley said. “… As a teen in such a vulnerable situation, she deserved to be held and surrounded by care, and instead, she was placed in this really precarious, uncertain situation.”
 Postpartum ‘disrupted’

When Hailey was finally discharged from the hospital, she and her baby were driven 200 miles southwest to Springfield.
There, they were placed in a private foster home with other teen moms.
Less than a week later, Hailey called Spradley. She was being taken to a mental health hospital to be screened for postpartum depression. Hailey said she was told it was because the foster parent heard her yelling; Hailey said she was yelling at a friend on the phone, not at her baby.
“I never heard this kid cry like she did,” Spradley said of Hailey during the phone call.
Her daughter was napping when they took Hailey away.
At the hospital, Hailey said she didn’t screen positive for postpartum depression but was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, meaning she has stronger emotional or behavioral responses to stress and trauma.
Hailey said when she learned she was being admitted to the hospital without her daughter, she had to be sedated after she started “throwing hands” at staff. She remained there for six days.
Spradley had little contact with Hailey in the hospital once her phone was taken away. When Hailey was released, she signed power of attorney for her daughter over to Spradley.
As Spradley drove to pick up Hailey’s child, Hailey was taken to yet another location — this time a group home in southeast Missouri.
Hailey believes the separation from her daughter was intentional. Within the first month of her child’s life, the two had been apart nearly as much as they’d been together.
She tried to continue pumping breast milk. At the start of her third trimester, Hailey had already started collecting small bottles of colostrum. But it didn’t take long after being separated from her daughter for her milk supply to diminish.

“For a teen mom, especially one with attachment issues like Hailey has, to be able to breastfeed successfully, that is beautiful and amazing, and could have been really healing,” Sullivan said. “But it was disrupted. So that caused both Hailey harm and (her daughter) harm.”
Sullivan, who has also worked as a social worker in two states, said it’s easy to use a teen’s years-long history in the system against them unfairly. She doesn’t believe Missouri ever gave Hailey a fair chance.
“Instead of being like, ‘This is a kid who we know has a lot of trauma and a lot of stuff, we should probably try to figure out how we’re going to help her parent and heal so she can be a good parent,’” Sullivan said. “‘It was just, ‘We’re on a mission to make her not be able to parent.’”
 ‘I’m not giving up on you’

On a sunny day in early April, Hailey returned to her aunt’s home in Cuba.
For the second time in a week, she held her daughter, who was one day shy of 5 weeks old.
Hailey’s milk supply had mostly dried up. She considered attempting to breastfeed, but then opted to make a bottle instead.
“Has she given you all the stink face yet?” Hailey asked as Spradley confirmed with a chuckle.
“Good. That’s my child,” Hailey replied, smiling down at her daughter as she fed her.
She sat in her old room again, across from stickers adhered to the wall welcoming her baby home. She urged the dogs to be careful as they investigated her baby’s scent. She cuddled her cat.
It was all temporary.

Hailey was back for just part of the day on an authorized off-site visit. A few hours later, Spradley would drive her 90 minutes back to the group home where Hailey would again kiss her baby goodbye.
Until then, she changed diapers, went through paperwork and sorted baby clothes, a sense of normalcy in a life that had been anything but.
As Hailey lounged on the couch with her daughter and Spradley rocked her small dog, named Baby, in the corner, Spradley’s cell phone rang. At the sight of the caller ID, an old friend of Spradley’s, Hailey perked up and grabbed for the phone to say hello.
“You know what? I love the sound of your voice right now. You sound so happy,” Spradley’s friend said to Hailey before pausing. “Honestly, are you doing OK?”
“Not for good, sadly,” Hailey said. “Jodi kidnapped me for the day though.”
She outlined her plan to return permanently to her daughter. The first step was the maternity home she initially resisted. It was her only option she saw to parent.
Less than a week later she checked into the St. Louis area facility. Spradley met her in the lobby with the baby.
The past several months have been hard on Spradley. Anxiety attacks bare themselves in the middle of the night. She worries over Hailey and her daughter. She worries over herself. When she first took in Hailey, there were days she wondered if the stress was too much and if she should send Hailey away. But now, the house feels devastatingly empty without her.
When Hailey was 11 weeks pregnant, she snuck Ash, the cat, into the house against Spradley’s wishes. At the time it infuriated Spradley, who was already having a difficult time feeding two humans and two dogs, making frequent trips to the food pantry. Then she saw how much comfort the cat brought Hailey as she faced an unknown future.
When Hailey was taken away, Spradley started letting the cat sleep beside her at night.
Over the years, Hailey ran from multiple family members and foster homes.
But she never ran from Spradley. It’s something Hailey’s social worker pointed out to Spradley in messages throughout Hailey’s pregnancy, and something Spradley continues to emphasize in her fight to bring Hailey and her daughter back under her roof.

It’s why Spradley wasn’t shocked when she learned at Hailey’s most recent placement hearing in mid-April that she had run away from the maternity home just hours earlier.
“I don’t believe what the system is doing to her… She is a child that’s been in that system for so long that they broke her,” Spradley said the next day, after police located Hailey and her daughter about 130 miles east, in south-central Illinois.
“Sometimes she makes me so mad,” Spradley continued, “but I just can’t blame her for what they did to her. I blame them. I blame the system.”
After Hailey and her daughter were located by the state, they were moved to another foster home, just outside St. Louis.
A few days later, Hailey said her case worker showed up with police, insisting her daughter was underweight and needed to be evaluated at the hospital. Spradley rushed to St. Louis Children’s Hospital to meet them. There, she said doctors gave the baby a clean bill of health and noted she gained weight since the week prior.
Then on Friday, hours after the Missouri Department of Social Services responded to a request for comment on Hailey’s case from The Independent, her case worker called Spradley. The state would soon allow Hailey and her daughter to return to Spradley’s care, at least until a court made a more permanent placement decision, Spradley said.
Despite the sudden good news, nothing about the family’s situation is set in stone.
“I’m scared about what tomorrow’s going to bring,” Spradley said Sunday.
She often reflects on words she spoke to Hailey’s mother not long before she died. Hailey was in a private foster home at the time.
“I promise you I’m going to bring Hailey home,” she said more than a decade ago.
It’s why Spradley didn’t hesitate when Hailey reached out for help. Though when asked about that decision, Hailey, who doesn’t tend toward sentimentality, said, “I knew she’d take my dumb ass.”
She flipped Spradley the bird. Spradley mirrored the motion.
“Me and Hailey, our relationship, even when she has hardships, I’m like, ‘I’m not letting you go,’” Spradley said. “I’m not giving up on you.”
It’s why Hailey chose Spradley to help raise her daughter.
She’s adamant her daughter won’t end up in the state’s care the way she did.
“What they’re doing is f**ked,” Hailey said of her lifetime spent in the foster system.
Spradley is ready to fight right there alongside her niece.
“We want her to experience an actual caring family and have support rather than toss you aside whenever they can’t handle you,” Spradley said. “If they can’t handle you at your worst, then they don’t deserve you at your best, right?”
