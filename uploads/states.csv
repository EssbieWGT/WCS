People living around the New Mexico State Fair grounds in the heart of Albuquerque should start imagining the 236-acre state-owned site, now mostly covered in asphalt and concrete and surrounded with tall stucco walls, with open green space, an inviting entrance, a park and a pond. 
Those stood among the common elements of early design concepts for the site during a presentation by design firm Stantec Thursday to a newly created state board that the Legislature endowed with up to $500 million in bonding capacity for a fairgrounds redevelopment project. 
Legislative leaders and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham touted the creation of the new district board as a way to convert the site where the State Fair currently happens once a year into a year-round income generator or site for mixed-income housing. In a statement after Senate Bill 481 was passed, the governor said redevelopment could provide “badly needed new housing for the workforce, while spurring massive private investment.”
Stantec officials , who are drafting a master plan, stressed that no design decisions have been made — particularly whether to move the State Fair from its home for more than 80 years — but they called on the public to imagine a transformation at the fairgrounds. It’s one that could be the impetus for change at the International District.
Potential relocation looms large over NM State Fair opening day

The area surrounding the fairgrounds has some of the deadliest intersections for pedestrians in New Mexico, and a recent Albuquerque police presentation detailed its high crime rates. It’s also a food desert, thanks in part to recent closures of a nearby CVS, Walgreens and Walmart, and a “heat island,” due to the lack of tree canopy and green space. The Trust for Public Lands also rates it as one of Albuquerque areas with the highest need for a public park. 
Nonetheless, the proposed redevelopment has proven controversial with some neighbors who told Source New Mexico that they are concerned the funding will do little to help the neighborhood, will uproot the historic annual State Fair and will, like past efforts at fairgrounds redevelopment, be a flop. According to the Albuquerque Journal, many voiced their concerns about the project at a meeting Stantec held Monday. 
Stantec designer Nancy Locke also released the results of a recent neighborhood survey, which found that nearby neighbors most want “safe, welcoming neighborhoods;” “economic prosperity for neighborhood residents;” and “public health and social services.” 
Instead of the current layout of the fairgrounds, which is 93% pavement, Locke listed off possibilities for the master plan, including designs for “livable density, incorporating agriculture, farming, youth programs, commercial areas that act as like a third place” as well as “open space, bike paths” and other transportation solutions that “get people out of their cars and get people walking.” 
Given how closed off the fairgrounds are from Central Avenue and the International District neighborhoods just beyond them, Locke said the firm thinks it’s important to establish a greater connection between the grounds and the neighborhood, as well as establish a large green space that could be used for multiple purposes.

“It ideally wears multiple hats,” she said of the new Central Avenue connection. “It serves multiple needs, and it will be driven, really, by what we’re hearing from the community going forward.”
Now that it is wrapping up its “analysis” phase, which includes market analysis and public engagement, the firm is moving toward its “master plan development phase,” Locke said. Options abound, she said. 
“There’s a whole range of opportunities that we can start to imagine and start to lay the base for,” she said Thursday. 
The board on Thursday also approved spending up to $22.5 million to acquire an eight-acre area on the southeast corner of the fairgrounds, which currently has about 17 parcels and 13 condominium units. Doing so is a necessary step as the board seeks approval for future spending, according to former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez, who is spearheading the project on behalf of Lujan Grisham.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0894-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 17:57:13.258819

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)As the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) prepares for major service cuts, State Police are investigating a crash involving a bus route that will soon cease part of its weekday service.
A route 14 bus flipped on its side in Jamestown at the end of the Pell Bridge on Thursday afternoon, sending three people to the hospital with minor injuries.
The crash was reported at 12:10 p.m. on Route 138 West near the E-ZPass plaza and Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority (RITBA) offices. A preliminary investigation found the left side of the bus struck a guardrail, causing it to cross the other westbound travel lanes and hit a light pole and the guardrail on the right shoulder, coming to rest on its left side in a parking lot behind RITBA’s offices.

Four people were on the bus, State Police Lt. Col. Robert Creamer confirmed in an email. Three of them, including the bus driver, were taken to Newport Hospital with minor injuries. One rider declined medical attention at the scene.
RIPTA spokesperson Cristy Raposo Perry said in an email that the agency deferred questions to the State Police. The bus had a capacity of 36 seats.
Sweeping service reductions are set to take effect Saturday across RIPTA’s network as a cost-cutting measure meant to avert bus driver layoffs due to a multimillion dollar budget shortfall. Service reductions include cutting some buses, reducing schedule spans, decreasing frequency, and getting rid of segments on 46 of its 67 lines — primarily impacting weekend and off-peak hours.
The 14 line connects Newport and Narragansett to Providence via the West Bay. Starting Saturday, weekday service between Routes 1A and 138 in North Kingstown and Salt Pond Plaza in Narragansett will be completely eliminated. Buses on the 14 line would still operate on weekends.
RITBA, the quasi-governmental agency responsible for overseeing the Pell Bridge, first closed the right lane of the westbound section of the highway at 1:08 p.m., according to a post on social media. Westbound traffic was fully shut down at 1:47 p.m. Both lanes reopened by 2:45 p.m.

Mike Kehoe, center, speaks to reporters Thursday during a visit to Columbia Regional Airport. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)The courts will determine if the bill revising Missouri’s congressional districts is constitutional, Gov. Mike Kehoe said Thursday after announcing his plans to sign the measure this weekend.
Speaking to reporters after an event in Columbia, Kehoe said he felt confident he was on firm legal ground when he called lawmakers into a special session.
“We’ll let the courts decide that,” Kehoe said. “We wouldn’t have went into this without feeling like we had good advice on that.”
Over 10 days this month, lawmakers met and passed a revised map for Missouri’s eight congressional districts so Republicans could have an advantage in the 5th District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat. 
“Missouri’s conservative, common-sense values should be truly represented at all levels of government, and the Missouri First Map delivers just that,” Kehoe said in a news release announcing he would sign the bill on Sunday.
Even before the special session began, legal challenges were being filed. The NAACP has a case argued Sept. 15 challenging Kehoe’s authority to have called a special session on redistricting. Additional court challenges are underway in Cole and Jackson counties seeking to have the new map declared void because the Missouri Constitution directs lawmakers to draw districts after the census every 10 years, but is silent on whether it can be done at other times.
Kehoe said he relied on his advisers on the legality of his decision to call a special session.
“I really believe they’re very good on these issues, and we think we’ll withstand all those challenges,” he said.
The case in Jackson County alleges the map is incorrect because a voting district designation is used twice in the bill. The court must decide if that is a mistake that scuttles the bill but Kehoe on Thursday said he believes it is a mistake in census mapping, not in the bill.
“Once you look at the map, if you just read the language, it doesn’t seem to make sense,” Kehoe said. “But if you read the language and you look at the map, you can see somewhere along the line there was some sort of error when they put those numbers on out of the 60,000 voting districts across the United States.”
As the case that is the most advanced in challenging the new map, the NAACP lawsuit is likely the first that will be decided. At an “emergency meeting” Wednesday, Missouri NAACP president Nimrod Chapel said the group will not waver in their effort to throw out Missouri’s new congressional map.
If successful, the lawsuit will not only get the new map tossed but also remove a proposed constitutional amendment from the ballot that would change the way majorities are counted for constitutional changes proposed by initiative petitions.
“We recognized instantly that gerrymandering in the state of Missouri targeted two Black congressional districts, Kansas City and St. Louis,” Chapel said. “Not only is this an attack on the most populated urban centers within the state of Missouri, but it’s also an attack on Black and brown voices whose needs are distinct, in some ways, from rural Missouri.”
Since the special session ended on Sept. 12, the NAACP has filed an amended petition asking for the map to be scrapped. The state’s attorney, Solicitor General Louis Capozzi, has said the lawsuit should be dismissed because lawmakers have already adjourned.
Chapel also said he believes that the use of the same voting district designation twice in the bill is a mistake that will undermine the new map.
“There is a map that’s been proposed and is sitting on the governor’s desk that cannot be signed,” Chapel said, “and the reason that it cannot be signed is because it has precincts that will get to vote on multiple occasions.”
Chapel said the NAACP is prepared to appeal the case to the Missouri Supreme Court if the judge sides with the governor.
“We’re suing them,” he said, “and we will keep suing them until they get it right.”

“It’s a critical step that the US and other nations recognize Palestinian statehood now,” said Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., in a statement Thursday.

Vermont’s three members of Congress are all calling on President Donald Trump and his administration to recognize an independent Palestinian state.
U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are among eight senators sponsoring a resolution that urges the White House “to recognize a demilitarized State of Palestine, as consistent with international law and the principles of a two-state solution, alongside a secure State of Israel.”
The resolution, which is led by Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, is the first of its kind in the Senate, Welch’s office said in a statement. Other than Sanders, all of its backers are Democrats.
Meanwhile, Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has signed onto a letter with dozens of her House Democratic colleagues asking the same of Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The existence of the House letter, which is led by Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., was first reported by The Guardian Thursday morning. A spokesperson for Balint’s office, Sophie Pollock, said later Thursday that Balint was among the signatories.
“Just as the lives of Palestinians must be immediately protected, so too must their rights as a people and nation urgently be acknowledged and upheld,” the letter says, according to The Guardian. “We encourage the governments of other countries that have yet to recognize Palestinian statehood, including the United States, to do so as well.”
The Guardian reported that Khanna plans to deliver the letter to Trump on Friday.
Welch’s and Sanders’ resolution has slim chances of advancing in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans. It’s also unlikely that either their resolution, or the letter circulating among Democrats in the GOP-controlled House, would ultimately persuade the White House to recognize a Palestinian state. 
Trump said Tuesday in remarks to the United Nations General Assembly, which is meeting in New York City this week, that recognizing Palestinian statehood amounts to “a reward” for Hamas, the group that governs Gaza and was responsible for the brutal terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.
Still, the U.S. legislators’ push comes as there has been growing international support in recent days for Palestinian statehood among major U.S. allies including Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Australia. A number of other countries have also granted that recognition during this week’s General Assembly.
In all, more than 150 countries recognize Palestine as its own state, though the U.S. is not among them. Recognition of Palestinian statehood is a largely symbolic gesture, though supporters have argued it will keep pressure on global leaders to work toward finding a two-state solution to the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which also encompasses dispute over control of the West Bank, not just the Gaza Strip.
The push for greater recognition comes nearly two years into Israel’s war in Gaza that, according to the latest estimates from local health authorities, has killed about 65,000 people in the Middle Eastern enclave. Israel’s military campaign has spurred rampant hunger in the region and destroyed vast swaths of Gaza’s infrastructure.
Last week, an independent United Nations commission concluded that Israel’s military has committed acts of genocide in Gaza since the October 2023 attack. All three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation then became some of the first among their colleagues to publicly label the country’s offensive as a genocide.
The delegation’s push also comes as five members of Vermont’s Legislature — Democrats and Republicans — joined legislators from other states across the country on a trip around Israel last week that was funded by the Israeli government.
Welch said in a statement submitted for the congressional record last week that while senators could not unilaterally recognize an independent Palestine on their own, his and Sanders’ resolution “aligns with the objective of nearly 80 years of United States policy: two independent states and lasting peace in the Middle East.”  
“The choice before us is clear: either we embrace the two-state solution or continue to support today’s relentless military occupation,” Welch said. “This horrible death and destruction in Gaza must stop. That is why the time for two states can be delayed no longer.”
Balint also echoed support for a two-state solution in a statement Thursday.
“This is the most viable path forward to find stability, peace and to hold all nations accountable to international law,” she said. “It’s a critical step that the US and other nations recognize Palestinian statehood now.”

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

State Rep. Ed Crockett enters Maine governor’s race as independent


By: Emma Davis - Thursday September 25, 2025 5:07 pm





Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. And, he’s the second sitting legislator who has unaffiliated from a political party to run as an independent.
Crockett, who until recently had been a Democrat, announced his intention to run for higher office in an op-ed earlier this summer, in which he condemned what he described as a Legislature “stuck in a morass of partisanship.” Crockett is approaching his eighth and final year serving in the Maine House of Representatives before he’ll be termed out.
That critique echoes why Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, formerly a Republican, similarly said he decided to run as an independent for governor earlier this year
With Crockett in the running, there are now 17 candidates in the open race to replace Gov. Janet Mills, who terms out in 2026. Crockett is the third independent, along with Bennett and John Glowa, a retired environmental specialist.

Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

Hannah Pingree officially launched her campaign for governor after months of speculation about the candidacy of the former Mills administration official and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

State Sen. James Libby is running in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Libby, who represents parts of Cumberland, Oxford and York counties, is one of five Republican candidates contending for the Blaine House, according to filings with the Maine Ethics Commission.
The race is already starting to get crowded, with the Democratic ticket drawing notable names including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, as well as Angus King III, the son of independent U.S. senator and former governor Angus King Jr., who announced his run earlier this month.
Libby is in the middle of his second consecutive term in the Senate, but he has also spent time as a state representative after being first elected to the Legislature in 1992. He also ran in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary.

“I’m so grateful to Governor Mills for the tremendous opportunity she gave me to dive into Maine’s biggest challenges and lead work across her administration to chart a path to solutions,” Pingree said in a news release from the governor’s office Thursday.
Though the release didn’t specify what Pingree plans to do next, she said she will “remain relentlessly focused on the future of the state we all love.” The Bangor Daily News has reported that Pingree is expected to throw her hat in the ring for the Democratic gubernatorial primary next year.

Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows officially announces bid for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 26, 2025 7:53 am





Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced her run for governor in 2026, becoming the first major Democratic candidate to throw her hat in the ring.
During her address early Wednesday at the official launch event at the Hancock Community Center, Bellows said “we need leaders who will meet the moment.”
“Because while we’re paying our taxes or helping our parents measure out their medication, our country is being demolished by a greedy, unelected billionaire who thinks his dollars are more powerful than our voices…Who thinks the value of his stock portfolio matters more than the values of our community.”

,DC,2025-09-25 20:59:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Democrats argue in court for unannounced visits to immigration detention facilities,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-argue-court-unannounced-visits-immigration-detention-facilities,,"WASHINGTON — Attorneys on behalf of a dozen U.S. House Democrats Thursday pushed for a federal judge to force the Trump administration to comply with an appropriations law that allows for unannounced oversight visits at Department of Homeland Security facilities that detain immigrants.  “We don’t know what detention will look like in the future,” said Christine Coogle, a senior staff attorney for the group Democracy Forward, which represents the lawmakers.Coogle argued before federal Judge Jia Cobb that because of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, the number of immigrants detained has ballooned. Coogle said that Democrats’ ability to conduct oversight visits without preapproval is not only needed, but already signed into law.  The suit, filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia, charges that the Trump administration has overreached its authority in creating a policy to require members of Congress give DHS seven days’ notice, plus approval from an agency official, before visiting a facility where immigrants are detained. The suit also argues that the DHS policy is unlawful due to the appropriations law.  DOJ argues against DemsAppearing on behalf of the Trump administration, Department of Justice attorney Alexander Resar said that the entire case will be moot in three business days, citing the looming government shutdown by next week. He argued that because the appropriations law will expire, lawmakers will not have the authority to conduct oversight provided under that provision. Coogle pushed back and said that even the House’s seven-week continuing resolution to avoid a partial government shutdown, passed last week, contained the oversight provision.“We expect it to be included,” in the fiscal year 2026 appropriations, Coogle said. Resar also argued that because that provision is attached to appropriations law, the administration views it as not as enforceable as a separate law passed by Congress.  He added that Congress has multiple tools to conduct oversight of DHS facilities, such as withdrawing funding from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or impeaching officials. Republicans control both chambers in Congress as well as the White House. Cobb questioned why two administrations, that of Biden and the first Trump administration, signed the appropriations bills into law for the past five years if they had an issue with the provision.Resar said because the provision is attached to an appropriations bill, the Trump administration argues that it doesn’t reach the level of statutory authority. Blocked from entryDemocrats detailed in their suit that since June, DHS officials have blocked them from entering facilities that detain immigrants. Coogle said members of Congress being able to show up unannounced is an important tool, as in the past lawmakers have detailed how DHS has quickly made changes in preparation for planned visits. She said some of those changes include painting facilities and moving detainees.Resar argued that “if the facilities are being changed for the better,” then planned visits seem beneficial overall. The oversight policy that allows members of Congress to show up unannounced at DHS facilities that detain immigrants, including ICE field offices, stems from the first Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the southern border in 2018. At that time, Democrats such as Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas, who represents the border town of El Paso, were unable to conduct interviews with separated immigrant families and often denied entry into the facilities. That led to the inclusion of a provision in the fiscal year 2019 appropriations law that codified a member of Congress’ ability to conduct in-person oversight visits at DHS facilities where minors were detained. The provision later was expanded to include all immigrants detained at DHS facilities, not just children, and allowed for unannounced visits by members and the inclusion of congressional staff to enter with their members during oversight visits.Twelve Democratic House members are part of the suit including Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J. Luis Correa of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Veronica Escobar of Texas, Dan Goldman of New York, Jimmy Gomez of California, Raul Ruiz of California, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Norma Torres of California.",,,,2025-09-25 17:57:13.258819

Markey: Pass the torch,James Nichols-Worley and Milan Singh,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/sen-markey-pass-the-torch/,"HAD JOE BIDEN won re-election, he would have been 86 years and two months old at the end of his term. That is four months younger than Sen. Ed Markey would be at the end of the new six-year term he plans to seek next year.  Five years ago, we were too young to vote, […]","HAD JOE BIDEN won re-election, he would have been 86 years and two months old at the end of his term. That is four months younger than Sen. Ed Markey would be at the end of the new six-year term he plans to seek next year. 
Five years ago, we were too young to vote, but both of us supported Sen. Markey in his 2020 Democratic primary race against Rep. Joe Kennedy III. We felt that, since both candidates agreed on all of the big issues, there was no good reason other than ambition driving Kennedy’s challenge, especially since many at the time thought that this would be Sen. Markey’s final campaign.  
We appreciate the senator’s work over his decades in public service, particularly his advocacy on environmental issues. But five years later, it’s time for him to pass the torch to a new generation. 
Our Commonwealth and our country face great challenges over the coming years: a cost-of-living crisis that is pricing young people out of our state; an increasingly violent and unstable world; and new technologies that will reshape our society, for good and for ill. These are difficult problems without simple solutions. We should be making way for younger leaders to help shape the future that they, and those even younger than them, will be contending with long after today’s oldest elected officials are gone. 
Several other Senate Democrats have chosen retirement in recent years. Maryland’s Ben Cardin (80), Delaware’s Tom Carper (77), and West Virginia’s Joe Manchin (77) all declined to run again last year. Already this year, four more announced they would not seek re-election in 2026: Illinois’s Dick Durbin (80), New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen (78), Minnesota’s Tina Smith (67), and Michigan’s Gary Peters (66). Sen. Markey is older than all but two of them. In fact, he’s the oldest Democratic senator seeking reelection next year.  
Judging our elected officials solely by their age does have its limits. Take former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, now 85, who is still playing an influential role in California and national politics as a member of Congress after relinquishing her role as the leader of House Democrats. Sen.  Markey, for his part, has parried criticism with an oft-repeated rejoinder: “It’s not your age, it’s the age of your ideas,” which has become something of a campaign mantra.  
This line of thinking resonated with us and many other young people in 2020, who admired Sen.  Markey’s bold politics, but it has run its course. Although the senator gave a vigorous speech at the Democratic State Convention earlier this month in Springfield and seems, by all accounts, in good health, his steadfast determination to run for reelection papers over the immense uncertainty surrounding his age and betrays a lack of confidence in his potential successors. 
According to actuarial data collected by the Social Security Administration, an American male aged 87 has about a one in eight chance of dying in the following year. An 82-year-old male — the age Sen. Markey would be at the start of his next six-year term — has a life expectancy of just seven years. One-third of Americans over the age of 85 suffer from some form of dementia. 
As we’ve seen all too often in recent years, there are real risks when public officials remain in office well into old age. Just this year, three House Democrats have died in office. Towards the end of her career, the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who died while still in office at age 90, was reported to be “bewildered or disengaged” and suffering from diminished capabilities. And in the case that put the issue front and center for all Americans to see, the Joe Biden of six years ago is unrecognizable compared to the one we saw in the disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump last summer. 
We’re not alone in holding these concerns. A poll from the University of New Hampshire found that 55 percent of Massachusetts voters — including 57 percent of Democrats, 51 percent of independent voters, and 55 percent of Republicans — are concerned about Senator Markey’s age. The same poll found that 43 percent of Massachusetts voters do not think that Sen. Markey deserves reelection, compared with 33 percent who think he does and 25 percent who are unsure.  
Even among those who think Sen. Markey deserves to be reelected, nearly half — 48 percent — are concerned about his age. A recent poll of voters under 30 found that two of the top three (out of 31) best-testing democracy reform proposals were term limits for Congress and an age limit of 75 for elected officials generally.    
Despite this, Sen. Markey has managed to trot out endorsements from across the state, and his campaign has sent half a dozen emails asking volunteers to “personally endorse Senator Ed Markey.” Before meetings with Sen. Markey earlier this year, volunteers and activists were asked to appear in videos for the campaign endorsing him. One of us was contacted personally to participate in such a video. 
Sen. Markey’s insistence on running again — despite clear concern from voters about his age —  is essentially a statement that he alone is the only Democrat who can serve the people of Massachusetts. With all due respect, we just don’t think that’s true. 
Massachusetts has a deep bench of would-be candidates who share Sen. Markey’s commitment to the Democratic Party’s values — standing up for regular people, trying to pass laws that make our lives just a little bit easier, and fighting against the abuses of the Trump administration.  
Not waiting for the seat to open up, Rep. Seth Moulton is reportedly considering challenging Sen. Markey in next year’s Democratic primary. Among other potential Senate candidates who share Sen. Markey’s core commitments, some, like Rep. Ayanna Pressley, adhere to the senator’s particular brand of progressivism; others, like Rep. Jake Auchincloss, have embraced newer ideas like the Abundance agenda.  
Sen. Markey has had a long and honorable career in public service. But we believe that it is time for him to step aside. Nothing could do more to invigorate the Massachusetts Democratic Party at this challenging time for our country than to give voters a chance to choose a nominee – and hopefully their next senator — in a competitive, open primary election.

Dairy manufacturer HP Hood has confirmed it plans to close the Booth Bros. manufacturing plant in Barre in April. 
The Booth Bros. facility, which bottles different milk varieties, has been operating in Barre since 1946 and was sold to Hood in 1997. Approximately 50 employees will be affected by the closure, Hood spokesperson Lynne Bohan said in an email. 
Hood decided on the closure after a review of the company’s milk operations in the Northeast, Bohan said. 
“Hood carefully reviewed each of its fluid plant’s geographic locations, current production capacity, as well as rising infrastructure costs,” she said.

She added that Hood is working to transition the manufacturing in Barre to other Hood plants. The company has 11 other plants listed on its website, located in New England, New York, Virginia and California. The company also still plans to manufacture Booth Bros.-branded products and sell them in Vermont, Bohan said.

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)Federal immigration officials are reportedly considering building a detention facility at the controversial Franklin County state prison site, further frustrating locals who say they’ve been left in the dark by state officials once again.
Franklin County Sheriff Johnny Crocker told the Advocate Thursday that Chief Deputy Jon Little was patrolling the area Monday when he encountered three Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from the agency’s New Orleans office at the entrance of the site. Joe Profiri, a special adviser to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the former secretary of the Department of Corrections, arrived a few minutes later, and he and the agents entered the property.
Describing the agents as “super friendly,” Crocker said they told Little they were looking at potentially building a migrant detention facility at the Franklin County prison site.
“And Jon goes, ‘Well, man, this may not be up for the next three to five years. If the prison even goes in, there’s still a lot of things going on,’” Crocker said. “And the ICE agent stated, ‘No, we can have this up very quickly, we’ll put a temporary one up first.’”
Crocker said that when Profiri arrived, the former corrections secretary did not want to talk to the chief deputy. Profiri acted aggravated that Little was there, Crocker said.
Arkansas legislators skeptical of prison site selection, frustrated over absence of Sanders staff

Local officials were not informed that the 815-acre site was being considered for use as an immigration detention facility, Crocker said.  The sheriff expressed deep displeasure with how the prison saga has been handled, calling the lack of information “cowardly” and dishonest. He said he supports Sanders in general as a conservative, but “I do not support this.”
“It frustrates me that leading individuals of this state are being very quiet and very sneaky and lying to the people of this state, and it needs to be fixed,” Crocker said.
“Be transparent with people, let them know what’s going on,” he said. “Taxpayers should have input. We don’t live under a … dictator. What they’ve done is wrong.”
Crocker’s attitude reflects the opinions of many Franklin County officials and residents, who’ve complained they were blindsided by Sanders’ announcement of the nearly $3 million purchase of the property on Oct. 31, 2024.
The site is unworkable, Crocker added, because there’s “no water there,” nor are there local utilities that can provide water. “They’re going to put them in a cattle pasture. That’s what this place is,” he said. “They spent $100 million on nothing, so is this their bailout? That’s my question.”
Franklin County water well testing summary released

The state Legislature previously appropriated $75 million toward prison capital improvements but failed this year to appropriate a requested $750 million specifically for the proposed mega-prison. In addition to the $2.9 million cost of the property, the Board of Corrections hired Vanir Construction Management as its new prison project manager on a four-year, $16.5 million contract. The board also approved a $57-million design contract for the prison, but the Arkansas Legislative Council has not yet taken it up for final approval.
Governor’s office comment
When asked to confirm whether the site visit with Profiri occurred, Sam Dubke, Sanders’ spokesperson, did not explicitly confirm or deny it, nor did he answer specific questions about the state’s discussions with ICE regarding the site and what actions had been taken to consult with local officials.
“Governor Sanders’ Administration is in ongoing conversations with the Trump Administration and federal immigration officials on how to best support the President’s work to secure the border and get violent, criminal illegal aliens off our streets,” Dubke wrote in a text message to the Advocate.
Local officials weren’t the only ones who didn’t know about the visit or potential for an immigration detention facility. The state Department of Corrections was also left in the dark, according to spokesperson Rand Champion.
“The Department became aware of reports of a site visit late Wednesday,” Champion told the Advocate in a text message Thursday. “To my knowledge we have not been involved in those discussions as it would fall under federal jurisdiction.”
Adam Watson, an outspoken opponent of the prison project and director of online site Gravel and Grit, pointed to ICE’s visit as another example of Sanders’ office not consulting with local communities or the state officials who oversee state prisons on major decisions impacting their communities.
Watson said he had no clue what the end game was in allowing ICE to potentially use the site, but that it does nothing to change the minds of people in the local community about the prison. The site, he said, is still completely unsuitable for either a federal or state facility, pointing to concerns about a lack of available water, and other utilities and infrastructure.
“I don’t know if the governor thought that this was going to be something to garner additional support from such a conservative community” by working to assist with immigration detentions, Watson said. “But it’s been exactly the opposite, so if that was the intent, it backfired.”
Franklin County radio station KDYN was first to report about ICE’s visit Thursday morning. Many commenters on KDYN’s Facebook post about the visit seemed to agree with Watson’s and Crocker’s concerns.
“I have more objections to this than a regular prison!” Emily A Barton wrote.
Some commenters conjectured that Arkansas might be allowing immigration detention in order to reduce the cost of constructing the proposed 3,000-bed prison. The most recent estimates peg construction costs at $825 million.
“[P]robably running out of money to get it up and running,” David Kathleen Hedges wrote. “If they get federal money involve[d] it takes care of their problem. The people we voted in obviously don’t care about we the people. Whatever it takes to get their prison built is what they will do.”
Even people who say they support the prison weren’t enthused.
“I support the prison but it’s pretty ridiculous that they are doing all this behind our county administration’s back,” RD Brooks wrote.
U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman’s office said: “We have not been contacted by any officials from the state or federal government regarding an ICE facility in Franklin County.”
ICE’s New Orleans office and national headquarters did not immediatley respond to a request for comment.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia traveled to Alachua County Thursday, where he said his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team of auditors had determined that the local government had indulged in more than $84 million in “wasteful spending” over the past five years.
He said that meant that the county’s general fund budget has grown by $140 million since 2019-2020, or 77%. Gainesville is the county seat.
But as has been the case with the other local government budgets that Ingoglia’s team has reviewed this year, he did not mention any specific programs that constituted what he defined as wasteful spending.
“I will tell you that I was at a meeting this morning and I have seen some of the things that your local government is spending money, and I can assure you that I think the taxpayers would be very unhappy with what they’re spending the money on,” he said.
When pressed by a reporter to give his definition of a superfluous program, Ingoglia wouldn’t do so.
“It’s not our job to micromanage,” he said. “The people who should be micromanaging are the people who get paid to micromanage.”
This was Ingoglia’s fourth preliminary report of a local government’s alleged overspending announced since last month, shortly after he was appointed to serve as CFO by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
On Wednesday, he claimed that Hillsborough County had overspent by nearly $279 million. Last week, he alleged that Orange County had overspent by more than $190 million, and the city of Jacksonville’s government by $200 million.
The announcements are taking place as he (and the governor) travel up and down the state making the case that Floridians should vote next year for a (still to be written) constitutional amendment to eliminate or severely reduce property taxes.
One thing that Ingoglia did not mention during his press conference is the fact that, for the ninth consecutive year, the Alachua County Commission has reduced its countywide property tax millage rate. In the $947 million Fiscal Year 2026 budget approved earlier this year week, leaders reduced the rate by 15%.
“Approving this budget is a testament to our commitment to fiscal responsibility and community priorities,” said Commission Chair Charles Chestnut IV in a written statement. “I am proud that we have reduced the millage rate for the ninth consecutive year in our ongoing efforts to ease the tax burden on residents while still funding essential services like public safety, infrastructure, and programs that enhance our residents’ quality of life.”
Alachua County officials said immediately after Ingoglia’s press conference that they weren’t prepared to provide any formal response.
“We listened to the press conference and we will take the next couple of days to check on what he has to say,” said Mark Sexton, the county communications director.
Ingoglia has been making the case that local governments are overspending to preempt criticism by local government officials that reducing property taxes would severely harm basic government services that they pay for, such as police, fire, parks and recreation, libraries, and public health.
Local government officials in other parts of the state have defended their increased budgets in recent years, citing inflation and rising population.
“We’ve already accounted for fire and police,” Ingoglia said Thursday, anticipating that’s what local officials in Alachua may claim.
“As populations grow, you are going to need more fire. You are going to need more police,” he acknowledged. “What it doesn’t mean is that you’re going to need more bureaucrats. And that’s what we have seen. A lot of these governments are expanding the bureaucracy, not necessarily the things that they are supposed to be funding.”
Ingoglia noted that the focus has been on property taxes generated from the general fund budget, not including school boards. “I will tell you from some of the numbers that I have seen, the school boards are some of the biggest, wasteful spenders that I have seen.”

Leaders in Gov. Phil Scott’s administration are coming up with a plan for how to handle out-of-state employees in the governor’s return-to-office initiative. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Data: How many Vermont state government employees live out of state?.","Starting Dec. 1, state employees will need to return to the office at least three days per week, part of a new hybrid work schedule proposed by Gov. Phil Scott. But where do they currently reside?
As part of the return-to-office process, Scott created an advisory group of state leaders to hash out the logistics of the policy change. Among the lingering questions: how to handle government employees who live out of state, a population that’s grown since the Covid-19 pandemic normalized remote work for many. 
Administration officials said they have not yet figured out how to handle the hybrid schedule for out-of-state workers. Beth Fastiggi, Department of Human Resources commissioner, declined an interview request, citing the ongoing work of the advisory group.

The Vermont State Employees’ Association, the union representing state workers, opposes the hybrid back-to-office plan. What matters is that work gets done, not where it gets done, according to Steve Howard, the union’s executive director.
“We’ve been benefiting from their talent and experience, and there’s no reason to uproot them,” he said of out-of-state employees. 
According to Howard, many state workers who live far from Vermont either previously worked locally and would have left state service if not for remote work, or they fill positions that are hard to recruit. 
To be sure, many out-of-state employees regularly report to a Vermont job site. Of the 552 state employees who lived out of state as of September 2025, 433 lived across Vermont’s borders in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York or Quebec. But another 119 lived further afield in states like Florida or North Carolina. As of this month, state employees reside in 31 different states and one Canadian province. 
Many out-of-state workers are also seasonally employed. 
The number of out-of-state workers has risen significantly over the past few years. In 2019, just before the Covid pandemic began, Vermont hired 559 out-of-state employees throughout the year. Five years later, the state reported hiring 753 out-of-state workers through the course of 2024. 
The top department for out-of-state employees was the Department of Corrections, followed by the Department of Children and Families and the Department of Health.

(AP) — 911 systems across Mississippi and Louisiana were down Thursday afternoon, authorities said.
The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said AT&T was reporting damage to some of its fiber optic lines and that was affecting 911 services across the state. Across Louisiana, 911 phone lines are also down. The state’s most populous cities, including Baton Rouge and New Orleans, reported emergency system outages Thursday afternoon.
“We are assessing now as crews for AT&T are on the ground making repairs,” agency spokesperson Scott Simmons said.
“We’re aware of service issues for some customers in areas of Mississippi and Louisiana. Additional information will be provided as soon as it’s available,” an AT&T spokesperson said in an email.
Law enforcement agencies across both states took to social media, urging people to call local phone numbers if they were experiencing an emergency.
Mike Steele, spokesperson for the Louisiana Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the agency “is standing by if there are any requests for and there have been no requests for local support from our parishes at this time.”
“Nothing I’ve seen indicates a cyberattack,” Steele said.
St. Tammany Parish Sheriff’s Office also reported its 911 and non-emergency lines “are down” according to an X post.
The Emergency Communications Center for New Orleans said on their social media page that the outage was due to the cutting of a 911 “fiber line.”
Baton Rouge Mayor Sid Edwards said most parishes in the state are being affected by the outage. St. Tammany Parish Sheriff’s Office also reported its 911 and non-emergency lines “are down” according to an X post.
In southwest Louisiana, the Cameron Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness urged people using “cellular devices” to contact a local number for emergencies due to a “massive phone outage.” But the agency said that calls to 911 via a landline “will still go through.”
Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office is one agency where their 911 line is still operation. The department said in a statement that they use the “Next Generation 911” system – which is a “complete overhaul” of the current system, replacing “legacy copper wire technology.”
In the meantime, residents in impacted areas are urged to call alternative emergency service numbers, posted by law enforcement on social media, as needed.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/25153740/priscilla-du-preez-BjhUu6BpUZA-unsplash.jpg,,,2025-09-25 16:57:43.102491

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — The state Broadband Office is preparing to hook into the information superhighway the last remaining South Carolina homes and businesses without high-speed internet access.
The public has until just before midnight Friday to comment on the state’s plan, which state broadband chief Jim Stritzinger called “the anchor leg of the broadband investment relay race here in South Carolina.” The office will then submit for final approval the plan for spending it’s share of a $42 billion federal grant program.
The milestone is one to celebrate. Still, how the state plans to link up about half of its final locations raises concerns about affordability and reliability, some broadband groups say.
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of broadband and the state’s digital divide. Without high-speed internet, people couldn’t work or attend classes amid closures. In rural areas where healthcare access is thin, patients are increasingly turning to virtual visits with doctors. But being diagnosed by a physician over a video call is nearly impossible without a good connection.
Legislators recognized broadband was a critical need, not a luxury. In response, they designated $490 million over two years toward extending accessibility statewide, the bulk of it from federal COVID aid packages. The biggest single chunk — $400 million approved in May 2022 — came from the $2.5 billion that flowed to state coffers from the American Rescue Plan.
People across SC connected to high-speed internet with $400M: ‘It completely transformed us’

With that $400 million, combined with $263 million in private investment, state-contracted companies added high-speed internet access to more than 117,000 homes, businesses and community buildings, such as schools and libraries.
When that money ran dry last year, there were about 20,480 locations still without a connection, according to the latest data from the state Broadband Office — down from an earlier estimate of about 32,000.
Infrastructure funds for broadband
The state then turned its attention to another federal grant program — Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) — funded through the federal Infrastructure Investment spending package passed by Congress in November 2021.
That program, pushed by U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., brought $551.5 million into the state, but under the final plan up for review, the state says it needs only a fraction — 7.5% — of it.
According to the Broadband Office, which the Legislature officially created in 2021, the state’s early investments of pandemic relief funds toward broadband, starting with $50 million in June 2020, provided a head start. Private companies also have expanded their service areas and made investments that helped fill in gaps.
What will become of the remaining funds is unknown.
States were supposed to be allowed to use leftover funds to pay for things other than broadband deployment. But the federal telecommunications agency has not yet released guidance since the Trump administration revised the rules in June.
“There’s a lot of fear right now that (the National Telecommunications and Information Administration) may try to call that money back, which would be a big shame,” Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute for Broadband in the Chicago area, told States Newsroom affiliate Stateline.
South Carolina is far from the only state with a potential surplus:

In Oklahoma, critics noticed the updated plan would not be using $225 million of the state’s allocated funds.
In Nevada, that number is nearly $250 million.
Arizona — $481 million left over
Kentucky — $623 million
Mississippi — $633 million
Louisiana — $750 million
North Carolina — $1 billion

And the list goes on, according to the Benton Institute, which has been tracking these plans.
Most of the state plans do not mention how they would like to spend the remaining funds.
But Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, in a letter sent earlier this month, asked the U.S. Department of Commerce, which administers the program, to allow states to spend it on artificial intelligence efforts and education and workforce initiatives. Louisiana also previously sought to spend the funds on rural healthcare.
Program changes
The program changes implemented by the Trump administration, which put a focus on driving down costs as much as possible, also has led to other shifts, said Alex Karras, a researcher with the Broadband Expanded project at New York Law School. Namely, more states have turned to satellite internet companies that cost less to build but tend to have more uneven service than underground fiber optic cable, favored for its speed and durability.
That includes Elon Musk’s Starlink, which states could award about $10 billion worth of projects nationwide, according to The Wall Street Journal. There’s also Amazon’s Project Kuiper, which has yet to start service as it has struggled to get satellites into space, the Journal also reported.
Under South Carolina’s state plan, the two tech giants are in line for $7.9 million worth of contracts, covering 49% of the remaining unserved homes and businesses. While these locations are scattered across the state, there are clusters in the rural areas surrounding Greenville, Columbia, Florence and Orangeburg, as well as Cherokee, Darlington, and Hampton counties, that will rely on the satellites for service, according to a map put out by the Broadband Office.
It’s a bird, it’s a plane. No, it’s broadband!

While not as fast as fiber-optic cables, the satellites could reach parts of the state where installing cables is difficult, Stritzinger has previously said.
And though satellite internet makes up a large chunk of this latest investment round, it accounts for less than 1% of the locations where the state has worked to add service, according to the Broadband Office.
Whether satellite internet technology will be able to consistently meet the minimum speed requirements under the federal program remains in question. In a Starlink test program, only 17.4% of users were getting high enough speeds over the first three months of 2025, according to an analysis by Ookla, a company that measures internet speeds.
However, the analysis noted, the company’s speeds have increased significantly over the past several years. The challenge will be maintaining that speed as the company adds more customers.
“If four out of five subscribers aren’t getting broadband speeds today, what do people think is going to happen when you add in hundreds of thousands of new users?” Sascha Meinrath, a professor at Penn State and co-author of a recent study questioning whether Starlink, the internet division of SpaceX, can meet the program’s requirements, told Spotlight Pennsylvania.
Also under the program rule changes, while internet providers must still offer low-cost residential service options, states no longer have the power to dictate the rates.

Amazon has yet to publicize the rates it plans to charge when its satellite system is operational. In the test program, Starlink gave free equipment, valued at $350, to each user who agreed to sign up for a one-year plan that cost $120 per month for higher speeds and $80 per month for lower ones.
A grant program offering low-income families a $100 discount to buy equipment and a $30 monthly discount on their internet bill ended last year without additional funding from Congress.
Remaining locations
While states have been finalizing their plans this month, rollout of the BEAD program was delayed after the Trump administration asked states to recheck their list of unserved locations to search for duplications and other unnecessary service areas.
For South Carolina, that proved to be a useful exercise. The state found about 12,000 locations that no longer needed service, according to Broadband Expanded.
The vast majority of those — about 6,790 locations — already received service via high-speed fiber installed during other projects funded by COVID relief dollars or a state-funded grant program.
Another 3,370 locations already had privately funded internet access. And about 1,800 were mistakes and duplications on the map.
A smaller portion of the locations were found to be structures that didn’t actually need service — garages, barns, grain silos, demolished or uninhabitable buildings.
Once the final round is complete, the federal dollars, combined with state, and private investments, will have added service to more than 200,000 locations statewide, Stritzinger said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/internet-access-300x200-1.jpeg,,,2025-09-25 16:57:43.102491

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas utility regulators on Thursday approved Evergy’s request to increase rates by $128 million, which will raise the average residential electric bill about $8.47 each month. 
The Kansas Corporation Commission approved the unanimous settlement agreement that had been reached in the case, although Commissioner Dwight Keen filed a partial dissent.   
The decision was reached after public hearings, negotiations between intervenors in the case and evidentiary hearings before the commission. The case was opened in January, with Evergy initially asking for a base rate increase of $192 million of total retail revenue.
The order did not set a recommended return on equity for investors but set a 9.7% return on equity to be used for transmission delivery charges, which covers costs associated with building and maintaining the transmission system.
Keen partially dissented from Thursday’s order because he thought the 9.7% return on equity to be too high. 
“In my opinion, this ROE is excessive and may present ongoing affordability issues for all EKC (Evergy Kansas Central) customer classes – in particular the most burdened and vulnerable residential retail and small general service ratepayer (SGS) classes,” Keen wrote in his dissent.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A New York City charter school network will set up shop in Miami now that the Florida Legislature and Board of Education have lowered standards for “Schools of Hope” to operate near low-performing schools. 
The development comes months after a last-minute effort by legislators to expand the area and scope that Schools of Hope (publicly funded and privately operated charter schools that may open in areas adjacent to “persistently low performing” traditional public schools) may serve.
During a news conference Thursday in Miami, Gov. Ron DeSantis, Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, and Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas were joined by Success Academy’s CEO Eva Moskowitz and Citadel hedge fund founder and CEO Ken Griffin, who will donate $50 million for the schools to come to Miami. 
“Ken, you’re not only helping the children of Miami and the Sunshine State, but you’re sending a national message, like the governor, that children, poor children, matter, that excellence matters, that the American dream matters and it’s time to get going,” Moskowitz, a former New York City Council member, said. 
Success Academy operates about 60 K-12 charter schools in New York and pumps out high-performing students, although it has been criticized for weeding out students in a way that traditional public schools cannot based on behavior and parental involvement. 
According to Success Academy, the majority of its 22,000 students “are from low-income households in New York City’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods” through “a random public lottery.”
“Today, we are proving that all children, no matter their background, no matter their zip code, no matter where they live, they can have access to a world-class education,” Kamoutsas said.
The governor praised the move as a major addition to the state’s school-choice ecosystem, which critics have derided for straining the budgets and enrollment of traditional public schools.
DeSantis insisted that when traditional public schools lose students to charter schools, “then they’re going to have to do something to earn the trust of those parents back.”
Success Academy will open its first schools in Miami for the 2027-2028 school year. The Miami Herald reported that the charter organization hopes to have three to five schools operating by then.
“Competition drives excellence, a rising tide floats all boats. When good people and good organizations step up beside us to help push forward and lead, everybody gets stronger because of it. Having Ken Griffin and Success Academy come to Florida is just that catalyst. It’s an opportunity to push things forward, to achieve greatness, to push boundaries that we maybe haven’t hit that much yet,” Collins said. 
The law, SB 2510, passed during the extended legislative session in June, was implemented by the State Board of Education on Wednesday. It allows schools of hope to open in low-income zones, or even outside of such zones if there is a suitable underused, vacant, or surplus facility, and in the attendance zone of a “persistently low performing school.” 
Under the new law, “hope operators,” like Success Academy, are allowed to open inside of vacant spaces inside public schools at no cost. School districts must provide custodial, maintenance, safety, food, nursing, and transportation services if the school of hope requests it.
The law expanded the criteria for what defines a persistently low-performing school. According to The Florida Times-Union, the change increased the number of those schools by 423%, jumping from 51 in 2024 to 267 in 2025, meaning there are more spaces for Success Academy to step in and receive public funds to operate. 
Independent reporter Jason Garcia reported that Success Academy lobbied the Legislature, including providing bill language. 
Garcia also reports that Griffin made nearly $30 million in campaign contributions in the state during the 2024 elections, including $12 million to a political committee that opposed the proposed state constitutional amendment to legalize recreational marijuana, which the governor strongly opposed.
He also gave $4 million to Senate President Ben Albritton’s campaign committee, and the same amount to House Speaker Daniel Perez’s campaign committee.
Griffin, born in Florida, founded Citadel in Chicago in the 1990s. He moved Citadel to Miami in 2022.
“I think Miami’s just the beginning, I think where there’s needs around this state, I think you’re going to see Success Academy make a big, big difference,” DeSantis said.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Following a sojourn in two separate committees, legislation permitting the Attorney General to investigate and enforce campaign finance violations against the Secretary of State is heading back to the Michigan House floor. 
House Bill 4642 was put forth by Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Caledonia), the chair of the House Election Integrity Committee, after the Michigan Department of Attorney General determined Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson violated campaign finance law. 
Although the department determined Benson’s decision to hold a press conference launching her campaign for governor in the lobby of the Austin Building – which houses the Department of State – was a violation of Michigan Campaign Finance Act, the Department of Attorney General noted that it did not hold the legal authority to impose civil or criminal penalties on Benson. 
Violations of the act are usually investigated and resolved by the Secretary of State while the attorney general is charged with investigating complaints involving the Secretary of State. However, the law was silent on how the Department of Attorney General should resolve a complaint against the Secretary of State if it’s determined that a violation occurred.
Rigas’ bill amends the Michigan Campaign Finance Act to grant the attorney general the same authority in investigating and resolving campaign finance violations. Similar legislation was introduced in the state Senate by Sen. Jonathan Lindsey (R-Allen). 
“No one, especially not the Secretary of State, should be immune from accountability. We’re fixing a broken system to ensure fairness and uphold the law,” Rigas said in a statement when the bill was introduced. 
While the bill was initially referred to the House Election Integrity Committee, it was later referred to the Rules committee, with all nine members agreeing on Wednesday to send the matter to the House floor for further consideration.

In a news release, the sheriff’s office said Taylor’s campaign manager reported earlier in the day that the campaign had received a text message threatening the delegate’s life. Investigators developed a suspect and arrested Strawmeyer at 2:15 p.m. 
He is being held without bond at Meherrin River Regional Jail in Alberta, pending an initial appearance in Dinwiddie County General District Court.
Taylor’s campaign said she is safe and praised law enforcement for its swift action.
“Earlier today, Delegate Kim Taylor received a politically motivated death threat by text message to her campaign. Our campaign takes every threat seriously and this was no exception. Thanks to the Sheriff’s Department and law enforcement partners, the individual responsible is already in custody,” campaign spokesperson Jacklyn Washington said in a statement.
“Delegate Taylor is safe and doing well,” Washington added. “She is grateful for the decisive action of law enforcement and remains focused on serving her constituents. No threat will distract her from the work she was elected to do.”
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger also condemned the threat. “I am horrified to hear about the death threat made against Delegate Kim Taylor — and I am relieved to hear that the suspect is now in custody,” Spanberger wrote on social media. “I am thinking of Delegate Taylor and her family, and I am grateful for our local law enforcement who worked swiftly on this case.”
Taylor, a Republican delegate since 2022, represents the 82nd District, which covers parts of Chesterfield, Dinwiddie and Prince George counties, along with the city of Petersburg and parts of Hopewell. She won her seat in a 2021 upset against Del. Lashrecse Aird, a Democrat, a victory that helped Republicans regain control of the House of Delegates.
She was narrowly re-elected in 2023 after a recount confirmed her 53-vote edge over Democratic challenger Kimberly Pope Adams. Earlier this year, Taylor drew attention as one of five Republican delegates who joined Democrats in supporting legislation to safeguard same-sex marriage in Virginia.
Away from politics, Taylor is a small business owner who operates car repair shops with her husband, Butch, employing about 30 people. On her campaign website, she highlights her work on school safety legislation, efforts to support victims of human trafficking, and votes for broad tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks.
Law enforcement officials said the investigation into the threat remains ongoing.

A press release from the Department of Corrections said McLain died by “apparent suicide.” He was found unresponsive in his cell, the release said, and taken to a Sioux Falls hospital, where he died.

On Tuesday, inmate Kaleb Lukkes, 25, was found unresponsive in his South Dakota State Penitentiary cell. 
“This death is being aggressively investigated in collaboration with the Division of Criminal Investigation and the DOC Office of the Inspector General,” Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko said in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight.
Lukkes died on the same day lawmakers and Gov. Larry Rhoden met for a special legislative session at the Capitol in Pierre and approved a plan to build a 1,500-bed, $650 million men’s prison in northeast Sioux Falls. 
On Wednesday, 64-year-old Frank Twiggs died “in a comfort care setting” at the Jameson Annex.
A request for a response to the deaths sent to spokespeople for Rhoden was not immediately returned Thursday. 
South Dakota tracks inmate deaths by state fiscal years, which run from July 1 through June 30. The three deaths this week bring the number of deaths for fiscal year 2026 to six, consistent with a recent uptick for in-custody deaths.
The department says there were 19 in-custody deaths during the fiscal year that ended June 30. That’s the highest fiscal year tally since at least 2018. 
Since the beginning of the 2025 calendar year, 18 men have died in South Dakota prisons, at least four by suicide. Another three men died from drug overdoses. 
Attorney General Marty Jackley announced charges in drug distribution cases tied to those deaths earlier this summer, and announced charges last week against a separate set of defendants — including one former correctional officer – for their alleged roles in a drug smuggling ring.

(Photo by Getty Images)A western Iowa county is being sued over the federal government’s refusal to release jailed immigration detainees, even in cases where judges have ordered their release on bond.
The lawsuits claim that federal immigration officials have concocted a “scheme” whereby detainees with no criminal record can be jailed indefinitely despite judges approving their release upon payment of a bond.
The cases stem from a policy that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security adopted in July 2025, holding that all employees of DHS’ Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), were to consider anyone who is alleged to have entered the United States illegally to be subject to mandatory detention.

When detainees request a bond redetermination hearing before an immigration judge, judges often deny the request on the basis that under DHS’ newest interpretation of federal law, they have no jurisdiction over the matter.
In the past three weeks, a growing number of detainees have sought relief from such rulings by filing lawsuits that go before federal judges in U.S. District Court. That’s partly because of a Sept. 5, 2025, decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals. In that decision, the board adopted DHS’ latest interpretation of the law, finding that immigration judges lack the authority to even consider bond requests.
Now, another twist has been added to the legal conflict: Even in those cases where an immigration judge has set a bond for immigration detainees seeking release while their cases are pending, Homeland Security and ICE are refusing to accept payment of that bond and are keeping the detainees behind bars in county jails.
The result is that counties operating those jails are now being sued in federal court. In Iowa’s Woodbury County, for example, two such lawsuits were filed in the past week.
One of those cases involves Armando Garcia Picazo, who was arrested by ICE on Aug. 8, 2025, in Sioux City. According to court records, that arrest stemmed from an ICE and Drug Enforcement Administration surveillance operation that centered on another individual.
According to Garcia’s attorneys, the government has admitted that because Garcia “looked like” the individual being sought, he was detained and was later charged by ICE for having no legitimate immigration status in the United States.
Garcia has lived in Iowa for about nine years and has no criminal history, according to his lawyers.
Court records indicate that after he was arrested, Garcia participated in a bond redetermination hearing in front of an immigration judge. Citing Garcia’s lack of criminal history and his ties to the community, the judge on Sept. 12, 2025, ordered Garcia’s release upon payment of a $6,000 bond. Garcia’s family then attempted, without success, to post the bond.
“ICE will not allow them to post it,” Garcia’s lawyers argue in their newly filed lawsuit. “ICE refuses to release Mr. Garcia from custody, relying on a federal regulation giving DHS unilateral authority to block an immigration judge’s custody order.”
Garcia’s lawyers are now asking a U.S. District Court judge to intervene, rule that Garcia’s detention is unconstitutional, and order his release from jail upon payment of the bond.
As part of that lawsuit, Woodbury County Sheriff Chad Sheehan is being sued due to his having physical and administrative custody over Garcia. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Sheehan at his office on Thursday.
“For nine years, Garcia has worked hard, paid taxes, and contributed to the Iowa community,” Garcia’s lawyers have told the court in seeking intervention. “Mr. Garcia has significant ties to the community … He has many friends and is a skilled mechanic who often helps his community while expecting nothing in return. He has no criminal record and has never had any legal issues whatsoever until the current civil proceedings. Mr. Garcia was arrested by ICE on August 8, 2025, while walking out of his home because he apparently resembled a different man the government actually intended to arrest.”
The other Woodbury County case involves Francisco Torres Aleman, 34, of Omaha, who was detained in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, on June 28, 2025.
According to his lawyers, Aleman was born in Guatemala and came to the United States at least 12 years ago. They say he has no criminal history and is the father of two daughters who are U.S. citizens.
Court papers filed by Aleman’s attorneys give conflicting accounts as to how Aleman was arrested. In their petition seeking intervention by U.S. District Court, they state that Aleman was “arrested following a traffic stop in Sioux Falls,” but in that same document they say he was “detained while washing his car on June 28, 2025.”
Court records indicate that on Aug. 19, 2025, an immigration judge authorized the posting of a $20,000 bond that would allow for Aleman’s release while his immigration case was pending. Aleman’s family then attempted to post the bond through the required computerized processing system called “ICE CeBonds,” but each attempt was allegedly denied.
Aleman remains behind bars in the Woodbury County Jail, his attorneys allege. In seeking court invention, they argue that his continued detention not only contradicts the judge’s order on bond, it also inhibits his ability to argue against his removal from the country in that he can’t communicate with potential witnesses or earn wages to afford legal representation in the case.
“This scheme,” Aleman’s lawyers argue in court, is “plainly designed by the executive branch to give DHS the power to circumvent both immigration judge and Board of Immigration Appeals orders … The regulations are written in such a way that it does not matter what either the immigration judge and Board of Immigration Appeals orders; if the government disagrees, the government can, through its own actions and per its own regulations, keep the noncitizen detained indefinitely.”
In addition to Sheriff Sheehan, the two Woodbury County cases name as defendants Peter Berg, the director of the ICE field office in St. Paul, Minnesota; Todd M. Lyons, the acting director of ICE; Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security; Pamela Jo Bondi, the attorney general of the United States and head of the U.S. Department of Justice; and President Donald J. Trump .
The defendants have yet to file a response to the lawsuits.

(Stock photo by L Pettet/Getty Images)Let’s start at a place where we can all agree: In a nation of 340 million people, systems designed to serve the needs of such a large population will be imperfect. Public education is imperfect. The justice system is imperfect. Medicaid is imperfect. Social Security is imperfect. Taxation is imperfect. Road maintenance is imperfect. 
Pick a system, at any level of government from local to federal, and you will find proof of defect.
It is when we try to move forward together from that point of unity that the nation’s major fault lines emerge. We can’t agree on what exactly is broken, who is to blame, or how (or whether) we should go about the repairs.
Last week, I wrote that the fundamental tension in New Hampshire and the United States — the primary fault line — stems from a dispute over how public money should move. The defining position of the right is that the potential for prosperity among the masses is directly tied to how much the government invests in its wealthiest citizens, through tax breaks for example, and the left traditionally argues that direct investment in the masses, including through programs like Medicaid and Social Security, will lead to broader prosperity and therefore a stronger nation.
Fundamentally, Americans agree that our public systems are imperfect. And, fundamentally, we are divided over the scope and value of many of those systems.
The Republican Party has long framed its efforts to dismantle systems as a desire for small government. From a political marketing perspective, that’s a wise choice. “Small-government conservative” suggests efficiency, and who doesn’t love efficiency. But their efforts are rarely surgical — despite rosy monikers like the federal “Department of Government Efficiency” or New Hampshire’s “Commission on Government Efficiency” — and so the combination of administrative layoffs and reduced funding end up making the systems even more inefficient, more fully broken. And often that’s the point — to break public systems to the degree that they are no longer worth fixing — because ultimately Republicans want that money to go to private industry.
The harm from that approach is direct and it is immediate. Medicaid, for example, serves more than 180,000 people in New Hampshire, according to KFF, a nonpartisan organization that provides health policy research. The program covers 64% of the state’s nursing home residents, 30% of its children, and 31% of working-age adults with disabilities. Nationally, 77% percent of voters hold a favorable opinion of Medicaid, including 81% of independents and 63% of Republicans.
But during the last legislative session, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed a budget that increased premiums and established work requirements, amid other punitive changes to the program. After the governor signed House Bills 1 and 2, a coalition of 80 health care providers and advocates said, “These policies will shift more costs to families and low-wage individuals, imposing significant financial burdens and limiting access to care for some of New Hampshire’s most vulnerable residents.”
And, the group continued, “Beyond the direct impacts on individuals and families, safety net providers will face increased uncompensated care costs unless the state takes proactive steps to protect coverage.”
You see, in order for Republican lawmakers to continue investing in the wealthiest Americans, the money has to come from somewhere. That “somewhere” is a magical place called “smaller government,” which is really a wasteland of reduced services for poor people, people with disabilities, and residents who require nursing home care.
In New Hampshire, that translates into heavier burdens placed on low-income residents in order to pay for the elimination of the interest and dividends tax, the expansion of school vouchers to benefit high-income families, and a years-long series of aggressive business tax cuts. Among the “efficiencies” gained from this “small government” approach is a decline in care and support for already underserved populations, more economic pressure placed on property-poor towns by way of expanded school vouchers, and the forfeit of a tax paid largely by upper-income residents. And, to be clear, when I say this was a tax paid by rich people, I mean more than half of the payers of the interest and dividends tax (which brought in more than $180 million in 2024) made in excess of $200,000 in income from interest and dividends alone. How much base wealth does it even take to earn more than $200K just in interest and dividends?
Nationally, the Republicans have been even more aggressive in undermining a program that has the support of more than three-quarters of the country. That “big, beautiful bill” the GOP is so proud of cuts $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next decade to pay for a $1 trillion tax cut for the richest 1%. The primary “efficiency” gained is that another 15 million low-income Americans will join the 25 million people who were uninsured even before Donald Trump’s mega-bill was signed into law. 
Will any of the $1 trillion taken from low-income people and given to the highest income people ever make its way back to the people at the bottom? That is the very foundation of the Republican platform, but the overwhelming evidence — via rapidly expanding economic inequality — says that’s not what happens at all. Money that could spare a family from having to choose between groceries and health care is instead going to those among us who are fortunate enough, for example, to collect more than $200,000 a year just in interest payments.
In what way is any of that a good deal for the masses, now or even in some imagined future?
But let’s return, just for a second, back to that original point of unity in America: Our systems, including Medicaid, are imperfect. Before we take another step and become mired once again in political confrontation, how about one more place at the beginning where we can stand together: Less suffering is preferable to more suffering. 
More than anything, that is my political position. Odds are it’s yours, too. Where, I wonder, can we go from there?",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/medicaidform-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 15:57:35.011743

(Photo provided by Cass County N.D., Vector Control)A Providence County resident in their 60s is the first probable human case of West Nile virus in Rhode Island this year, the state Department of Health announced Thursday.
The case will be confirmed through further testing by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Health officials did not disclose where the person was exposed, but said they began showing symptoms in early September and have remained hospitalized since. 
The Rhode Island Department of Health’s announcement comes as the state’s risk level for mosquito-borne diseases remains high, with 13 mosquito samples testing positive for West Nile virus so far this season.
The first positive mosquito sample was collected in East Providence on July 21. The second positive sample came from Bristol on July 28. The most recent samples came from Johnston, East Providence, and Cranston on Aug. 28.
Mosquitoes in the latest samples collected on Sept. 15 tested negative for West Nile virus, along with other illnesses including Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and Jamestown Canyon Virus. 
West Nile virus is the most common mosquito-borne illness in the U.S. While most people infected never develop symptoms, about one in five experience West Nile fever, which can bring on headaches, body aches, and other flu-like symptoms. 
In rare cases, West Nile virus can progress to serious neuroinvasive illnesses that involve encephalitis or meningitis. The CDC reports that about 10% of these severe infections are fatal, most often among people over age 60 or those who are immunocompromised. 
As of Sept. 25, preliminary CDC data shows 1,137 West Nile virus cases across the nation, with neuroinvasive illness involved in 742 of those cases. The virus has been recorded in 42 states so far this year.
Massachusetts has recorded eight human cases, according to data from its Department of Public Health. Connecticut has had two human cases confirmed by the CDC.
Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine have had no human cases so far this year, according to the CDC.
Rhode Island health officials remind residents to protect themselves against bites by wearing insect repellent, long sleeves, and pants, especially when mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk. Removing stagnant water from yards and outdoor areas reduces the number of places where mosquitoes can breed, and repairing holes in window or door screens can stop mosquitoes from entering the home.
Weekly mosquito testing data is posted to the Rhode Island Department of Health’s website. Additional prevention tips and resources are available at health.ri.gov/mosquito and dem.ri.gov/mosquito.

That’s due, in large part, to shifting federal guidelines that have narrowed the pool of people who are eligible for this year’s COVID-19 vaccine. In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines, but limited eligibility for the updated shots to only those who are 65 or older, as well as younger people with certain health problems. Previous booster shots had been recommended for everyone six months of age and older.
CDC panel opts against requiring COVID shot prescription, but wants greater emphasis on its risks

Last week, a top vaccine advisory committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also voted to change the recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine to allow individuals over six months of age to access the vaccine after discussing their options with a health care provider, though the panel fell short of issuing a blanket recommendation. The panel also rejected a proposal to require a prescription to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.
The new recommendations must now be formally approved by the acting CDC director before they can take effect.
In some states, top officials have implemented new policies to ensure that residents can access COVID-19 shots. But Georgia has so far been slower to respond to the changing guidelines. 
Ahead of last week’s ACIP meeting, the state’s Department of Public Health announced that it would be halting distribution of the newest version of the COVID-19 vaccine to local health departments until after the federal panel issued its annual recommendations. On Monday, DPH spokesperson Nancy Nydam Shirek said that the agency is holding off on issuing statements until the CDC officially approves the recommendations. 
Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at my local pharmacy?
In the U.S., pharmacies — rather than doctor’s offices — have increasingly become the venue where many Americans seek common vaccines like those for the flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV.
Part of the reason for that is convenience, according to Ashley Chinchilla, who works as the associate director of the Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences program at the University of Georgia’s College of Pharmacy.
“Pharmacies tend to have a little more flexible hours than a lot of other locations that offer vaccines,” Chinchilla said. “We tend to be open a little bit later. A lot of them have at least some weekend hours, and so for people who are working full time, it’s sometimes a little bit easier to get to a pharmacy than to another location.”

In Georgia, pharmacists can typically administer vaccines as long as they have an agreement with a supervising doctor, which most pharmacies do. But, Chinchilla added, “the state law that allows pharmacists the authority to administer vaccines under protocol without a prescription is tied to the ACIP recommendation.” 
That means pharmacists practicing in Georgia are unable to administer an updated COVID-19 vaccine until the CDC formally approves the recommendations, and as a result, many pharmacies are still requiring a prescription for anyone seeking the vaccine.
At CVS, Georgia is one of five states where prescriptions are still required before pharmacists can administer a shot. Florida, Louisiana, Utah, West Virginia and the District of Columbia also require residents to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine prescription.
“Once the CDC approves ACIP’s recommendations, we’ll be able to offer the FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines — without a prescription — in these states,” said CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault.
Walgreens, which is offering updated COVID-19 shots in every state except Georgia, Louisiana, Utah, and the District of Columbia, said that it is also waiting for the CDC director to adopt ACIP’s updated recommendations before their pharmacists can administer the vaccine.
“Once that happens, Walgreens will offer the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines at locations nationwide, including in Georgia, to individuals three years and older, no prescription required,” Walgreens spokesperson Brigid Sweeney said.
Representatives for Kroger and Publix, which also operate in-store pharmacies, did not reply to requests for comment.
Where can I access the COVID-19 vaccine in my area?
Dr. Joanna Dolgoff, a pediatrician based in Hiram and a member of the Georgia chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that shifting policies on vaccine access have caused confusion among many of her patients over access to the vaccine.
“I think parents are very confused about what’s going on with the COVID vaccine,” she said. “They’re hearing all different things. They don’t really know what to believe. So I think there’s a lot of confusion out there.”
Her advice for parents and others who are seeking a COVID-19 vaccine is to check with their local primary care provider to get the most up-to-date and accurate information.
“Talk to your doctor, make sure that you will have access to the COVID vaccine,” Dolgoff said. “Find out where, locally, that vaccine is being offered, so that you go to the right place.”
Dr. Cecil Bennett, a family medicine doctor based in Newnan, said his office will be following recommendations from organizations like the American Academy of Family Physicians, which advises everyone six months of age and older to get an updated COVID-19 vaccine. He also urged patients to follow the advice of reputable, science-based organizations.
“The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, are dependable organizations that are not a part of the political spectrum,” he said. “CDC, NIH, FDA have proven to be political entities and no longer scientific and dependable entities. So patients should rely on their doctors more now for proper advice and not listen to what they hear on television from political bodies.”
I don’t have a primary care provider. Can I still get a COVID-19 vaccine?
If you don’t have a primary care provider, you’re not alone. Georgia has broad primary care provider shortages across most of the state, impacting all but three of its 159 counties.
If the ACIP recommendations are approved by the CDC’s acting director, Georgia residents will likely be able to access COVID-19 shots at their local pharmacy without needing a prescription. But until that happens, residents may be able to get vaccinated against COVID-19 at retail clinics, which are typically operated out of grocery stores, pharmacies, and other retail establishments. 
Common retail clinics include CVS’ MinuteClinics and Kroger’s The Little Clinic, which offer scheduled appointments as well as walk-in visits.
Thibault, the CVS spokesperson, said that MinuteClinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and therefore “are not subject to the same rules that apply to [a] pharmacy and do not require a prescription from patients to be able to administer the vaccine.”
A full list of CVS MinuteClinic locations in Georgia can be found at the MinuteClinic’s online directory. A list of Kroger’s walk-in health clinics can also be found online.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A South Dakota lobbyist hinted this week that Summit Carbon Solutions’ plan to build a 2,000-mile carbon dioxide pipeline is on life support without the ability to secure easements through eminent domain. 
Pipeline opponents in his state, according to David Owen, president of the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce before retiring earlier this year, have argued Summit is free to move forward with the carbon dioxide pipeline that would bring 18.5 million tons of carbon dioxide to North Dakota annually. Some have said that while the company can no longer use eminent domain to secure the pipeline route without landowners’ consent, Summit could obtain voluntary easements for 100% of the project’s path. 
“I like that fantasy,” Owen said of constructing the pipeline without use of eminent domain. “I wish that were true. But it’s not.”
In addition to facing the obstacle of South Dakota’s law against eminent domain, Summit also still needs a permit from South Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission for the project to move forward. 
Summit proposes to build a network of pipelines in five states to capture carbon emissions from ethanol plants. The main portion of the pipeline would run through South Dakota.

Owen was speaking Tuesday on a panel at the Greater North Dakota Chamber’s annual policy summit. He warned the audience that South Dakota’s opposition to eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines, which he attributed to the strain of political populism shared by both states, might be “contagious.” 
Jessica Bell, Rainbow Energy vice president and former Republican state lawmaker who moderated the panel discussion, attributed this opposition to “horseshoe politics.”
“The opposition comes not only from those on the far left who frame these projects as perpetuating fossil fuel use, but also from the far right who view them as government overreach,” Bell said. “While these groups rarely agree on much they do converge here in trying to stop development. For conservatives in particular, leadership on energy policy cannot always be simply saying ‘no’ to something and everything.”
Owen pushed back on the idea that property owners “gathered in a barn” and organically built a successful opposition to use of eminent domain. 
“Landowners teamed up with environmental groups, who supplied a lot of money, and they hired damn good political talent,” said Owen, who hopes this is only a “pause” and South Dakota will return to the table down the road. 
Owen was joined on the panel by Brian Kalk, chief research officer at the Energy and Environmental Research Center and a former member of the Public Service Commission, and North Dakota Rep. SuAnn Olson, a Republican from Baldwin.

Olson noted some of the opposition to Summit’s pipeline has been created by mixed messaging from the company and government officials.  The pipeline was “adamantly described,” Olson said, as a way to deliver CO2 to a storage facility in North Dakota. But Summit officials have also said the pipeline could be used in the future for enhanced oil recovery if a customer developed an agreement with Summit. 
Enhanced oil recovery is under development in order to extract a greater percentage of North Dakota’s oil, extending the life of Bakken wells. One technique being researched would use carbon dioxide to repressurize underground reservoirs. Bell noted current estimates require 100 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, far more than is produced in North Dakota, to make it happen. 
The pipeline route permit approved by the North Dakota Public Service Commission specifies that the CO2 would go into permanent underground storage. 
“Even the 100 million tons annually that’s needed is built on lots of assumptions,” Olson said. “None of us, if you want to be accurate, can be sure exactly what that’s going to be and where it’s going to come from.” 
Kalk suggested it was possible for North Dakota and the United States to become “third world countries,” like those he said he visited as a U.S. Marine logistics officer for 20 years. 
“That’s what some of these other countries are because they don’t have progressive thinking about building pipelines, about building a power grid,” said Kalk. “I think North Dakota right now is kind of in that spot where we have done great things, but what’s next?”
North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said during a radio interview last week he’s researching what legal options the state could have to challenge South Dakota’s law against eminent domain.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)In January 2022, Elmer Waggoner arrived at a hospital with COVID-19. By March 3 he was negative for the virus and died March 29 after developing necrotizing fasciitis from a bed sore.
By then, the state emergency declaration had also expired.
But an attorney for dozens of doctors and three anonymous hospitals argued before the Indiana Supreme Court Thursday that his family’s malpractice suit should be dismissed due to COVID-related immunity.
“The extent of COVID’S causation is it caused him to go to the hospital, and that’s it,” said attorney Arie Lipinski, representing Waggoner’s wife and children. “And defendants are asking this court to extend the immunity statutes, so broadly that just because a patient presents at a hospital with COVID-19, anything after that goes.”
Waggoner’s family filed a malpractice complaint against 86 defendants in March 2023. His treatment spanned several hospitals in Kentucky and Indiana as he was transferred back and forth several times.
A trial court granted summary judgment to the health care providers based on immunity related to the emergency.










Defendants are asking this court to extend the immunity statutes, so broadly that just because a patient presents at a hospital with COVID-19, anything after that goes.


– Attorney Arie Lipinski


The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed in January, finding that the question of whether all or some of the defendants’ services to him for his pressure wound “arose” out of the state disaster emergency hinges upon causation — something a medical review panel should decide.
“To be sure, Elmer was originally hospitalized for COVID-19, and he first developed the wound while prone and ventilated to treat his COVID-19 symptoms, but Waggoner submitted an expert’s opinion stating that Elmer’s death was caused by inadequate treatment of the pressure wound, not by his COVID-19 symptoms,” the appellate decision said.
But that decision conflicts with other immunity-related precedent in Indiana.
Justice Mark Massa said the immunity statutes were common-sense legislative action to not second-guess people working in the midst of an emergency.
“But we had cases of negligence for bed sores long before COVID. Is this the type of alleged malpractice that this statute was intended to immunize?” he asked.
Attorney Colleen Davis argued it is.
“When COVID first came out and when these laws were enacted, this was a disease we didn’t understand. This was a time where health care providers are putting their health and safety, the health and safety of their families, at risk so that they can care for our community. And this was also a time when providers were leaving the medical profession because they were afraid. And so, yes, resources were strapped.”

She added “this was an uncertain time, and I think the legislature really intended to protect those providers that are doing their best to care for our community.”
Chief Justice Loretta Rush noted that the immunity provisions don’t cover gross negligence or willful misconduct. But that wasn’t argued in the original complaint.
Lipinski said causation is key in the case and those are questions for a medical review panel — not a court.
And he noted that between March 3 — the day Waggoner tested negative and the governor rescinded the emergency — and March 29, several defendants treated him only for the necrotizing fasciitis and complications from the bed sore.
But Davis said a medical review panel can’t look at causation — only whether the defendants breached standard of care and whether that breach caused injuries.
“It’s never going to inform anyone as to whether these defendants should be immune,” she said.

Thomas Massie appears to still have an enthusiastic base of supporters in his congressional district. 
Massie earned laughs and applause from a large crowd at a rally in Burlington Wednesday night. It was the final stop of the day for him and Republican Kentucky U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, who travelled throughout Northern Kentucky for a mix of official forums and campaign events. 
Perhaps the clearest sign that Massie is still in good graces with his constituents is the standing ovation he received after announcing he will have the 218 signatures needed to force a U.S. House vote on releasing federal investigation files on convicted sex offender and financier Jeffery Epstein, a point he reiterated throughout Wednesday’s stops. Though the president campaigned on declassifying the files, Trump has more recently opposed releasing them. 
Amid the president’s repeated threats to oust the seven-term congressman, next year’s GOP primary for Massie’s seat could become a choice between Trump’s brand of governing and the Tea Party movement that helped propel Massie and Paul into office, though no Trump-backed challenger has stepped up.
A Trump-tied super PAC, MAGA KY, spent $1.2 million on ads opposing Massie this summer. The congressman has previously accused one of the PAC’s backers, financier John Paulson, of being in Epstein’s “black book,” and did so again during the rally. A spokesperson for Paulson has denied this and called it “a weak attempt to imply a relationship with Epstein” that doesn’t exist, according to media reports. 
“I do find it interesting that I am leading the charge to release these files, and that one of the three billionaires is among the circle of just a few hundred people who are actually in the phone book of Jeffrey Epstein,” Massie told the crowd.

Massie was also critical of the PAC ads against him, including one that accused him of supporting burning U.S. flags. He said that he once tweeted that he agreed with late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia “that if you have your own flag and you’re on your own property and you’re not infringing on somebody else’s rights, you can burn your flag.” 
“Now, if you burn my flag, I’m going to kick your ass,” Massie said, and the crowd roared with cheers. 
Massie has often been seen as a leader of Liberty Republicans in Northern Kentucky, or GOP politicians who lean more libertarian than the rest of the party. With constituents during stops, he focused on his priorities like eliminating national debt, supporting limited government and not backing foreign aid. 
Like Paul, the son of former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul from Texas who led the Tea Party movement, Massie has not been afraid to rub his fellow Republicans the wrong way by opposing budget bills that he considers irresponsible. Speaking ahead of Massie, the senator said he and Massie sometimes incur anger, even from Trump, “because we vote on principle.”
“You have to treat presidents the same. No matter which party they’re in. We have to believe in something bigger than me, bigger than Thomas and, frankly, bigger than Donald Trump,” Paul said. 
Paul said Massie’s upcoming Republican primary in the 4th Congressional District in May will be one of the “biggest elections in U.S. history” because “if they defeat him, they’re defeating all of us.” 
“If Thomas loses, if they have the ability to have three billionaires come down here from New York City and beat him, they defeat the movement,” Paul told the crowd. “It is the end of the Tea Party at that point.”
‘Under Trump’s skin’
Earlier this year, Massie opposed Trump’s bombing of Iran. He voted against the president’s tax and spending plan, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, for increasing federal deficits and the debt. Trump took to Truth Social in June calling Massie a “simple minded ‘grandstander’” and said he “votes ‘NO’ on virtually everything put before him (Rand Paul, Jr.), no matter how good something may be.” 
Trump vowed to oust Massie with “a wonderful American Patriot running against him in the Republican Primary.” Massie, an MIT-educated engineer who served as Lewis County judge-executive, was elected to Congress in 2012. 
During the rally, Paul said he was ready to endorse Massie and if someone asked about waiting to see who could run against the congressman, “I can’t imagine that they’d even try it.”

Northern Kentuckian Trey Grayson, a former Republican secretary of state who lost the 2010 U.S. Senate primary to Paul, told the Lantern in a phone interview that traveling the district with an ally like Paul is a way for Massie to be “visible” and “remind people who he is” ahead of the primary. 
“He’s very personable, and so getting out and about in the district, reminding people of that fact, and also talking about what’s been going on. He’s talking about the Epstein files and talking about his votes and defending his record. So, I think it’s pretty smart politics to do that and especially right now.”
Wednesday’s stops included rural parts of the congressional district, including forums in eastern counties Greenup and Mason. Massie and Paul connected with the Republican base in Northern Kentucky in Burlington and in Dry Ridge at Beans Cafe and Bakery. The cafe pushed back against restrictions on bars and restaurants during the coronavirus pandemic, gaining support from local conservatives. 
Massie repeated the central points of his messaging throughout the day — strong support of the First and Second Amendments, a love of agriculture, and concerns about a growing national debt. He drew attention to his real-time debt counter, which he had pinned to his jacket for the day and often wears at the U.S. Capitol, by joking that some Democrats ask if it’s his step counter. 
Grayson said Massie “is pretty formidable” in the congressional district. Pushing an issue like releasing the Epstein files could keep Massie “under Trump’s skin” and could still motivate Trump’s political team to recruit a primary opponent.

“But at the same time, it’s also one of those issues that maybe when it’s litigated at a ballot box, it’s actually better for Massie, because he’s on the side of transparency and doing something the public likes,” Grayson said. 
Grayson said he has heard from some Northern Kentucky Republicans who are “old school” and aren’t big fans of either Trump or Massie, but “several of them have said to me that they like Massie standing up to Trump.”
Asked if he thought pushing for the release of the Epstein files would impact his reelection, Massie told reporters at one stop he’s seen polling that shows “80% of Republicans and Democrats want the Epstein files released, and the other 20% don’t care.”
“There is nobody against transparency, except for the folks in Washington D.C., who are taking up for their billionaire friends and politically connected people,” Massie said. “And I think this is about a trust issue. We need to restore trust in the DOJ (U.S. Department of Justice) and in the government, and they need to release the files.”
Later in the day, Massie told the Burlington rally that he does still have praise for the president despite their policy disagreements. Massie even did an impression of Trump while reenacting a phone call between the two of them about Massie’s endorsement in the 2024 presidential election. He added that his presidential impression maybe “wasn’t that good,” but he had still “never disparaged him personally.” 
However, the congressman did warn voters in Burlington that the PAC is going to try to convince them that he isn’t a true conservative and a challenger would have to “sell a lie.” 
“They have to try to convince tens of thousands of people in Kentucky that I’m not conservative,” Massie said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5305-1024x723.jpg,,,2025-09-25 15:57:35.011743

Dan Innis became the first candidate in New Hampshire’s 2026 U.S. Senate race to drop out Thursday, and on his way out he endorsed John E. Sununu, who publicly said he’s considering a run but hasn’t officially launched a campaign.
Innis announced he was suspending his campaign in a statement posted online. He said he ran for the seat “because there was no real Conservative running” and that “Chris Pappas (a Democratic candidate) would be a disaster for our state, and I believe that only a true Republican with unquestionable Conservative credentials can defeat him next November.” However, when Sununu told WMUR he was considering joining the race earlier this month “all of that changed for me in an instant,” Innis said.
Dan Innis
“If Senator Sununu decides to put his name on the ballot, there is no way that I would try and stand in his way,” Innis wrote.
Innis lavished praise on Sununu, who previously represented New Hampshire in the U.S. Senate from 2003 to 2009 and is part of the politically connected Sununu family. He called Sununu “the respected, experienced and trusted Conservative that I was hoping would jump in the race last spring.”
Innis encouraged Scott Brown, the only other Republican in the race, to also drop out and back Sununu. Brown represented Massachusetts from 2010 to 2013 in the Senate before moving to New Hampshire.
Innis said if Sununu decides not to run, he’ll reactivate his campaign.
Sununu lost reelection to the Senate in 2008 and has remained out of elected office since. He is the brother of Chris Sununu, who served as New Hampshire’s governor from 2017 to 2025 and was widely rumored to be a candidate for this race until he publicly ruled out a campaign in April. His father, John H. Sununu, was governor from 1983 to 1989 and White House chief of staff under President George H.W. Bush.
On the Democratic side of the race, U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas and progressive organizer Karishma Manzur are seeking the nomination. The race became wide open after current U.S. Sen.

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Saying the state’s new limits on ballot initiatives were too great to immediately overcome, Florida Decides Healthcare announced Thursday that it is putting the brakes on efforts to get  a proposed constitutional amendment on Medicaid expansion on the 2026 ballot and will aim for 2028, instead.
In an interview with the Florida Phoenix, organization Executive Director Mitch Emerson said the new law was passed to sabotage efforts to bring proposed constitutional amendments before voters. The Florida Legislature earlier this year passed HB 1205, which put in sweeping changes nearly immediately.
“As much as anything, it’s really about runway,” Emerson said, adding that the law changed the rules in the middle of the signature campaign effort. 
Florida Decides Healthcare, the political entity created to place Medicaid expansion on the 2026 ballot, challenged many of the changes in federal court but an appeals court earlier this month lifted an injunction against one of the restrictions that prevented groups from using non-citizens to gather initiative petitions.
Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican-controlled Legislature insisted that the restrictions were needed to counter fraud in which people were arrested for turning in petitions that contained the names of dead people or people who never signed them.
Restrictions on constitutional amendment process clears the Florida Legislature

Despite the new restrictions, Florida Decides collected 200,000 petitions, raised more than $6 million, and built a coalition of more than 100 grassroots organizations. In the meantime, Emerson said, it remains committed to its lawsuit against HB 1205, with a full trial scheduled for January. And it’s committed to a three-year plan to set the issue before voters in the 2028 general election.
“We’re going to keep moving forward. We’ve got a plan to expand the coalition in every county, raise the resources, and organize at the scale needed to overcome the barriers that politicians are putting out in our way. And over the next three years, we are going to build the biggest, strongest campaign Florida has ever seen,” he said, adding that a  GSG poll show 67% of Floridians support  Medicaid expansion.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“That’s Democrats, Republicans, independents alike. And that makes us confident that when this goes on the ballot in 2028, Floridians will say ‘yes’ at the end of the day. This fight isn’t about the politicians or courtrooms. It’s about Floridians,” Emerson said.
 Health care cliff is coming

While a delay could give Florida Decides a better chance to earn a ballot spot, it comes at a time when residents are at risk of losing their health insurance, Emerson said.
Health insurance premiums are slated to go up for millions of Florida residents, and people nationwide, unless Congress agrees to extend the enhanced advanced premium tax credits for so-called Obamacare health plans. 
The tax credits, established by Democrats in 2021 as part of a massive COVID-19 relief package, were extended in 2022 through the Inflation Reduction Act. The credits are set to expire at the end of the year. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost $350 billion to keep them intact over the next decade.
The tandem of the increases in health insurance premiums and lack of a safety net for people will show that health care is a “real crisis in the coming,” Emerson said.
“And it’s not years away. It’s here now, right? We already in Florida are 47th in the nation for health care access. And as it stands today, one in five Floridians are uninsured. When the ACA tax credits expire in January, that’s going to leave more than 3 million Floridians, one in five of us, without health care. 
“That means families devastated, hospitals closing, tens of thousands of jobs and good doctors lost,  fewer options for patients, and higher costs for everyone. Veterans, caretakers, working families will be left without coverage while politicians keep playing games in Tallahassee,” he continued.
“And that’s  why this fight is more urgent than ever,” Emerson said.  “So, over the next, you know, three years, I feel like more people are going to be feeling this impact. Because the estimates of what this will do here in Florida are catastrophic.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Without reading the morning headlines, one might believe Thursday’s Oklahoma State Board of Education meeting was routine, even more tame than usual. The crush of cameras and celebrations outside told a different story.
State Superintendent Ryan Walters dedicated his opening remarks to the assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk and went on to present a mostly flat budget proposal for public education next year. 
Walters did not acknowledge his impending resignation from elected office, a bombshell he revealed live on FOX News the night before. He told FOX host Trace Gallagher he would step down from office to become the CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, an anti-teacher-union organization founded earlier this year. 
The Teacher Freedom Alliance announced Thursday morning that Walters would start in his new role on Wednesday.
Gov. Kevin Stitt will appoint a replacement to finish Walters’ term through January 2027. Stitt helped launch Walters’ political career when he chose the former high school teacher to be his education secretary, but the two had a public falling out earlier this year.
“I wish Ryan and his family the best in this next chapter,” Stitt said in a statement Thursday. “Oklahoma students remain my top priority, and with my first appointment to this role, I will be seeking a leader who is fully focused on the job Oklahomans expect: delivering real outcomes and driving a turnaround in our education system.”

A spokesperson for the Governor’s Office, Abegail Cave, confirmed Stitt does not yet have a resignation letter from Walters.
Unlike Walters, Oklahomans who showed up to the state Department of Education building Thursday morning didn’t let the occasion pass unacknowledged. His supporters held signs stating “Thank you state Superintendent Ryan Walters” while his critics chanted “bye bye Ry Ry” and raised their arms in victory.
The two groups chirped insults at each other as they waited in line to enter the building, highlighting the polarized political clash that these board meetings have become since Walters took office.
Walters spent his final gathering with the board discussing teacher certification and school administrative matters. Rather than making a splash with headline-grabbing budget requests, like he did last year by asking for $3 million for Bibles, he made a relatively mundane funding proposal to submit to the state Legislature, who will make the final budget decisions. 
He proposed cutting $2.6 million in smaller programs like Imagine Math, Imagine Reading and Great Expectations to help make room for an expected $23.7 million increase in the cost of educators’ health insurance.
The board tabled the budget request to have more time to review it.

A mostly tranquil meeting ended with a heated back-and-forth when a few members questioned why Walters didn’t include more items on Thursday’s agenda after he canceled the board’s August meeting. 
Board member Mike Tinney noted some teacher license revocation cases are on the cusp of being dismissed, and other cases have had no progress for months toward a conclusion.
Walters responded with barbed comments, saying he had decided no cases were ready for a board vote.
“As long as I’m here, it will be my decision of what’s presented to the board, and that’s the way that we’re going to do it,” he said during the meeting. “You guys can sue me, I don’t care. You guys can run for state superintendent, go out and get hundreds of thousands of votes across the state, represent parents and students and teachers. Go for it. Good luck. But as long as I’m in this office, I will be unapologetic about protecting the kids of Oklahoma.”
What no one said was Walters wouldn’t be in office for much longer. 
He quickly left the room after adjournment without speaking to news media. The meeting agenda included no opportunity for members of the public to address him.
Tinney made the only reference to Walters’ resignation during the meeting, telling the superintendent “with all things being said here, I do wish you and your family well.”
“It is my desire that we get, if this really happens, that we get a new state superintendent that genuinely cares for the students and the educators and that will work with the board and that will be ethical and honest,” Tinney told reporters afterward.

Fellow board member Becky Carson echoed Tinney’s optimism that Walters’ departure could mark a more positive beginning.
“I believe that the superintendent’s resignation opens the door for us to now make progress on this board and do what’s best for the children of this state,” she said after the meeting.
Widely considered a potential candidate for higher office, Walters instead is making the rare move to resign from his statewide elected position with more than a year left in his term. He has not announced intentions to launch a political campaign, even to seek reelection.
Recent polling showed his popularity tanked in recent months amid a clash with the state board over nude women being visible on his office TV during a meeting. A law enforcement investigation found the images were from a Jackie Chan movie that accidentally started playing.
Walters also appeared to fall behind in fundraising, with less than $20,000 in his campaign account as of June 30, according to the most recent campaign finance reports available.
If he jumped into the 2026 Republican primary race for governor, he would face heavily-funded opponents, including Attorney General Gentner Drummond and former House Speaker Charles McCall who each reported more than $1 million in their campaign accounts in the first half of the year.
Walters, though, has strong name recognition from constant media coverage and his many appearances on cable TV. He built a national profile as a far-right Republican unafraid to push the envelope.
He was elected in 2022 with a pledge to shake up the education establishment with conservative, parent-focused reforms.
However, national testing revealed Walters’ first two years in office resulted in little to no improvement in Oklahoma’s academic results.

State-based testing in 2024 showed significant leaps in student performance, but Oklahoma Voice uncovered the rising test scores were not the result of genuine academic improvement. Rather, they primarily resulted from the state quietly lowering the bar for students to be considered “proficient” in reading and math.
Instead of acknowledging the state’s stagnant performance, Walters abruptly proposed eliminating state testing altogether. He told reporters expected a “very quick” approval from the Trump administration for the plan.
His comments appeared to backfire. Soon after, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon excluded Walters from her August visit to Oklahoma, signaling a rift with the state superintendent, despite him being a dedicated Trump ally.
Fellow Republicans in Oklahoma have voiced frustrations with Walters during his tenure over his numerous controversies, poor administration of state funds and constant focus on culture-war talking points. Democrats made multiple calls for his impeachment.
House Common Education Committee leader Rep. Dick Lowe, R-Amber, said “it’s been a rough couple of years.”
“Am I happy with where our results are of our kids and our testing or whatever? No, none of us are,” Lowe said while speaking with reporters after attending Thursday’s meeting. “I don’t think anybody watching this right now will think it’s good. We’re working hard to get better.
“This is not going to turn overnight. Doesn’t matter who’s sitting in what chair. This doesn’t turn overnight. It takes all Oklahomans to want to see this better, and we’ll work to do that.”

WILMINGTON, Del. – Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant, a pioneer in the Mid-Atlantic craft beer scene, abruptly closed all 16 of its brewpubs on Sept. 25, sending shockwaves through Delaware and beyond. The company announced the shutdown on social media and by email, confirming that every location across Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Georgia is now dark.
The sudden move came just two weeks after Iron Hill shuttered its original Newark, Del., brewpub—opened in 1996—along with sites in Chestnut Hill, Pa., and Voorhees, N.J. Signs posted on doors from Wilmington’s Riverfront to Philadelphia’s Market Street thanked customers for their loyalty and hinted at a possible return. “It has been our pleasure to serve you… we sincerely hope to return in the future,” read one notice.
Financial Strain Behind the Sudden Exit
While the public message was warm, an internal email to employees told a harder truth: “ongoing financial challenges” had left the company no choice but to close and prepare for bankruptcy. Leadership disclosed efforts to secure new funding but said the business could no longer sustain operations. Staff members were reportedly given little notice.
A Delaware Legacy
The loss is particularly painful in Delaware, where Iron Hill’s first location helped spark the state’s craft beer renaissance. Over nearly three decades, the brewery built a reputation for pairing award-winning beers with family-friendly dining, hosting countless community events, and setting the standard for brewpubs across the region. Locations in Newark, Rehoboth Beach, and Wilmington became gathering spots for locals and visitors alike.
Iron Hill’s closure also underscores a challenging environment for Wilmington’s dining scene. The brewery follows the recent shutdowns of other longtime favorites, including Gallucio’s and Ulysses Gastropub, both of which closed their doors earlier this year after decades of service.
What Comes Next
Iron Hill’s statement leaves the door open to a potential revival, but with bankruptcy proceedings underway, any comeback would likely require a major restructuring or new ownership. For now, loyal patrons across five states are left with memories—and a void in their local dining and craft beer scenes.
The closures mark the end of an era for a brand that helped define the region’s brewpub culture and raised the profile of Delaware’s craft beer industry.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-25-145317.jpg,,,2025-09-25 14:56:48.110368

A continued effort to propose rules expanding uses for oil and gas wastewater has sparked environment groups to call for the removal of seven commissioners. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Several environmental groups opposing a state water board’s oil and gas wastewater rulemaking on Thursday requested the board disqualify seven members and toss votes from earlier this year. The groups said the members’ “impartiality and fairness” were “compromised by interference” from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
The Center for Biological Diversity and Santa Fe-based New Energy Economy filed two separate motions requesting the commission address the issue in October, and cited emailed exchanges between members of the governor’s staff and cabinet members before a July meeting in which the board moved forward in efforts to roll back rules limiting expanded wastewater use.
“These commissioners and their subordinates need to be disqualified from this proceeding, that’s really the bottom line,” Colin Cox, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, told Source NM. “This is not how government is supposed to work — this is not fair, this is not impartial.”
New Mexico governor puts finger on scale in oilfield wastewater vote

Both petitions noted State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard’s support. In an interview Thursday Garcia Richard told Source NM that the office, which leases out more than 2 million acres for oil and gas activity in the Permian Basin, would be impacted by the rules change.
“it’s pretty evident that there is a blatant effort to roll back or reverse the initial decision of the commission. That’s what I’m concerned about,” Garcia Richard said.
She also described a “constant barrage of spills and illegal dumping of produced water that we are dealing with on state land.”
The governor, along with oil and gas industry advocates, has for years cited the state’s limited water supplies as they pursue expanded uses for oilfield wastewater. They have faced pushback from environmentalists, along with the Legislature.
Garcia Richard she’s skeptical about the current science around treating wastewater.
“Until I see something new that has come to light, I’m going to look at this new effort with suspicion,” she said.
A request for comment from the governor’s office remained pending Thursday afternoon, but the office has issued previous statements denying wrongdoing.
The motion to recuse cabinet members from voting on the issue marks the latest development at the Water Quality Control Commission, which is currently reconsidering its own rules limiting the uses of oil and gas wastewater issued in May to the oilfield and specific treatment projects.
The issue was reopened in June, spearheaded by the WATR Alliance, (Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse) which has board members from oil and gas giants Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum and other industry interests. The group proposed a new rule that would allow 13 counties to use “treated produced water” for uses such as watering livestock, “non-food crops,” construction and releases into the environment.
Commissioners — including cabinet secretaries sitting on the board for the first time — voted to move forward with possibly reversing the rule and quashed environmental groups objections in an August meeting.
The motions requesting the mandatory recusal for five secretaries – Environmental Secretary James Kenney, Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie, Department of Game and Fish Director Michael Sloane, State Engineer Elizabeth Anderson and agriculture Secretary Jeff Witte — and two other members: Christopher Moander, chair of the oil conservation commission and the state parks division designee for Toby Velasquez.
“The standard the commission is held to is a very strong standard: they have to be fair and impartial, and if there’s any doubt about that, then they have to recuse themselves,” said Cox. “These emails…make it very hard to trust any of those commissioners, or the people who work for them.”
The motions cited the Water Quality Commission’s recusal requirements, which state that no commissioner “shall participate in any action in which his or her impartiality of fairness may reasonably be questioned,” and goes on to describe that recusal must be public.
A request for comment to the attorney for the WQCC board about board requirements for recusal and disqualification was pending Thursday morning.
WQCC Chair Bruce Thomson, when reached by phone on Thursday, said any comment on the motions themselves would be “premature,” but also noted he has no qualms with the members of the cabinet and their actions taken on the board.
“I have no questions about their service on the commission, or at least I have no questions about their integrity, and their honesty,” he said. “They’re honorable people, they’re dedicated to the state of New Mexico and to public service.”
Thomson said the board would likely set an agenda for the upcoming Oct. 14 meeting of the board next week.

(Photo provided by the Cherokee Nation)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Cherokee Nation has signed an agreement with the federal government to take over operation of the Claremore Indian Hospital. 
The Claremore facility is the last Indian Health Service facility on the Cherokee Nation’s land still operated by the federal government, according to a news release. 
The transfer, signed by Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is effective Oct. 1.  
Hoskin said the transfer is an example of how self governance continues to “transform” the Cherokee Nation. 
“This is more than a transfer of management,” Hoskin said in a statement. “It is a moment in which decisions about health care are being placed directly into the hands of the Cherokee and Native people, the very ones who rely on this hospital most.”
The Cherokee Nation’s health system already handles 2.6 million patient visits per year across 11 health facilities. 
“Tribal Nations know best how to provide culturally appropriate care for their citizens,” Kennedy said.
About $11 million has already been committed by the Cherokee Nation to improve the Claremore facility. Another $244 million has been authorized for a “state-of-the-art replacement facility” that is expected to open in 2027. 
While the new facility suspends operations, the tribe’s health care system will absorb the Claremore area’s inpatient cases, according to a news release. Claremore’s inpatient average was about four patients per day. 
The tribal nation will double its inpatient capacity with a new Tahlequah hospital and the new Claremore health campus will be designed for future expansions. 
Hiring preference was given to employees of Claremore Indian Hospital and 80% who reapplied were offered positions, according to a news release.

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Republican and Democratic parties announced Wednesday that they will hold primary elections to choose their candidates for the upcoming state Senate District 26 special election.
The legislative seat became vacant upon Sen. Gary Stubblefield’s death earlier this month. The Republican from Branch served 16 years in the Legislature and was reelected last year to a term ending in January 2029.
Last week, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders gave both of the state’s major political parties until Thursday to notify her office whether they would hold a primary election or a convention of delegates to select a candidate for the election to finish Stubblefield’s term.
“It is important that the people of this district have the opportunity to choose their Republican nominee through a fair and open process,” GOP Chairman Joseph Wood said in a Wednesday news release. “A special primary election is the best way to ensure their voices are heard.”
Senate District 26 includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties. As of Thursday, three Republicans and no Democrats have announced their intention to run for the seat.
“We’re looking forward to the mudslinging that we’ll see in the crowded Republican primary field as Gov. Sanders desperately attempts to install a pro-prison rubber stamp in the State Senate,” Democratic Party Chairman Marcus Jones said in a news release.
Republicans Brad Simon and Ted Tritt, both Paris businessmen, stated in their campaign announcements that they oppose Sanders’ plan to build a 3,000-bed prison on 815 acres of land in Franklin County. Stubblefield was a vocal opponent of the proposed prison.
Mark Berry of Ozark, the third Republican candidate so far, did not mention the prison in his campaign announcement. Berry is a military veteran, former adjutant general of the Arkansas National Guard and a former two-term state representative who declined to run for reelection last year.
Arkansas lawmakers consider other funding methods as they abandon sixth prison appropriation vote

Jones noted in the Democratic Party’s news release that a $750 million appropriation bill to support the prison’s construction died after five failed votes in the Senate earlier this year.
“This is Arkansas’s moment to reject corruption and cronyism and deliver a win for common sense and decency,” Jones said. “…From the roads, to the water infrastructure, to the electrical grid, to the non-existent workforce, to the furious voters of Senate District 26, there’s not one good reason to build a brand new billion-dollar prison in Franklin County. That’s what this Special Election will be about.”
Tritt and Simon previously announced their intention to run for the House District 46 seat, soon to be vacated by term-limited Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris. Three other Republicans and no Democrats remain in that primary field so far.
Sanders’ office has yet to announce the dates for the special primary and general elections.

Sept. 3, 2025 | Photo By Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceMuch has been said about the Michigan House Republican claims about “waste, fraud and abuse” in government and the allegedly bloated budgets the state has produced since the pandemic days of 2020, but for Speaker Matt Hall, the “ghost jobs” issue is a real problem.
The House GOP is hoping the state will adopt some form of its $78.5 billion proposal that contains massive cuts to agencies and programs across the board. At present, those talks remain at a standstill.
One of the major mantras in the House GOP’s budget talks is the caucus’ belief that the state’s agencies have tens of thousands of positions funded in previous budgets, which remain unfilled. Hall (R-Richland Township), House Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) and the committee’s vice chair, state Rep. Matt Maddock (R-Milford), have repeatedly called those unfilled positions “ghost jobs” and accused the agencies of keeping the money while in an attempt to fund other priorities – all while holding onto “phantom employees.”
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

There has been some discrepancy on how many of those phantom positions exist, but Hall, in an interview with Michigan Advance, said something needs to change and that eliminating the excess dollars in various budgets for employees he says that aren’t there was a good first step.
“We’re entering a post-COVID era, and you’re either going to have to raise taxes to continue this level of government or you’re going to have to go back to what was normal pre-COVID,” Hall said of the GOP’s budget considerations and cuts. “With some of the Medicaid changes, that’s even more real than it might have been before.”
The speaker added that his team’s understanding of “phantom employees” has only grown since they’ve had a chance to dig into the issue through the budget process.
“Every week that goes by we get more information,” Hall said. “When we were coming into this, we thought it was about $500 million and then we realized that it was more like $750 million. So we came out with a number that was our best guess.”
Democrats in both chambers of the Legislature and the various heads of several state departments have said that they are flatly wrong.
State agency heads warn House budget could kneecap operations, harm Michiganders

The Department of State Police has been a major target for cuts to department resources. State Police Director Col. James Grady said last week that $40.2 million in budget cuts proposed by the House, and the slashing of an equivalent 297.5 full time positions for post operations, would be devastating.
The situation has led to accusations from Democrats that House Republicans were the party of defunding the police, which Hall and others have brushed off, saying they are attempting to route budget funding into a public safety trust fund aimed at boosting spending for local law enforcement.
Other department heads or their spokespeople have also said that the House was dealing with bad or outdated information to reach their phantom jobs claims.
Senate Democrats have also chimed in, saying that if the GOP budget team was worth its salt, it wouldn’t interpret the unfilled jobs as a clear example of wasteful spending and taxpayer dollar abuse.

The House Republican calculus on phantom jobs
Information provided to the Advance shows that the House GOP budget team pulled its information from multiple state agency reports.
They include quarterly full-time equivalent jobs reports that multiple departments are legally required to publish on their websites; and annual reports from the state’s Civil Service Commission, showing the backend accounting system.
The quarterly reports look at how many actual employees, or FTEs, each department has in that quarter, but they don’t account for overtime or additional dollars for a given position. For example, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources might have 1,700 employees in the winter time, but in the summertime, they could have double the amount of employees. House leadership posits that as you go through the year, accounting for overtime, the overall number of employees might be somewhere closer to the middle.
As for the annual reports, the House has used those to get more real-time, backend accounting looks at the number of filled and open full-time equivalents the departments have, but those are not quite as official or authoritative as the quarterly reports.
State Police and the Department of Corrections have been targets for House Republican oversight since they took back the chamber in 2024, following two years of a government trifecta. Grady has been called into House Oversight Committee hearings over the last year to touch on a number of issues the caucus has with his leadership of the state’s largest law enforcement agency. Corrections has also seen some pushback from representatives and senators alike when it comes to staffing and security issues.
With phantom jobs in focus, Hall and his team are claiming that Corrections consistently has 600 to 700 unfilled FTEs, not accounting for overtime, and about 2,900 unfilled deputy positions in State Police consistently over the last few years.
Corrections has had significant challenges in terms of staffing and recruiting, despite the department’s best efforts to boost recruitment and try to relieve the department of mandatory overtime shifts, which has affected morale and conditions from the corrections officers down to the prison population itself.
The Advance asked if those unfilled positions in Corrections were more a symptom of the challenges it has faced in recent years than a sign that the department was trying to misuse its funding.
In response, House officials have said that in 2025, according to their accounting, Corrections had 2,700 unfilled positions. Its budget proposal for the next fiscal year pulls out 775 of those positions, and the House appears confident that the department would still have enough wiggle room to hold new corrections classes of 100 recruits each and then use the leftover money to incentivize higher wages.
For State Police, the House GOP has calculated that it had found 738 so-called “phantom jobs,” but is only getting rid of 435 of them in its spending proposal. It has said the cuts would still provide for overtime, two trooper schools in the next fiscal year and give them greater flexibility.
The House considered that the problem might stem from a wage issue in the department for corrections officers, and the same might be true for State Police. That’s why, despite clamouring for the cuts in “phantom jobs,” the House GOP is hoping to give each department close to 20% raises with enough room for recruitment and overtime.

But is it really a fraud?
Calls for state government to mind its budget better have resonated with a wide swath of voters and leaders of all political stripes ad infinitum, but the new GOP ethos of targeting programs it doesn’t like has faced backlash as its leaders – much like Elon Musk and the  Department of Government Efficiency he formerly led – have claimed that those same programs are evidence of fraud and abuse of power.
Such was the mantra for Medicaid cuts at the federal level, and the dismantling of federal influence or involvement in public education.
Still, Hall said there is a legitimate concern when looking at past budgets and the departments’ own reports of seeing money go in for a specific purpose and then not being used for that purpose – in this case, the hiring of additional positions with a range of duties that never materialize.
For the House GOP, even in the best case scenario of the department not using the money for a nefarious purpose, that’s still money sitting in a vault somewhere because of what the caucus claims is a bad accounting process.
That was the House GOP’s most salient argument, the Advance was told, as to why the state doesn’t appear to have money to pay for a long-term $3 billion roads plan or properly fund K-12 and higher education.
There have also been accusations that the state departments have been using those unused funds as a sort of reserve or slush fund that no other previous Legislature was willing to give them as a specific line item.
“The more you comb into it, you can categorize some of this stuff as … gaming it so it looks different than what their intent is,” Hall said.
In the case of State Police, House Republicans claimed that the department is using that money for things like office supplies and building maintenance, whereas the caucus also claims that Corrections has in the past rolled its FTE line into its facility line items.
House leadership is making the case that many of the departments do this and label those efforts to move money around as work projects, but it has been told that both State Police and Corrections don’t do that, and just end up keeping the FTE money and still use it for other purposes.
State Police spokesperson Shanon Banner, in a statement to the Advance, said that all FTEs are critical and the department is constantly working to fulfill them.
Corrections, when asked to respond to the GOP’s claims, deferred comment to the State Budget Office. 
When asked, Lauren Leeds, communications director with the budget office, said: There are no phantom jobs.

The cuts have to come from somewhere, GOP says
As evidenced by public comments from Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) and her appropriations team, the Democrats in the upper chamber aren’t buying what Hall is selling.
Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), in a recent news conference, said that Hall’s assertion that eliminating “phantom jobs” would be a massive fix to state budgeting – and his team’s labeling that as fraud – showed either a “stunning ignorance of basic budgeting, or it’s a deliberate attempt to mislead the public.”
Hall countered by telling the Advance that it shouldn’t be this difficult to eliminate money for positions that he insists aren’t there, and that was one of many reasons why budget talks have stalled. The longer the negotiations go on, or don’t, the GOP claims it has a better understanding of the financial issues that have stymied growth in the state.
“Brinks doesn’t believe there’s any waste, fraud or abuse,” Hall said. “What I’m saying is, if we can’t even cut ghost employees from the budget, then we’re never going to get a roads deal because they’re only going to do tax increases. … They ask for more money than they need and they keep it.”

(Photo courtesy of Kyra Kearse)When Kyra Kearse first visited a pharmacy to pick up free boxes of the overdose reversal drug naloxone, she had a flashback to herself five years earlier, when she was buying drugs and living on the street.
“How many do you want?” the pharmacist asked her in December about naloxone, often known by the name brand Narcan.

“How many can you give me?” Kearse replied.
Kearse, who works with other people in recovery and is approved to distribute large amounts of naloxone, organized Save a Life Day events Thursday in York and Chester counties to hand out free boxes of the medication, which can reverse an opioid overdose.
Originally started in West Virginia, Save a Life Day has grown from two counties in West Virginia to events in every state, including a dozen counties in South Carolina, according to its website.
The event comes as overdose deaths decreased for a second year in South Carolina, though officials have warned that new drugs are deadlier, and some are less responsive or not at all responsive to naloxone.
Many of the organizations participating offer free naloxone throughout the year, organizers said. Save a Life Day, which looks different depending on the county, gives treatment centers and nonprofits a chance to highlight the medication’s significance and correct common misconceptions, organizers said.
The medication is provided free of charge through grants from the South Carolina Opioid Recovery Fund, which is responsible for doling out the more than $360 million the state is expected to receive from a $26 billion settlement legal settlement with three of the nation’s primary drug distributors.
York and Chester counties
Kearse, who lives in Rock Hill, picked up 300 naloxone kits Thursday morning, many of which she will distribute among nonprofits, such as Pathways Community Center and Keystone Substance Abuse Services. The rest, Kearse will offer to people living in homeless encampments, she said.
After spending five years homeless and addicted to drugs, Kearse is intimately familiar with the way addiction and homelessness go hand in hand, she said. Despite the prevalence of addiction among people who are homeless, encampments often lack access to life-saving drugs like naloxone, she said.
“I’ve never seen a drug take away a person’s life the way fentanyl and meth do,” Kearse said. “The devil is at work, but God works harder.”
Kearse also traveled to neighboring Chester County to drop off free naloxone at the Hazel Pittman Center, a nonprofit meant to help treat addiction, she said. Chester County doesn’t have a formal Save a Life Day event scheduled, but the treatment center hosted a conference about how to reduce the use of opioids, which will hopefully mean more efforts year-round, Kearse said.
Charleston County
In Charleston County, nonprofits, law enforcement and county employees planned to hand out naloxone at six different locations, said Sarah Halse, opioid initiative coordinator for the county-run Charleston Center. The county also staged pop-ups in the more rural parts of the county, she said.

The county, which offers naloxone for free all year, has hundreds of kits to give out, Halse said.
“We’re really just out here trying to raise awareness, reduce stigma and educate the community,” Halse said.
Anderson and Spartanburg counties
Palmetto Carolina Treatment Center in Duncan had about 200 boxes of naloxone available for pickup Thursday, and Southwest Carolina Treatment Center in Anderson had about 250, said Candace Latimer, a program director for Carolina Treatment Centers, in an email.
While Save a Life Day is a way to highlight resources such as naloxone, the centers have naloxone available for free every day and are looking for ways to get more of it into the hands of people who might need it, Latimer said.
The centers are also working to raise awareness at local schools, businesses and other community groups about naloxone and what it does, with the goal of continuing to decrease the number of overdose deaths, she said.
“By empowering individuals with the knowledge and tools to act in critical moments, we are making strides toward a safer and healthier community,” Latimer said.
Hampton, Jasper and Allendale counties
New Life Center is holding off on its official event in Hampton County until Saturday to align with Varnville’s Celebrating Small Town America Festival, said Emily Ginn, a peer support specialist for the addiction recovery service.

The group wanted to go where people would already be, Ginn said. The Save a Life Day distributions will be part of a larger resource fair involving other nonprofits offering different sorts of help, she said.
People visiting for other resources can then pick up some naloxone and pass on the goodwill, Ginn said.
“If Narcan isn’t the way to help save your life, it could be the way to save someone else’s life, and the next thing could be the way to save your life,” Ginn said. “We all have struggles.”
Ginn will bring 78 boxes of naloxone, with the goal of handing out all of them. She also helped organize distributions in Allendale and Jasper counties, also under New Life Center’s service area, last weekend at similar resource fairs.
Between the two counties, the outpatient service center handed out nearly 100 naloxone kits, an impressive number for the small, rural communities, Ginn said.
Already, that’s more than quadruple what New Life Center gave out last year during its inaugural Save a Life Day, which Tropical Storm Helene forced the center to reschedule, she said.
‘There’s still hope’
Save a Life Day carries personal significance to Ginn, who has been in recovery for four years after 20 years of active addiction. Although she never had naloxone used on her, she saw it save friends’ lives during overdoses, she said.

When people don’t want to take a naloxone kit because of the stigma around drug use or because they think it enables addiction, telling them her own history of addiction often helps change their mind, she said.
Having naloxone on hand and not needing it is better than needing it and not having it, Ginn and other organizers said. And it doesn’t enable anything but breathing in a person having an overdose, they said.
There’s no saying what might be a person’s tipping point that causes them to get sober, Ginn said. Addicts are people, too, and their lives are worth saving, she added.
Seeing people in every state committed to giving out free naloxone “means there’s still hope in our society and our nation,” Ginn said. “I don’t think I’ve ever been a part of something so big.”
Ginn never saw herself working in addiction recovery, but after three years working for the same treatment center where she was once a patient, she’s striving to do everything she can to help people in similar situations, she said.
“It just fills my heart with so much joy because there’s that chance of someone’s life being saved who is where I was at,” Ginn said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9594-scaled-e1758822283854-1024x639.jpeg,,,2025-09-25 14:56:48.110368

Judge William E. Smith’s 45-page decision issued this week orders FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security to release funds for more than 50 programs because the decision to withhold them from so-called sanctuary states was “arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional.”
Smith wrote that the financial pressure on states to comply or lose irreplaceable federal funding “goes well beyond ‘relatively mild encouragement’ … and amounts instead to ‘economic dragooning.’”
“The record shows that states rely on these grants for billions of dollars annually in disaster relief and public safety funds that cannot be replaced by state revenues,” Smith wrote. “Denying such funding if states refuse to comply with vague immigration requirements leaves them with no meaningful choice, particularly where state budgets are already committed.”
Connecticut was one of 20 states that filed the federal lawsuit in May in Rhode Island, alleging that the withholding of funding was not only impacting the state’s ability to respond to disasters but also to other vital programs involving responses to mass shootings, wildfires and cybersecurity threats.
The judge approved the states’ motion for summary judgment.
“You cannot play politics with disaster relief. Not with lives and communities on the line. We sued, and this decision is a decisive victory for public safety and our sovereign states,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a press release Thursday.
“This decision states unequivocally that Donald Trump’s baseless actions were once again arbitrary and capricious … and that he had zero authority to override the will of Congress. We’re going to keep fighting and we’re going to keep winning to stop Trump from defunding our states,” Tong added.
DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement Thursday that “the Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law and no lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that.”
“Radical sanctuary politicians need to put the safety of the American people first—not criminal illegal aliens. Cities and states who break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding,” McLaughlin said.
In February, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem issued a memorandum titled “restricting grant funding for sanctuary jurisdictions.” A FEMA administrator at the time identified only 12 of 53 programs where the government could lawfully withhold funding from sanctuary states, but despite that, DHS revised its policy to include all federal programs covered by FEMA and DHS, according to the lawsuit.
After the lawsuit was filed, the government revised the initial order twice to say only 13 of 53 programs would be under DHS review regarding assistance in immigration cases. In arguing against the summary judgment motion, attorneys for the Department of Justice argued the lawsuit was now “moot” because the order had been rolled back and the remaining 13 programs were still under review. 
But Smith ruled the “partial rescission cannot moot the controversy where the government continues to assert the authority to enforce the challenged policy.”
“DHS still asserts it was authorized to impose these immigration-related conditions, continues to publish them in its standard terms, and has not issued amended agreements to plaintiff states reflecting any exemption,” Smith wrote.
“Since 2021, Connecticut has received more than $1.2 billion from FEMA to prevent, protect against and respond to flooding and other natural disasters, terrorism, mass casualty events and other catastrophes,” Tong said in a press release. “These conditions would also damage the carefully built trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities that is critical to promoting public safety.”

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Poor practices surrounding account reconciliation, receipts and cash deposits allowed for the theft of about $188,000 from the Iron County Building Department to go undetected, according to a review by the Utah State Auditor’s Office.
The office manager in the department is accused of pocketing cash payments made to the department for building permits from 2018 to 2025, the review released Wednesday found. 
A call to the Utah State Auditor’s hotline that prompted the investigation, according to the review, after a similar complaint made to Iron County Auditor Lucas Little failed to identify any missing funds.

Chelsea Boxwell, 42, was charged Sept. 3 in 5th District Court with misusing public money and theft, both second-degree felonies. Details of the charges in that case are sealed; a probable cause statement filed in connection to a separate case said that Boxwell told investigators she had taken “some of” the building permit payments and used them for “bills, child expenses, and other things.”
That separate case, filed Sept. 5 charging Boxwell with theft, a second-degree felony, alleges that when Boxwell spoke to authorities about the building department investigation she told them she had also taken money from a property management company she worked for part time, and was paying it back. Bank records from 2022-2024 showed Boxwell deposited $119,609 in checks to herself, investigators wrote in the probable cause statement.  
Boxwell’s attorney declined to comment on the case.

Utah State Auditor Tina Cannon in a statement issued Wednesday praised the whistleblower who used the hotline to report the money missing from the Iron County Building Department.
“With that information, our Office was able to initiate our limited review, bring additional facts to light, and ensure proper safeguards were implemented going forward. Our role is not only to identify weaknesses, but also to help counties and cities strengthen their systems so public money is protected,” Cannon said.
The review notes that hotline tips are the most common and effective way that misuse of public funds is exposed. The State Auditor’s Office will use what it has learned in Iron County to train other entities, the news release says.
According to the review by the State Auditor’s Office, the building department’s office manager submitted spreadsheets to the Iron County Auditor’s Office for monthly reconciliation rather than proper records. The report also found that the county auditor did not account for missing permit numbers from the sequence listed on the spreadsheets. 
When first notified about the misused funds, the Iron County Auditor’s Office reviewed only the spreadsheets, failing to uncover the missing money, the review found.
Additionally, the report found the building department was depositing the cash payments it received just once a week, while Utah Code requires funds be deposited at least once every three banking days.
Auditors also reviewed receipt practices for nine Iron County departments, finding two of them — the building department and the County Events Center — at higher risk for misused funds. 
In its response, the Iron County Board of Commissioners acknowledged the department’s insufficient reconciliation process, saying the auditor’s office was previously unaware of the software system the county uses to log permits and deposits, but is now using the program.
The commissioners also wrote that steps are being taken to improve receipt practices and to deposit funds twice weekly.

(Photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)North Carolina AFL-CIO president Braxton Winston II, a longtime Democratic activist in Charlotte, said he will fight for the rights of all workers regardless of political affiliation and sees opportunities for cooperation with the Republican-controlled General Assembly.
“You’re going to have a disproportionate level of investment to the upside in industry, both emerging industries as well as legacy industries, in North Carolina,” Winston said in an interview with NC Newsline. “I look forward to working with whoever is going to come to the table to make this state the number one state for both businesses and workers.”
Those initiatives could include helping to bring energy, transportation, and infrastructure investments into the state and advancing workforce development programs to match that growth, he said.
Winston, 42, was elected to lead the NC AFL-CIO at its Wilmington convention on Sept. 12, as longtime labor leader MaryBe McMillan departs the role. He won the election with roughly 86% of the vote against Rodney Hughes, president of the Communications Workers of America Local 3607.
A member of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees as a union stagehand and grip, Winston said that he ran for NC AFL-CIO president at McMillan’s urging.
“When I got the phone call and she was retiring, I was taken aback, like everybody else around the world. I was also taken aback when she suggested I think about this position,” Winston said in his convention speech. “As it was said yesterday, over and over again, you saw something in me that I didn’t necessarily see in myself, so thank you for that.”
‘Determination to fight back’

	
 McMillan, the first woman to serve as the state federation’s president, said she put an emphasis on building a “leaderful movement” during her time in office, working to welcome a wide variety of voices into the labor cause and helping them build the skills to become the best advocates the can be. “It’s really important to create opportunities for new leaders to emerge — this movement needs to build a movement for the future,” she said.
An officer of the NC AFL-CIO for 20 years and president for the past eight, McMillan said she’s proud to have helped achieve “major organizing victories” in her time in leadership.
In an interview with NC Newsline, she pointed to the Duke Graduate Student Union getting its first contract with the university just this year — after two years of negotiating and roughly a decade of organizing. And during the pandemic,  the NC AFL-CIO helped back successful union efforts among workers at Smithfield Packing in Tar Heel and nurses at Mission Hospital in Asheville.
“All those campaigns, they were able to win because they built a movement,” McMillan said. “It wasn’t just about the union, it was about how this would also benefit the community in terms of like, with Mission Hospital, that they’re advocating for better health care, lower staff-patient ratios, and they really built a coalition.”

Stepping down amid significant strife between unions and the federal government, she said she is “really encouraged” by the fire she’s seen from federal workers. Crackdowns on their unions and rights are fueling workers’ determination to fight back, McMillan said.
“I think there’s a real determination that even though we’re facing all these attacks, especially on the federal level, that we can make a difference, and now is the time more than ever for us to stand up and fight,” she said. “It’s on the one hand a challenging moment, but it’s also a real moment of opportunity.”
One of McMillan’s signature achievements was a successful resolution at the 2022 AFL-CIO convention urging labor leaders to invest in the South, where labor organizing has historically faced significant obstacles. The AFL-CIO’s national president, Liz Shuler, praised McMillan for working to create that focus on the South.
“It’s taken some time to get everything in place, but we are following through, and now everyone sees what you have seen for years, that there is a massive, massive opportunity to organize here in the South,” Shuler said.
McMillan said she will remain on to aid Winston in the transition for the next month and will continue to act as a labor advocate in her post-presidential life.
‘I decided to put my body on the line’
Coming into leadership as the labor movement faces some of its greatest challenges of the 21st century is an opportunity that excites Winston, even as he will be forced to confront the federal government head-on.
“In some cases, it seems to be an existential threat to unions and certainly is an attack on workers, period,” Winston said. “I take heed to the wins and losses that have occurred during many precarious times to understand that solidarity is the path forward, and sometimes those forces that seem to beat us down have ways of driving working people closer together.”
He is no stranger to resistance against the government, particularly in the Trump era. Winston drew national attention in 2016 after the fatal shooting by police of Charlotte man Keith Lamont Scott, which sparked citywide protests. A photo of Winston standing up to riot police, fist raised, as they fired tear gas into the crowd went viral, and he won election to the Charlotte City Council the following year.

“When a man was killed waiting for his kids to get off the school bus, I had to show up,” he said at the convention. “I decided to put my body on the line, I had decided to use my voice to speak up for others — largely because of the lessons I had been learning as I entered this movement.”
After concluding his term as a council member in 2023, Winston was nominated by the Democratic Party for labor commissioner in the 2024 election and earned 47.2% of the vote, though lost to Republican Luke Farley by 5.6 percentage points.
“As I was going around the state over the past two previous years running for commissioner of labor, what I’ve learned is that a lot of people don’t know what unions actually are in this state,” Winston said in the interview. “They only understand what they’ve heard — they’ve only been told that they should be afraid of unions.”
Part of the problem, Winston said, is a reticence among Democratic Party leadership to stand up for workers’ rights, a failure that struck him throughout the 2024 elections as he sought the labor commissioner’s office.
“To be completely honest, the Democratic Party leadership did not invest in talking about worker issues. They didn’t want to talk about fair pay, worker safety, and workers’ rights,” he said. “But the labor movement at the leadership of MaryBe had a comprehensive plan on how to do that, and I felt those effects all across the state as I traveled.”
In a state with the lowest union participation rate in the U.S. at just 2.4%, building a successful labor movement can be a herculean task. But, Winston said, “there’s nothing more American than the idea of a union — it says it right there in the preamble of the Constitution.”
“We all work for somebody, and we understand that if work together and collectively, we can have better leverage over our bosses and managers,” he added. “Going and having those conversations, educating people about what labor is all about, is an important thing.”
He added that it was “excellent” to see political leaders in the state join union organizers at this year’s convention and give remarks backing labor rights — most prominently Gov. Josh Stein and state Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs.
“The ability to garner political power is certainly important and we’re going to look to do that all across this state, whether that’s in state government or in our local halls of government as well. Everybody can be partners to this,” Winston said.
The midterm elections will be a focus for the union, Winston said, but for now his priority is learning the “nuts and bolts” of leading the state’s largest labor federation from McMillan during the transition period.

(Hart Van Denburg/CPR, pool)Colorado’s largest electric utility announced Wednesday that it had agreed to settle a lawsuit over its alleged role in the most destructive wildfire in state history.
Xcel Energy’s announcement of the $640 million settlement came one day before the start of a civil trial in Boulder County District Court, where thousands of homeowners, businesses and insurers impacted by the 2021 Marshall Fire had filed a lawsuit seeking damages from Xcel and two telecommunications companies.
The Marshall Fire killed two people and destroyed nearly 1,100 homes and businesses in Louisville, Superior and unincorporated areas of Boulder County after igniting on Dec 30, 2021. Fueled by dry conditions and high winds, the fire’s destructive path through densely populated suburban neighborhoods in midwinter put a spotlight on heightened wildfire risks brought on by climate change.

Investigators with the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office later determined that the fire had been caused by two different ignition points located roughly half a mile apart: a burning debris pile on a property owned by the Twelve Tribes religious group, and an unmoored Xcel Energy power line. The two fires quickly merged together, and the combined blaze grew to over 6,000 acres in size. No criminal charges were filed in connection with either ignition source.
In an investor filing Tuesday, Xcel said that it “did not admit any fault, wrongdoing or negligence in connection with these settlement agreements.”










For some, the trauma and financial losses remain incredibly difficult. It is our hope that any settlement will allow all those impacted to continue to recover and rebuild.


– Michael Dougherty, Boulder County district attorney


“Despite our conviction that (Xcel) equipment did not cause the Marshall Fire or plaintiffs’ damages, we have always been open to a resolution that properly accounts for the strong defenses we have to these claims,” Xcel CEO Bob Frenzel said in a press release.
“We recognize that the fire and its aftermath have been difficult and painful for many, and we hope that our and the telecom defendants’ contributions in today’s settlement can bring some closure for the community,” Frenzel added.
More than half of the settlement amount will come from Xcel’s insurance coverage, the company said, and ratepayers will not be forced to cover any of the remaining cost.
Total damages from the fire were estimated at over $2 billion.
“Thousands of people suffered devastating losses from the Marshall Fire,” Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said in a statement. “For some, the trauma and financial losses remain incredibly difficult. It is our hope that any settlement will allow all those impacted to continue to recover and rebuild.”

Ron DeSantis may ask the Legislature for an additional $4 million to maintain a warehouse in Lakeland for the state’s Canadian Prescription Drug Importation Program. 
The Agency for Health Care Administration seeks the support in its legislative budget request for state fiscal year 2025-26. Florida law requires agencies to submit spending requests that can serve as a sneak peak of what the governor will include in his recommended budget for the coming year.
Without the annual $4 million bump, “AHCA would be unable to implement the program as directed by the Legislature and no longer have the infrastructure required to support the Program,” the agency wrote in its budget request.

Florida was  the first state to gain approval to import prescription drugs from Canada when the Food and Drug Administration gave the state the green light in January 2024 for a two-year pilot project.
But it continues to face delays in implementation.
AHCA is required to submit a report annually to the Legislature and the governor’s office with a lengthy list of data requirements and documentation showing “the program provides cost savings to the state on imported prescription drugs. “
The Florida Phoenix requested a copies of annual reports from 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 but the agency did not respond.
The $4 million request coincides with the Lakeland Ledger’s dive into the payments the DeSantis administration has made to LifeScience Logistics, which holds the contract with the state to administer the yet-to-be implemented program.
Four years after LifeScience Logistics built a warehouse in Lakeland, the Ledger reported the “facility is a quiet place.” The lack of activity belies a financial footprint that shows LifeScience Logistics received $77.2 million in fiscal year 2025. That was a sharp increase from the $51.7 million the company collected for the contract between fiscal years 2021 through 2024.
“Since July 1, the start of fiscal year 2026, the state has paid the company $3.7 million. That includes three deposits on Sept. 2 totaling $1.3 million for construction services,” the Ledger reported.
Alex Azar is chairman of the board for LifeScience Logistics. Azar served as U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services under Trump’s first administration.
 Medicaid survey

AHCA’s request also shows that the state wants a baseline analysis of its Medicaid population’s health and social services “to support informed policy decisions and allocation of resources to support individual Medicaid enrollees on their path towards stability, economic self-sufficiency, and graduation from enrollment.”
There were 4.07 million people enrolled in Florida’s Medicaid program in August 2025, the latest available data. Florida’s top economists routinely meet to analyze Florida Medicaid data and to project costs, utilization, and enrollment trends. The group, known as the Social Services Estimating Conference, examines Medicaid costs with the exception of those related to people with intellectual or developmental disabilities.
The budget narrative says AHCA would competitively procure the $3.5 million contract.
 Network provider audits

AHCA relies on Medicaid managed care plans to care for the majority of people in the safety net program. The August data show 2.96 million enrolled in some sort of state-contracted Medicaid managed care plan.
The plans are required to maintain a network of providers to meet the health care access standard set by the state. Plans must establish and maintain an accurate and complete electronic database of contracted providers, locations, and hours of operation, plus specialty credentials, among other things. Each managed care plan is required to submit quarterly reports to the Agency identifying the number of enrollees assigned to each primary care provider.
In its budget narrative, AHCA says it needs $6.8 million to hire an outside vendor to audit the provider networks “and any other activities to verify provider networks as identified by the Agency.”
Unlike other spending proposals, that $6.8 million isn’t coming from public coffers, per se. “The managed care plans will pay the Agency for the expenses of the vendor’s network review, at the rates established by the Agency, proportionate to the managed care plan’s enrolled population. The Agency will then transfer payment to the vendor for services rendered,” the budget notes.

Ned Lamont signed an agreement with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Thursday that will delegate oversight of radioactive materials used in medicine, academics and industry to state officials in Connecticut.
The agreement expands the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s current authority to regulate radiation-emitting devices such as X-rays and CT scans — which are typically the purview of the states — to also include radioactive substances such as tracers used to detect cancer or cracks in underground water pipes.
Radioactive material used in nuclear power plants, as well as its subsequent waste, will continue to be regulated and overseen by federal authorities at the NRC.  
During a signing ceremony in the state Capitol on Thursday, NRC Chairman David A. Wright said the agreement eliminates duplicative regulations and allows professionals who work with nuclear materials to coordinate directly with state regulators to ensure proper handling and disposal.
“You know your people better than we do, and they know you,” Wright said. “So there’s that trust factor built in.”
Lamont, meanwhile, pitched the agreement as part of his administration’s efforts “to be a little more business friendly, and speed things up and make them happen.” 
Connecticut is the 40th state to enter into such an agreement with the NRC covering nuclear materials. Two other states, Indiana and West Virginia, have also signaled their intent to sign similar agreements.
DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said there are over 100 business in Connecticut handling nuclear materials that will benefit from the agreement. “Connecticut will be able to streamline processes and increase efficiency, all while maintaining the highest safety standards,” she said.
As part of the agreement, Dykes said that the NRC will continue to monitor and provide support and training for the state-run program. 
As part of the agreement, Connecticut will begin collecting roughly $1.7 million in annual revenue from license fees that previously went to the NRC to fund its regulatory efforts, according to Jeff Semancik, director of DEEP’s radiation division.
In order to take on additional duties required by the agreement, Semancik said the radiation division has already hired one additional staff member and plans to bring on two more, bringing its total number of employees to 15. Currently, Semancik said the division’s work includes hospital inspections, emergency management and responding to any incidents at Millstone Nuclear Power Plant in Waterford.
Connecticut first signaled its intent to enter into an agreement with the NRC in 2020, and Dykes said that formalizing the deal required several years of planning, drafts and adjustments to state law.
DEEP staff, she added, have received “thousands of hours” of training from their federal counterparts in licensing, inspection and enforcement of the rules pertaining to nuclear material handling.
The agreement formally takes effect on Oct. 1, when Connecticut assumes its regulatory authority from the NRC.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6570-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-25 13:57:32.242548

Sanchez is a member of Make the Road Connecticut, an immigrant advocacy organization, and Hartford Deportation Defense. He has testified in front of Connecticut lawmakers in support of expanding HUSKY to unauthorized immigrants.
The crowd, holding signs and chanting, listened as 19-year-old Victor Sanchez Jr. and 17-year-old Silvana Sanchez talked about their father. 
“I’m really mad right now because I’m not only losing my dad, but I’m losing my best friend as well,” said Silvana Sanchez. 
Silvana said her father encouraged her when she was frustrated with school, telling her that he’d come to the U.S. so his children could have a better life. She said her parents are the reason she’s working toward her dream of becoming a nurse. 
Her brother, Victor Sanchez Jr., said he sometimes helped his father with his contracting business, working on apartments. 
“He’s [been] taken away, and all that work that he has was for nothing. His dream was to start a business, and he did, but yet his dream is probably getting taken away,” said Victor Jr. 

Teresa Quintana, an organizer at Make the Road Connecticut, speaks and leads chants at a protest outside the Abraham A. Ribicoff Federal Building and Courthouse on September 24, 2025. Activists from immigrants’ rights organizations gathered at the courthouse in protest of the detention of activist and community member Victor Sanchez earlier that afternoon. 
Sanchez arrived in the U.S. in 2004. A native of Mexico, he has three children — Victor Jr., Silvana, and a 2-year-old son, all of whom are U.S. citizens. 
According to the Connecticut Judicial Branch records, Sanchez was arrested for driving under the influence in 2019 and sentenced to probation, which he completed in 2020.
But Constanza Segovia, co-founder of Hartford Deportation Defense and organizing director of CT for All, said that Sanchez had joined Alcoholics Anonymous, found recovery, and become a fixture in the community. 
“ He not only has gone through recovery and becomes sober himself, but he has been a leader in local groups and has supported many, many other people,” Segovia said. 
Sister Margarita Castañeda of the Congregation of Notre Dame said Sanchez was very active in his church, Our Lady of Sorrows in Hartford. “He showed his leadership right from the beginning,” she said.
“When I arrived, there was nothing to Our Lady of Guadalupe,” added Castañeda, referring to the Catholic image of the virgin Mary that has become the patroness of the Americas and Mexico. “Now we have Mass, we have Novenas, we have gatherings, but I don’t think we can do it this year. Our people are too afraid, and that frightens me.”
According to Segovia, Sanchez had a pending immigration case and had been complying with all the requirements brought forward by the court. 
“Victor has been following every single rule that this building has put in front of him. Every single rule. He has shown up, every time. He has done everything asked of him,” she said. 
Jacob Pudlin, co-chair of the Greater Hartford Democratic Socialist Alliance and a volunteer with Hartford Deportation Defense, said he had accompanied Sanchez to his six-month check-in with immigration officials that afternoon. He said he witnessed Sanchez be placed in handcuffs and taken away by five people. 
ICE officials did not return a request for comment.
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, and Hartford City Councilman Josh Michtom were also present outside the courthouse. Michtom called on his fellow city council members and state lawmakers to do more to stop ICE from detaining residents. 
Segovia also reiterated activists’ calls for new state laws that would make it more difficult for the federal government to access immigrants’ data, would prevent ICE agents from accessing state courthouses and allow people to attend court hearings remotely.
Sanchez’s attorney, Glenn Formica, said in a statement read by Segovia that he had filed a request to delay Sanchez’s deportation.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Silvana-and-Victor-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 14:56:48.110368

(Courtesy of Gary Stone)LINCOLN – An updated report on the impact of climate change in Nebraska says the state continues to get noticeably warmer and wetter.
The legislatively ordered report also concludes that predictions made in the last State Climate Report in 2014 – that the state was headed toward a climate more like Oklahoma – were spot on.
The 312-page report, authorized by the Nebraska Legislature in 2022 and submitted on Wednesday, predicts increased stress on the state’s water resources, particularly increased irrigation demand as growing seasons expand and more water evaporates from the soil and crops.
“Nebraska stands at a crossroads of experiencing and addressing the challenges climate change brings,” the report begins.
At a seminar detailing the document last week, State Climatologist Deb Bathke said the consensus among climate scientists that humans are contributing to faster heating of the planet has moved from theory to an established fact.

“There is no debate among scientists that climate change is happening,” Bathke told those attending the presentation at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Hardin Hall.
According to the report, produced by Bathke and 20 other “lead” authors, “Reputable climate scientists worldwide continue to be in near unanimous agreement (greater than 99%) that human influences have warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land.”
“Furthermore,” the report said, “the speed of the changing climate exceeds what can be attributed to natural variability.”
Eric Hunt, an assistant extension educator of agricultural meteorology and climate resilience at UNL, illustrated that by saying 1990 was once ranked as having the 8th warmest summer since 1890. It’s now ranked the state’s 30th warmest, he said, after so many record-breaking summers since.
“September is more August like,” Hunt added, though the early part of the month was an exception.
Overall, he said, cold winter temperatures are arriving later in the season, and there has been more precipitation at “the wrong time,” during spring planting season, delaying crucial activity.
The new State Climate Report, funded via bipartisan legislation sponsored by State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, a Democrat, and then-State Sen. Mike Flood, a Republican now serving in Congress, is a more comprehensive update of the state’s first climate impact report in 2014.
Chapters examine the impact of climate change on water resources and agriculture – the state’s top industry – but also on energy, human health and faith and Indigenous communities. Each chapter presents “gaps and needs.”
The report also includes supplemental recommendations from an independent, science-based consultant from Minnesota, paleBLUEdot, a group that worked on Omaha’s climate plan, about what can be done to mitigate and address climate change.

Among the report’s takeaways:
* Statewide annual temperatures are expected to rise by 5 to 6 degrees by 2050 compared to 1951-2014, and by 7 to 11.5 degrees by the end of the century.
* Summer and fall will warm slightly more than winter and spring, leading to more frequent and prolonged heat extremes.
* Extremely hot days, 90 degrees and hotter, will multiply two to four times, while extremely warm nights of 70 degrees or more could increase tenfold or more.
* Extreme precipitation events, particularly the most intense ones, are expected to rise in frequency and magnitude.
* By the end of the century, if greenhouse gas emissions aren’t reduced, the state could see more than 50 days a year with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees.
* Higher temperatures and drier conditions are leading to more extreme wildfires, which burn longer. The worst year in state history for those was 2012, burning 500,000 acres. The second worst was 2022, with 250,000 acres blackened, including the national forest at Halsey.
* The average number of winter days with at least 1 inch of snow on the ground has decreased statewide, with the biggest change hitting the Norfolk area, which was down to 48 days in recent years compared to 63 from 1951 to 1980.
* Agriculture faces more risks from rainfall variability, shifts in rainfall seasonality, more rapid drought development and intensification, rising temperatures, fewer very cold days (which help control pests) and heightened risks of wildfires and hail.
“These factors could significantly reduce agricultural output if unaddressed,” the report warned.
Nebraska climate report delayed to allow for ‘revisions’ and ‘further vetting’

Strategies to maintain productivity, the report said, include advancements in plant genetics, diversification of crops and cropping systems and improved soil and water management practices.
Overall, “decreasing greenhouse gas emissions can avoid climate change’s most significant changes and impacts,” the report said.
The consultant, paleBLUEdot, pointed out that Nebraska received a $307-million federal EPA grant to implement mitigation steps outlined in a 2024 Priority Climate Action Plan done by the Nebraska Department of Energy and Environment.
Those steps include adopting a statewide strategy for groundwater recharge, improving management of soil health, utilizing more filter strips along streams, planting more native turf and landscape plants, increasing water conservation education and providing funds for conservation easements. The consultant also suggested “decarbonizing” Nebraska energy generation and moving to 100% renewable energy by 2040.
Bathke, the state climatologist, told those attending the climate change seminar last week that she plans to take the report “on the road” to help Nebraskans understand it.
The consultant also recommended that the state develop a “Climate Mitigation and Resilience Plan” to help Nebraska deal with the challenges ahead.
The report, initially scheduled to be completed by the end of 2024, was delayed due to editing changes. It is available at https://nsco.unl.edu/news/nebraska-climate-assessment/.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)The state of Idaho’s massive overhaul of its business and accounting software in 2023 led to a number of errors on financial statements and weaknesses in processes for ensuring accuracy of those statements, a legislative audit found. 
The findings included reported financial misstatements of hundreds of millions of dollars for some agencies, duplicated payments, and a lack of processes to verify accuracy of statements between the State Controller’s Office, Idaho State Treasure’s Office, and the bank — many of these issues have been reported previously by the Idaho Capital Sun. 
The financial reporting errors don’t necessarily mean agencies spent more or less than they had, but problems could arise in the state budgeting process or potentially affect the state’s credit rating, Idaho lawmakers told the Sun. 
The state is required to submit an Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and audit of the entire state budget each year. This year’s report detailed fiscal year 2024 — which ran July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024 — and thus included some of the results of a bumpy implementation of the software, called Luma. 
The report is scheduled to be discussed at a Legislative Council meeting at 8:30 a.m. Friday at the state Capitol in Boise.

The co-chairs of Idaho’s budget-writing committee, the Joint Finance and Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, both said the report was concerning, but noted there are efforts underway to fix issues identified in it. 
“It’s problems like that that make the budgeting process difficult,” said co-chair Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls. “If we can’t rely on these numbers to be accurate, the budgeting process gets complicated real quick.” 
Co-chair Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, who is also a retired certified public accountant, said he was most concerned about the lack of process for reconciliation — ensuring the accounting system’s cash numbers matched the bank’s records. According to the report, amid the implementation of Luma, this process was no longer being completed for some categories of cash. 
“When there’s an uncertainty in cash, it puts a level of uncertainty about the overall financial statements,” Grow said. 
The State Controller’s Office pays the state’s bills and the Idaho Treasurer’s Office holds cash for the state. The system changeover caused hurdles in verifying agency fund balances for the Treasure’s Office, the Sun reported in 2024.
“As with any change in financial systems, there’s always a challenge in the first year, but also recognizing that, for the state of Idaho, each year that these audits are conducted, there’s always a series of findings, so it’s not abnormal,” Scott Smith, chief deputy controller and Luma Division administrator, told the Sun in an interview. “And certainly from the Controller’s Office perspective, we appreciate the due diligence from the Legislative Services Office to make sure that we’re following the appropriate rules and have the right controls in place, and anything they do find is really an opportunity for us to continue to improve and do better.” 
The Idaho State Treasurer’s Office could not immediately be reached for comment. 
 What made this Luma report so significant? 

The Annual Comprehensive Financial Report is more than 200 pages long, and this year’s audit includes what are called “qualified opinions,” which means the finding was significant enough that there could be a material error in reporting, largely because the documentation wasn’t adequate for auditors to verify accuracy. 
Legislative Services Office Audit Division Manager April Renfro told the Sun that in her 13 years in the position, she had never issued a qualified opinion before. There were eight qualified opinions in this report. 
Renfro’s follow-up report on internal controls, which detailed errors found by auditors, had 18 findings, including 11 “material weaknesses,” which are failures in internal processes that make it possible staff would be unable to prevent financial misstatements.

The discontinuation of the reconciliation process for cash balances by fund amid the launch of Luma on July 1, 2023, was one of the findings; this resulted in reports of unverified cash amounts in statements and errors going undetected. 
 “That’s the biggest problem, in my mind,” Grow said.
Grow said it’s important for an organization to not rely on the bank to know how much money it has, which is what happens without internal reconciliation. 
Horman echoed Grow’s concerns. 
“It’s troubling that (the State Controller’s Office) thought that we could get by without a reconciliation process,” she said. “That, to me, is the most disappointing part of this.” 
Because of challenges in having the needed reports available, the Controller’s Office has implemented a manual process for reconciliation, Smith said, and is in the process of creating a more streamlined automated process. 
“As we become more familiar, and our process has become more mature, on getting that knowledge across all of our agencies then that helps frame, ‘what does that automation look like?’ And ‘what should it be?’” Smith said.

 What were some of the errors found in the Luma audit? 

One of the financial statements provided by the Controller’s Office did not include the value of federal money received and spent for the food benefits in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, resulting in a misstatement of $280.9 million. 
Grow noted that misstatements in financial reporting don’t necessarily mean agencies thought they had more or less money to spend, but the errors call into question the reliability of financial statements. 
Auditors identified more than $30 million in duplicate payments made to Medicaid providers in November 2023, an issue that was reported by the Idaho Freedom Foundation at the time; the error wasn’t discovered until providers called the state to ask about the extra payment, the report said. 
Auditors found other incidents of duplicate, sometimes triple, payments in fiscal year 2025, the report said, but those payments were not recorded in Luma so there was “no way to track them through the accounting system.” The Treasurer’s Office tracked the payments through a manual process using a spreadsheet, the report said. 
“Additionally, when the (Controller’s) Office was questioned about instances beyond the two incidents, we were aware of, it stated that only ‘one or two, here and there’ were seen,” the report said. “This did not instill confidence that additional errors had been detected or prevented.” 
The Controller’s Office in its response agreed with the findings, and said the office had implemented automatic checks to prevent duplicate payments in the future. The auditor in her response to the proposed corrective action noted that errors from the report “would not have been detected” by the process described in the controller’s corrective action. 
The report found that the State Department of Education didn’t adequately monitor data supporting about a quarter of payments going to districts. Meaning that in a quarter of the total payments made to schools — or of $545 million — that were sent out, there could be errors, but it’s unclear from the provided information. This issue came up the prior fiscal year too, the report said, which was driven by difficulty in hiring a position that audits the payments. 
The Department of Environmental Quality recorded federal pandemic-era American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, funds twice, overstating its revenue in the ARPA fund by $83.7 million. The Division of Financial Management also misstated ARPA funds, understating it by $175 million. 
A coding error resulted in a misstatement of accrued liabilities and cash in the Department of Health and Welfare of $359 million, and another coding error resulted in $132 million overstated in cash in the annual statewide financial report. 
 What does this mean for the state of Idaho? 

All of the errors identified in the report were fixed. However, the auditors don’t verify every single financial statement in the state budget, but often finds errors through testing a sampling of statements or interviewing staff to determine if internal controls were used, Renfro said. 
Horman said because of this, she’s concerned that there are errors going undetected. 
“I’ll definitely be looking for some reassurance that those have been fixed immediately,” Horman said. 
Smith said that the Controller’s Office is working through the corrective action plan and has additionally revamped its training on the system for employees — who overwhelmingly bemoaned the transition at first. 
Whether those corrective actions are adequate may not be determined until Renfro and other legislative auditors follow-up on the office’s plan to see if the report’s findings were sufficiently addressed.

Here’s how it’s working,Cayla Mihalovich,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/09/california-prisons-recidivism-study/,Several new California laws gave incarcerated people a second chance at freedom. A new report provides the first in-depth look at how they’re working.,"In summary
Several new California laws gave incarcerated people a second chance at freedom. A new report provides the first in-depth look at how they’re working. 



California over the past dozen years enacted a series of criminal justice laws that were meant to give more people an opportunity to be resentenced and thin out the state’s severely overcrowded prisons. This week a state agency released the most-comprehensive look yet at how those changes are playing out among formerly incarcerated people. 
The report found low recidivism rates among people who were older and had served lengthy sentences. Those patterns contrasted with people serving shorter prison sentences for nonviolent crimes, which showed higher rates of recidivism, the majority of which were for misdemeanors. 
The Committee on Revision of the Penal Code and California Policy Lab on Wednesday published the report, which details demographics and recidivism rates for five of the most significant resentencing policies implemented between 2012 and 2022 under Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Gov. Jerry Brown.

Changing Three Strikes: Proposition 36 in 2012 allowed people serving a life sentence for a “non-serious, non-violent” third strike offense to petition courts for resentencing. Nearly half of the 2,200 people who were released were Black and most were above age 50. The group had an especially low recidivism rate. 
Lower penalties for drugs and petty theft: Proposition 47 in 2014 allowed incarcerated people convicted of certain low-level drug and theft offenses to petition courts for resentencing. This population, which accounted for the largest share of people released among all of the policies, had a higher recidivism rate.
Restricting felony murder charges: New laws in 2018 and 2022 narrowed the circumstances for prosecutors to charge people with felony murder if they were involved in a crime but did not pull the trigger to kill someone. Those released under the changes had a very low recidivism rate.
Good conduct: A 2018 policy allows the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to recommend resentencing due to changes in the law or positive conduct. The department’s secretary has referred over 2,200 people for resentencing. The report found that 786 of those cases were denied. Those released under the policy had a low recidivism rate.
Rethinking sentencing enhancements: A 2022 law allowed courts to reduce sentences for people who were serving time for enhancements that had been repealed through other laws. The report found that Black and Latino people accounted for 75% of people who were resentenced under the law. 

Under all five policies, approximately 12,000 people have been resentenced and 9,500 have been released, according to the report. Black and Latino people represented the majority of those released under the policies. 
The Committee on Revision of the Penal Code, a state agency created by the Legislature in 2020, is led by a group of academics and lawmakers, most of whom are appointed by Newsom to recommend statutory reforms. The agency partnered with the California Policy Lab, a research institute at UC Berkeley, to produce the report. 
Tom Nosewicz, legal director for the agency, said the data show that the policies have been largely successful at reducing the prison population without increasing risks in public safety and can serve as a blueprint for future changes. 
About 90,000 people are incarcerated in California prisons, down from a peak of about 170,000. It costs roughly $130,000 per year to incarcerate someone. As of December 2024, more than 30,000 incarcerated people were over the age of 50 and had served more than 15 years, according to the report.  
The new laws “helped reduce our prison population, but of course, it’s a drop in the bucket,” said Nosewicz. “That’s why I think it’s important to show how we can expand some of these opportunities and show ways that have worked and ways that haven’t.” 
While the report includes one-year recidivism outcomes for all five reform policies, only two of the policies were old enough to measure three-year recidivism outcomes, which is the standard timeline to determine recidivism. Researchers Alissa Skog and Johanna Lacoe acknowledged that as a limitation, noting that a longer time frame can yield “substantially higher recidivism rates.” They also noted that they could not account for people who were eligible under the policies but did not petition the courts or were denied resentencing by judges.
Michele Hanisee, special assistant of legislative affairs for the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, said the report was not “an intense study.” 
“It was a superficial data review,” she said. 
Other district attorneys have been critical of the Committee on the Revision of the Penal Code. 
“Generally, the committee’s recommendations, though maybe well-intentioned, have proven to be damaging to victims, law enforcement, and the criminal justice system and have also endangered public safety,” said Jonathan Raven, an executive at the California District Attorneys Association.
Women benefited from felony murder changes
But Kate Chatfield, executive director of California Public Defenders Association, said that resentencing, writ large, is working. 
“Looking at this holistically, 15 years is the max that we should have someone in prison for. That should be the ceiling,” she said. “If you are looking at public safety, there is no reason to hold people in prison after they age out. That is what this data shows.”
Chatfield, who drafted the 2018 felony murder reform law, was struck by the number of women who were resentenced under it. According to the report, women accounted for 11% of people who were resentenced and released, which was a notch above the 7% they represented in total prison releases. 
Under felony murder reforms, the report showed that nearly 1,200 people have been resentenced, the majority of whom were just over 21-years-old at the time of their offense and nearly half of whom were Black. Many served long prison terms — generally 14 to 15 years — after never having been incarcerated before. 
For those released under felony murder reforms, researchers found that recidivism rates were “notably low” at 3% within a year and 7% within two years, most of which were misdemeanor convictions. Just five people out of 274 had been convicted of a new serious or violent felony within three years. 
“It reinforces how correct it was for the Legislature and Gov. Brown to enact and sign that reform,” said former Oakland Democratic Sen. Nancy Skinner, who authored the 2018 law. “A long sentence does not contribute to improved public safety. There’s just a certain point where we’re warehousing people and using taxpayer dollars in a way that’s proven to be unproductive.”  
‘Who actually needs to be incarcerated’?
Just over 4,700 incarcerated people were resentenced under Prop. 47, nearly half of whom were serving time for a felony drug offense and under the age of 40 at the time of their release, according to the report. Researchers found that 57% of people resentenced under the proposition were convicted of a new crime within three years of release, most of which were misdemeanors. In comparison, 42% of people released between 2018 and 2019 were convicted of a new crime within three years.
Voters last year undid part of Prop. 47 when they passed a new initiative that lengthened sentences for certain theft and drug offenses.
Matt Cate, who was California’s corrections secretary under former Govs. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Brown, wasn’t surprised by those high recidivism rates, and said the combination of substance use disorders and property crimes are typically a “recipe for additional crimes committed upon release.” 
But that doesn’t mean those individuals should have been incarcerated for longer, he said. 
“In California and throughout much of the United States, we built the wrong prisons,” said Cate. “We built places that are really good at keeping inmates from escaping and are good, typically, at keeping people — especially staff — safe. But they’re a terrible environment for people to change their lives.”
Jennifer Shaffer, former executive officer of the Board of Parole Hearings, said reports like this will hopefully motivate people to dig deeper and understand how California can do better.
“Who actually needs to be incarcerated is the question,” she said. “This idea that people who commit low-level crime shouldn’t go to state prison, I think makes sense. It makes sense that they get treatment at the local level as opposed to going to state prison, because state prison unfortunately is a very violent place.”

The agency said it included a sharp rise in reservations at sites near federal campgrounds that had been impacted by staffing cuts made by the Trump administration.
According to DCNR, overall summer reservations were up 10% statewide and 60% near affected federal sites from the previous summer. They received a 30% boost in campground reservations after federal closures shifted demand.
“When the federal government closed campgrounds, Pennsylvania stepped up,” said DCNR Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn. “Thanks to the incredible work of our state park and forest teams, we kept the outdoors open, awesome, and accessible for all.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In April, DCNR said they were bracing for a “record-breaking” season for state parks and forests, due in part to federal cuts at national parks by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
The department also encouraged Pennsylvanians to plan trips for the fall through Pennsylvania: The Great American Getaway, which is a campaign run by the state to promote its public lands, foliage, and outdoor economy.
All of the 124 state parks and forests in Pennsylvania are free and open to the public.
The state Department of Community & Economic Development (DCED) also announced last week that the tourism industry in the state generated $83.9 billion in economic impact, supporting 514,261 jobs in 2024.

The Delaware Office of Auditor of Accounts (AOA) has released a performance audit of the Memorial Volunteer Fire Company (MVFC), citing multiple deficiencies in financial management between 2021 and 2023. 
The audit was requested by the State Fire Commission after members raised concerns over the company’s fiscal practices.
The review covered operations during which MVFC received more than $2.6 million in State funds. According to the report, auditors found widespread issues, including non-compliance with policies, poor documentation of expenses, and weak oversight of financial operations. Testing revealed that 70% of expenses lacked proper board approval and 42% were missing adequate documentation, representing nearly all of the $3.3 million in transactions examined. Payroll was also flagged for errors, with missing timesheets, overpayments, and unreconciled records.
“This performance audit underscores the importance of strong internal controls and rigorous oversight when dealing with State funds, including grant funds,” said State Auditor Lydia E. York. “Delaware’s volunteer firefighters rely on their companies effectively managing State funds to ensure they have the tools they need to save lives. I want to thank the State Fire Commission for their partnership, and Memorial Volunteer Fire Company for their cooperation and commitment to strengthening their fiscal practices.”
The report also noted MVFC’s failure to comply with Sussex County’s grant agreement, as the company did not implement written financial policies until mid-2023. 
Despite the findings, the current MVFC Board has taken steps to correct past weaknesses. Since 2024, the company has hired outside accountants, switched to cloud-based accounting software, and strengthened payroll and credit card oversight. The audit acknowledged these improvements but stated that a future review will be needed to confirm whether the new controls are working effectively.
“I want to thank the State Auditor and her staff for their diligence in assisting the Commission in reviewing the financial status of our volunteer fire companies,” said Fire Commission Chair Ron Marvel. “These companies receive significant amounts of taxpayer funding, often with limited oversight. It’s essential that we work collaboratively with fire service members and legislators to strengthen accountability for how these public funds are spent. At the same time, we must ensure that fire companies have the flexibility to use the resources appropriately so they can continue providing the highest level of protection to their communities.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apparatus_11_14_thumb_w750.jpg,,,2025-09-25 12:57:15.867211

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska is one of five states the Trump administration selected to participate in a pilot program aimed at improving the way the nation carries out the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which is nearing its 30th year.
States tapped for the six-year pilot program — others are Iowa, Arizona, Ohio and Virginia — underwent a competitive process and were announced Thursday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families.

“It’s great for Nebraska,” said Shannon Grotrian, director of Nebraska’s Office of Economic Assistance. “We’ll be able to lead the way in showing what works.”
No additional grant money comes with participation in the pilot, though Nebraska will get federal coaching and other support services.
 Pillen touts ‘Nebraska way’ 

Grotrian envisions no change in the amount of benefits provided to the 2,700 Nebraska families participating in the TANF program, a federal block grant that provides cash and other support to eligible low-income families with children. The premise of the pilot is to explore different and better ways to gauge the outcome of TANF spending than the “work participation rate,” which is the current measure of accountability for the program. 
The WPR is the share of work-eligible recipients engaged in countable work activities. States typically must meet a minimum WPR or face financial penalties.
Grotrian said keeping track of hours can be onerous for participants, and she said “now we can measure what truly matters: helping people to become self-sufficient.”
She said currently when an applicant seeks TANF, the state creates an employment plan focused on work participation hours that can include volunteerism and training.
As a pilot program, Grotrian said the state now will start with the end goal in mind, a job and will develop milestones to help get there. She said Nebraska will have the flexibility to redesign its program to “best meet new benchmarks related to increased employment and earnings, reduced dependency and improved family stability.”
When applying for the TANF pilot, officials said the state stood out for its alignment with Trump administration goals and its approach to reducing dependency and increasing workforce participation.
Acting Assistant Secretary of ACF Andrew Gradison, in a statement, highlighted Nebraska’s “employment first” emphasis and its integration of TANF with other federal programs such as Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood.
“The Trump administration recognizes the best economic program is a job, and Nebraska’s pilot reflects our shared commitment to promote personal responsibility and move families out of poverty,” he said.
State officials said Nebraska’s application emphasized employment as the most effective path out of poverty and government dependence. Central program elements include providing participants with individual coaching to identify goals, collaborating with business to connect participants with jobs, expansion of vocational training and internships.

Participants are to continue to receive help with childcare, transportation and to overcome other barriers.
The state said the pilot allows for flexibility for participants with physical or mental health challenges to receive “tailored support” toward earning additional income.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen thanked the Trump administration and said in a statement that he has “insisted” that assistance programs ranging from Medicaid to food benefits be run the “Nebraska Way” of encouraging independence from government.
 Earlier Biden slate nixed

Grotrian anticipates no resistance. “I truly believe we will be able to help people in a much better way than we’ve been able to before,” she said, in guiding a path toward self-sufficiency.
As authorized under the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, the pilot program is billed as an opportunity to strengthen state accountability “to the original core TANF values of work and self-sufficiency,” according to the document that invited states to apply.
“The pilot can play a pivotal role in the design of modern approaches to moving work-eligible individuals into the labor force, while providing critical insights” on ways to highlight “personal responsibility,” the guidelines said.
The pilot states announced on Thursday replace a slate previously chosen by the Biden administration. Of the original five, Ohio was re-selected. Others in the first group that were nixed were California, Maine, Kentucky and Minnesota.
In explaining the decision to re-start the pilot, the Trump administration said it sought proposals aligned with the administration’s key priorities and measures of success: promoting work and reducing dependency. 
The first year of the pilot is finalize design and target.  Grotrian said a website soon will launch to share more details.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-25 16:07:58+00:00,Mississippi Today,The grades are in: Mississippi schools backslide on academic progress,Devna Bose and Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/25/mississippi-schools-backslide-on-academic-progress/,"New accountability scores show a decline in academic performance, interrupting steady progress of an education system that is sometimes called the “Mississippi Miracle.”","For the first time in years, the performance of Mississippi schools and districts fell from the previous academic year, according to state education rankings released Thursday.
The new scores interrupt the steady progress of Mississippi’s education system that’s been praised across the country and occasionally referred to as the “Mississippi Miracle.” Coupled with mixed results on state tests this past year, it could signal trouble — a possibility the state superintendent frankly acknowledged in a press release this week. 
“While Mississippi has made historic progress over the past decade, the areas of declining achievement demand our immediate attention,” Lance Evans said. 
This year, 80% of schools and 87% of districts received a “C” or higher on their report card. That’s a meaningful drop compared to the 2023-2024 school year, when 85.7% of schools and 93.9% of districts got a “C” or higher. 
The accountability framework was created by the state Board of Education to judge how well schools are serving their communities. It takes into account state test scores, graduation rates and academic growth. This year’s grades fall short of the board’s goal, set in 2016, that every school and district in Mississippi be rated “C” or higher.
Evans had no explanation for the shortfalls in a press call with Mississippi Department of Education officials Monday. He said as soon as agency leaders got the results, they started investigating reasons for the decline but couldn’t pinpoint one specific thing. 
“We would have loved to have been able to find one particular issue, but we did not find one,” Evans said. “We also know that over a period of … continual gains, there is going to come a point in time in which there is some drift.”

School districts closer to the Gulf Coast dominated the top of the list, including Long Beach, Ocean Springs, Petal, Pass Christian and Bay St. Louis-Waveland. 
The state’s largest school districts mostly received top scores, too. DeSoto County School District, which serves around 35,000 students, got an “A,” as did Rankin County, Harrison County and Madison County. Jackson Public Schools, the second-largest district in the state, got a “C.” 
“I will tell you the reaction that we’ve taken here at the department is we have internally done an analysis of everything we do, every support we provide, to make sure that what we’re doing is actually moving the needle now,” Evans said. 
The state Board of Education approved the accountability grades during a meeting Thursday.

Will grades impact school choice expansion efforts?
With the legislative session on the horizon, the slipping scores could provide fodder for school choice advocates, who have been met with opposing arguments about the success of the state’s public schools. 
Nancy Loome, education advocate and director of The Parents’ Campaign, said it’s important to note that the accountability grades place a strong emphasis on growth. Because Mississippi has consistently seen improvements, she said, it’s harder to maintain that growth from year to year. Last year’s accountability grades were an all-time high for the state. 
She pointed out the National Assessment of Education Progress scores from 2024 showed Mississippi fourth-graders ranked ninth in the country for reading and 16th for math scores.
“I don’t think we have a crisis,” Loome said. “Even as individuals we have good days and bad days, and we’re going to have little bumps in the road. But we didn’t go off a cliff, and I still believe that performance in Mississippi public schools is wonderful.”
The accountability grades could also pave the way for expansion of charter schools, which are publicly-funded schools that operate with more autonomy and independently from districts. Under current state law, charter schools can only be established where local public schools are failing. This year, nine districts earned a “D” or “F” grade, up from three the prior year. 
At the same time, six out of seven of the state’s charter schools that were graded this past year got a “D” or “F” rating.
Angela Bass, executive director of policy research organization Mississippi First and a former charter school leader, said it’s “sobering” to see charters at the bottom of the list. 
But she, like Loome, didn’t think the grades were a signal the state is headed in the wrong direction.
“Of course, it’s always a time to reflect when we see the number of ‘A’ to ‘C’ districts declining and seeing an increase in ‘D’ and ‘F’ grades,” Bass said. “We think that these grades are a tool that helps us reflect on where we are and pinpoint where we need to target our efforts.”
Bass said her organization is focusing on how to bolster early education and literacy efforts, and strengthen the high-quality teacher pipeline in Mississippi. The latter is one of the reasons agency officials gave on the press call Monday for lowered accountability grades among struggling districts in the Delta. 
Some Delta districts struggle, while others shine
Letter grades fell for Holmes County, Humphreys County, Yazoo City and Noxubee County after previously making improvements. All have been taken over by the state for failing performance.
Evans acknowledged his disappointment about the four struggling districts under state control, and said making systemic changes in those districts is “complex work that does not happen overnight.” 
Three out of these four “Districts of Transformation” are in the Delta, a region with understaffed schools, districts with some of the lowest pay for teachers and schools that routinely receive low grades from the accountability system.
“Students are being taught by substitute teachers who are not knowledgeable about the content in some cases,” said Clayton Barksdale, a former principal in Greenville and current executive director of West Mississippi Education Consortium.
Nearly all school districts that received a “D” or an “F” are in the Delta region, with Yazoo City and Clarksdale both receiving an “F.” Greenville, Humphreys County, West Bolivar and Greenwood-Leflore all received a “D.”
“If you look at the larger school districts, which are struggling, they have high turnover at the administrative level,” Barksdale said. “How can there be constant growth with a different superintendent and a different mission and a different vision year after year?”

For teachers in struggling districts, boosting the school’s accountability score and encouraging student progress makes up a big portion of work responsibilities. State-tested teachers are often paired with consultants who work with them to move the bottom 25% of students in a subject, which is prioritized in the school accountability system.
Sylvia Jones, a high school science teacher in Humphreys County, said that meant spending her planning period and after school time studying data in which students are ranked by how they scored on their most recent state tests. Students also took biweekly benchmark assessments to track progress throughout the year.
But with so much testing, Jones had to discuss strategies to avoid burnout and build endurance. It can put a lot of pressure on students and staff, she said.
Three Delta school districts received “B” ratings. Tunica County retained its “B” from last year and was the highest performing Delta school district. Leland and Hollandale, two of the smallest districts in the state and located in Washington County, moved from a “C” to a “B.”
“I would credit (the ‘B’) to teacher retention and curbing absenteeism,” said the Rev. Jessie King, superintendent of Leland School District. “We continuously studied the data.”
He said attendance was 90% to 93% most days.
“I would tell other Delta school districts, it is doable and achievable if there is buy-in from staff and administration,” King said. “Public education in Mississippi is an all-time success story. I would say in the midst of upcoming legislative changes, we should rally around the success of our public schools.
“Right now, I don’t think the timing is ripe for an overhaul.”
Next steps
Moving forward, the state education agency plans to seek more dollars from the Legislature this spring to fund a math initiative for grades 2-6 and an adolescent literacy initiative for grades 4-8, expanding the agency’s previous literacy work that transformed reading in Mississippi. 
The state education department is also working on a new strategic plan that will be released in 2026 and updating the accountability system by which schools are measured. The new framework, which will be finalized this fall, will add a focus on college and career readiness and raise the standards for each letter grade. 
“The foundation we have built over the past decade remains strong,” Evans said. “Higher academic standards, targeted support for teachers, and a strong accountability system have improved student achievement in Mississippi over the long term. This year’s results do not change our commitment to these proven strategies.” 
C. Alan Burrow, associate superintendent for district and school performance, said Thursday that schools with low proficiency rates can earn points through growth.
“Accountability is essential to ensuring that we’re working towards our overall goals, making sure that all students are ready to be successful when they leave public education,” Burrow said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/17124216/3X0A8409.jpg,,,2025-09-25 12:57:15.867211
,DC,2025-09-25 16:01:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"As immigration raids step up, US citizens predicted at risk for detainment",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/immigration-raids-step-us-citizens-predicted-risk-detainment,,"WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh argued in a major case earlier this month that U.S. citizens face few problems in having their immigration status verified if federal agents apprehend them.“If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go,” Kavanaugh wrote in concurrence with an opinion in a case on the emergency docket. In reality, the Trump administration’s aggressive drive to carry out mass deportations of people without legal status already has led to U.S. citizens being swept up in raids and detained, according to news reports from around the country as well as immigration experts. Such detainments now will increase, experts predict.Once in detention, it can take time to verify citizenship. A passport is considered the gold standard for proof that an individual is a citizen, but fewer than half of Americans hold passports, according to the State Department’s most recent data from 2024. Even fewer are likely to carry the bulky document around.Kavanaugh’s remarks came in a 6-3 Supreme Court decision that gave the go-ahead, for now, for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to use racial profiling in enforcement raids in Los Angeles, while a case on the issue proceeds through the courts. A district court's order had barred federal immigration officers from using racial profiling to detain immigrants without legal status.Two of the five plaintiffs at the center of the case are Latino men who repeatedly informed federal immigration officials they were U.S. citizens, but were still arrested and detained. All three liberal justices on the high court dissented with the ruling that authorized racial profiling. Justice Sonia Sotomayor in a scathing opinion said Kavanaugh’s reasoning “blinks reality.” John Sandweg, an attorney who served as the acting director at ICE during the Obama administration, said in an interview with States Newsroom that the outcome is clear.“There's a high likelihood, based on this opinion, that somebody who is a United States citizen could be detained for days, if not weeks, while ICE goes out and tries to confirm … that they are in fact a U.S. citizen,” said Sandweg.“It's not something you can figure out in the parking lot of a Home Depot,” he said, referring to locations targeted by ICE because day laborers, typically lacking legal status, wait there to find work.Proving you are a citizenThere is no national database of U.S. citizens and no requirement to carry around a national ID, meaning it can take ICE significant time to verify citizenship status, Sandweg said.There is an exception for naturalized citizens, something ICE officers can quickly check in a database. But more complex situations such as Americans born abroad to U.S. citizen parents, known as derivative citizenship, can be more problematic.Obtaining a passport is an answer but it is expensive, costing up to $160 to renew or get one for the first time, and takes weeks for processing.  Even carrying a form of identification like a driver’s license doesn’t guarantee proof of citizenship, as 19 states and the District of Columbia approve driver’s licenses regardless of citizenship status. It’s unclear how often ICE mistakenly arrests U.S. citizens, but the most recent data comes from a 2021 report from the Government Accountability Office, an independent federal watchdog agency. The report found that ICE arrested 674 “potential” U.S. citizens, detained 121 and deported 70 from fiscal year 2015 to six months into 2020 — long before the current crackdown.ICE did not respond to States Newsroom’s requests for comment about the process for immigration officials to verify citizenship.‘Apparent ethnicity’The order from the high court, for now, will allow federal immigration officials to use “apparent ethnicity” as one factor in determining reasonable suspicion that a person is violating U.S. immigration law, as long as it is not the only factor. Before the district court issued a restraining order on the practice, immigration agents used a broad variety of factors to determine someone’s apparent ethnicity, including speaking Spanish or accented English, certain types of work like landscaping and day labor and locations such as bus stops or car washes.The case stemmed from the administration’s mass raids this summer on Los Angeles-area Home Depot stores and other sites where day laborers gather, sparking massive protests in the city. President Donald Trump cited the protests in deploying National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to the city, over California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s objections. Those two plaintiffs in the case are not the only U.S. citizens swept up in ICE raids during the second Trump administration.In Florida, police detained a 20-year-old for days following a traffic stop, even though he told officers he was a U.S. citizen and provided his Social Security card. In New Jersey, ICE detained a U.S. citizen who was a military veteran for hours before releasing him. And in Southern California, a 25-year-old U.S. Army veteran was detained for three days by federal immigration officials, The Atlantic reported. Members of Congress have also expressed concern about federal immigration officials arresting and detaining U.S. citizens, and 50 Democratic lawmakers have pressed the Department of Homeland Security internal watchdogs to investigate if the agency is violating Americans’ civil rights.“We are increasingly concerned by reporting that U.S. citizens are being detained as a result of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement actions,” they wrote in a letter last month to the DHS  Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of Inspector General and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman.Supreme Court ‘signaling to ICE’The ruling, while based on immigration raids in Los Angeles, could have effects nationwide, said Sophia Genovese, a clinical teaching fellow and supervising attorney at Georgetown University’s Center for Applied Legal Studies. The Trump administration launched an immigration crackdown in Chicago and Boston this month, two cities with large immigrant populations. They were also the frequent target for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to send buses of newly arrived migrants from the southern border. Genovese said while Kavanaugh’s concurrence is not a binding majority opinion, “it’s still signaling to ICE that they can engage in this racial profiling,” for a warrantless arrest. ICE agents are allowed to make warrantless arrests if an officer has probable cause or reason to believe a person is in the United States without legal authorization and can escape before a warrant is obtained.   “The situation that we're seeing play out in L.A. and across the country is a warrantless arrest, and the reality on the ground is they're being quite violent and physical with people,” she said. “They're quite literally snatching people off the street.”Genovese, who specializes in immigration and asylum law, said that even when a U.S. citizen produces their documents, it can take weeks to be released for detention or to have a case closed in immigration court. “People are scared, and people have been saying they feel like they need to carry their ‘papers,’ whether that's a passport or a green card or something else, to prove that they have a right to be here,” Genovese said. “That isn't required under the law, but that's nevertheless the impact it's having on communities.”She added that the burden to prove citizenship should be on the federal government, not the individual. It’s a consequence that Sotomayor warned in her dissent would fall on the Latino community, arguing that it creates a second-class citizenship status and violates the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment that bars unreasonable search and seizure.“The Government, and now the concurrence, has all but declared that all Latinos, U. S. citizens or not, who work low wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents’ satisfaction,” she wrote.",,,,2025-09-25 12:57:15.867211

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) A North Dakota agency has approved a permit for what could become the largest dairy in state history — a 25,000-cow milking operation in Traill County. 
The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality is issuing the permit for Riverview Dairy at a site near the Red River southeast of Hillsboro. 
Riverview, based in Morris, Minnesota, plans to build two large dairies on the North Dakota side of the Red River that could quadruple the number of dairy cows in the state. North Dakota’s dairy industry has been dwindling for decades. 
Riverview had already obtained an environmental permit for a 12,500-cow dairy north of Wahpeton in Richland County. 
Comment period opens on proposed 25,000-cow dairy’s environmental permit 

Riverview still needs permits from the North Dakota Department of Water Resources to supply the dairies with the large amounts of water the dairies need. Riverview says its cows need 20 to 30 gallons of water per cow each day. That would equal at least 700,000 gallons of water per day for the Traill County site.
The environmental permit reviewed such things as Riverview’s plans for storing manure from the cows and applying it to farm fields near the dairy as fertilizer. 
A news release from the Department of Environmental Quality said Riverview identified sufficient cropland acres to apply the manure. But because of public concerns, the agency will continue to analyze the 100-year floodplain near the Traill County dairy. No fields in the floodplain were approved for manure application.
Riverview said Thursday it hopes to begin moving dirt at the site this fall, with construction taking about two years.  It has already started dirt work in Richland County.

In the news release, the Department of Environmental Quality said the agency is committed to protecting the environment and public health. 
“During the construction phase, staff will conduct regular facility inspections to ensure full compliance with all permit conditions. Once the operation begins, inspections will occur at least annually to verify continued adherence to permit requirements,” the agency said. 
Some environmental groups such as North Dakota-based Dakota Resource Council and others based in Manitoba, Canada, have expressed concerns about the potential for pollution from the dairies into the north-flowing Red River. 
In submitted comments, the Dakota Resource Council said the “failure to regulate Herberg Dairy in a manner that prevents water pollution will harm human health, wildlife, and North Dakota’s outdoor recreational economy.” It also said the dairy will add to the cost of cleaning up Red River water for cities downstream that use the river as a drinking water source, such as Grand Forks and Grafton.
Huge dairy farms planned for eastern North Dakota

Canadian groups have expressed concerns about pollution in the Red River contributing to algae bloom on Lake Winnipeg, which the river drains into. 
Riverview, which operates several large dairies in western Minnesota, refers to the Traill County site as Herberg Dairy, named for the township it will be in. 
“Our dairies are designed to meet or exceed strict environmental standards, reflecting our commitment to caring for land, water, animals, and people,”  Riverview said in an emailed statement. “We are also committed to being a good neighbor and community partner.” 
The Traill County dairy would create about 100 jobs and the Richland Dairy 45 to 50 jobs, according to Riverview.
Jim Murphy, executive director of the Traill County Economic Development Commission, called the permit approval great news for Hillsboro and Traill County but said housing workers will be a challenge. 
“We don’t have much for housing in town, so that’s a solution we will need to work on over the next 18 months,” Murphy said in an interview with the Hillsboro Banner.

Riverview provides housing on site for some of its workers who milk cows around the clock. 
When Riverview filed for its permit for the Herberg Dairy, the Department of Environmental Quality held a public hearing in Hillsboro in May, with many of the comments in support. 
That included Darin Johnson, the mayor of Halstad, Minnesota, a town on the Red River that is closer to the dairy site than Hillsboro. He has visited a Riverview Dairy and said he’s impressed with its risk management and manure handling methods.
“I really believe the manure is liquid gold that is going to help our soils and help our crops,” Johnson said at the hearing.

WILMINGTON — Two New Castle County–produced documentaries exploring Delaware’s legacy of racial justice have captured top honors, including a Mid-Atlantic Emmy Award.
On Saturday, September 20, the team earned its second win in four years at the 2025 Mid-Atlantic Emmy Awards.
The documentary “Restless Ground: The Untold Story of Mt. Olive” won in the Diversity/Equity/Inclusion Long-Form category, which “honors excellence in content focused on topics including racism, discrimination, inequity, marginalized communities and similar social injustices, notably focused on efforts to raise awareness or affect positive change,” according to the contest’s 2025 call for entries.
“This story is about truth, justice, and honoring the lives and legacies of people too long overlooked,” Governor Matt Meyer said. “I am deeply proud of the team that brought this story forward and grateful to the Mother Africa Union Church community for trusting us with it. Telling even our hardest, cruelest Delaware history can spark change and build a more just future.”
Restless Ground: Honoring Mt. Olive’s Legacy
Produced by Meyer, Deputy Director of Strategic Communications Kyle Grantham, and others in partnership with 1440 Film Co., “Restless Ground” explores the history of Mt. Olive Cemetery. 
RELATED STORY: Wilmington International Film Festival features Shuffle, exposing addiction treatment fraud
The film examines the impact of institutional racism on those buried there, New Castle County’s work with the Mother African Union Church and Trust for Public Land to restore dignity after decades of neglect, and the personal connection discovered by one man who had long maintained the property.
“I’m incredibly honored that ‘Restless Ground’ was recognized and thankful for the amazing colleagues I was fortunate to partner with in telling this story,” Grantham said. “This project was something I worked on for three years, and it couldn’t have become a reality without our crew at 1440, or the Mt. Olive community opening up and sharing their stories with us.”
Return to Hockessin No. 107C: A Story of Desegregation
Another New Castle County production, “Return to Hockessin No. 107C,” is gaining national recognition. Produced with Bowstring, the documentary has been screened at several film festivals across the country and won Best Documentary Short at the Newark Independent Film Festival in August.
The film was also nominated for a 2025 Mid-Atlantic Emmy in the Historical/Cultural Long-Form category and accepted to the Diamond State Black Film Festival, Independent Shorts Awards, and Micheaux Film Festival.
“Return to Hockessin No. 107C” tells the story of Hockessin Colored School No. 107C and its role in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case. Former students recall the closure of their school and the backlash they faced in their community. The film also chronicles efforts to preserve the abandoned building, giving those students a chance to return decades later.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Emmyawards-768x532-1.jpg,,,2025-09-25 11:59:51.017474

Haley Stevens, as the congresswoman on Thursday filed articles of impeachment over what she called dangerous cuts to medical research.
Stevens (D-Brimingham) also cited the increased cost to health care under RFK Jr.’s short time as secretary, abuses of power and ongoing threats to public health. The congresswoman previously asked Kennedy to resign, but is now trying to force his ouster through articles of impeachment.
“RFK Jr. is making our country less safe and making healthcare less affordable and accessible for Michiganders,” Stevens said in a news release. “His contempt for science, the constant spreading of conspiracy theories, and his complete disregard for the thousands of research hours spent by America’s top doctors and experts is unprecedented, reckless, and dangerous. Enough is enough – we need leaders who put science over chaos, facts over lies, and people over politics.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The cuts in question center around cancer research, as well as sudden infant death syndrome and studies on combating addiction.
Kennedy’s restriction of vaccine access was another point of contention, and his spreading of “absurd conspiracies” that have put people’s lives in danger, Stevens said.
The secretary is also being accused of lying in his confirmation hearings over promises he made during those proceedings that have not been upheld. The chief promise Stevens cited was his pledge to not break up the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine panel of independent experts.
While the filing has little chance of passing the GOP-controlled House of Representatives, Stevens said she believes Kennedy has failed to carry out his statutory duties in administering the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Stevens is among several Democrats seeking the nomination to run for Michigan’s U.S. Senate seat next year. Also running are state Sen.

Doolittle said he was notified Sept. 11 that his appointment would not be renewed and immediately placed on leave. His employment then ended Tuesday, the final day of his two-year probationary term as an immigration judge.
Notice came via a brief letter signed by the acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice responsible for adjudicating immigration cases.
The letter didn’t provide a reason why Doolittle was let go, stating only that “the Attorney General has decided not to extend your term or convert it to a permanent appointment.”
Doolittle joins dozens of other immigration judges who have been fired or not renewed in their positions this year, including at least 14 who received notice this month, according to NPR. They worked in courts in Florida, New York, Maryland, California and Washington state, NPR reported.
Doolittle was first appointed in 2023 by then-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. Doolittle said he doesn’t know whether his dismissal was politically motivated, but he has no doubt the broader wave of terminations is “part of a political agenda and a political strategy.”
“They’re cutting bodies from what’s supposed to be an independent adjudicatory agency at a time when the caseload is crushing,” he said. “And it’s getting even more urgent as they put more and more people into jail.”
The firings come as the nation’s immigration courts struggle to process an enormous and growing backlog of cases, which has been exacerbated by a lack of available judges.
At the time of his removal, Doolittle said he was one of only two full-time judges working in the Hartford immigration court, which has seen its pending caseload swell to more than 40,000. A third judge based in Connecticut also splits duties between cases in Hartford and other jurisdictions, Doolittle said.
It’s unclear how Doolittle’s position will be filled. An EOIR spokesperson said the agency declines to comment because it is a personnel matter.


The Associated Press reported previously the Trump administration plans to send up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges amid the shortage, a move that has alarmed some Democratic lawmakers.
Doolittle’s abrupt departure this month had puzzled some local immigration lawyers, who told Connecticut Public scheduled hearings for their clients were moved or canceled with no explanation. Doolittle said he was scheduled to hear 57 cases on the Friday after he was placed on leave alone.
“I do worry that overall, the system is being administered or managed in a way that is not pointed toward trying to do justice as quickly as possible in the largest number of cases as possible,” Doolittle said.
Doolittle’s legal career includes work in the private and public sectors, including serving most recently as the healthcare advocate for the state of Connecticut from 2017 through 2023. He is also former deputy director of the Center for Program Integrity at the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
As recently as July 24, Doolittle received a positive review of his performance as an immigration judge, which recommended he remain in the position. A supervisor wrote that Doolittle “demonstrated exceptional dedication and professionalism” in handling complex cases, while also efficiently handling the workload.
Court records show Doolittle completed more than 1,900 cases in the current federal budget year, well ahead of the goal of 700 cases he said was set for his position.
“Judge Doolittle maintains high standards of judicial conduct, and this reflects his dedication to the administration of justice in one of the nation’s most overburdened immigration courts,” the evaluation reads.
Doolittle said he stands by his record on the bench, and said he granted asylum or other relief when it was indicated and denied it in many other cases.
“I did love the job, and I gave it everything I could, and I want to think that I did the best that I could for the families in front of me,” he said.

Under updated regulations adopted in May by the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, each district must develop and submit a local Competency Determination (CD) policy and graduation requirements to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) by December 31.
The shift comes in the wake of the 2024 ballot law ending the decades-long MCAS graduation requirement. In response, DESE Commissioner Pedro Martinez issued guidance in July detailing how districts must outline the coursework and assessment methods they will use to determine student competency in English language arts, math, and science through grade 10. Beginning with the class of 2027, U.S. history will also be required.
Districts must define which courses will fulfill these requirements, how students will demonstrate mastery, and how policies will accommodate students with disabilities, English learners and late enrollees. They are also required to create an appeals process and allow for transcript reviews for current or former students.
All policies must be approved locally before being submitted to DESE through the state’s online system.
Students must also meet local graduation requirements — such as credits, attendance or community service — which are separate and cannot replace the state-mandated CD policy.
The regulatory changes are temporary. In January, Gov. Maura Healey formed the Massachusetts K–12 Statewide Graduation Council to recommend a permanent statewide graduation standard. That 31-member group is expected to issue its final recommendations by July 2026.
On Wednesday, Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll and Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler will hold a press conference at Attleboro High School to unveil the council’s “Vision of a Graduate” and mark the council’s “first step towards recommending a statewide set of high school graduation standards,” according to a media advisory.
The advisory says the vision statement is intended to articulate what Massachusetts students should know and be able to do by the time they graduate, forming a foundation for a statewide framework.
The council has held eight listening sessions. Any permanent changes to graduation requirements will likely require further regulatory or legislative action.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Education-Testing.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-25 11:59:51.017474

(Sofia Resnick/States Newsroom)A pair of anti-abortion organizations on Wednesday announced their plans to pour $4.5 million into field outreach aimed at securing Michigan’s vacant U.S. Senate seat for Republicans in 2026. 
Susan B, Anthony Pro-Life America and its partner Women Speak Out PAC said its campaign will target anti-abortion voters who do not consistently vote in the midterm election and persuadable voters in the Lansing, Detroit and Grand Rapids area. The effort will include digital advertising, voter mail and an early voting campaign. 
“We’re energized and ready for the next critical chapter in the fight for life,” said Emily Green, a field director for SBA Pro-Life. “The murder of Charlie Kirk – a true champion for the unborn – has only strengthened our resolve. Now more than ever, we’re committed to speaking out with courage. By connecting with voters and winning key elections, we can save more unborn children and support moms.”
The group also led a door-knocking campaign in the 2024 election, which the group says reached 750,000 voters. 
“Four Planned Parenthoods in Michigan have closed their doors because we took back the White House and Congress in 2024 – and we’re just getting started. America’s premier pro-life field program will complete 1 million voter visits over the next 13 months to build on that momentum and defend and grow our pro-life majority in the U.S. Senate,” the group’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said in a statement.

While a Democratic nominee will not be selected until the August primary election, Dannenfelser said that whoever emerges victorious “is going to be an abortion extremist.”
The Democratic slate of candidates includes U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed and research health specialist Rachel Howard. 
Reproductive Freedom For All Michigan slammed the announcement, saying the group was aiming to buy the open Senate seat for an anti-abortion extremist. 
“In 2022, Michiganders proudly passed Prop 3 to constitutionally protect access to abortion, making it clear they will not stand for a Senator who will gut their access to reproductive care. We are grateful to Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) and Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) for holding the line in Michigan,”  Reproductive Freedom for All President and CEO Mini Timmaraju said in a statement. 
The Michigan Democratic Party took aim at the presumptive Republican nominee for U.S. Senate, former U.S. Rep, Mike Rogers (R-White Lake). 
During his 2024 campaign against Slotkin, Rogers said he would honor the state’s decision to protect reproductive rights at the state level. However, Democrats argued Rogers cannot be trusted on reproductive healthcare, citing his record of opposing abortion while serving in the U.S. House.
“Michigan women and families deserve better than Mike Rogers, who will be beholden to out-of-state special interests trying to strip away their constitutional right to reproductive freedom,” Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel said in a statement.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/March01-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-25 11:59:51.017474
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-09-25 15:03:29+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Phoning it in – Mass. residents still lean toward in-person care as telehealth booms,Jennifer Smith,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/health-care/phoning-it-in-mass-residents-still-lean-toward-in-person-care-as-telehealth-booms/,"While the rise of telehealth in the early 2020s “did improve access to care,” according to the Health Policy Commission, not everyone is able to use the new virtual hospital landscape. “Specific actions could be taken to further enhance access for more rural and vulnerable populations.""","AS THE COVID-19 pandemic surged, homes became workplaces, schools, and day care centers. And with the rise of telehealth, they became remote doctors’ offices too.  
Now half a decade from the first lockdowns, most major providers offer telehealth options, but new polling finds nearly two-thirds of Bay State residents are still primarily receiving their health care the old-fashioned way: in person. 
Telehealth involves a clinician providing a patient medical services, in real time or asynchronously, generally by phone or video conferencing. While technological developments like laptops and cell phones made the practice more convenient in recent decades, KFF research in March 2020 found use of telemedicine in the US was minimal. Growth was slow, hampered by irregular insurance coverage policies and hurdles like high startup costs, workflow reconfiguration, clinician buy-in, and patient interest.  
That all changed in 2020. With the onset of the pandemic, usage soared. Massachusetts lawmakers passed a suite of pandemic-focused reforms to enable broad use of telehealth. The new regulations made coverage for telehealth services and cost parity between telehealth and in-person behavioral health services permanent. For primary care and chronic disease management, in person and telehealth cost parity changes were temporary. 
Two-thirds of covered outpatient visits in Massachusetts in April 2020 were telehealth visits, settling at about 31 percent of those visits over the course of the year. “As the most acute phase of the pandemic has ended,” the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission wrote in 2023, “telehealth has remained an important element of the health care delivery system.”  
While the rise of telehealth in the early 2020s “did improve access to care,” an HPC spokesperson said this month, not everyone is able to use the new virtual hospital landscape. “Specific actions could be taken to further enhance access for more rural and vulnerable populations,” the spokesperson said.  
According to new polling data from the MassINC Polling Group for CommonWealth Beacon, many Massachusetts residents aren’t leaning heavily into the digital health care transformation. The survey found that 37 percent had no telehealth appointments in the past year, while another 25 percent said less than half of their appointments were conducted virtually. (MassINC Polling Group is partially owned by Commonwealth Beacon’s publisher, MassINC.)

Those who make under $75,000 a year were significantly more likely to report no medical appointments in the last year (10 percent) than those making over $75,000 (3 percent). For those who did report medical appointments, higher income brackets were more likely to report fewer telehealth visits, though a majority of respondents of all income levels said they had no telehealth appointments or less than half of their appointments were telehealth over the past year. 
For those who want and can access telehealth, options abound. 
The Bay State has the third highest rate of hospital telehealth adoption in the country – 93.8 percent of its hospitals had installed some sort of telemedicine solution by early 2024.  
Mass General Brigham, the state’s largest health system and private employer, launched a new virtual and artificial intelligence-based primary care platform this month. For now, the program covers MGB patients who are between providers and those in risk-based contracts who haven’t come in for a visit in the past year.  
A spokesperson said the health system plans to expand the program this winter to reach new patients who prefer a virtual primary care physician experience. 
“Mass General Brigham always strives to provide the best quality, personalized care for our patients and give options as to how patients access care,” the hospital said in a statement. “Telehealth is a vital tool to expand access to care and lower barriers for patients.” 
Digital tools can ease some of the workforce strain, hospitals and insurers say. Facing weeks, months, or even more than a year of wait time for appointments, patients may opt for telehealth as an initial option if they can access it. 
“We understand how difficult it is for our members to access high-quality, affordable care,” Blue Cross Blue Shield Massachusetts spokesperson Kelsey Pearse said in a statement. “We’re focused on building a network of providers and solutions that can support our members now and navigate them to the care they need when they need it.” 
Blue Cross Blue Shield pointed to 13 percent growth in their primary care network and 48 percent growth in their mental health provider network over the past five years, including in-person and “virtual first” providers. Almost all of the system’s providers offer some sort of telemedicine these days, Pearse noted. The major remote-only vendor through BCBS is the telehealth network Well Connection. Other digital health options that have boomed during the pandemic include the physical therapy app Hinge Health and the virtual women’s health clinic Maven Clinic. 
According to Epic Research tracking, telehealth had declined from its mid-pandemic peak but remained above pre-pandemic levels, especially in behavioral health fields. About 27 percent of mental health contacts were via telehealth in June 2025, compared to less than 7 percent of primary care and 2 percent for urgent care. 
Pandemic aside, remote health care has stayed in the headlines because of its role in accessing abortion medications, something that is increasingly under attack in dozens of states.  
Since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the number of people receiving abortion medication prescriptions through telehealth has surged, with a Society of Family Planning report finding that a quarter of all abortions in the United States were delivered via telehealth prescriptions of medication by the end of 2024.  
Massachusetts providers reaffirmed earlier this month that they plan to continue mailing abortion pills to Texas even after its governor, Greg Abbott, signed a first-of-its-kind law that lets anyone sue prescribers and others responsible for getting abortion pills into the state.  
But accessing virtual care requires access to technology and a strong internet connection.  
The Health Policy Commission identified low digital literacy and a lack of access to connected devices and reliable internet as the biggest barriers for patients to access telehealth services. They also found telehealth platforms, patient portals, and other patient communication materials may be challenging to use for those with lower English proficiency or vision and hearing impairments. 
For regions without many accessible care facilities, telehealth is pitched as a partial solution. It may be physically easier to access than distant in-person appointments, but the regions also need improvements to their digital infrastructure to make full use of virtual care. 
“Rural patients face unique challenges in accessing both in-person and audio-video services, creating inequities in care,” according to the National Rural Health Association. “Rural patients, on average, travel further to access health care than their non-rural counterparts. This disincentivizes rural residents from seeking care if they do not have the ability or resources for travel.”    
These areas have less broadband infrastructure and lower rates of smartphone ownership, the advocacy organization notes. Expanded telehealth and rural internet offerings during the pandemic have been a boon, it says, and rural areas “will suffer if such flexibilities are removed.” 
Residents in Southeast Massachusetts were least likely in polling to regularly use telehealth, with just 22 percent reporting that more than half of their appointments were remote and 37 percent reporting no telehealth appointments in the past year. Greater Boston residents were most likely to report more than half of appointments by telehealth (31 percent), with Western and Central Massachusetts regions reporting less regular telehealth usage but also fewer overall medical appointments in the last year. 
Massachusetts lawmakers are still refining the state’s telehealth policies.  
The initial telehealth legislation’s payment parity mandate between telehealth and in-person services expired at the end of 2022, which the Massachusetts Medical Society noted “caused some insurers to reduce reimbursement rates. This variation in payment policies creates confusion and instability for providers and limits patient access to care.” 
Rep. Marjorie Decker and Sen. Adam Gomez have introduced legislation this session to re-establish payment parity for all telehealth services and create initiatives to advance digital health equity.  
A hearing on legislation put forward by Rep. William MacGregor of Boston that would create a special commission to study the accessibility and quality of telehealth is scheduled for September 29.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Telemedicine_Consult.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-25 11:59:51.017474

WILMINGTON– Buccini Pollin Group, Inc. (BPG) has officially opened The Press, a 243-unit luxury apartment community at 801 N Orange Street, marking a milestone year for the developer’s residential growth across the region.
The ribbon-cutting on Wednesday featured remarks from Wilmington Mayor John Carney and BPG Founder Rob Buccini, highlighting the project as part of BPG’s record-breaking year in multifamily housing delivery.
“The Press exemplifies our commitment to creating exceptional residential experiences in the heart of Wilmington,” said Rob Buccini, founder, Buccini Pollin Group. “This project represents more than just adding housing inventory—it’s about creating vibrant communities where residents can live, work, and thrive in downtown’s most connected locations.”
The Press represents a $90 million investment in Wilmington’s revitalization. Designed by Perkins Eastman, the 14-story glass and metal tower features an indoor lounge and dining space, a fourth-floor roof deck with views of downtown, and a private exterior area with a pool, dog run, grill stations, and social gathering spots. The development also features a landscaped pocket park open to the public, providing a green space for both residents and the surrounding community.

Apartments range from studios to three-bedroom units and duplexes, with high-end finishes such as quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, in-unit washers and dryers, and expansive windows. 
The name, The Press, pays tribute to the site’s history as the former headquarters of The News Journal.
The Press is the latest in a wave of BPG projects in 2025 that together bring more than 1,000 new apartments to the region. Highlights include the completion of The Standard at Market West, new groundbreakings at the University of Delaware’s STAR Campus and Justison Landing Residences on the Riverfront, and the ribbon cutting of Humble Park Place on Lower Market Street.

“Our momentum this year reflects not just market opportunity, but our deep understanding of what today’s residents need,” added Buccini. “From adaptive reuse projects like The Standard to ground-up developments like The Press and our STAR Campus community, we’re creating diverse housing options that serve Delaware’s growing workforce and attract new residents to our region.”

Laura Kelly and House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told Democrats a key goal in 2026 election cycle was breaking the GOP supermajority in the House.,"House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, joins Gov. Laura Kelly at a Sept. 23, 2025, rally that affirmed Democrats would try again in 2026 to break the Republican supermajority in the Kansas House. Democrats made it a top priority in 2024, but lost seats to Republicans in the House. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard says there’s no way to sugarcoat results of the November 2024 election that deepened the Republican supermajority in the Kansas House.
The idea, from the perspective of Democrats, was to recruit viable candidates to compete in winnable districts so the 85-40 GOP advantage would be reduced by at least two. That would have made it more difficult for House GOP leadership to secure 84 votes to override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly or to place constitutional amendments on statewide ballots.
The opposite occurred in the 2024 general election as Republicans expanded their grip on the House by winning an 88-37 majority. Likewise, Republicans expanded the partisan edge in the Senate to 31-9 by picking up two seats.
“Let’s be honest. Last November was tough. We lost seats. We lost ground,” said Woodard, a Lenexa Democrat.
He told more than 200 people at a Democratic Party event Tuesday night in Johnson County that House Democrats were outmuscled daily at the Capitol during the 2025 legislative session. The experience inspired a 14-city tour that included Dodge City, Pittsburg, Newton, Emporia, Hays, Topeka, Wichita and Manhattan.
The objective, Woodard said, was to open conversations with all sorts of voters about what was occurring in Topeka as well as Washington, D.C. He said the tour was also about finding allies to help flip at least five GOP House seats and retain all 37 Democrat seats in November 2026, which would be enough to break Republican Party’s two-thirds supermajority in the House.
“I’m hopeful about what’s ahead with us in 2026,” Woodard said. “Not only to win back seats and break the supermajority, but to end the extreme right madness being funneled into Kansas.”
On election night in November 2024, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach declared that wider GOP supermajorities in the House and Senate should be used to unlock the two-thirds majorities necessary to place an amendment to the Kansas Constitution on the ballot to enable direct election of justices to the Kansas Supreme Court. That’s exactly what happened during the 2025 session of the Legislature. The question will be decided by voters on the August 2026 primary ballot.
Senate President Ty Masterson, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins relied on their GOP supermajorities to push back against dozens of vetoes by Kelly in the 2025 session. They appear ready to do the same in the 2026 session — Kelly’s last as governor.
Kelly, who spoke to the Johnson County audience with Woodard, deployed a $2 million political action committee in an effort to turn the tide in favor of Democrats in legislative races in 2024.
She said that with the 40-member Senate not up for reelection until 2028, legislative investments next year could target the 125 House seats.
“There are some opportunities for us to pick up some more Democrats,” she said.
She said voters should respond to work of Democrats to fund K-12 public schools, eliminate the state sales tax on groceries and bring $22 billion in new private sector investments to Kansas since 2019.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Woodard-lenexa-2-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-25 10:58:02.649058

Bill Jennings, a 69-year-old libertarian who lives in Daytona Beach, Florida, said his mother and wife both worked outside the home, but he has been impressed by the younger generation of women in his family who are homeschooling their children.
“Both parents should participate in raising children, but I’m thinking more that the man is typically the breadwinner and the female is more focused on the home and raising children,” Jennings said. “I know it sounds old-fashioned.”
Half of respondents to a new 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll said they believe, like Jennings, that society would benefit from a return to traditional gender roles. Men were more likely than women to want a return to traditional gender roles, however — nearly 6 in 10 of them agreed with that, compared with 4 in 10 women.
“I’m not taking a hard line that ‘the woman’s place is in the home,’ but I just think the traditional roles are generally better — our traditional cultural, Western cultural roles are better for the family and for children,” Jennings said.
The new data on Americans’ views on gender roles comes amid the high-profile assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, who often argued to his audience of younger Americans that men should be providers and leaders in their homes, while young women should cherish marriage and children over careers. Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s widow has vowed to carry forward her husband’s work as the CEO of the company he helped found.
While Gen Z men were less likely than men of older generations to agree at 54 percent, the gap between Gen Z men and women was 19 points, illustrating the ways in which younger Americans are diverging when it comes to culture and politics.
Women of both parties were less likely to support a return to traditional gender roles than men. Support for a return to traditional gender roles was highest among Republican men at 87 percent, followed by Republican women at 79 percent. Democratic women were the least likely to support a return to traditional gender roles — 23 percent do, compared with 29 percent of Democratic men.
Another notable gender divide exists between men and women who are married and who are parenting. Married men support the premise at 62 percent, compared with fewer than half of married women at 47 percent. Sixty-seven percent of dads support a return to traditional gender roles, compared with 52 percent of moms.
Divorced men were most likely to think that society would benefit from a return to traditional gender roles at 67 percent. Women who have never been married were the least likely to agree at 37 percent.
SurveyMonkey conducted this poll online from September 8 to 15 among a national sample of 20,807 U.S. adults, with a modeled error estimate of plus or minus 1.0 percentage points.
Eve Rodsky, a lawyer specializing in organizational management who has become a prominent advocate for fair labor division in the home, said many Americans have long yearned for an idyllic “Leave it to Beaver” lifestyle. The current rise in Christian nationalism being promoted by Republicans in power — and on full display following the death of Kirk — will only turbocharge those long-standing yearnings, Rodsky said.
“This idea of women being at home is so strong that I would have been shocked if I saw something different in the data,” said Rodsky, the author of “Fair Play,” a book and card game designed to guide couples through domestic divisions of labor. “It is in our lore.”
The survey showed stark religious divides: More than three-quarters of evangelical Christians — 77 percent — agree with a return to traditional gender roles, compared with 54 percent of non-evangelical Christians, 32 percent of Jewish people, and 15 percent of atheist or agnostic people.
The survey also asked Americans whether or not they agree with the statement, “Families are better off when one parent stays home with the children.” A net 63 percent of Americans agreed, including 69 percent of men and 58 percent of women.

Holly Ann Zuercher, a 71-year-old Republican in Florida, also responded to the survey and said at least one parent should stay home for the sake of the children. She said she and her sister were raised in a home with a dad who worked full-time and a mom who stayed home full-time for about a decade before returning to work part-time.
“A lot of our kids have gone off the rails because they don’t have proper parenting. The parents are too busy and don’t have time to devote to help teach the children all the values and things they should be teaching them,” Zuercher said. “And on the weekends, they’re so tired taking care of things around the house and the kids don’t get the quality time with parents that they should get.”
Zuercher acknowledged that rising costs have made it difficult for many families to make ends meet without both parents working full-time. She herself went back to work when her daughter was less than 2 years old but was able to leave her with a good friend who was a stay-at-home mom.
“I’m not sure if there’s a policy that would fix the situation or make it better: Things are expensive, housing and child care,” Zuercher said. “There isn’t always a grandparent that can take over and the influence of some teachers doesn’t really go with the ideals of parents. Kids are suffering.”
Both Jennings and Zuercher were among the 66 percent of those who say it’s better for a parent to stay home with children — including majorities of men, women, Republicans and Democrats — who said whichever parent wants to stay home should be the one to stay home.
Those views appear to conflict with the large share of Americans who want a return to traditional gender roles, where the woman is the primary caretaker of children.
“It’s difficult to say in every instance that the mother should be the primary person to stay at home,” Jennings said, adding that “by and large, that’s the case.”
Rodsky said that given the realities of women in the workforce — occupational segregation, lack of paid leave, the pay gap between men and women, for example — Americans who say either parent can stay in the home are likely doing so with the assumption that, more often than not, in heterosexual couples, it will be the woman.
“I think you can say women without having to say women,” Rodsky said. “It’s almost always going to be women.”
Americans’ yearning for a return to traditional gender roles is crucial to understanding why the United States lags behind other wealthy countries in policies like paid parental leave and universal child care. “It’s going to be very, very hard to implement policies that buck that aspirational trend,” she said.
Rodsky said that traditional gender roles, or gender specialization, while an ideal for many Americans, particularly men, is out of reach for more than two-thirds of families because of income inequality, which is only growing.
Kaylia Artis, a 24-year-old from Virginia, said her husband wants her to stay home full-time to watch their children, ages 2 and 6. But she works as a nurse at a hospital and is employed in another part-time retail role, and she said the family cannot afford for her to stop working. Not to mention, she said, she really enjoys it.
“The way things are changing, we both need to be working because we got to be able to pay the rent, the lights, the water, the gas, anything the kids might need, the car,” Artis said. “But my husband’s telling me he’d prefer me to just cook, clean, do everything at home. And I’m like, respectfully, I’m just not that kind of woman.”
Artis believes whichever parent wants to stay home should. But in her specific situation, Artis said she can’t imagine her husband taking over all of the household duties from her.
“Women are being asked to do too much and take on everything,” Artis said. “Us moms are the main ones taking sacrifices for our kids. It’s mainly us women that are leaving or quitting jobs or have to leave work early or have to change our hours a certain way to get the kids or take them to school. We’re making the kids’ appointments, going to the schools and participating in everything.”

,DC,2025-09-25 14:25:34+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump threatens mass firings of federal employees in a government shutdown,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-threatens-mass-firings-federal-employees-government-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — The White House has sent guidance to departments and agencies, telling them that if a shutdown begins Wednesday, they’re expected to institute mass firings and layoffs. The two-page memo, shared with States Newsroom by a Trump administration official, says any programs that received funding in the “big, beautiful” law will “continue uninterrupted.”But the vast majority of federal departments and agencies need Congress to approve an annual funding bill or a stopgap spending bill before the start of the new fiscal year to keep running. The memo says the employees who run those programs may receive a Reduction in Force notice if lawmakers don’t broker an agreement before the Oct. 1 deadline.  Those reductions will apply to programs, projects, or activities that are “not consistent with the President’s priorities,” according to the memo.  “RIF notices will be in addition to any furlough notices provided due to the lapse in appropriation,” the memo states. “RIF notices should be issued to all employees working on the relevant (programs, projects, or activities), regardless of whether the employee is excepted or furloughed during the lapse in appropriations.”Once lawmakers reach a deal and the government reopens, the memo says agencies should rework their reduction in force plans “to retain the minimal number of employees necessary to carry out statutory functions.”Employee union urges compromiseSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a statement the memo represents “an attempt at intimidation.”“Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one—not to govern, but to scare. This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government,” Schumer wrote. “These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today.”American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley wrote in a statement the memo shows that White House budget director Russ Vought intends “to pursue another DOGE-like round of illegal mass firings in the event of a shutdown, adding to the chaos.” “The truth is simple: Republicans cannot fund the government without Democratic votes. That means the only path forward is compromise,” Kelley wrote. “The president and congressional leaders must sit down and negotiate in good faith to keep the lights on for the American people. Nothing less is acceptable.”Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen wrote in a statement that “Trump is engaged in mafia-style blackmail, with his threats ultimately harming the American people.” “He is threatening to double down on the failed actions of Elon Musk and his chainsaw — going after patriotic civil servants that provide Americans with critical services — despite having to rehire many of these workers after Americans experienced the negative impact of those cuts,” Van Hollen wrote. “These dedicated workers have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy disputes that have brought us to the brink of a shutdown.”House GOP departs until after Oct. 1The House voted mostly along party lines to approve a seven-week stopgap spending bill last week before leaving town. GOP leaders were supposed to bring lawmakers in that chamber back to Capitol Hill on Monday, but extended their break and won’t return until after the shutdown deadline. The move was largely seen as a way to jam the Senate, specifically Democrats, with the short-term government funding bill that they largely oppose because GOP lawmakers wrote it behind closed doors without bipartisan negotiations. The Senate tried to advance the House-passed Republican stopgap bill but didn’t have the necessary 60 votes to move the legislation toward final passage. Democrats have maintained for weeks that if Republican leaders want their support on a short-term spending bill, they should have negotiated with party leaders on key issues, including an extension of the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.Those tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year but Americans who rely on the marketplace for their health insurance will begin purchasing their plans for next year on Nov. 1. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he views negotiations on those tax credits as an issue for December, not this month, despite the open enrollment period ending on Dec. 15. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has said repeatedly he views the issue as separate from government funding.",,,,2025-09-25 10:58:02.649058

Mikie Sherrill and former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli are in a statistical tie, according to an Emerson College Poll released Thursday.","Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill are competing in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy (Photos by Dana DiFilippo and Amanda Brown)Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill are locked in a tight race to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, according to a new poll released Thursday.
Each candidate received 43% from the 935 self-reported likely voters surveyed by Emerson College Polling, marking a slowdown for Sherrill, a four-term congresswoman who has led the contest in every other public poll of the race. Just under 11% of respondents were undecided, and 3% plan to vote for a different candidate.
Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman, and Sherrill are vying in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat barred from seeking a third consecutive term.
Spencer Kimball, the poll’s executive director, in a statement noted that poll results show state and federal executives are unpopular.
“Both President Trump and Governor Murphy are underwater among Jersey voters. Sherrill is trying to tie Ciattarelli to Trump, at the national level, and Ciattarelli is trying to tie Sherrill to Murphy and the cost of living at the state level,” Kimball said.
NJ governor hopefuls duke it out at first of two debates

The poll found Murphy holds a 35% job approval rating, with 44% disapproving. Just over a fifth of voters, 21%, said they had no opinion on the two-term governor. Trump’s approval rating is at 41%, with 51% disapproving (9% are unsure.)
The poll found independents favored Ciattarelli 52% to 26%. Republicans (86%) were a little more likely to back their party’s nominee than were Democrats (81%).
Overwhelmingly, voters said the economy (51%) was the most pressing issue facing New Jersey, followed by threats to democracy (13%) and housing affordability (11%).
Few voters named crime (5%) and immigration policy (5%) as a chief issue, though even fewer named abortion access (0.9%).
Trump has been a major issue on the campaign trail, with Democrats warning voters that Ciattarelli would be the “Trump of Trenton.” The new poll says voters narrowly preferred a candidate who would stand up to the Trump administration (51%) to one who would work with it (49%).
Both Ciattarelli and Sherrill have pledged to lower costs for residents plagued by skyrocketing electric bills. The new poll says voters continued to blame utility companies (30%) and the governor (22%) for rising utility rates. Few (7%) said the federal government — which has indefinitely paused New Jersey’s offshore wind projects and regulates New Jersey’s grid operator — was to blame.
Even fewer (4%) said PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey and 12 other states, was responsible for rising electricity rates. A little more than a third of voters (35%) said everyone was to blame.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Maine Gov. Janet Mills appears poised to announce a run for U.S. Senate against Republican Susan Collins. In recent weeks, the Democratic governor has been crisscrossing the state, visiting local businesses and leaders, and reportedly interviewing campaign managers to help with her Senate bid.
This comes after months of pressure from national Democratic leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, for whom flipping Collins’ seat remains one of the only paths to gaining a Democratic majority in the chamber. 
I understand why they have zeroed in on Mills as their chosen fighter after she gained national attention for confronting President Donald Trump (with a merch-ready tagline to boot), and it’s clear they are eager to thrust her into the ring.
But I want to caution the party against getting over their skis here as Maine voters, Democrats in particular, have been burnt before when the establishment chose a candidate without allowing a primary to play out.
Graham Platner and other Democratic candidates are garnering interest that spans from curiosity to fandom.
Mills is a known entity with a proven record of being a champion of reproductive rights and public health. While she would likely be a solid Democratic vote in Congress, her history on issues including labor rights, gun safety and tribal sovereignty, among others, has left many voters frustrated.
At the same time, many of her likely challengers — Platner, Jordan Wood, Dan Kleban, Daira Smith-Rodriguez — are untested and have a lot of work to do to win Mainers’ support. The more we learn about their platforms, the more opportunity there will be for disagreement.
But with so much hand-wringing about the Democratic Party’s favorability problem (which currently has a polling average of 33.5%), it would behoove those at the top to see who is connecting with voters and who they are excited about before calling the race a done deal.
If there’s one thing we can take from the 2020 Senate race in Maine, when party leaders endorsed Sara Gideon one day after she announced her candidacy, it’s that it takes more than a hefty war chest to best Collins.
It’s very possible that Mills could win the primary on her own. She’s a savvy politician and an experienced leader. But if that’s not what Maine voters are asking for, the national party would be smart to listen.

Baffled and appalled. 
That’s how Minnesota taxpayers should be feeling about their state government in the past week following federal fraud charges, which allege that two separate Medicaid programs were bilked by scammers, even as the feds have continued to charge new defendants in the notorious Feeding Our Future case.
The Reformer was first to report on a wide-ranging federal investigation of the state’s autism treatment program last year, which arose out of the Feeding Our Future food aid scandal that cost taxpayers at least $250 million in federal money. 
The feds had an inkling about the autism program because some Feeding Our Future defendants also ran autism treatment facilities — multitasking! 
The FBI executed search warrants of two operators in December. Now, Asha Farhan Hassan has been charged and plans to plead guilty, according to her attorney, for her role in a $14 million scheme to defraud the autism program. 
Maybe someone at DHS should have noticed that spending on autism was exploding beyond reason: The number of providers — who are supposed to diagnose and treat people with autism spectrum disorder — increased 700% in five years, climbing from 41 providers in 2018 to over 300 in 2023, while spending increased 3,000%, from about $6 million to nearly $192 million — according to DHS data.
When we asked about this in June of 2024, DHS was unperturbed: “I don’t think we are surprised or particularly disturbed by the rate of growth,” said a DHS assistant commissioner. 
(Hilariously, she said the growth was “pretty consistent” with other DHS programs, such as “housing stabilization services,” a program we now know was so riddled with fraud that Gov. Tim Walz moved to shut it down last month.)
Finally, DHS took notice and began investigating autism providers. First, they said they were looking at 15. Then, 29. Following Wednesday’s indictment, DHS released a statement saying they now have 84 open cases, or nearly one-fourth of all providers. 
DHS also said they began on-site visits in 2024 and have examined 342 providers. 
Even after we reported the FBI was on the case in June of 2024, however, DHS didn’t start on-site inspections until the fall — months later. 
Let’s recall a criticism of state government during Feeding Our Future: Even though for-profit companies and nonprofits claimed to be serving hundreds of thousands of meals from addresses linked to apartment buildings, an apartment complex for seniors and a  townhome, among other suspicious sites, the Minnesota Department of Education, which administered the program, never visited them.
And, still, DHS was guilty of the same lax oversight, only beginning site visits years after the autism program launched.  
Let’s go back further, however. In the summer of 2023, we reported that about half of the people who to that point had been charged in the Feeding Our Future case had other state contracts. 
How did DHS respond? The agency told the Reformer — after months of stonewalling — that they’d reviewed the contracts with Feeding Our Future defendants and hadn’t turned up evidence of fraud. 
That wasn’t the only warning DHS should have been wise to, however.  
As the Star Tribune recently reported, DHS was warned, also in 2023, about potential fraud in the aforementioned housing stabilization program, designed to help people secure housing after they’d come out of rehab or were struggling with homelessness. 
According to the Strib, a “caseworker notified the state in September 2023 that Faladcare LLC was falsifying timesheets to receive payments.” 
DHS never investigated, however, “referring it instead to an outside Medicaid administrator.”
The subject of the tip was among eight people charged last week. More charges linked to fraud in that program are likely.  
While DHS was passing the buck, the bucks were flowing: Spending on housing stabilization services — another Medicaid program — skyrocketed in recent years. 
Analysts predicted the program would cost about $2.6 million annually when it was created about five years ago. But in 2021, the program paid out over $21 million in claims, rising to $42 million in 2022, $74 million in 2023 and $104 million in 2024, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
Mind you: This isn’t paying people’s rent. It’s just helping them find a place to live and counseling them through the at-times difficult process of securing housing after being homeless or coming out of rehab. 
DHS was apparently so clueless as to the potential fraud that the Walz administration “asked the Legislature to fund additional DHS positions to keep pace with the growth,” the Strib reported. “Where it could, DHS moved to speed up processing times and let more individuals into the program.”
It’s like we were putting our cherished Christmas gifts right into the Grinch’s bag of stolen goods.   
A Walz spokeswoman told the Strib last week that “There is an organized crime ring in Minnesota determined to cheat and steal from taxpayers, and we have continued to pass policies to stay ahead of them — and that is why we are seeing people going to prison. It’s why the governor’s administration moved to shut off this entire program.”
Too little, too late. 
I take no joy from the fact that in 2023, I wrote a column warning Democrats of the policy and political ramifications of widespread government fraud: “If government is constantly being hoodwinked and wasting the people’s money on boondoggles, why would voters entrust to Democrats a universal public health insurance program?”
Moreover, in a year when the president is lining his pockets with shady crypto deals and his border czar faces an allegation that he accepted a $50,000 cash bribe, Democrats ought to be running as the party of reform and clean government. 
Instead, in Minnesota, they’ll confront a neverending drip drip of indictments of people alleged to have stolen the people’s money. 
They can’t say they weren’t warned.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-900038802-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 11:59:51.017474

(Photo by Steve Hillebrand/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)A U.S. District Court judge in Anchorage has ruled against the state of Alaska in an 11-year-old legal dispute that has significant implications for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and state finances.
On Wednesday, Judge Sharon Gleason ruled that laws and regulations setting the western border of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are “ambiguous,” but federal regulators made a reasonable decision when they declared the border to be the western bank of the North Slope’s Staines River, rather than on the western bank of the Canning River.
There are 20,000 acres of potentially oil-rich land between the two waterways, and the state of Alaska had sought ownership of the area — sited just to the east of the Prudhoe Bay oil field — for oil and gas drilling.

This map, published by the Alaska Department of Law as part of its summary judgment motion, shows the area contested between the state of Alaska and the federal government. (Screenshot)

While the federal government is now advancing plans for oil and gas leasing in the disputed area, the decision to keep it under federal control means that if oil and gas are discovered there, the state of Alaska would receive far less revenue than it would if it were state-owned land.
“The state of Alaska is disappointed that the court failed to recognize the state’s ownership of this disputed area on the border of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,” said Patty Sullivan, communications director for the Alaska Department of Law, which brought the case against the federal government. 
“This land may hold significant resource potential for the future of energy for Alaska and the United States and would likely be thoroughly explored and developed under state management. We will evaluate our options and are glad to, at least, have a federal administration currently in place that recognizes the importance of responsible resource development in this area,” she said.
Attorneys for the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Department of Justice did not return messages seeking comment.
The state’s dispute with the federal government revolves around whether federal mapmakers viewed the Staines River as a separate river from the Canning, or simply a “distributary,” a different channel of the same river, in 1957. 
The Bureau of Land Management used the boundary drawn that year to create the Arctic National Wildlife Range in 1960, and it became the refuge in 1980. Maps published at that time show the border running along the Staines River. 
As Gleason explained in her 74-page order, “If the Staines River was considered to be part of the Canning, then the extreme west bank would follow the west bank of the Staines distributary of the Canning River. But if the Staines and the Canning were considered to be two separate rivers, then the boundary would follow the west bank of western-most channel of the main Canning River.”
The dispute also included a marker designating the northwest, seward boundary of the refuge, but the main issue was about the river-defined border.
In 2014, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources requested ownership “of certain lands west of” the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
The Alaska Statehood Act, which remains partially unfulfilled more than 65 years after statehood, allows the state to select more than 100 million acres of federal land for state ownership.
In 2016, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management responded to the state’s request, saying the state had already selected all available land in the area. The state protested, saying that federal officials were drawing ANWR’s border west of where it should have been because they were relying on the Staines River, not the Canning.
The state appealed to the U.S. Interior Board of Land Appeals, which ruled in favor of the BLM. The state sued over the issue in 2022 and won an early victory when Judge Gleason ruled the following year that the land appeals board failed to consider a 1951 map that showed the Staines as a separate river from the Canning.
But in 2024, the land appeals board again ruled against the state, which promptly renewed its case in the U.S. District Court and requested summary judgment, a request that was answered Wednesday.
Explaining her order, Gleason noted a 1906 U.S. Geological Survey dictionary that labeled the Staines and the Canning as the same river, but “on the other hand, some contemporaneous maps label the two rivers separately, indicating that the Staines and the Canning may have been considered to be two separate rivers. And yet other contemporaneous maps do not label the Staines or do not separately label the Canning River at the mouth,” she wrote.
While that might have favored the state’s position, Gleason concluded that the land appeals board’s interpretation of the border was reasonable, not arbitrary, was supported by substantial evidence and wasn’t contrary to law, meaning that the state doesn’t have grounds to overturn it.
Gleason concluded, “the court upholds the IBLA’s finding that the northwest boundary of the refuge follows the Staines River, a distributary of the Canning River.”
If the state chooses to appeal Gleason’s decision, it will have 30 days after final judgment.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8192238026_68ea381f61_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 10:58:02.649058

The Delaware Restaurant Association (DRA) is launching the Council of Hispanic Restaurants (CHR), a new initiative dedicated to supporting Hispanic restaurant owners and operators across the state.
The council will focus on the unique needs of Hispanic food entrepreneurs by providing regulatory updates, networking opportunities, and operational resources vital for long-term sustainability and growth.
According to the National Restaurant Association, Hispanic workers make up 27% of the U.S. restaurant workforce, shaping menus, leading kitchens, and driving innovation. In Delaware, the number of Latino-owned businesses increased from 5% to 6% of all businesses between 2022 and 2023, reflecting growing momentum and a positive impact on the community. 
RELATED STORY: Wilmington Parade Celebrates Hispanic Heritage with Music, Color and Community Spirit – Update
To celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, the DRA is partnering with local Hispanic organizations to host two free community events, offered in both English and Spanish. The sessions are designed for restaurants, food trucks, catering businesses, and food entrepreneurs, and will provide access to resources, state regulatory updates, and connections with agencies such as the Delaware Departments of Health and Labor.
According to the DRA, “The CHR will ensure Hispanic-owned restaurants in Delaware have a dedicated seat at the table — connecting owners with critical resources, culturally relevant guidance, and year-round support.”

Francis Awerkamp, a St. Marys Republican pictured here on March 11, 2025, was the most vocal legislator during a hearing in which gambling industry representatives weighed in on changes to sports betting in Kansas. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas legislators are considering changes to the way the state taxes sports gambling after receiving less than a 1% cut on more than $2.7 billion in bets in the past fiscal year.
As the expiration dates for contracts between the state and sports wager operators draw nearer, Kansas is confronting an increasingly complex and more profitable gambling climate than when it first legalized sports betting in 2022.
During the 2025 session, the Legislature implemented a last-minute moratorium on the state approving any contract renewals for online sportsbooks. A hearing Monday was the first public discussion of potential changes to Kansas’ sportsbook market since then.
Legislators toyed with the idea of rejiggering the formula that dictates the allocation of sports betting revenues at a Monday hearing in Topeka. Of the $2.7 billion in wagering revenue in fiscal year 2025, which began in July 2024 and ended in June, Kansas retained about $17 million, or 0.6%, according to state data.
Lawmakers also considered changing the way book operators reach customers.
John Pappas, the state advocacy director for iDevelopment and Economic Association, a national trade group for mobile sportsbook operators and technology providers, said during the hearing that Kansas’ model is a success story.
But Rep. Francis Awerkamp, a Republican from St. Marys, said he struggled to accept that notion.
“I guess we represent different people, right?” he said to Pappas. “ You have your clients. I have the people of my district. The people of Kansas.”
In ranking sports wagering tax revenue per $1 million wagered since inception, Kansas ranks 29 out of 33 states.
“This is absolute failure from my perspective,” Awerkamp said.
“What am I not seeing?” he added. “How can you say that this is a success story when we’re basically one of the worst states in the country?”
Pappas said the answer is simple. Success is based on the size of Kansas’ market. For a small population, Kansas’ sports betting revenues are disproportionately large. In Awerkamp’s eyes, the problem is that the revenues are only taxed at 10%.
Six states and Washington, D.C., set different tax rates for online and retail sports betting. Kansas is one of 11 states that tax online and retail sports betting at the same rate of 10% or less. New Hampshire, New York, Oregon and Rhode Island have the highest tax rates at 51%.
Kansans over the age of 21 can bet on more than 50 categories of live and virtual sports, from bull riding to baseball to chess. Casinos in Kansas are allowed to contract with sportsbook operators, of which there are currently six: BetMGM, Caesar’s, DraftKings, ESPNBet, FanDuel and Fanatics.
The 5-year contracts, which include retail and mobile betting, are set to expire around the same time in August 2027. Other states run their own books, or contract directly with book operators.
Existing sportsbook operators and Kansas casinos opposed a change to Kansas’ model. Some cautioned lawmakers about modifying business in Kansas while sportsbooks are expected to begin operating in neighboring states, including Missouri later this year.
Aaron Gomes, president of the parent company to Kansas Crossing Casino in Pittsburg, said in written testimony, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”
The casino works with three book operators: Caesars, Fanatics and BetMGM.
“Untethering sports wagering from casinos would not only disrupt these partnerships — it would risk undermining the very institutions that have delivered economic value to Kansas,” said Gomes, who is the chief operating officer of the casino’s owner, Peninsula Pacific Entertainment.
Earlier in the hearing, in discussion with another casino representative, Awerkamp said the sole purpose of the Kansas Lottery is to generate revenue for the state to offset burdens on taxpayers.
“From my perspective, what’s happened is certain organizations have recognized a tremendous opportunity of essentially a constitutionally protected monopoly and tried to get in the process and take a cut,” he said.
The Kansas Lottery was established for the good of the people, Awerkamp said, not the good of the casinos.
 
Raising the stakes
Kansans’ attitudes toward gambling have evolved since the state legalized sports wagering, and problem gambling behaviors have escalated, according to a 2025 study that surveyed more than 1,600 Kansas adults.
It was the first time the survey was conducted since 2017, and it recommended enhancing problem gambling messaging, improving state-funded treatment and gambling screening, regulating gambling advertising, and conducting statewide surveys more frequently.
Around 70% of survey respondents reported gambling, and 34% of respondents said they had gambled in the past month, an increase from 19% who reported gambling in 2017.
“The number of Kansans at moderate or high risk for problem gambling has more than tripled since 2017,” the survey found.
Almost everyone surveyed who was classified as high risk acknowledged they had a gambling problem. Many said gambling caused health, financial and relational problems. Substance use and mental health struggles were more likely for those in the high-risk category than those in the moderate and low-risk categories, the study said. Kansans are also less likely to use a gambling hotline than they were eight years ago.
More Kansans are citing their motivation for gambling as paying bills and escaping everyday problems. In 2017, 18% of survey respondents said they gamble to pay bills and 16% said they want to escape their problems. In 2025, those percentages rose to 38% and 35%. Still, between the two surveys, the top motivations remained entertainment and fun, to win money and excitement and challenge.
Around 37% of respondents reported placing a sports wager in 2025. Fewer than half of those surveyed viewed sports betting as entertainment that allows for reasonable gambling.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3111026-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-25 09:57:35.348521

Ed Crockett of Portland is running as an independent in the open race to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Janet Mills in November 2026. (Photo courtesy of campaign)Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. And, he’s the second sitting legislator who has unaffiliated from a political party to run as an independent. 
Crockett, who until recently had been a Democrat, announced his intention to run for higher office in an op-ed earlier this summer, in which he condemned what he described as a Legislature “stuck in a morass of partisanship.” Crockett is approaching his eighth and final year serving in the Maine House of Representatives before he’ll be termed out. 
That critique echoes why Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, formerly a Republican, similarly said he decided to run as an independent for governor earlier this year 
With Crockett in the running, there are now 17 candidates in the open race to replace Gov. Janet Mills, who terms out in 2026. Crockett is the third independent, along with Bennett and John Glowa, a retired environmental specialist.
Before assuming public office, Crocket had a decades-long career in sales and marketing, leading initiatives for Maine-based companies such as Country Kitchen, Hannaford and Oakhurst Dairy.
Crockett has said his world view was shaped by his childhood growing up on Munjoy Hill in Portland as the youngest of eight children in a family that struggled financially, which he detailed in his memoir released in 2021, “The Ghosts of Walter Crockett,” titled after his father. 
Crockett is also the third Clean Elections candidate, fully funding his campaign with public money under Maine’s Clean Elections Act. 
A bill this past session that sought to expand the fund failed, and the Maine Ethics Commission raised concern about allocations not being enough if more than two gubernatorial candidates run under the program in 2026. Bennett previously told Maine Morning Star that he chose not to run under clean elections because of fear that there wouldn’t be sufficient funding.
Crockett has been a vocal critic of how the state has set its budgets over the past several years, specifically Democrats choosing to pass majority budgets without Republican support. He has argued that that approach puts too much power in the hands of the chief executive while making most of the bipartisan work done in committees fruitless. 
“Maine does not need more partisan fighting,” Crockett wrote on his campaign website. “It needs a governor who can bring people together and move us forward.”

As President Donald Trump’s administration continues its crackdown on immigration, one California school district stands out to ensure all its students — regardless of legal status — can feel safe and access vital resources, reports CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
Serving more than 500,000 students, Los Angeles Unified School District is the country’s second largest school district. Within days of Trump’s reelection in November, its school board passed a resolution vowing to protect students from immigration enforcement on campuses.
The district also has a hotline for families seeking assistance related to immigration; provides free legal help through partnerships with local nonprofits; and has a virtual academy for students who are housebound due to fears of deportation.
Amid drops in enrollment and attendance from increased immigration raids, the district organizes volunteers to help escort children to and from school for parents who are afraid to leave their homes. 
These efforts have been led by Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, a former immigrant without legal status. His outspoken defense for immigrant rights has captured the attention of some educators and advocates, who say it’s important that school leaders stand up for their students.

Carvalho, at a recent panel on immigration: “It is my compelling moral responsibility, as well as professional responsibility, to protect all children. On the sidewalks of America, we don’t have some reserved for immigrants and others for everybody else. Everybody walks the same sidewalk of hope and opportunity.”

At the state level, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law last week two measures that aim to protect immigrant students: One prohibits school staff from sharing information about students to immigration authorities without a judicial warrant, and the other requires schools to notify families when immigration officials are on campus.

Data center bills lack bite

California is home to more than 300 data centers, and two bills regulating these power-guzzling facilities now await the governor’s decision, writes CalMatters’ Khari Johnson.
Both measures have been notably amended since their introduction: One would require data center operators to disclose how much water they estimate their centers will consume whenever they apply for or renew a business license or permit.
Data centers can use hundreds of thousands of gallons of water a day as part of their cooling systems, and many facilities are located in drier areas of the state. But one amendment made to the bill would require operators to share their water data with water suppliers — not government officials.
Another bill originally aimed to ensure that utility companies wouldn’t leave customers financially on the hook for the energy infrastructure they build to power data centers. Now, however, the measure only authorizes state regulators to assess whether data centers shift costs to ratepayers — a power the state’s public utility commission already has.

Researchers not deemed ideological match for Trump’s agenda lose grants

Millions of dollars in canceled federal grants have left California researchers and educators in the humanities scrambling for new funding — threatening various projects focused on local history, the immigrant experience, border studies and more.
As Lylah Schmedel-Permanna of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network explains, in April the National Endowment for the Humanities canceled over $10.2 million to projects in California. The agency notified campuses that it “is repurposing its funding allocations … in furtherance of the President’s agenda.”
CalMatters found that of all the 29 California campuses that had ongoing NEH-funded projects at that time, every campus but one had their funding cut. Canceled grants ranged from about $23,000 to more than $500,000, though the University of Southern California lost over $1.2 million in total canceled projects.
Cal State San Bernardino lost nearly $150,000 in three-year funding for its “Inland Empire Project,” which would provide a teaching framework that links local history with broader U.S. history. The project is led by historian and professor Michelle Lorimer, who said she was devastated after receiving notice about the grant termination.

LA Unified Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, himself formerly an immigrant without legal status, has been outspoken in his support of immigrant families.


As the Trump administration has ratcheted up immigration enforcement, school districts across the country have rallied to support students and families without legal status. But perhaps none more so than Los Angeles Unified.
The nation’s second largest school district — under the guidance of Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, himself formerly an immigrant living in the country illegally – has emerged as a national model for how school districts can help families gripped by fear.
“I think L.A. Unified is at the top of the list for folks looking at what schools are doing right now,” said Sophia Rodriguez, associate professor at New York University who’s studied the topic. “We’re seeing individual teachers and schools push back, but this effort cannot fall on the backs of heroic educators. It has to happen at the district level, like L.A. Unified.”
L.A. Unified catapulted itself to the forefront of the issue within days of Trump’s election in November. At its first school board meeting after the election, the board unanimously passed a resolution vowing to protect students from immigration enforcement on campuses. Since then, the district has rolled out a slew of other services: a 24-hour hotline for families seeking help; a “compassion fund” to help families facing economic emergencies; free legal assistance through local nonprofits; online and in-person workshops addressing immigrants’ legal rights; and a virtual academy for students who’re afraid to leave the house due to the risk of deportation. 
Families can get red cards outlining their legal rights in case they’re detained, as well as mental health counseling and medical care at 19 wellness centers located on school campuses. The district also encourages families to create emergency plans in case a parent is detained. 
Those moves are in addition to statewide efforts to keep schools safe. Guidance from Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta reminded schools that immigration officers need a judicial warrant before entering a school campus. Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, last week signed a bill that prevents school staff from disclosing information about students or their families to immigration authorities without a judicial warrant. He also signed a bill requiring schools to notify families and the community when immigration officials are on campus.
Outspoken superintendent
These steps are helpful, advocates said, but Carvalho’s outspoken defense of immigrant families might be even more powerful. At a time when some civic leaders are shying away from controversy, Carvalho has repeatedly spoken out and made clear that protecting immigrant students is a priority.
“As a proud American by choice — not by chance — and as a formerly undocumented immigrant, it is my compelling moral responsibility, as well as professional responsibility, to protect all children,” Carvalho said at a recent panel on immigration. “On the sidewalks of America, we don’t have some reserved for immigrants and others for everybody else. Everybody walks the same sidewalk of hope and opportunity. … The day we abandon that we might as well bring down the arm of Lady Liberty, extinguish the flame, and tell everyone, ‘I’m sorry, America’s democracy is closed.’”
An immigrant from Portugal, Carvalho was living illegally in the country for  his first few years in the United States in the 1980s. He had moved to the U.S. alone after he graduated from high school, in hopes of escaping poverty and finding more opportunities for education and a career, according to a New York Times profile. While living on the East Coast, he struggled with housing and the fear of deportation, but eventually obtained a student visa and went on to become a high school science teacher in Florida and gain citizenship. He served as superintendent of Miami-Dade County Public Schools before taking over at Los Angeles Unified in 2021.
Carvalho’s words are important, particularly amid the current political climate, said 
Mayra Lara, Southern California director of partnerships and engagement at the research and advocacy nonprofit EdTrust West. Lara was once a student living in the country illegally in Los Angeles Unified and later worked as a high school English teacher in the district. 
“I’ve been impressed with what the district has done, but the superintendent has been especially vocal,” Lara said. “Having a leader who has the courage to speak out makes an incredible difference.”

Students living in the country illegally often feel isolated, afraid to reveal their stories for fear of deportation, she said. Lara felt school, especially English class, was a safe place where she could be herself. 
“School saved me. That’s why it’s so important that schools do what they can to help families right now,” Lara said. “All school districts should be doing what LAUSD is doing.”
Effect on enrollment
Like all school districts in California, Los Angeles Unified doesn’t ask students about their immigration status. But immigrant rights groups estimate that about 1 in 5 students, or 76,000, in the district come from mixed-status families, meaning that at least one parent lacks legal status. 
Enrollment this year has dipped, in part due to the immigration crackdown, Carvalho said. Some families have moved away and some are keeping their children home from school. Attendance has also faltered as raids have increased. That’s led the district to send staff — including the superintendent — to visit 2,000 students’ homes and call more than 14,000 families to assure them that their children are safe at school.
The district has created so-called safe passages to school: volunteers who escort children to and from school for parents who are afraid to leave their homes.
Still, the district can do more, said Maria Miranda, vice president of United Teachers Los Angeles, the teachers union. More outreach to families, so they know what’s available to them, and larger zones around campuses monitored by volunteers, should be a priority, she said. The union would also like to see a stronger alert system to notify parents of nearby immigration enforcement activities, as well as more school staff available to assist students who immigrated to the U.S. alone.
“I think it’s great the superintendent supports students and the district deserves credit,” Miranda said, noting that the union has long pushed for these measures. “It’s been beautiful to see the community come together to protect our democracy. … It’s not OK for students to go into hiding and therefore not have access to school.”
‘My job is to teach kids’
Rodriguez, who teaches at NYU’s Steinhardt School, has extensively researched schools and immigration. She’s not surprised Los Angeles Unified has been a leader in supporting students after immigration enforcement spiked in Los Angeles. Public schools in Chicago, where Trump has recently ordered an immigration crackdown, have also taken extra measures to protect families.
But even school districts in conservative areas have taken steps to protect immigrant students, Rodriguez said. Their superintendents might not be as outspoken, and they might use different terminology and strategies, but the services and commitment to students’ welfare are there, she said.
Patricia Gandara, an education professor at UCLA, agrees.
“Our research has shown that superintendents in red states might be thinking, ‘I don’t disagree with Trump’s policies, but my job is to teach kids,’” Gandara said. “In general, superintendents everywhere are far more concerned about their undocumented students than you’d imagine.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091525_Mayra-Lara_ZS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-25 08:56:59.790469

Nineteen California campuses are still missing over $5.2 million in canceled humanities grants. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is issuing millions of dollars in new grants, many of which are in celebration of the upcoming 250th anniversary of America’s founding.


California colleges and universities are still missing over $5 million worth of humanities grants, despite one federal district court order to return funds to University of California campuses. For at least 19 other campuses, the money remains out of reach as lawsuits continue to challenge the Trump administration’s abrupt halt of promised funding in April, when the National Endowment for the Humanities canceled over $10.2 million to already-awarded projects in California.
Now campuses must scramble for limited, alternative funding if they want to keep their projects alive.
For students like Kathleen Boswell, a teaching credential student at Cal State San Bernardino, the loss affects their professional advancement. Boswell and fellow teaching credential students were ready to participate in the first cohort of the “Inland Empire Project,” originally to launch this fall. This project would have provided training and curriculum for current and prospective K-12 teachers to use local history to talk about national topics, such as world wars. Boswell especially looked forward to testing new approaches to connect students with American history.
“Kids get really excited when history is in their grasp,” she said. “If they can connect to local history, they can connect to the broader scope of history. It’s a domino effect.”

President Trump announced plans to gut the National Endowment for the Humanities in his most-recent budget, starting with cutting two-thirds of the agency’s staff. The agency is the largest public funder of the humanities nationwide, created alongside the National Endowment for the Arts after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act into law in 1965. The law asserts that the arts are vital to democracy. Ever since, NEH awards represent a coveted prize in the humanities field. 
Earlier this year, the agency announced major ideological shifts for the types of projects it would support to comply with the president’s executive orders. Those orders aim to eliminate federal funding for programs that promote such ideals as diversity, gender equity, and environmental justice.
During the first three days of April, letters went out to most NEH grant recipients stating that their funding was terminated. A letter sent on April 2 to Cal State San Bernardino states that, “NEH has reasonable cause to terminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda.” The termination was effective immediately.
CalMatters reached out to all 29 California campuses that had ongoing NEH-funded projects at that time, as listed on the federal grant tracker USA Spending. CalMatters found that every California campus but one had their funding cut by confirming with public information officers at each college and checking the American Historical Association’s database of terminated NEH grants. 
The only campus spared, the California Institute of Technology, confirmed its funding for the Einstein Papers Project remained intact. The collection houses more than 90,000 of Albert Einstein’s written records.
Terminated projects covered a wide variety of topics, from digitizing the history of Catherine the Great at the University of Southern California to the creation of a minor in human rights and border studies at San Diego State University. Some colleges were in the midst of their project spending when they received the news, while others were slated to start in the upcoming months. Canceled grants ranged from about $23,000 to over $500,000. USC’s canceled projects totaled over $1.2 million. 
UC researchers then sued federal agencies. In that case, Thakur v. Trump, a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction in June ordering the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Endowment for the Humanities to reinstate grants to the UCs that were not given a grant-specific explanation as to why they were chosen for termination. That case is still ongoing.
Two other lawsuits over the grant cancellations have been filed by humanities groups on behalf of thousands of individual and institutional members. One lawsuit is led by The Author’s Guild and the other by the American Council of Learned Societies. Although the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York consolidated the two cases, the federal judge in both cases granted a preliminary injunction against the NEH in July only for The Author’s Guild case. However, the judge did not order the grants be returned, but instead be held until the case is tried.
As for the other lawsuit led by the American Council of Learned Societies, along with the American Historical Association and Modern Language Association of America, the same judge denied a preliminary injunction, stating they lack standing to sue the NEH for making such institutional cuts as firing employees and discontinuing programs. A hearing in the case is scheduled for today.
Over 40 universities and research institutions in California are members of the American Historical Association, including Cal State Bakersfield, which had to cancel its “California Dreamin’” project.
Jennifer Self, the university spokesperson, told CalMatters in an email that “at this point, the money is on pause and has not been reinstated and everyone is waiting for how this will play out.” Cal State Bakersfield had been awarded $183,000 for a partnership with Bakersfield College to bring high school teachers from around the country to visit historic sites and learn about the history of immigration and agriculture in the Central Valley. Teachers had already been sent their acceptance letters for the workshop when the funding was cut and the project had to be canceled.
Humanities projects take a huge hit
When Michelle Lorimer, the historian and professor at Cal State San Bernardino leading the Inland Empire Project, received the termination notice, she was devastated. For Lorimer, this award represented several months of research, gathering educators and establishing specific programming and curriculum goals. She says the experience has changed the way she looks at federally funded grants.
“I’m not going to apply for federal funding right now for the work that we’re doing. That would be a waste of time,” Lorimer stated. “ It’s really time-consuming writing these applications, so honestly it would need to be something that I’d feel confident that we’d have a shot at — not something I’m trying to pigeonhole our work into.”
The NEH initially approved the Inland Empire Project for nearly $150,000 to roll out over a period of three years. The project was to create a framework of teaching that uses local history as a method to demonstrate broader U.S. historical topics, such as segregation, redlining and environmental injustice. Teachers in local schools, as well as aspiring history teachers from Cal State San Bernardino, would have received this curriculum and tools to use in classrooms.

Lorimer has looked for alternative funding, but grants of this size are rare and she anticipates that private grants will only get more competitive. Certain private grants are by invite only. Lorimer said that although her college is a member of the American Historical Association, she is not getting her hopes up that the funds might be returned.
Michael Kerp, an assistant professor at Cal State San Bernardino, had planned to create curriculum about the Salton Sea, focusing on environmental and civil rights. He said that the cuts don’t just hurt the university, but the surrounding community. 
“There are thousands of high school students who would have benefited from learning about their communities, understanding how to make change in their communities and working closely with their teachers and local leaders in the region,” Kerp said. “Underserved school districts had this opportunity, and now it’s gone.”
Kerp plans on helping Lorimer downsize the project, and has been able to secure some smaller philanthropic funding through the university. He agrees that applying for future federal funding under the current administration is likely a waste of time. 
Other projects halted include $171,000 for an institute at San Jose State open to K-12 teachers, librarians, and administrators highlighting the immigrant experience through history and literature. Another project was awarded to Saint Mary’s for over $50,000 for an architectural and engineering assessment of the Saint Mary’s College Museum of Art building with the goal of someday making it the first carbon-neutral building on campus while preserving their collections.

Despite Trump’s calls to dismantle the NEH, the organization announced on Sept. 15 it is awarding $10.4 million, the largest single grant it has ever awarded, to the New York-based Jewish organization Tikvah to “examine Jewish history, culture and identity in the broader context of Western history,” according to a NEH press release. In August, the NEH also announced that it merged seven grantmaking offices into four divisions and appointed new heads to those divisions. 
Since May, the agency has also allocated over $44 million in grants to universities and organizations for research and preservation projects, including for an initiative called “A More Perfect Union,” which celebrates the upcoming 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 2026. Three California private universities have received these new grants.
Two awards were given to the University of Southern California — $60,000 for the development of a book on the history of Jerusalem from 1099–1187 and over $249,000 to process and digitize historical archives relating to Southern California’s first African American Baptist church. The university had four NEH projects spanning over $1 million cut in the spring for programs including a history project that would have created an augmented reality of a long-lost Chinatown area of Los Angeles. Another project would have funded 18 academic conversations between humanities experts and the public regarding the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and reframing the conversation in a way that is inclusive of underrepresented groups like Native Americans. 
A single award was given to National University, a private nonprofit university located in San Diego, in the amount of $100,000 for a project titled, “Legacies of War: Memorials and Memories of the American Civil War & the Vietnam War.” Pepperdine University, a private Christian university located in Malibu, also received $30,000 for a project focused on the role of Christianity and the bible in the “American founding.” 
Given the new executive orders limiting the scope of what is now acceptable for a federally funded grant, the NEH website gives the following advice to prospective applicants: “We encourage you to read the relevant Executive Orders and consider whether your project’s topic — jointly with its goals, methodology, activities, and intended audience — seems allowable.”

Here’s what survived,Khari Johnson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/09/data-centers-california-electricity-rates/,"Most plans to regulate data centers died in the state’s Legislature this year, despite a nationwide backlash. Two surviving bills aim to promote disclosure of energy and water use.","In summary
Most plans to regulate data centers died in the state’s Legislature this year, despite a nationwide backlash. Two surviving bills aim to promote disclosure of energy and water use.




California lawmakers started the year signaling they were ready to get tough on data centers, aiming to protect the environment and electricity ratepayers. Nine months later, they have little to show for it.
Of four data center bills in play, two never made it out of the Legislature, including one that would have required data centers to publicize their power use and another that would have provided incentives for them to use more clean energy.
Two others are on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk, but in substantially reduced form. One mandates disclosure of water use by data center operators, although now in a way that may elude public access. Another originally aimed to protect energy customers from shouldering infrastructure costs driven by data centers but now merely lets regulators figure out if that is happening.
Data centers have the seemingly mundane job of storing and transmitting the contents of the internet. But the drab, largely windowless facilities are becoming a growing public policy concern. At least one is involved every time you watch a TikTok video or shop on Amazon. 
In recent years, demand for artificial intelligence, and especially new general purpose systems like ChatGPT, caused such server farms to multiply. That means more water to cool semiconductors used to train and deploy AI models and more power plants and transmission lines, leaving state regulators increasingly concerned about stress on reservoirs and potentially higher power bills for residential customers.
Those concerns are not confined to California; communities and regulators in several states have made moves toward transparency requirements or efficiency standards. Michigan in 2024 enacted a law to require water use disclosure and the mayor of St. Louis enacted new rules earlier this month.
California is home to one of the largest concentrations of existing data centers in the world, and more projects are on the way. Pacific Gas and Electric, the largest power supplier in the state, reported this spring that it saw a 40 percent jump in data center hookup requests. In July the California Public Utilities Commission voted to streamline data center project applications.
Protecting your electric bill
One of the bills now with the governor, Senate Bill 57, authorizes the state public utility commission to assess whether data center loads shift costs to other customers like renters and homeowners. 
Initially that bill from Democratic Sen. Steve Padilla of Chula Vista sought protections like those recently approved in Oregon and Ohio to ensure data center costs aren’t passed on to households.
But amendments by the Assembly Appropriations Committee in late August changed the bill to eliminate a special pay structure for data centers. A requirement that the commission assess how data centers shift costs to ratepayers was also reduced to an authorization, effectively granting the utility commission authority that it already had. Commission officials told CalMatters they’re using that power.
“Lobbyists for data centers successfully gutted the bill.”Adria Tinnin, The Utility Reform Network
The changes soured at least one early backer on the bill. The Utility Reform Network supported the proposal initially for its protections of small businesses and residential ratepayers. The group still thinks the governor should sign it into law to track the impact of data centers, but “unfortunately lobbyists for data centers successfully gutted the bill,” said TURN director of race, equity, and legislative policy Adria Tinnin. “It doesn’t allow us to do anything to actually protect ratepayers from the impacts of data centers.”
PG&E initially opposed the bill, but retracted opposition after changes last month. In August, with support from the California Public Utilities Commission, PG&E adopted a rule that requires new customers for large projects – two-thirds of which are data centers – to cover initial costs of transmission lines instead of passing those costs on to ratepayers. 
Big Tech-backed organizations such as the Data Center Coalition and the Silicon Valley Leadership Group continue to oppose the bill. They say the state public utility commission already assesses prospective projects.
Tapping in to water metrics
If signed into law, Assembly Bill 93 will require data center operators to share with their water supplier how much water they estimate they will consume when they apply for or renew a business license or permit. It also directs state agencies to develop water use efficiency guidelines and best practices for data centers, and for businesses to self-certify that they comply with them. It was written by Diane Papan, a Democrat from San Mateo and chair of the assembly committee on water, parks, and wildlife. An environmental group last year sued the Bay Area city of Pittsburg over a data center development, citing water concerns. A community group also raised the issue in relation to a data center near the Salton Sea.
The same Big Tech groups that are fighting the consumer cost bill are also opposed to the water legislation, saying sharing water use data could divulge trade secrets and harm the competitive edge of businesses.
Data center water use is a concern in part because many of the facilities are located in drier areas and can consume hundreds of thousands of gallons of water a day. From Southern California to San Jose in the Bay Area, roughly 17 data center projects planned in California as of May are in areas where water stress is high or extremely high, according to reporting by Bloomberg.
A Stanford University study released in April found that Los Angeles and Northern California rank among some of the most popular locations in the U.S. for future data center projects, alongside drought-stricken areas fighting over the fast-draining Colorado River like Phoenix and Las Vegas.
Water concerns have been a key reason behind recent opposition to data centers in  Arizona, Georgia, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia, said University of Virginia assistant professor Lauren Bridges, who tracks local and state data center regulation across the U.S. “Because we don’t have any information from the industry about specific site usage, it makes it almost impossible to know what’s going on and how it might impact them,” she said.
It’s unclear how much water is consumed by data centers and the AI systems within them, said University of California, Riverside professor Shaolei Ren, a prominent researcher of AI’s impact on the environment and public health. Google and OpenAI have claimed their models use only a few drops of water per query. A study coauthored by Ren, meanwhile, concluded that AI can consume roughly 16 ounces of water in a series of queries by one user in one sitting.
Ren thinks the proposed water regulation will help shed new light on the question while enabling California’s tech industry to continue to thrive.
But it’s not that simple, said Masheika Allgood, a Silicon Valley water activist who has spoken out against a data center project in San Jose and created an online tool to calculate data center water consumption.
An amendment to the bill tells data center operators to share their water use data with water suppliers rather than government officials. Allgood has found that data center operators and most tech companies don’t share details about how much water they take from local aquifers and is not sure water suppliers will either.  Without such data, it will be harder for people who oppose a data center to spark public discussion or organize their community.
“I can look up the applications, that’s public record, but giving it to the water supplier, I have to go to them directly and ask for this information,” she said. “That’s not transparency for people.”
Linda Gordon, an attorney and climate researcher for the UC Berkeley Human Rights Center, said she supports the proposal and legislation that increases transparency of any kind.
In ongoing work Gordon is conducting with Allgood on the environmental impacts of data centers, she’s found gaining access to water use data difficult, and that some water agencies refuse to share that data, citing a court decision decided roughly a decade ago. Since nothing in Papan’s bill specifically addresses whether the data will be available to the public, it’s unclear whether the disclosure in the bill will help inform researchers, journalists and communities concerned about the water consumption of data centers.
She hopes that language in the law that requires the California Department of Water Resources develop efficiency standards will in turn empower local agencies to develop ways to evaluate  the water use footprint of a data center and whether they ought to approve or deny a project.
“More disclosure is great but how that information gets used is also important to understand if it will actually make a difference,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021025-Data-Center-GM-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-25 08:56:59.790469
,California,2025-09-25 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Trump made a fact-free case against cashless bail with no authority to scrap it,Robert Greene,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/trump-cashless-bail-california/,President Trump is threatening to withhold federal funding unless states and local jurisdictions that have taken cash bail off the table reinstate it.,"Of all our presidents, is Donald Trump the foremost expert on bail? If it’s a matter of personal experience, then yes.
Two years ago he paid $20,000 to a bail bond agent in Atlanta to avoid being locked up in Fulton County Jail pending trial on racketeering charges and more than a dozen other counts in connection with his alleged attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. 
No other president has had such an intimate encounter with the pretrial justice system.
But he still doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
That became clear last month when he issued two executive orders purporting to abolish what he calls “cashless bail.” One order applies to the District of Columbia, which is now being patrolled by National Guard troops under Trump’s direction.
The other bail decree supposedly covers every other U.S. jurisdiction — thousands of them — where people are accused of crimes and arrested.
We’ve now passed the 30-day period that Trump gave his team to submit a list of cities, counties and states that have “substantially eliminated cash bail as a potential condition of pretrial release from custody” for several broad categories of crime. 
Will California be on the list? Maybe, maybe not. Could Trump compel California and its 58 superior courts to change their pretrial release protocols? The answer ought to be no, but so many people and institutions — law firms, universities, Congress, television networks — have shamefully and unnecessarily bent to Trump’s will that it’s hard to say. 
Like every state, California has its own constitution, its own courts and its own rules on money bail. Those rules are complex. They’re different in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento from the rest of the state. And the rules are different for the two times bail can be set: the two or three days between a suspect’s arrest and their first court appearance, and the period leading up to trial, which could be weeks, months or even years later.
California’s practices also have been reshaped by recent voter and court action and may be further affected by a state Supreme Court ruling expected any day now.
Trump has no authority to butt into any of this. But he’s butting in anyway, by threatening to withhold federal funding unless states and local jurisdictions that have taken cash bail off the table reinstate it. 
Trump’s basic premise, although demonstrably false, appears to be that money and the fear of losing it will make potentially dangerous people alter their behavior. He may believe, as do many in law enforcement, that criminal defendants will show up for all their court dates and avoid misconduct to protect their pocketbooks. Defendants with no money at stake presumably would have nothing to lose and therefore put the rest of us at risk because, as Trump said, “they know our laws will not be enforced.” 
For proof, he cited a report prepared by the Yolo County District Attorney’s Office and promoted by District Attorney Jeff Reisig. The report looked at 100 people let out of jail without paying bail during the COVID emergency and compared their subsequent arrest records with 100 people who were released after paying bail in prior years.
A succession of criminologists has refuted the Yolo report in court testimony, declarations and articles, criticizing its methodology and offering numerous peer-reviewed studies finding no evidence that putting up money as a condition of release has any effect on pretrial behavior.
But proponents of money bail have made sure that it’s the faulty Yolo report, and not the peer-reviewed data and studies, that makes it to the desks of news editors. And, apparently, the White House. 
How bail actually works
Rooted in medieval England, money bail historically has served a single purpose — to guarantee that a defendant appears in court for trial and all the required pretrial hearings. U.S. courts now also impose bail in an attempt to protect witnesses and the community from risky defendants.
Most people released on bail, like Trump in 2023, never actually pay bail. They pay a fee, typically 10%, to a bail bond agent, who pledges the full amount to the court. If Trump’s racketeering trial were to go forward, there would be nothing he could do — no number of court appearances, no agreements to stop saying nasty things on social media or anything else — that would get him his $20,000 fee back. As with any other defendant who paid a private bond agent, there was no monetary incentive that would have affected his behavior before trial.
If instead of hiring a bond agent, Trump had pledged or paid the full $200,000 bail amount to the court, he’d get it all back after showing up for trial. In the relatively rare case of a defendant posting the full bail amount, that theoretically is a monetary incentive to not flee.
In fact, most people who don’t show up for trial aren’t desperate crooks on the lam; they’re defendants living on the economic or social margins who were distracted by medical appointments or childcare or mental health crises or, perhaps, they just need the kind of reminder that dentists send their patients. Or a ride to the courthouse.
Santa Clara County pioneered a pretrial services program that helps defendants get to court. Under the 2021 California budget bill, the Judicial Council offers funds to other counties to do similar work. Los Angeles’ program was developed alongside an entire complex of programs to promote “care first; jail last.”
Does a defendant who paid the full bail or a fee to a bail bond agent have a monetary incentive not to be arrested for another crime? The crux of the Trump bail order is that the presumed answer is “yes” — but the actual answer is “no.”
Unlike failure to appear, being arrested does not result in a defendant losing bail money. How could it? An arrest while awaiting trial is not proof of misbehavior. Until conviction, it is only an accusation by the government. In the United States, a defendant cannot be penalized, thank goodness, based merely on an accusation.
It is understandable, although ironic, that the same defendant can indeed be returned to jail upon that second arrest because he or she is no longer considered a low risk to public safety. The law does not consider jail before trial to be a punishment, but merely a safeguard.

A person who posts money bail and is free before trial is in exactly the same position as a person who is free without posting bail. Neither has more or less incentive than the other to behave or misbehave. Paying bail and then losing it doesn’t protect anyone. 
As is the case with many proponents of money bail, Trump’s purpose may be only ostensibly to alter the defendant’s behavior while awaiting trial. The actual purpose is more likely to keep people locked up, whether or not they pose any risk of fleeing or causing public harm.
California eliminated money bail in 2018, but the legislation was overturned two years later in a referendum funded by the bail bond industry and backed, as is often forgotten, by reformers who feared that the state would end up like the federal justice system, where people are locked up who could have been safely released before trial.
In the landmark 2021 case of In re Humphrey, the California Supreme Court ruled that defendants could not be held before trial solely because they could not afford bail. The court has yet to consider how to reconcile the state constitutional right to bail with a provision of Marsy’s Law, a 2008 victims rights ballot measure that requires judges to primarily consider public safety when settling bail. A ruling on the follow-up case, In re Kowalczyk, is expected soon.
California’s differing, two-phase approach
In the meantime, lawsuits in three counties have sharply reduced the use of cash bail after arrest but before arraignment (the defendant’s first appearance in court).
Observers in many other states are puzzled by California’s two-phase bail system. In Philadelphia, for example, almost immediately after arrest a defendant appears before a judge — often by video — to enter a plea and make a case for release without bail, or at least a low bail amount. Except for the video appearance, this is how it works in most TV police procedurals like “Law and Order.”
But it’s not how it works in California, where defendants’ rights to a defense lawyer, an impartial judge and pretrial release are merely theoretical for at least the first 48 hours. During that time, police check the bail schedule, refer defendants to a list of bail bond agents and, if they can’t pay right away, send them to jail. They don’t see a judge, can’t argue for release and usually don’t even meet their public defender until two or three days later, when they have the first chance to enter their plea. At that point, the judge may set bail all over again.
After a lawsuit challenged the process in Los Angeles County, the L.A. Superior Court adopted a new protocol for the pre-arraignment period. Defendants still don’t see judges during that time. But judges, working from home, review the circumstances of the arrest and any criminal records and decide whether to hold or release the defendants without bail. People accused of violent or serious crimes are not eligible for the program yet still can go free immediately if they pay bail.
Lawsuits in San Francisco and Sacramento have led to similar modest changes in the pre-arraignment phase. It’s not clear whether those jurisdictions will end up on Trump’s list of punishable “cashless bail” jurisdictions.
What is Trump playing at?
Except in Illinois, which completely swept away cash bail and now releases or retains people based on their risk of fleeing or of being a threat to public safety, and a few other states like New Jersey and New York, where cash bail remains the exception — Americans continue to enjoy many of their constitutional rights only in proportion to how much money they have.
Defendants with a lot of money can post a lot of cash but get it all back at the end of trial. Those with just a little cash must pay a nonrefundable bail bond agent fee, and those with no money go to jail — and lose their jobs for failure to come to work, or their apartments for being unable to pay their rent, or their children for not being on hand to care for them. Many plead guilty rather than fight the charges, just to go home. Now with criminal convictions, their prospects in life are greatly diminished.
Why does Trump want this?
It may be because, like most Americans, he is clueless about how bail works. Or it could be because, like many police and prosecutors, he believes the justice system taught in school is just a fairy tale and the real system is meant to impose punishment from the moment of arrest,  except for people with money.
Or he could be planning to lock up people just for protesting. It is noteworthy that his executive order listing crimes that should require money bail includes, along with violent and sexual crimes, “vandalism.”
Or it could be that he just considers bail reform to be “woke,” and therefore something to wreck.
None of that is especially surprising.
What is surprising is that so many liberal Americans buy the groundless argument that people who leave jail without paying a bail bond agent are somehow more dangerous than their counterparts who pay. And that their constitutional rights aren’t worth fighting for.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/11022022-Bail-Bonds-RL-CM-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-25 08:56:59.790469

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill still remembers one of the most difficult calls of his time as a public prosecutor. It was an elderly woman with a severely mentally ill adult child. 
Without access to many resources and feeling increasingly exhausted as she and her husband got older, she asked an unimaginable question — what felonies could her son commit to get help from the county’s mental health court?
“That experience reminded me, early on, the impact of mental illness, not only on families and loved ones, but how broken our institutional support had been,” Gill said during a criminal justice and mental health symposium on Wednesday.

The largest mental health facilities in the U.S. are New York City’s Rikers Island, Twin Towers Jail in Los Angeles and Cook County Jail in Chicago, demonstrating that the criminal justice system is a critical mental health provider, Gill said. 
There is a disproportionate presence of people with mental illnesses in jail, compared to the general population, Gill said. And nearly 25% of all police shootings involve an encounter with a mentally ill person — but that’s a number he said he may contest, since in his experience overseeing reviews of over 150 officer-involved shootings in the last 15 years, Gill believes that percentage has been higher.
In this scenario, and with underfunded mental health centers and a reliance on low-level courts to manage mentally ill offenders, Gill said the state needs to think about the resources it puts forward for the federally-proposed expansion of civil commitment. 
Utah’s new homeless campus should have 300-plus beds for civil commitment, board chair says

Utah is already studying ways to increase its number of civil commitment beds, with a proposal to add over 300 beds to the state’s new homeless services campus in northwest Salt Lake City, a measure that could be a step for the state’s response to Trump administration’s controversial “Ending Crime And Disorder On America’s Streets” order.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has also called for a mental health expansion in the state, arguing there should be more resources for patients “who are killing themselves slowly on our streets.”
With the lack of infrastructure to serve this population, it should come as no surprise that many patients who have lost shelter and access to medications may drink in excess or use illicit drugs, Gill said.
“The criminalization of public health issues became our norm. You and I would not criminalize somebody with heart disease, you and I would not criminalize somebody for having diabetes,” Gills said. “Unfortunately, mental illness, driven by shame, stigma and fear, continues to be criminalized, even today.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Added to that, city justice courts, which handle low-level offenses like public intoxication, trespassing, disorderly conduct and camping, among others, don’t have the resources to address the complexity of individuals with mental illnesses either, Gill said.
Missing a court appearance, for example, could escalate a case, overwhelming the mentally ill population with a cycle of warrant after warrant.
“I think we need to recognize and acknowledge that systemic failure,” Gill said. “And please, when I say this, I am not trying to blame anyone. I’m just trying to share an observation, because if we do not honestly make an observation, we will never be in a place to effectuate the change that I know that all of you and all of us talk about.”
The county has also signed a contract with the Leifman Group — a consulting firm led by Steven Leifman, a retired judge who has developed substantial criminal justice reforms for people experiencing mental illness in Miami Dade County — to identify gaps in Salt Lake’s system.
“We really are focused on this work. And I’ll tell you, I’ve worked on it every day. Keeps me up at night. My brain is constantly thinking about it because I don’t like the outcomes that we’re seeing. And I also know that criminal justice is not the space where we want people to land,” Kelly Colopy, director of the Salt Lake County Human Services Department said.

But that uncertainty meant halting the program, which administrators are now trying to restart.
Upward Bound is a six-week program for students who come from low-income families as well as first-generation college students. The program provides students with tutoring, test preparation and college campus tours among other services.
On Sept. 18, Central Alabama Community College (CACC) President Jeff Lynn said he received a letter from the federal government stating that the institution will receive funding for Upward Bound.

“I can confirm we have been awarded $394,765.00 for this fiscal year for Upward Bound. We look forward to changing more lives for the better,” Lynn wrote in a statement on Monday.
That followed weeks of uncertainty. Before funding was secured, a Facebook post made by a parent on Sept. 4 showed a letter sent out by CACC Upward Bound Director Rachel Harmond stating that the program would have to halt operations for the remainder of the month.
“We regret to inform you that Upward Bound will no longer be able to provide in-school services, CACC campus events and or programming,” the letter said . “The program has been supported by the U.S. Department of Education, and due to delays in funding, we are unable to continue.”
CACC’s Upward Bound program serves students attending high schools in Talladega, Shelby and Coosa County. The program currently serves 77 students.
In a letter to Congress in May, Russell Vought, the director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget proposed slashing funding for TRIO and Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) because college is not “the obstacle it was for students of limited means.”
A message seeking comment was left with the U.S. Department of Education Wednesday.
Lynn said on Sept. 10, prior to the restoration of funds, that the program is needed to help schools and there were other federally funded programs offered that still had funding.
“The key thing is that we’ve got to touch all of the different students that are in the school system,” he said. “We do have funding for [Student Support Services-STEM], we just don’t have it for Educational Talent Search and Upward Bound right now.”
Kimberly Jones, the president of Council for Opportunity in Education, a nonprofit based in Washington D.C. dedicated to assisting first-generation, low-income and students with disabilities go to college, said in an interview the goal of Upward Bound and other programs under TRIO is to not only get students in college, but to help them complete it.
“I just talked to somebody and they told me they were an Upward Bound student, and when they got to college, they didn’t have a true [Upward Bound] program at their college but they found themselves having difficulties and they reached back out to their Upward Bound counselors for support, guidance and coaching to get them through the semester,” she said.
As of Wednesday, Lynn said CACC is still looking into when to resume Upward Bound.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/College-graduates-holding-diplomas-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-25 08:56:59.790469
,California,2025-09-25 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Longtime frenemies Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom reach career crossroads,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/kamala-harris-gavin-newsom-frenemies/,Harris and Newsom quickly climbed political ladders in California to ultimately pursue the presidency. At times they've supported or rivaled each other.,"Three decades ago, thanks to the patronage of legendary San Francisco politician Willie Brown, two young, ambitious politicians launched careers that have taken them into the upper strata of American politics.
As state Assembly speaker, Brown appointed Kamala Harris, with whom he had a personal relationship, to two well-paying state boards and in 1998, as mayor of San Francisco, helped her land a job in the district attorney’s office.
That career move led to her becoming district attorney in 2004, California attorney general six years later and a U.S. senator six years after that. After her four years in the Senate (and a failed 2020 presidential run) Joe Biden made her his vice presidential running mate in 2020 and, finally, endorsed her as his successor in 2024, only to see her lose to Donald Trump.
It was an extremely fast climb up the political ladder, from local civil servant to presidential nominee, but Brown’s other protégé, Gavin Newsom, was also climbing quickly.
In the early 90s, Newsom had founded a restaurant-wine-hotel business called Plumpjack, the title of an opera written by oil fortune heir Gordon Getty, whose personal trust provided early financial support.
In 1996 Mayor Brown appointed the young businessman to the city’s Parking and Traffic Commission, then to the city Board of Supervisors, setting up Newsom’s successful campaign for mayor in 2003.
Newsom wanted to run for governor in 2010 but stepped aside when former Gov. Jerry Brown decided he wanted another crack at governing California. Newsom, with obvious reluctance, ran for lieutenant governor and bided his time in the powerless office until Brown retired again, allowing Newsom to claim the governorship in 2018.
Now, a year after Harris lost her second presidential bid, the two politicians whose relationship has always featured elements of both mutual support and rivalry, find themselves at a crossroads.
Harris is promoting her book about the presidential campaign, “107 Days,” which digs into other politicians, including Newsom. She wrote that she tried to reach Newsom after Biden’s decision not to seek re-election but Newsom’s reply was “Hiking. Will Call Back.”
“He never did,” Harris added.
Newsom later told reporters that an unknown number popped up on his phone that day, and only later did he realize it had been Harris. “That exact same moment, was working with my team to draft a statement,” he said. “I assume that’s in the book as well.”
Harris’ book did not mention Newsom’s endorsement.
As Harris peddles her book she brushes aside questions about running again in 2028, but Newsom is no longer hiding his ambition to climb the final rung on the nation’s political ladder three years hence.
He already claims the role of Donald Trump’s most strident critic, trolling the president with snide and sometimes vulgar social media postings, and denouncing virtually every presidential decree.
Newsom is also sponsoring a November ballot measure, Proposition 50, that would, if successful, shift five California congressional seats from Republicans to Democrats to thwart Republican gerrymanders as the parties vie for control of the House of Representatives next year.
On Tuesday, Newsom took his crusade to a very friendly venue, Stephen Colbert’s talk show, fielding the host’s softball questions and running through his litany of Trump’s sins.
“This guy is flooding the zone, dominating the narratives. Facts don’t seem to matter, and Democrats, frankly, have had a difficult time pushing back,” Newsom told Colbert.
Newsom couldn’t resist taking an oblique shot at Harris for her losing campaign, without naming her. “As the Democratic Party, we have a lot of work to do to make up for our failures in the past,” he said. “We got crushed in this last election.”
The remark reflected what has been — and obviously still is — a decades-long relationship of frenemies.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/090821_harrisnewsom_AW_sized_36.jpg?fit=1024%2C710&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-25 08:56:59.790469

After a fight with a Black student in a St. Louis suburb left a white student badly injured in March 2024, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey blamed their school district for unsafe conditions, even though the incident occurred after classes and more than a half-mile from campus.

Bailey seized on the fight as evidence of what he called the Hazelwood School District’s misplaced priorities. He sent a letter to the superintendent demanding documents on the district’s diversity policies and accused leaders of “prioritizing race-based policies over basic student safety.” Bailey argued that the district’s dispute with local police departments over its requirement that officers participate in diversity training — an impasse that resulted in some departments leaving schools without resource officers — had left students vulnerable.
In response, the school board’s attorney said Bailey had misrepresented basic facts: The district employed dozens of security guards at schools where it could not assign resource officers, and even if it did have police officers stationed at the school, those officers would not have handled an after-hours, off-campus fight. Finally, police found no evidence that race played a role in the fight.
The attorney general’s office took no further action.
“He was just trying to get attention,” said school board President Sylvester Taylor II.
The legal skirmish was the kind of publicity-getting move that defined Bailey’s two years and eight months as Missouri’s attorney general before his surprise selection last month by President Donald Trump as a co-deputy director of the FBI, according to experts who study the work of attorneys general.
As Missouri’s top law enforcement officer, Bailey repeatedly waded into fights over diversity, gender, abortion and other hot-button issues, while casting conservatives and Christians as under siege by the “woke” left.
Bailey had pledged at the start of his tenure in early 2023 not to use the state’s open public records law “as an offensive tool” to demand bulk records from school districts in broad investigations — a tactic used by his predecessor, Eric Schmitt, now a U.S. senator. Still, he made frequent use of cease-and-desist letters, warning school districts that their diversity initiatives or handling of gender and sex-education issues violated the law.
Some efforts, like his letter to the Hazelwood School District, amounted to little more than a press release. Others ended in defeat, with judges calling his arguments unpersuasive or “absurd” or, in one case, dismissing them without comment. One lawsuit, against China, ended in a judgment against the country that experts said will likely never be enforced.
Bailey, who was sworn in to the FBI position on Sept. 15, did not respond to messages left with the FBI’s press office and with James Lawson, a longtime friend who managed his attorney general campaign and served in various roles on his staff.
Bailey’s actions as attorney general, according to legal observers, stood apart from the office’s core, nonpolitical duties: defending the state against lawsuits and handling felony criminal appeals. That work, by most accounts, continued as usual.
His Republican predecessors, Schmitt and, before him, Josh Hawley, also used the position to advance conservative causes, wage fights against progressive ones and raise their national profiles.
During his stint as attorney general, Hawley — like Schmitt now in the U.S. Senate — delivered a speech in which he claimed the elimination of social stigmas to premarital sex and contraception during the 1960s had degraded the treatment of women and promoted sex trafficking. And he fought to uphold state restrictions that threatened to shut down Planned Parenthood clinics four years before Missouri’s near-total abortion ban took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022.

Schmitt was named to succeed Hawley in November 2018. During his four years in office, he defended Christian prayer in public schools and sued several local school districts that had enforced mask requirements during the pandemic.
In 2022, he joined a small group of conservative attorneys general in withdrawing from the National Association of Attorneys General, a bipartisan group that had long coordinated multistate investigations in cases against industries ranging from tobacco to opioids. In a letter posted to the social media platform now known as X, Schmitt joined Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen in arguing that NAAG had taken a sharp “leftward shift” and that continued membership was intolerable. Neither Hawley nor Schmitt, through their spokespeople, responded to requests for comment.
Chris Toth, the executive director of NAAG who retired from the organization weeks after the letter became public, said in an interview that the claims in the letter were “completely unsupported by facts.” Republicans, he added, were involved “in every facet of the organization.”
The move reflected a broader shift in how many attorneys general now use their offices — not only to defend their states in court, but to score political points on the national stage. Few have embodied that strategy more than Paxton, who has often been described as focusing on culture war issues as attorney general.
ProPublica and The Texas Tribune have reported how Paxton has transformed the attorney general’s office into an agency that seems less focused on traditional duties like representing other state offices in court to one preoccupied with fighting culture wars. His office has increasingly used the state’s powerful consumer protection laws to investigate organizations whose work conflicts with his political views. At the same, he’s started increasingly outsourcing major cases to private law firms.
Paxton’s office has said most of the instances when it declined to represent a state agency were due to practical or legal limits — some agencies chose their own attorneys; others were barred by statute. He’s also argued that certain cases would have required reversing earlier positions or advancing claims he viewed as unconstitutional. He’s defended hiring outside law firms, saying his office lacks the resources to take on powerful industries like tech and pharmaceuticals. Paxton did not respond to a request for comment.
Bailey, though far less prominent nationally, fit squarely within this mold. Before leaving for the FBI, he spoke openly about protecting Missourians from what he called “woke” ideology and lawlessness from the left.
A former U.S. Army officer, he has often framed his mission in combat terms. In a podcast interview this year, he said that while conservative states generally try to limit the power of their attorneys general to “maximize freedom,” blue states have weaponized their offices.
“I mean, Letitia James in New York has every weapon in her arsenal that her general assembly can give her,” he said in the podcast interview. He said she uses them “to mess with people’s lives, to prosecute President Trump, take him to court in civil law to try to seize his assets and undervalue those assets.”
“Missouri is uniquely positioned because we were so recently a blue state,” he said, “so it’s like a retreating army has left the battlefield and dropped their weapons and we’re picking them up and learning how to use them against them.”
A spokesperson for James’ office said that “any weaponization of the justice system should disturb every American” and that it stood behind its litigation against Trump’s business and would continue to stand up for New Yorkers’ rights.
Bailey said in the podcast interview that he supported all efforts to investigate President Joe Biden, his family and his administration, and to uncover what Bailey called the truth behind the COVID-19 vaccine, which he said “seems to not be a vaccine at all.”
Bailey used his office to investigate the nonprofit media watchdog Media Matters for America after it reported that corporate ads were appearing next to extremist content on the social media platform X.
Stephen Miller, a top aide to Trump in his first administration, posted that conservative state attorneys general should investigate; Bailey quickly responded that his team was “looking into the matter.” Weeks later, he issued a “notice of pending investigation” to Media Matters and ordered it to preserve records. He later accused the group of using fraud to solicit donations from Missourians to bully advertisers out of pulling out of X, and demanded internal records and donor information under Missouri’s consumer protection law. In a June 2024 interview with Donald Trump Jr., Bailey described the probe as “a new front in the war against the First Amendment” and tied it directly to the 2024 election, accusing Media Matters of trying to silence conservative voices.
Media Matters sued and a federal judge blocked the investigation as likely retaliatory. In early 2025, Bailey dropped the case in a settlement and said he had not found evidence of financial or other misconduct by Media Matters. The organization did not respond to a request for comment.
When Trump was awaiting sentencing after being convicted in a New York court of falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments to a porn star, Bailey asked the U.S. Supreme Court to lift a gag order on the former president and delay his sentencing until after the 2024 election, arguing the restrictions kept Missouri voters from hearing Trump’s message. The Supreme Court rejected his request in an unsigned one-page order without explanation. A New York judge later postponed the sentencing until after the election, writing that he wanted to avoid the appearance, however unwarranted, of political influence.
Trump could have faced up to four years in prison, but a judge issued an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction in place but sparing him any penalty or fine. Trump said the conviction was a “very terrible experience” and an embarrassment to New York. He is appealing.
Bailey also fought to keep a woman in prison even after a state court judge declared her innocent. Even after the state Supreme Court ordered her release, Bailey’s office told the prison warden to ignore the court’s order. A state court overseeing the case scolded Bailey’s office in a hearing, saying, “I would suggest you never do that.”
Legal experts and other observers of the office said state attorneys general traditionally didn’t act primarily as partisan warriors. Most were focused on defending the state in court and protecting consumers.
Scott Holste, who served as a spokesperson for Jay Nixon, a moderate Democrat who served as the Missouri attorney general from 1993 to 2009, recalls a starkly different approach from Bailey’s. For example, in late September 2008, the top headlines on Nixon’s website focused on robocall rules, lawsuits over mortgage fraud and consumer tips for students.
“We were stridently apolitical in our news releases and in the way we operated,” Holste said. “Our job was to serve all Missourians, not to make political points.”
In the days before the August 2024 Republican primary, two of the three stories featured on Bailey’s homepage targeted the Biden administration over immigration and protections for LGBTQ+ students. The third highlighted a consumer-fraud prosecution.
To his supporters, Bailey is fulfilling campaign promises — a conservative acting like a conservative, said state Rep. Brian Seitz, a Republican from Branson.
Voters see a leader defending their freedoms by fighting policies such as diversity and equity, which they often equate with racism, and mask mandates, which they view as government overreach, Seitz said. “And,” he added, “we have a populist president who appreciates that.”
Toth, the retired head of the national AGs association, traced the shift in how state attorneys general act to the 1998 multistate settlement with the tobacco industry, when nearly every state joined a landmark deal that required cigarette makers to pay more than $200 billion, curb advertising aimed at children and fund anti-smoking campaigns. It also showed attorneys general how much power they could wield.
Over time, the newfound power has raised the profile of attorney general offices across the country, turning them into a springboard for higher office. That higher profile has fueled politicization.
Democratic attorneys general are no strangers to using their offices to fight political battles. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, for example, has filed numerous lawsuits challenging policies of the Trump administration on immigration, environmental regulations and federal funding. While Bonta maintained these suits were based on the law, critics characterized the coordinated legal action as politically motivated resistance.
Dan Ponder, a political science professor at Drury University in Springfield, Missouri, said that as the state has shifted to the right, the GOP primary, rather than the general election, is now the real contest for statewide office.
He pointed to actions such as Schmitt opposing critical race theory and reviewing public school textbooks. “That would have been unheard of 20 years ago,” Ponder said, “but now you can’t lose because you’re fighting the quote-unquote good fight.”
Peverill Squire, a political science professor at the University of Missouri, said that from the time of Bailey’s appointment to the position in January 2023, he probably had only two audiences. The first were voters he needed to defeat Will Scharf, a candidate already in Trump’s orbit, in the 2024 Republican primary for attorney general.
“And then once he secured his election, then I think his audience was really Trump,” Squire said.
Former Missouri Republican Party Chair John Hancock said voters seemed to reward Bailey’s approach. Bailey got nearly as many votes as Trump and Gov. Mike Kehoe in the 2024 general election — and more than Hawley or any of the Republicans who won the offices of lieutenant governor, treasurer or secretary of state.
“So obviously the work he was doing in that office was supported,” Hancock said. “I don’t take terrible shock when politicians do political things.”
Kehoe has appointed Catherine Hanaway, a former Missouri House speaker and U.S. attorney, to succeed Bailey as attorney general. Hanaway has said she intends to run the office in a different style. She told the Missouri Independent she had more interest in Medicaid fraud, consumer protection and violent crimes.
Her office said she was not available for an interview with ProPublica.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_1991-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-25 08:56:59.790469

Students see NSU’s curbing of resources for Hispanic and undocumented students as part of the larger push nationwide to rein in diversity, equity and inclusion programs by the Trump administration. And faculty say attempts to push back against the efforts has led to retaliation by university administrators.
Marcela Rodriguez-Campo, the former director of the university’s Office of Community, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion, resigned in August, citing the “discontinuation and erasure” of her department as well as other diversity programs.
“There are folks who had been building at the institution for a decade, who have now been blacklisted, been forced to sign non-disparagement agreements and have essentially had their voices taken from them for advocating for the continuation of these programs and for the needs of students,” she said.
Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, the U.S. Department of Education, determined to dismantle any DEI initiatives, has launched investigations into higher education institutions’ diversity related programs.
According to the Chronicle for HigherEducation, Nevada State closed its Office of Community, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion as of May 1, one of 403 college campuses in 47 states and the District of Columbia to do so this year. 
In an email, Maria Marinch-Gibbons, a spokeswoman with Nevada State, said the dismantling of the CEDI office was part of efforts that began in 2022 to reorganize campus priorities and “ensure the institution is prepared for future growth while maintaining flexibility to adapt to the changing needs of students, faculty, and staff.”
A newly formed Student Transition and Retention Office “is designed to play a crucial role in expanding student service, student peer mentoring, and cohort program experiences to all Nevada State students,” Marinch-Gibbons added in the email. 
The Current also emailed NSU seeking additional information, including: how many employees had previously been in the CEDI office or diversity related programs that were transferred to other departments; how many employees were asked to sign agreements prohibiting them from saying anything disparaging about school officials or administrators; and what is NSU’s response to concerns raised by faculty and students who said they face retaliation after speaking up against ending the programs.  
The university declined to answer those questions “due to the connection to personnel matters.” It did verify that “standard employment contracts do not include a non-disclosure agreement.”
Rodriguez-Campo said beyond the CEDI office the university is also ending or dramatically scaling programs such as Nepantla, which helped first generation college students, as well other diversity serving programs.
The cuts of staff and threats to jobs have disproportionately impacted on Latinas, she added.
“It’s been really heartbreaking, because many of us have so much love for Nevada State University,” Rodriguez-Campo said. “We are witnessing it be remade in a way that does not align with the values that the institution has said it believes in.”
One current academic faculty, who has worked for Nevada State for several years, said some faculty members were moved around into different departments but “a lot of people moved to roles they were not suited for.”
The anonymous faculty member said she understood if the institution wanted to protect itself from attacks on diversity and threats from the Trump administration but that the school’s leadership “didn’t have to go all in.”
“There is a sense we got from the (Nevada State) administration that people should be grateful,” she said. “In practice, people weren’t being treated like they were colleagues in this process.”
The attacks by the Trump administration on any sort of diversity or equity program has led many universities to lose federal funding. The administration announced this month it would withhold $350 million of congressionally approved funds to minority-serving colleges and universities and divert the funds elsewhere.
Broadly speaking, even conversations at Board of Regent meetings “where institutional leaders were direct and outspoken on what we value,” has shifted to a more cautious tone, said Molly Appel, a member of the Nevada Faculty Alliance and a professor at Nevada State.
The shift in tone isn’t unique to Nevada institutions, she said. 
“What we’re seeing is higher education being more focused on maintaining its existence than focusing on its reason for existence,” Appel said. 
But the example has been more apparent at Nevada State.
“I don’t envy the position our administrators are in right now,” Appel said. “They are dealing with a lot of shifting ground constantly. I think they do want to be protecting us ultimately. But I see the impact of the choices they are making.”
She couldn’t speak directly about how other universities like UNLV and UNR are responding to anti-diversity backlash. 
“I think Nevada State has really gone from being unapologetic about embracing and celebrating students’ diverse, racial, cultural and ethnic identities to tiptoeing around it,” Appel said. “What hasn’t changed is the dedication to first generation students and non-traditional students. That is still very much present in our mission. But the way we talk about (our mission) certainly has changed and there is a feeling of whiplash in many ways.”  
In a statement to the Current, UNR said it was committed to “fostering an inclusive, equitable, and diverse learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff” adding that the university is reviewing “policies and programs to ensure compliance with applicable laws while preserving the goals of access, opportunity, and support for students.”
UNLV didn’t respond to requests for comment. 
‘Character assassination campaign’
Nevada State University announced in a social media post in August that the CEDI office and its social media would become inactive. 
The university had been building a pathway toward dismantling all diversity programs since fall of 2024, Rodriguez-Campo said.
Faculty and staff leading various diversity programs were brought in last year to talk about the direction of those programs. 
“We believe that those conversations were intended for us to be able to provide feedback and play an active role in figuring out how we are going to protect our students at our institution and the work that we did,” Rodriguez-Campo said.
That wasn’t the case, she added. 
Instead of listening to those leading diversity programs, the administration focused on “reorganization” and began to “strip historic programs that had existed at our institution of their funding, of their staffing, of their spaces, of their resources,” Rodriguez-Campo said.
An email obtained by the Current that was sent in March this year by Leilani Carreno, the former Nepantla Director, showed when community members and Nepantla alumni were first informed the program would be “discontinued.” 
“We have built a community where first-generation students have found support, guidance, belonging, and together we have seen generations of students succeed and thrive in their academic journeys,” the email read. “I know this news may feel unsettling, and I want to assure you that we are fully committed to providing support to all current participants during this transition.”
Faculty who ran diversity programs began to voice frustration with the administration about the abrupt changes.
Those faculty were often met with a “character assassination campaign” from high level administration, Rodriguez-Campo said.
In one case, the university took away a staff member’s private office, put her in a cubicle to be supervised, and then barred her from being able to speak directly with students, she added. 
“The surveillance she was experiencing was really intense,” Rodriguez-Campo said.
“Any meeting that she had, she had to report back to her supervisor what those meetings were about and why.”
Appel believes the university, and its faculty, are still committed to serving nontraditional students core to Nevada State’s mission. 
But she acknowledged there have been departing faculty who told her they left because the “institution no longer aligned with their values or they pushed back against this change.”
In addition to attacks against diversity related programs in higher education, the second Trump term has included a relentless mass deportation campaign targeting undocumented people and reversing immigration policies, such as temporary protected status, for previously protected groups. 
Many of the students who benefited from diversity related initiatives also are affected by the shifts in immigration policies. 
“They need these supports more than ever,” Appel said. “They need a sense of affirmation. In some ways, they see their institutions tiptoeing around it and hiding.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nVStateuniversityphoto-1024x583.jpg,,,2025-09-25 08:56:59.790469

SB 20 is the most recent legislation filed by members of the Alabama Republican Conference that expands either the protection or authority of law enforcement.
Among bills filed on those lines for the 2026 session are proposals that make it a crime to refuse to provide law enforcement with information and require incarceration for a person caught attempting to evade law enforcement.
Some of the bills are ones that the Legislature failed to enact into law during the previous sessions in the quadrennium.
In the spring, legislators enacted a law that established enhanced immunity protections for law enforcement against criminal charges or civil lawsuits for alleged wrongdoing while performing their duties.
A message was sent to the Southern Poverty Law Center Wednesday seeking comment.
SB 20 leaves much of the current law intact, which already allows people to be charged with harsher penalties for those who cause “serious” physical injury to others or injure others using a “deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument.”
Under the bill, people could be charged with second-degree assault when they “cause physical injury to a current or former local, state, or federal public official during or as a result of the performance of the current or former official’s duty, he or she causes physical injury to any individual.”

(Lithium Americas video screengrab)The Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in Lithium Americas as it renegotiates the company’s $2.26 billion federal loan for the Thacker Pass mine project in Nevada.
Reuters reported on Tuesday the White House is requesting as much as a 10% stake in the Canada-based mining company in exchange for a modification to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) loan. 
Thacker Pass, a massive proposed mine in Humboldt County near the Nevada-Oregon border, is expected to become one of the largest sources of lithium in North America once operational. The project is a joint venture between Lithium Americas and General Motors.
Lithium Americas confirmed on Wednesday it was in discussions with the DOE and General Motors over the Thacker Pass loan, adding the company is working towards “a mutually agreeable resolution.”
Tim Crowley, vice president of government and external affairs for Lithium Americas, said in an email Wednesday that the company cannot comment on the details of its discussions with the DOE and General Motors, but expects “to provide an update in the future.”
The negotiations revolved around a modification sought by Lithium Americas and General Motors that would allow a longer repayment period for the loan after Lithium Americas missed conditions necessary for the first disbursement.
“In exchange for their minor modification, our minor modification was essentially for the administration to have some equity in the deal to create a cash buffer and eliminate some risk for taxpayers … we want some equity on behalf of taxpayers,” a White House official told Axios.
While Lithium Americas has offered to provide the U.S. government an equity stake in exchange for the loan, General Motors is proving to be a tougher sell, according to Reuters.  
General Motors invested $650 million in the mine, securing a 38% stake in the project. Under the agreement, the car company has the right to buy during the first stage of lithium production — but not an obligation to do so — which became a sticking point for the White House.
According to the Reuters report, the White House is now asking General Motors to commit to purchasing the mine’s lithium. The report said Trump officials are also asking General Motors to give up control over some parts of the project. 
The White House said the request for an equity position was driven by concerns Lithium Americas would struggle to repay the loan given low lithium carbonate prices created by softer demand and an oversupply of the battery metal globally.
The price of lithium carbonate has fallen more than 80% since its peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said the price fell from nearly $80,000 per tonne globally in December 2022 to about $10,000 per tonne this September. Analysts do not expect lithium prices to rally significantly any time soon.
The Trump administration’s interest in an equity position with Lithium Americas seemed to be well received by investors. Lithium Americas’ stock price more than doubled at one point following the reports of the U.S. stake.
The move is the latest example of the Trump administration seeking direct government ownership in Nevada’s critical minerals industry as the administration looks to strengthen its position in both domestic production and global supply chains.
The Department of Defense took a 15% equity stake in Las Vegas-based rare earth miner MP Materials in July, making the federal government the largest shareholder in the company. 
Nevada officials have said they expect more investment from the federal government in the state’s mineral supply chain, especially from the DOE and the Department of Defense.
“There is movement within the federal government to support critical minerals and mining and processing as a whole,” said Tom Burns, the director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED), during a lithium summit last week.
“I think you’ll see that in Nevada,” Burns said.
The Trump administration has sought a government stake in other critical mineral and semiconductor companies. In June, the Trump administration approved US Steel’s takeover by Japan’s Nippon Steel in exchange for the federal government owning a majority control of the company’s shares. 
Last month, the federal government also announced it would take a 10% stake in Intel in an effort to help boost semiconductor manufacturing in the United States.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)“We are the hottest country anywhere in the world, and there is no other country even close,” because “America is blessed with the strongest economy,” Donald Trump told delegates to the United Nations earlier this week.
“Under my leadership,” Trump gushed, “grocery prices are down,” and “growth is surging.”
“This,” Trump proclaimed, “is indeed the golden age of America”
Cool.
Let’s see him say that in Las Vegas.
Trump was inaugurated in January. Passenger traffic at Harry Reid International Airport has declined every month since then, for seven consecutive months. 
Barring a miracle, passenger traffic at the airport will be lower this year than it was the year before for the first time since the pandemic. The last time before that was the depths of the Great Recession a decade earlier.
For the sixth time in the first eight months of 2025, Nevada lost jobs again in August. Whatever job growth had occurred since the previous August had been washed away by job losses; the size of the workforce was the same last month as it was in August 2024. 
In other words, as of August, job growth in Nevada was effectively nonexistent.
Construction was the sector that lost the most jobs and drove overall job shrinkage in Nevada in August. “Mortgage rates are down” is another boast Trump made to the UN. But they’re not down enough to overcome a plunge in area home sales contributing to falling construction employment. 
Trump’s tariffs are also causing “extreme” cost increases for construction materials, and Trump’s immigration enforcement tactics are shrinking the supply of available workers, according to the Associated General Contractors of America.
During Republican Joe Lombardo’s first year as governor, the political action committee which exists to shore up his political career routinely issued statements saying things like “Nevada has experienced 10 straight months of employment growth under Governor Joe Lombardo’s leadership.” 
When the PAC issued that particular version of the statement, in October 2023, it was also true that Nevada had experienced 34 straight months of employment growth under President Joe Biden’s leadership. Though of course the PAC didn’t say that part. 
Biden’s gone, Lombardo’s not, and to reiterate, under Trump’s leadership, and Lombardo’s, Nevada has experienced employment decline in six of the last eight months.
And no, grocery prices aren’t down
Food was 3.2% more expensive in August than it was a year ago, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index Summary released earlier this month. 
That’s the highest inflation rate for food since October 2023. The inflation rate for food in August was also higher than the overall inflation rate for all goods and services, which was 2.9%.
To be fair, the inflation rate for what the BLS calls “food at home” — groceries — was slightly lower than the overall inflation rate, at 2.7%. 
But that doesn’t mean “grocery prices are down,” as Trump asserted. It means that — “under my leadership,” as Trump put it — groceries are on average nearly 3% more expensive than they were a year ago.
Meanwhile, the cost of “food away from home” was 3.9% more expensive than it was a year ago. And the cost of eating out at “full-service” restaurants (as opposed to “limited-service” ) was 4.6% higher last month than in August 2024.
So don’t eat out. Right?
Except that would make things worse.
“Accommodation and food services” is by far Nevada’s largest employment sector, accounting for more than 20% of the state’s jobs. 
At a minimum, more than 42% of the people holding those jobs are directly employed in full-service or limited-service restaurants, and not just those tasked with the care and feeding of tourists. In a metro area of 2.4 million people, it’s safe to assume those 2.4 million residents, not tourists, are the largest Southern Nevada customer base for food away from home on any given day.
As Las Vegas slips into whatever economic fate awaits it, the last thing it needs is the effects of slumping tourism and construction to be compounded by weakness in spending by locals brought on by food inflation, in turn jeopardizing food service jobs throughout the valley. But that might be what Las Vegas gets.
Donald Trump, come on down…
Albeit unintentionally, Trump has persuaded most of the world’s nations they need to put as much distance between them and dependence on the U.S. economy as possible, because U.S. policy under Trump’s leadership is a noxious brew of instability, arbitrariness, and fanaticism.
And having accomplished that task in a relatively short span of time, Trump has declared victory and moved on from economic policy — he never brags about his big beautiful bill anymore. Instead he’s focused on what he sees as more personally gratifying pursuits, like imposing a militarized police state in U.S. cities, silencing and/or punishing any and all who fail to hail his magnificence, and making Charlie Kirk’s birthday a national holiday. 
So even though there’s a tall building with his name on it in Las Vegas, Trump’s current awareness of Nevada’s economy may extend no further than tearing up already-approved federal loan conditions so as to snag his regime direct ownership interest in a lithium mine.
He should come to Las Vegas and make the same boasts about his economy that he made to the UN. 
No, it won’t cause him to reverse policies. Make no mistake, for the foreseeable future, Las Vegas is on its own. 
But it would be instructive to see if he can make people believe the bilge coming out of his mouth instead of what they see with their own eyes, and convince them the Las Vegas economy is great. After all, there’s no (well, less) tax on (some) tips (temporarily), so it must be, right?

The fight over health care for trans youth has come to New Jersey, with parents saying medical providers are denying needed care to their children. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Parents of children who receive gender-affirming care in New Jersey are urging the state attorney general to protect access to those services, as medical providers increasingly yield to the Trump administration’s pressure to cut such care for people under 19.
It’s unclear how many medical providers are taking this route. RWJBarnabas Health, the largest academic health care system in New Jersey with 15 children’s hospitals statewide, told the New Jersey Monitor that it recently stopped accepting new pediatric patients for gender-affirming care.
And in a letter earlier this month, seven parents told Attorney General Matt Platkin that Atlantic Health providers have alerted patients and their guardians that the system also might end or scale back gender-affirming care in response to President Donald Trump’s January executive order that threatened funding cuts for noncompliance.
Jane Buchanan of Maplewood said she signed the letter because the gender-affirming care her son, now 18, received at Atlantic Health over the past four years helped him overcome “very serious mental health issues.”
“Once he started receiving very supportive, very professional care, it just really helped him be a healthy, happy kid and get through high school,” Buchanan said. “This care is utterly crucial for our kids. The idea of it disappearing is terrifying.”
Gender-affirming care for youth typically involves mental health counseling and medications like puberty blockers and hormone therapy. It can include surgery, but a 2023 study found surgical intervention is rare for transgender youth.
Atlantic Health did not respond to the New Jersey Monitor’s requests for comment. Buchanan said the health care system, which oversees seven hospitals, also has not responded to a letter demanding answers that she and more than 500 other parents and advocates signed and sent earlier this month to Saad Ehtisham, who became Atlantic Health’s president and CEO in July.
Platkin’s office declined to answer questions and referred the New Jersey Monitor to a joint statement he and 14 other state attorneys general issued in February that says: “No federal law makes gender-affirming care unlawful. President Trump cannot change that by Executive Order.”
Since January, hospitals around the country have paused or ended such care, with 27 states enacting laws that limit gender-affirming treatment for minors. A judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order in response to lawsuits filed by both LGBTQ advocates and a coalition of states, including New Jersey.

In New Jersey, RWJBarnabas Health officials decided to limit gender-affirming care to patients age 19 and older, although current pediatric patients receiving hormone therapy or blockers may continue to do so “pending further updates from the federal government,” spokeswoman Carrie Cristello said.
“After careful consideration of the current federal landscape, including executive orders, administrative and enforcement actions, and U.S. Supreme Court rulings, and in alignment with other academic health systems across the country, we recently made the decision to update our gender-affirming care policy,” Cristello said. “Our physicians and care teams are working directly with patients and their families to provide resources and support as needed.”
In July, Attorney General Pamela Bondi said the Department of Justice sent more than 20 subpoenas to pediatric providers of gender-affirming care, vowing to hold accountable “medical professionals and organizations that mutilated children in the service of a warped ideology.”
Bondi did not specify which providers, and Cristello declined to say whether RWJBarnabas Health received a subpoena. The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, whose Gender and Sexuality Development Clinic is a go-to provider for many New Jersey transgender youth, was among those subpoenaed.
The uncertainty and cutbacks in care have distressed New Jersey’s transgender community.
Parents are afraid not only that children may not receive needed care, but they also fear a loss of privacy, getting dragged into legal fights between the government and health care providers, and getting prosecuted by — and possibly losing custody to — authorities who regard gender-affirming care as criminal abuse, said Del Sasso, a clinical psychologist in Middlesex County who specializes in such care.
“People in the community are very frightened that they’re compiling lists of trans kids and their families, and trans adults,” Sasso said. “All of my patients who are transgender, or have a transgender family member, have a plan to leave the country. Some of those are emergency plans that they’re hoping not to act on. But they range from that to people who have a plan that they’re leaving ‘in four months to X place.’ And I know many, many, many families who have left.”
Aisling MacDonald of LGBTQ rights group Garden State Equality said health care institutions should not let fear dictate care.
“We understand that health care systems are under immense pressure, navigating unclear federal guidance, media scrutiny, and real fear of political backlash,” MacDonald said. “But let us be clear: evidence-based, lifesaving gender-affirming care for youth remains legal in New Jersey. The long-term financial and ethical complications from ceasing such care far outweigh the short-term benefit of early compliance with federal whims.”
Sasso seconded that sentiment, saying ending this care for transgender youth is “extraordinarily dangerous.”
“This is absolutely deadly for our community. I don’t think that that’s hyperbolic. Perhaps that’s the goal,” Sasso said.
 Calls to codify care

In their February joint statement, the 15 attorneys general pledged to “continue to enforce state laws that provide access to gender-affirming care, in states where such enforcement authority exists.”
That’s not New Jersey.
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, issued an executive order in 2023 that protected access to gender-affirming care and decreed that denial of such care constitutes discrimination, saying denial of gender-affirming care violates the Law Against Discrimination, which bars discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
But New Jersey does not explicitly protect gender-affirming care by law. Several other states do, including Massachusetts, where Gov. Maura Healey last month signed a law shielding parents of transitioning pediatric patients from claims of abuse, neglect, or maltreatment.
Similar legislation that would essentially codify Murphy’s executive order and shield transgender patients and their parents from liability is already in the Statehouse pipeline in Trenton. It has widespread support, with 32 Assembly members and 18 senators — including Senate President Nicholas Scutari — listed as sponsors, but it hasn’t moved since it was introduced in June 2024. Scutari (D-Union) and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) did not respond to the New Jersey Monitor’s requests for comment.
Legislators are not expected to return to Trenton until after the general election in November, when all 80 Assembly seats and the governor’s race are on the ballot. Advocates like Louise Walpin have lobbied hard for lawmakers to come back earlier to act on the bill.
Walpin successfully led New Jersey’s fight to legalize same-sex marriage in both the Statehouse and the courts more than a decade ago. She finds legislators’ inaction on the gender-affirming care bill a frustrating missed opportunity, given that the state now has a “blue trifecta” with Democrats in control of the governor’s office and both legislative chambers.
“This isn’t business as usual this year. We’re living in a five-alarm fire, and with a five-alarm fire, you don’t wait to call the troops in,” Walpin said. “We should have the most power right now that we could ever have to fight back against the MAGA, Trumpian, authoritarian rule, and we’re not exercising it. We’re failing groups of people who are really most at risk.”
The protections Murphy ordered “could be erased by the next governor,” Walpin added.
“We don’t know who the governor is going to be or what their stance is going to be on it,” Walpin said.
Jack Ciattarelli, who is seeking to become our next governor, said he has concerns about “life-altering surgery” performed on trans minors. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican former assemblyman now running to replace Murphy, told the New Jersey Monitor that he supports parents’ rights to “do whatever they think is in the best interest of their children.”
Yet he said he’s “greatly” concerned about “life-altering surgery performed at a very young age.”
“I think the medical literature is starting to show us that people that may have had those surgeries eight, nine, 10 years ago are now feeling as though they wish they hadn’t,” Ciattarelli said. “I respect parental rights. But I think if the medical literature is showing us that there have not been good outcomes for people that had life-altering surgeries, eight, nine, 10 years ago, that’s something we need to take a look at.”
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Ciattarelli’s Democratic rival, did not respond to the New Jersey Monitor’s requests for comment. She has said she supports gender-affirming care but in December voted for a defense bill that bars such care for children of military families.
To Christian Madera of Millburn, politicians who profess to respect parental rights should have no say about the puberty blockers his 10-year-old son recently began taking under Atlantic Health’s care.
“In some states today, I have the right as a parent to withdraw my child out of a school lesson because I disagree with the content, but I don’t have the right to consult with a medical expert and follow protocols that are endorsed and supported by a number of major medical associations,” Madera said.
The American Medical Association, which represents more than 250,000 U.S. doctors, in June 2023 passed a resolution that calls for protection for this type of care.
Madera signed both letters, to Platkin and to Ehtisham. He said he publicly advocates for gender-affirming care because he believes education can help its critics understand “it’s not anything crazy or mentally ill.”
The puberty-blocking treatment his son is on is reversible and buys the family time for the child to decide at an older age if he wants to continue transitioning, Madera said.
“He has been very clear for a long time that he is a boy. He wants to grow up and have a beard and have a wife and be a man,” Madera said. “These are just normal kids who happen to have a brain that doesn’t match their anatomy. And medicine has always been there to help people when their bodies don’t serve them the way they need to, whether they need hormone therapy because they’re in menopause or they need IVF because they can’t conceive a child. There are all sorts of things where medicine intervenes, and this is just another thing.”

Communities in western North Carolina continue the recovery process. (Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)It’s been one year since Hurricane Helene first hit Western North Carolina on Sept. 27, 2024. With so many recovery needs still yet to be addressed and so little help from the federal government, it’s time for the state legislature to pass a budget that prioritizes people and stops cutting taxes.
Helene caused an immense amount of damage in a mountainous region that is not usually prone to hurricanes and flooding. All told, it’s estimated that the storm caused $60 billion in damage in Western NC, making Helene the costliest storm to ever hit our state.
Over the past year, important strides have been made to repair public roads and infrastructure, restore utilities, and expedite the process of rebuilding homes. Yet even still, as of September 2025, the combined funding for recovery from federal, state, and private sources is only about $15 billion. This means that 75 percent of the damage caused by Hurricane Helene remains unaddressed one year later.
Neither the federal nor state government has taken seriously the recovery needs of Western North Carolinians.
During past major hurricanes in the country, the federal government has typically covered between 40 and 50 percent of the total damage. For the costliest hurricanes like Katrina (2005), Sandy (2012), and Maria (2017), the federal government has covered about 75 percent of the billions in damage. In contrast, to date, the federal government has covered about 9 percent of the total damage caused by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina.
On Sept. 15, 2025, Governor Stein issued a renewed request of $13.5 billion in federal funding for Helene recovery. If granted, this would make a significant contribution toward addressing the outstanding $45 billion in damage that remains unaddressed. However, even in the optimistic scenario where Governor Stein’s request for the $13.5 billion in new appropriations is granted in full, we’re still left with over $31 billion in outstanding damages — about half of all the damage.
With so much damage that still needs to be addressed and the expectation that these sorts of extreme climate disasters will continue, one would figure that state lawmakers would be getting serious about ensuring that we have the funding that we need to recover fully from Hurricane Helene and prepare for the next major disaster. It’s all the more so critical in light of the actions being taken by the current federal administration, including sweeping staffing cuts at FEMA, cuts to essential FEMA programs, and the push to increase the responsibility of states in responding to climate disasters.
Instead, our state budget writers are pushing ahead with unpopular tax cuts for profitable corporations and the ultra-wealthy that will cost our state billions in revenue that is urgently needed to respond to community needs. When fully phased in, for example, the Senate’s proposed tax cuts would mean over $10 billion per year in lost revenue compared to today’s tax rates. Meanwhile, the House and Senate’s continued commitment to eliminating the corporate income tax will enrich out-of-state corporate executives and shareholders while doing nothing to help everyday North Carolinians like you and me.
This is money that could be used to address the many outstanding needs in Western North Carolina. Rather than giving handouts to those who don’t need them, we could instead:

Address Unmet Housing Needs: Provide housing stabilization services to those who are unhoused and rental and mortgage assistance to the hundreds of thousands of disaster survivors struggling to cover the cost of housing and are now facing the prospect of eviction, foreclosure, or displacement.
Support Small Businesses: Provide grants or forgivable loans for small businesses who lost the entirety of their revenue during the peak 2024 tourism season and who are still facing steep losses due to the lack of demand created by the storm. The insufficient direct support for small businesses in Western NC is exacerbating the difficulty of local economic recovery, impacting business owners, employees, and local governments alike.
Support Struggling Workers: Provide workers who have had their hours reduced or lost their jobs with employment opportunities funded by the state that contribute to the recovery effort.
Support Local Governments: Provide local governments with the funding that they need to restore the public infrastructure in their communities so that they don’t have to take our costly loans.
Invest in Resilient Infrastructure: Prioritize resilience in the rebuilding effort so that we build back better in face of future storms.

Of course, there is also no shortage of other, non-disaster related needs that we need tax revenue to address, like ensuring that all North Carolinas have quality health care, that families have access to child care, and that everyone in the state has food on their table.
State budget writers need to wake up to the reality that now is not the time to cut taxes. The people of North Carolina know this, but our elected representatives seem to have missed the memo.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Medicare enrollees in Washington may soon need to get additional approval before undergoing some medical procedures, under a controversial new program the federal government will test in a half-dozen states. 
The 6-year pilot program begins Jan. 1 in Arizona, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and Washington, and will rely on artificial intelligence to help decide whether certain care is eligible for coverage. 
It’ll be voluntary for doctors to participate, but critics still see the initiative as a sign of the Trump administration creeping toward Medicare privatization and are unsettled by the use of AI.
“This just is unfortunate and surprising news,” said Dr. Matt Hollon, of the Washington State Medical Association. “Patients expect their care to be guided by doctors, not insurance companies or automated systems.”
The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says the goal is to root out fraud, waste and abuse with Medicare, the federal program that provides health coverage to people older than 65 and younger people with disabilities.
Patient advocates, doctors, hospitals and lawmakers in Washington state argue that current forms of the process, known as prior authorization, have been frustrating and resulted in barriers to care. 
And they say they’ve gotten few details from the feds on the rapid rollout. 
For one, it’s unclear why Washington was picked. 
A Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesperson said the state’s inclusion is reflective of the agency’s “goal of testing across diverse practice environments to ensure a reliable and valid model test.” Washington has about 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries, about half of whom are enrolled in traditional Medicare and the other half in Medicare Advantage, according to the state.
The new model, known as Wasteful and Inappropriate Services Reduction, or WISeR, will work with third-party companies deploying artificial intelligence to decide if traditional Medicare enrollees qualify for certain outpatient procedures. Health care professionals will have to review any denials the AI technology makes. 
Procedures covered are those the federal government sees as too costly for the resulting medical benefit, or lack thereof. They include skin and tissue substitutes, impotence treatment, deep brain stimulation, cervical fusion, and knee arthroscopy for osteoarthritis, among others. Spending on expensive skin substitutes, for example, has surged in recent years even as their clinical value is questioned.
The CMS spokesperson said the objective “is to help patients avoid unnecessary, inappropriate procedures across a narrow set of services.” But critics worry this opens the door to expanding the practice to other procedures, possibly during the six-year pilot. They also contend it could be a step toward privatization. 
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., called it a “backdoor move by Republicans to privatize Medicare and let AI decide who deserves health care.”
“I will be opposing it every way I can in the Senate,” Murray said in a statement. 
The third-party companies involved will be compensated with a share of the savings they generate, stoking fears the decision-makers will be incentivized to deny approval.
“The use of AI is looking at this sort of aggregation of data, right? That doesn’t apply to individual patients and may not recognize an individual circumstance, and then they get paid to deny care,” said Hollon, a physician in Spokane. “It’s antithetical to health care.”
The CMS spokesperson said companies will face penalties for wrongful denials and slow decisions. 
Doctors will volunteer to submit prior authorization requests. If they don’t, their insurance claims will be subject to the traditional pre-payment review. The incentive for physicians is knowing that their care will be compensated upfront, instead of learning after the fact that it’s not covered. 
Jeb Shepard, policy director for the medical association, sees this as the “first foray” into prior authorization for traditional Medicare, and it may not always be voluntary.
How it has worked previously
Medicare Advantage, which includes Medicare-approved plans from private insurers, already deploys prior authorization, as opposed to traditional Medicare, where it has rarely been required. 
Most denials for prior approval made under Medicare Advantage are overturned upon appeal. But some patients don’t even know they can appeal, and abandon the care. 
Scrutiny over prior authorization increased after the killing last year of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, whose company contributed to a surge in Medicare Advantage denials. 
The companies participating in the new process will likely overlap with those already involved in Medicare Advantage’s unpopular review system.

Just days before announcing the WISeR model in June, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz touted a pledge from industry leaders to streamline and reduce prior authorization in Medicare Advantage. Insurers said at the time they hoped to decide 80% of requests within moments by 2027, erasing the delays that have frustrated patients and doctors.
“Hospitals do not oppose the idea of making sure that the care that’s provided is care that is needed,” said Taya Briley, general legal counsel at the Washington State Hospital Association. “What hospitals do get concerned about is cumbersome processes that essentially just slow the system down, make it so that it’s hard for patients to get the care they need, make it hard for hospitals to get paid.”
Dr. Bindu Nayak, an endocrinologist at Confluence Health in Wenatchee, said “prior authorization is part of every physician’s daily work, and it adds a lot of time.” This is time that could instead be spent working directly with patients, she added.
Meanwhile, the Statewide Health Insurance Benefits Advisors program manager at Washington’s Office of the Insurance Commissioner thinks WISeR could be a “net positive.”
“We’ll have a more definitive yes or no (if) Medicare is going to pay for it faster if the pilot works the way that it’s supposed to,” said the program manager, Tim Smolen. “So there should be fewer surprises for providers and for beneficiaries.”
Looking for answers
Last month, U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, led a letter with more than a dozen of her colleagues asking Oz myriad questions about the pilot. Washington Reps. Marilyn Strickland, D-Tacoma, and Emily Randall, D-Bremerton, also signed on.
As of Monday, Oz hadn’t responded. 
“This should be a bipartisan issue. The states are across the country,” DelBene said in an interview. “There should be concern about making sure that people have access to care in all these states and understand exactly how the models work, why it’s set up this way, what their goals are.”
An AARP spokesperson said the organization is “watching carefully” the implementation of WISeR.
“We are deeply concerned about persistent reports of fraud and abuse of Medicare that are draining the system of much-needed resources,” the spokesperson said in an email. “At the same time, the health care of older Americans must always come first, and nobody should be denied legitimate treatments they need.”
This year, Washington state lawmakers considered legislation adding oversight to the use of prior authorization and limiting the role of artificial intelligence. The measure didn’t make much progress in the Legislature, but will come back in 2026.
And at the federal level, DelBene has pushed a bipartisan bill to speed up the existing prior authorization process for Medicare Advantage enrollees and add guardrails to it.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/droz-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-25 07:56:36.030861

There are no criminal findings, per Gov. Mike Braun’s office.
Braun led the IEDC board of directors in a unanimous approval of the report’s release during a quarterly meeting Wednesday, at the Indiana State Library in Indianapolis.

He promised an “audit” in April, after Indiana Legislative Insight reported allegations of self-dealing and more among IEDC and its partners. In May, Washington D.C.-based FTI Consulting began work. The contract is worth up to $800,000 and extended for a year.
FTI Consulting’s proposal identified five “Entities of Interest”: the IEDC; the agency’s nonprofit subsidiary; Elevate Ventures; Applied Research Institute; and IIP, LLC.
“My focus is on solutions, and we’re fixing these issues to get better results for Hoosiers,” Braun said Wednesday. “… We have (been) and will be implementing new internal policies and controls to ensure full transparency.”
Changes include, according to a news release:

All votes must be taken by the IEDC’s full board of directors instead of in small committees.
The agency’s nonprofit arm — the Indiana Economic Development Foundation — will “wind down.” The shadowy foundation was placed on a spending freeze in April. It was created to raise private funds in support of the IEDC’s mission, but often declined to provide information on its donors and expenses. Also in April, Braun forced the foundation to release six years worth of audited financial reports required by the State Budget Committee.
Investment activity must “sta(y) in Indiana.”

IEDC’s board voted to allow Elevate Ventures to resume investment operations with the capital already loaned to the funds it manages on Indiana’s behalf. Those accounts include the Indiana Angel Network Fund and the Pre-Seed Fund.
The approval is “contingent upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the IEDC staff,” said Richard Waterfield, an IEDC board member and leader of various financial management companies.
Similar terms apply to a loan of up to $5 million, also approved Wednesday, to Elevate Ventures’ angel investment program. The State Budget Agency must also give approval, Waterfield said.
Just last month, however, the IEDC deemed Elevate Ventures “in breach of” lending language in all of its active loan agreements after defaulting on the angel investment program. The agency gave the troubled company 30 days to cure the breaches before it neared default on those agreements.
“Future iterations of contracts with partners such as Elevate Ventures and ARI will reflect these new policies and oversight controls to ensure full transparency and maximum value for taxpayer dollars,” the news release read. Braun’s office will also get an appointment to Elevate Ventures’ board.
“Indiana is a great place to do business, and with these additional accountability and transparency measures in place, it will be even a stronger place to live, work and raise a family,” Braun said.

Braun was scheduled to answer reporter questions after the meeting, but reversed course. Instead, he had to attend another meeting, according to his office.
Earlier in the day the Indianapolis Star posted a story detailing  how entities controlled by three men benefited handsomely from taxpayer-funded grants and no-bid professional services contracts: The IEDC under former Gov. Eric Holcomb doled out more than $180 million over less than six years in awards to entities controlled, either in whole or in part, by at least one — and sometimes all — of the three men.
One of those entities was Applied Research Institute, which is included in the audit findings.
Commerce Secretary David Adams additionally fleshed out a new vision for the IEDC.
“Our mission remains unchanged … but our approach is new,” he said. “(It’s going) from state-led to region-led, from fragmented with these various agencies to a unified commerce vertical, and moving from being transactional to transformational.”
Adams emphasized the importance of nurturing the state’s existing workforce — highlighting the administration’s modified employer reimbursement program — to boost productivity and wages. Another focus was homegrown entrepreneurship, in addition to the traditional wooing of big firms.
Under Braun’s administration, the average cost per incentivized job has decreased from $55,000 per job to $16,000 per job, according to the news release.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-25 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Entergy Mississippi announces largest grid upgrade in history,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/25/entergy-mississippi-announces-largest-grid-upgrade-in-history/,Entergy Mississippi's plan to invest $300 million to upgrade its power grid is designed to reduce outages.,"Entergy Mississippi announced plans Wednesday afternoon to invest $300 million into upgrading its power grid over the next five years. 
Speaking on a stage outside the company’s facility near Lake Hico in Jackson, Entergy President and CEO Haley Fisackerly explained that the investment, dubbed Superpower Mississippi, would mark a 50% increase in its usual power grid spending. The goal, he said, is to reduce outages by half over the next five years by installing stronger poles, increasing maintenance of rights-of-way, as well as installing smart devices and real-time monitoring systems.
The spending still needs Mississippi Public Service Commission approval, but two of the three PSC commissioners were on site for the announcement. Fisackerly, though, said the investment would have no impact on customers’ bills because of revenue increases coming new business from Amazon and other industries.
The CEO echoed past statements that new industries, including energy-intensive data centers, would not lead to rate increases for residential customers. Earlier this month, Fisackerly told Mississippi Today that two new data centers coming into its service area — one in Madison County owned by Amazon and another in Rankin County owned by AVAIO — would provide enough revenue to the utility that rates would actually go up less than they would have otherwise.

Fisackerly declined to say how much Entergy’s revenue had increased from its new industrial customers. 
“The fact that we can pay for an additional $300 million effort without increasing rates gives you an idea about the magnitude of that,” he said. “Think of it this way: We have a cost of business, and when you bring a larger user of electricity, we can spread that cost over a greater base. So they help reduce the cost to the other customers.”
 De’Keither Stamps and Wayne Carr — the Central and Southern District PSC commissioners, respectively, — spoke at Wednesday’s announcement in support of the project.
“It’s a step forward in getting to where we want to go,” Stamps said, emphasizing the importance of keeping rates affordable in areas with high poverty. 
Entergy is the state’s largest utility company, serving about 459,000 customers in 45 counties.  
At the PSC’s September docket meeting, Stamps called for an investigation into the company after hearing complaints from Entergy customers over power outages. 
“We’re not going to stop anything until the reality of the citizens changes,” Stamps said. “They must not have to live in fear when the rain picks up, and they shouldn’t have to live in fear that their water’s going to go out because the water in rural Hinds County (comes from) ground pumps.”

Fisackerly said the company continues to hold town halls to hear customers’ complaints.
According to an Entergy press release, the number of outages caused by fallen trees has spiked in 2025 because of dead vegetation after the 2023 drought, as well as recent storms and tornados. The release clarified that many of those trees are outside the areas the company can trim.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24163328/Entergy-presser-2.jpg,,,2025-09-25 07:56:36.030861

(Kevin Winter/Getty Images)Sometimes one event brings clarity to other, more ambiguous, actions. ABC’s indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel is such an event.
By threatening ABC over a comedian’s on-air comments, Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr violated core First Amendment limits on the government. And this event is simply the latest example of a playbook that has already been weaponized against law firms and universities.
The offending key line from Kimmel?
“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”
Whether that’s true or false, it’s speech.
When it comes to speech, the government’s legitimate responses are limited. It can argue, persuade and even criticize. But it can’t use official power — licenses, funding, investigations — to intimidate people or businesses into silencing views the government dislikes.
Two days after Kimmel’s show, Carr said on a conservative podcast that Kimmel’s remarks had been part of a “concerted effort to lie to the American people.” And, he said, the FCC is “going to have remedies that we can look at.”
He encouraged local stations — themselves FCC-licensed — to push back. And he left no doubt that he wanted action taken against Kimmel: “Frankly, when you see stuff like this — I mean, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”
Within hours, Nexstar, an owner of ABC affiliates with a $6.2 billion acquisition pending government review, pulled Kimmel’s show “for the foreseeable future.” And hours after that, ABC announced it was indefinitely suspending Kimmel’s show.
While ABC changed course within days, that doesn’t affect how we judge government conduct. Nor does Carr’s later denial that he meant to threaten anyone’s license; what’s important is how a reasonable license recipient would have understood it — and how it reveals the current government playbook.
Carr’s statements crossed a line clearly established by the Supreme Court.
“Government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a unanimous 2024 opinion in favor of the National Rifle Association.
It’s one thing for government officials to use persuasion. Persuasion sounds like, “we disagree, and here’s why.”
But when the person who controls your broadcast license enters the fray threatening action because of your speech, it’s not a clash of ideas anymore. It’s the government using leverage to get a result through means that violate the Constitution.
The Kimmel case provides a clear example of conduct that violates the First Amendment. But the government playbook in the Trump administration has consistently emphasized leveraging government benefits and threats to get other actors to do what the administration wants.
Pulling funds and threatening investigations has been brought to bear against universities across the country. Some have taken the government to court, often achieving court rulings that the government had overreached, while others have settled and still others simply worry and keep their heads down as far as possible.
Universities have many roles, but expanding knowledge and testing ideas are core principles — not enforcing the party line, whether it’s left, right or center. But when funding or political threats seek to force schools to change who can study there, what professors can say, or what programs can exist, students and faculty learn the wrong lessons: keep your head down, avoid hard topics and don’t risk speaking out.
That’s not what universities are for. Nor is it what we want from educators who are paid by taxpayers. Educators should be encouraged to share their knowledge and experience, not to hide it.
Similar government leverage has been used against law firms, often because of clients the firms have represented. Some firms have taken the government to the court and, once again, won court rulings. But others settled rather than risk damage to the firm or its clients.
The harm is to the public. Our justice system depends on everyone having a voice.
When government officials threaten investigations or contracts to make firms drop clients or arguments, there’s harm to the public’s right to have disputes decided on the merits. If the government can scare lawyers away from some clients, anyone’s rights could be the next to be in danger.
So where do we go from here? All of us need to remember that the rule of law isn’t just an abstract concept. It’s a promise that the same rule will apply even when emotions run hot or when your views are disfavored by the government. You need not agree with Kimmel, a university president or a law firm’s client list to insist that the government follow the rules.
In fact, that’s when it matters most.

The department administers the state unemployment insurance program. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)A change to unemployment compensation that would penalize people who receive federal disability payments has made it into a draft bill to revise Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance law — despite vocal opposition from Democrats in the state Legislature.
For people who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) income, the change would sharply reduce their jobless pay if they lose work. For many, it could wipe out their unemployment compensation entirely, according to Victor Forberger, a veteran unemployment insurance lawyer.
The SSDI provision is part of the agreed-upon draft legislation that was approved Wednesday by the Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council.
The council includes an equal number of management and labor representatives and was established in 1932 to give labor and management an equal voice in shaping the state’s unemployment insurance (UI) program. The council’s members negotiate and draft changes to the state’s UI laws every two years.
On Wednesday Forberger called the council’s 2025 draft bill “a terrible deal for workers.”
Less than a week ago, the Department of Workforce Development (DWD) walked back an earlier proposal to penalize SSDI recipients who apply for jobless pay. The return of a similar provision in the draft bill caught critics by surprise.
“I was pretty shocked when I heard about it this morning,” said state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee), a vocal critic of the earlier proposal. “I thought it was put to rest.”
The SSDI unemployment pay ban
Since 2013, under a law enacted in then-Gov. Scott Walker’s first term, people who receive SSDI income are automatically disqualified from collecting unemployment insurance — despite the fact that many SSDI recipients hold part-time jobs and would otherwise qualify for jobless pay if they get laid off.
In July 2024 a federal judge ruled that 2013 law violated two federal laws: the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. The ruling came in a lawsuit that a team of lawyers including Forberger filed on behalf of SSDI recipients who were denied unemployment compensation when they were thrown out of work.
This summer, the judge, William Conley, ordered DWD to stop disqualifying unemployment compensation applications simply because an applicant also receives SSDI.
In August, Conley ordered the department to reconsider the applications of people denied UI because of the ban since 2015 and to award them the jobless pay they would have qualified for without the ban. Conley also ordered DWD to repay applicants who had originally received jobless pay, then had it clawed back after the department belatedly found that they were also SSDI recipients.
Also in August, the joint labor-management advisory committee reviewed a dozen proposed changes in state unemployment insurance law requested by DWD.
One of those proposals was to repeal the 2013 state ban on unemployment pay for people on SSDI. The memo noted the court’s ruling invalidating the ban.
But that proposal also called for offsetting an SSDI recipient’s weekly unemployment pay by the weekly value of the SSDI income. The memo acknowledged that the proposal would probably eliminate unemployment compensation for most SSDI recipients who applied.
“In 2024, the average SSDI payment in Wisconsin was $1,500 per month,” the DWD proposal memo stated. “The average weekly SSDI payment for UI purposes is calculated at $346.20 per week. This weekly amount will in many cases fully reduce the UI benefit a SSDI recipient can receive.”
The memo concluded, “In summary, most SSDI claimants will not be able to receive UI benefits. While some may be able to receive UI benefits, it is expected that the weekly UI payment would be small.”
Offset proposal walked back — then returns
The proposal sparked backlash from Forberger and Democratic lawmakers. On Sept. 18, DWD submitted an amended version of the proposal to the advisory council.
The revision removed the offset provision entirely and called for simply repealing the ban on jobless pay for SSDI recipients.
The department noted in its amendment memo that the process of paying past unemployment insurance applicants under the court order had begun, and that those payments were being made without a deduction for SSDI income.
“The Department is amending its proposal to repeal the SSDI disqualification provision and remove the offset provision,” the Sept. 18 memo stated. “This will align with the effect of the court’s order that is now allowing claimants who receive SSDI to be eligible for the full amount of their weekly benefit without a reduction for any SSDI received.”
At the Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council’s meeting on Wednesday morning, the body approved a draft bill for updates to Wisconsin’s UI law on a unanimous vote.
The draft includes a repeal of the SSDI unemployment compensation ban. Despite DWD’s Sept. 18 memo, however, the draft includes language that claws back some of an SSDI recipient’s jobless pay.
“If a monthly social security disability insurance payment is issued to a claimant, the department shall reduce benefits otherwise payable to the claimant for a given week by one-half of the amount [of a] security disability insurance payment that is allocated for that week,” the draft bill states.
While the offset in the draft bill is half what the original DWD proposal called for, Forberger said Wednesday that even the 50% offset would likely mean no unemployment pay for many SSDI recipients.
Sinicki and state Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) introduced a bill of their own earlier this month to repeal the ban.
“Receiving SSDI should not prevent working Wisconsinites from receiving unemployment insurance if they’re laid off,” Dassler-Alfheim told the Wisconsin Examiner on Wednesday. “That’s why Rep. Sinicki and I have proposed legislation to remove that ban from state statute, and I’m really hoping that we can see it across the finish line and put this problem to rest once and for all.”
The draft bill is the product of provisions worked out by each caucus — management and labor — in separate closed sessions. The Wisconsin Examiner contacted two senior representatives in the labor caucus of the council for comment Wednesday on the process, but received no response.
“I’m looking forward to finding out how this language got in there,” Sinicki told the Wisconsin Examiner Wednesday afternoon.
“If that language is in there, it is in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and you know the courts have already said that. I’ve already said that,” Sinicki said. “And now they’re just going to end up right back in court with this. It makes no sense to me.”
Sinicki has long championed the advisory councils for unemployment insurance as well as for workers comp for negotiating legislation that represents the interests of both labor and management. She’s often chided Republican lawmakers who have authored and passed bills affecting either of those systems without going through the councils.
This time, “I’m struggling with it — I’ll be honest — because it is the agreed-upon bill,” Sinicki said of the unemployment insurance draft. “But first of all, as a Democrat and as somebody who prides herself in the fact that we take care of our most needy, I can’t vote for this.”
Sinicki said the legislation after it’s introduced is subject to being amended like any other bill, and that she would expect an amendment removing the offset proposal.
By tradition, the bill that comes from the advisory council is introduced under the names of the committee chair and the minority party ranking member on the Assembly’s labor committee — which is Sinicki.
Unless the draft is changed, however, “I will not be putting my name on this bill,” she said.

(Getty Images)Members of the General Assembly heard from consultants Wednesday about the potential benefits of setting utility rates over multiple years — rather than approving them annually.
Additional considerations include establishing performance incentives for utilities to accomplish certain goals, such as reliability. 
Nicholas Crowley, the vice president of consulting firm Christensen Associates, said he and his colleagues specialized in performance-based rate making and analyzing regulations across North America. 
 
Read the full report from Christensen Associates here.


Indiana’s current investor-owned utility climate follows a “cost of service” regulation model, Crowley said, meaning that utilities file their total service costs annually and submit that information to commissioners alongside rate requests. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission then decides whether or not to approve the rates requested that utilities say they need to recoup costs from the previous year.
“Economists have long criticized this approach as something that doesn’t provide great cost efficiency incentives,” Crowley said. “It doesn’t provide the utility with an incentive to really cut its costs as much as possible.” 
Rather, when costs for utilities go down, so do their rates. 
“It’s a situation where no good deed goes unpunished,” he summarized. 
But while Crowley had recommendations for improvement, it’s not clear when — or if — the state will adopt them.
Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford, said that while he anticipated legislation may be filed, it wasn’t quite “fleshed out” and might be “premature” to consider such a move in the 2026 legislative session. 
“I’m not going to carry the bill,” confirmed Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso. “Somebody is, but we’re going to crawl before we walk.”
The two lawmakers lead the Interim Study Committee on Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications.
 More on recommendations

Performance-incentive mechanisms and forecasted multiyear rate plans differ in their focus, with the former seeking to improve output efficiency — such as capacity or reliability — while the latter looks at input efficiency — such as capital, labor or materials. 
A multiyear plan sets either prices or revenues for three or more years without rate cases. 
“The longer the amount of time the utility has to manage outside of that rate case, the higher the incentive it has to keep its costs low because they want to earn a rate of return. And you can see why there’s risk involved,” Crowley said. 
Indiana kicks off hunt for new utility regulators as affordability outrage grows

Though this can take several forms, the one his firm recommended to Indiana was known as forecasted revenue, under which the utility would project its future costs and revenue needs. Though the utility runs the risk of potentially underselling their need, it can provide stable rates for them and for their customers while reducing administrative costs.
Utilities in Indiana can already do this to a more limited extent, known as “forward testing.” Under a multiyear proposal, a “reopener” can be scheduled to renegotiate a rate should a utility’s performance falter.
Performance-incentive mechanisms, on the other hand, allow commissioners to “ding” or reward utilities based on their results. For example, Crowley shared, utilities could be tasked with reducing their average service interruption times and could be fined if they fall below the benchmark.
“Especially in the state of Indiana, where you have all these service quality metrics, you don’t need to overhaul the current regulatory framework — just add a little bit of incentive power to the current framework,” Crowley said. 
But some standards could be “unrealistic,” he warned, such as saying utilities need to average zero minutes of service interruption time.

Seventeen states and Washington, D.C. have some sort of formalized performance-based regulation, Crowley said, with another dozen exploring such methods, including Indiana.
The above options allow for more “incremental change, as opposed to a complete overhaul of the system,” he said. 
Crowley explicitly opted not to include potential tools like price or revenue caps in the options for Indiana, due to the state’s vertically integrated system — which could make such choices expensive. Other places, such as parts of Canada or Massachusetts, have “distribution-only” systems that make such options available.
“We do have caps, but they are not hard caps and they are set by the IURC,” said Soliday. “If you break the cap, then you get additional scrutiny and the IURC can order you to bring them back. Putting a hard cap when you live in an inflationary and changing environment, the issue is: What are you trying to achieve?”
Soliday noted that the state’s aging utility structure makes it difficult for such corporations to adhere to such standards. He also suggested looking at recovery time for utilities after severe weather.
“We’re taking a hard look at the performance-based regulation that we’ve got,” Soliday said. “… And we have to look at it in the long term, not in the short term.”
Luke Wilson, the executive director of the IURC, concluded Crowley’s presentation by saying his body would recommend that the General Assembly “look at enabling the commission to establish performance-based rate-making plans for utilities.”
Doing so would be the next step in bringing the process to Indiana. Wilson also said the commission would recommend, “at least for now,” pausing considerations for multiyear planning.

Byron mother whose February murder-suicide shocked the state was taking ketamine at home against best practices, lawsuit alleges. 
The post Mother of Wyoming woman who killed children and herself sues over ketamine therapy, adding to legislative debate appeared first on WyoFile .","This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts, call or text the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.
The mother of a Byron woman who killed her four children and then herself has sued a psychiatric clinic in Cody, alleging improper use of ketamine led her daughter to commit a murder-suicide that horrified Wyomingites this past winter. 
The lawsuit, filed Monday, alleges that Sage Psychiatry Services allowed Tranyelle Harshman to take ketamine — a powerful anesthetic increasingly used to treat depression and post-traumatic stress disorder — at her home, against best practices for prescribing the drug.
The lawsuit dovetails with some conservative lawmakers’ growing interest in how psychiatric drugs are used in Wyoming, including more traditional anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications. (Harshman was also taking an anti-anxiety drug at the time of her death, according to the coroner’s toxicology report.) 
Harshman was in treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and postpartum depression, according to the lawsuit. 
After taking ketamine at home this February, the lawsuit alleges, Harshman shot her four children and herself “while in an altered or dissociative mental state.” The suit accuses the clinic of negligently assessing the young mother’s suitability for ketamine treatment and failing to monitor her use of the drug.
Lawmakers on the Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee held a hearing earlier this summer exploring whether psychiatric drugs play a role in Wyoming’s high suicide rate or in acts of extreme violence like Harshman’s murder of her children.

Health department officials, and practitioners, have in turn urged caution about drawing too sweeping a correlation between the use of certain drugs and tragic consequences. 
“This is sad on so many levels, but I don’t want to scare people away from ketamine, ketamine is a great drug,” Tracy Richard, a Cheyenne-based nurse who administers the drug in a clinical setting and opposes nearly all at-home use, told WyoFile. “We don’t know what happened with this person and there’s just so much that goes into this.” 
The attorney representing Harshman’s mother said the way ketamine was administered, and not the drug alone, drove the lawsuit. 
“The purpose isn’t to demonize ketamine,” Sean Olson, the Colorado-based attorney leading the case, told WyoFile in a phone interview Wednesday. “The goal here is to make sure this kind of thing never happens again. Ketamine is a dangerous drug and obviously it’s becoming more common in terms of its medical uses … it’s important to follow the guidelines so that it’s used safely.”
Sage Psychiatry Services did not respond to a voicemail from WyoFile seeking comment Wednesday. 
Ketamine was developed as an anesthetic, and its use as a therapeutic drug is a fairly unregulated area of practice, Shannon Hughes, an instructor at Colorado State University and therapist who advocates for psychedelics and drug policy reform, told WyoFile. There are a variety of ways people can get ketamine for at-home use, Hughes said, including through telehealth programs. But it is very much considered best practice to take it in a clinic and under supervision, she said.  
“These drugs alter your behavior,” Hughes said. “That’s what they do. And that’s why you need close monitoring when you start any kind of medication.” All psychiatric drugs carry risks, Hughes said, and many of those risks include suicidal or violent thoughts.

On the other hand, she said, ketamine leads to lasting improvements for some people who otherwise would be tied to antidepressants indefinitely. Therapists who give ketamine to their clients during sessions can spur lasting breakthroughs in addressing the root causes of someone’s depression, she said. 
“For some people ketamine is a real game changer,” Hughes said. 
There’s also evidence that ketamine can have “a significant therapeutic effect” at depressing suicidal ideation, according to an analysis published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature. 
Medical boards and other regulatory bodies may want to issue more uniform guidelines for the use of ketamine, Hughes said. “Until then, it’s kind of the wild west,” she said. Richard also described ketamine therapy as a “wild west,” and said the increasing ways to get ketamine for home use – a technique she strongly opposed – worried her. But she questioned whether Wyoming lawmakers were well equipped to take on the topic of psychiatric drugs. 
In the weeks immediately after the murder suicide, Harshman’s husband raised his own concerns that his wife’s toxicology report would give the public the wrong impression. “This isn’t a chance to demonize different therapies,” Cliff Harshman told a reporter for Cowboy State Daily, “this works for a lot of different people.”
Rep. Paul Hoeft, a Republican whose Park County district includes Powell and abuts Byron, is bringing a draft bill to the committee’s October meeting that would require the state to better catalogue when suicide victims or perpetrators of severe violent crimes have psychiatric drugs in their systems. 
Though that information is already often collected through coroner’s toxicology reports or law enforcement drug testing a criminal suspect, Hoeft seeks to create a centralized database to track correlations. 
“There’s some concerning associations going on between psychotropic medications and violent outcomes which we’ve seen recently, and which has prompted this lawsuit,” Hoeft told WyoFile. 
To his knowledge, lawmakers aren’t moving to regulate use of psychiatric drugs, Hoeft said, but instead want to gain more information about possible connections to violent deaths. 
Hoeft’s bill came out of the committee’s June meeting in Casper, where lawmakers questioned county coroners and Wyoming Department of Health officials about whether psychiatric drugs were driving suicides or homicides. Two county coroners told the committee they conduct a toxicology report on every death, but that it’s beyond their ability or role to determine whether psychiatric drugs spurred someone to act. 
“Neither one of the medications that she was on ended her life,” Fremont County Coroner Erin Ivie said at that meeting. “And so for our purposes the question is: What is the cause of death? The cause of death is a gunshot wound. What’s the manner of death? Suicide. She did this to herself. What’s the manner for the other people? [Harshman’s four children.] Homicide.”
Wyoming Health Department Director Stefan Johannson cautioned lawmakers seeking to draw correlations from Wyoming’s suicides or homicides alone. Even though the state has a high suicide rate for its population, the overall number of deaths produces a low sample size to look for the correlations described by Hoeft and other lawmakers, Johannson said. 
“I would just caution that drawing lines of causation is very difficult when our numbers in Wyoming … are so low, and you try to draw connections or correlations between chemicals that might have been present,” he said.

Trout Creek Farm celebrated the completion of its elder healing garden with a grand opening and community feast. The farm is planned as a learning center and food producer for Wind River Reservation communities.  
The post ‘This garden is a sanctuary:’ Wind River Food Sovereignty Project unveils tribal farm appeared first on WyoFile .","FORT WASHAKIE—When the Wind River Food Sovereignty Project purchased this 30-acre farm near Fort Washakie, the land mainly grew hay. Machinery and tools stood in the yards. Fences were aging. 
Fast forward two years, and a transformation is taking root. Old equipment has been cleared out, and a fenced vegetable garden is thick with vines of squash and melons. A large high tunnel has been erected; inside tidy rows of raised beds sit ready to receive soil and seeds. Native plants like chokecherry bushes have been transplanted near the creek, and some may even survive the deer onslaught. Near the farm entrance, circular paths wind around a garden, where benches, flowers and a shaded area have been designed to welcome tribal elders for rest and reflection. 
“This garden is a sanctuary,” Wind River Food Sovereignty Project Co-director Kelly Pingree told a crowd gathered for a grand opening celebration Saturday. “A place for healing, peace and connection with nature.”

Once the ribbon was cut, tribal members and others from the community filed through an ornate gate and into the brand-new elder garden, forming a circle around drummers. After a song and a prayer, it was time to eat. 
Marking the occasion with bowls of buffalo stew and fry bread dipped in chokecherry gravy felt appropriate given that the nonprofit is aimed at restoring food production and traditions in Wind River Reservation communities. 
“As Native people, we always give thanks to Mother Earth for what she provides us,” Pingree told the crowd. “And when we connect with our food, it reconnects us to the land, our ancestral knowledge, our spirituality, our prayer.”
The progress at Trout Creek Farm marks the early stages of a multi-year vision to bolster local production, access to healthy foods, tribal education and more. But it also signifies the fruits of a $36 million federal redevelopment grant that several facets of the reservation stand to benefit from.

The Food Sovereignty project hopes to share with everyone, said Pingree, clad in a vibrant ribbon skirt and standing beneath the flags of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes.
“I invite each of you to embrace this garden as your own,” she said. 
A dream takes root
The Wind River Food Sovereignty project was founded in 2018 by Hank Herrera. It was involved with reservation farmers’ markets and initiatives to support native food producers. Herrera passed away in 2020 due to COVID-19 complications, but colleagues continued the work. 
A longtime goal of Herrera’s was to operate a farm that could be both a living classroom and a vehicle to engage tribal members with production of traditional foods and plants. The idea was to find a neutral ground that both tribes could utilize. “We wanted to serve everybody here,” Pingree told WyoFile in a July interview.

The land search took years. But in late 2023, the nonprofit closed on the Trout Creek Farm. The former owner, who was aging, wanted the place to go to someone who would take care of it. The nonprofit vowed to do that. 
Private donations and grants helped enable the Sovereignty Project to purchase the land. In July 2024, it also received a major leg-up as one of the recipients of the federal “Recompete” pilot grant program. Wind River Development Fund, which applied on behalf of the Sovereignty Project and several others on the reservation, was one of only six awardees in the nation. The fund received $36 million, $4.2 million of which was earmarked for the Sovereignty Project’s ambitious plans.
“We knew it would be a huge leap for us, because it’s basically quadrupling our staff over the five years,” Wind River Food Sovereignty Project Co-director Livy Lewis said. “But we felt like we could rise to the occasion.”

The project began by hiring a farm manager and purchasing equipment. Clearing and preparing the land took months. This summer, staff planted seeds in a grow dome, tilled rows for a garden and began a pumpkin patch. They also began expanding work with education initiatives. More recently, they poured concrete and installed pathways to finish the elder garden. 
Saturday’s opening certainly drew elders — but they were joined by families with babies, young adults and residents from nearby towns. Along with feasting, participants drank sweet plum-colored chokecherry tea, perused a table arrayed with traditional native foods like cattails and amaranth, and took in the views of the hulking Wind River mountains to the west.  
First sprouts 
It’s taken years of work to get to the point of harvesting garden crops and opening the elder garden. But for the Sovereignty Project, it’s still just the beginning of a story that will in some ways write itself.  
“It’s the first of its kind,” Pingree said of Trout Creek Farm. “But it’s also to be self determined, to choose our own food ways. You know, that’s what food sovereignty is all about, is to define how we grow our own food, what we choose to eat, and how we distribute that.”

Ultimately, she said, the nonprofit wants to use its grant money to create a healthier community. That means ramping up production enough to get their vegetables and fruits into schools, restaurants and senior homes. Offering plots of dirt for tribal members to grow their own food, and for kids to learn the basics of agriculture and nutrition. Facilitating the expansion of food banks, and hosting cooking and preservation classes. Growing resources to help reverse the habits that have led to high rates of diabetes and obesity among Indigenous people.
“But also teaching them their ancestral ways of being reconnected to the land, which has been severed for many, many years,” Pingree said. “And so to bring that back and to teach them to be proud again of being able to stand up and say, ‘I don’t choose to eat that anymore. This is what I choose to eat.’”

A radioactive nest found at a South Carolina nuclear site gives columnist David Romtvedt pause about nuclear development in Wyoming.
The post Of wasps and men appeared first on WyoFile .","In July, federal officials reported that a radioactive wasp nest was found at the Savannah River nuclear site, an area of slightly more than 300 square miles in the sandhills of South Carolina. Built in the 1950s, the site produced plutonium and tritium to be used in the production of nuclear weapons. In 1996, following the end of the Cold War, the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management began cleanup at Savannah River. This requires dealing with 34.5 million gallons of radioactive liquid waste stored in 43 underground tanks. Other cleanup work includes diluting and disposing of surplus plutonium, and storing or transporting highly enriched uranium as well as both foreign and domestic spent nuclear fuel. Finally, crews will need to dismantle the site and restore the soil and groundwater to a safe condition. The Office of Environmental Management estimates that the process will be complete by 2065, meaning that cleanup will take longer than the site operated.

Opinion

The Savannah River radioactive wasp nest was sprayed to kill the wasps and then bagged as radiological waste. The Department of Energy reported that radioactivity in the nest resulted from the release of past radioactive contaminants, labeling that as “on-site legacy radioactive contamination.” The radioactive nest was not, they said, the result of a leak or loss of contamination control, adding that it posed no health risks.
A few weeks after that first discovery, workers found three more radioactive wasp nests, an indication, according to University of South Carolina biologist Dr. Timothy Mousseau, that there are contaminants in the area that have not been encased and protected. Dr. Mousseau, who studies organisms living in radioactive environments, noted that the government report didn’t indicate the absolute level of radioactivity, the specific isotopes in the nest or the species of wasp that was found, details that would provide clues to the source of contamination. Many wasps, for example, make nests out of wood they have chewed to pulp,which would suggest the presence of radioactive wood nearby. Calling the radioactive wasp nests a red flag, Mousseau said we need to determine if other radioactive material is moving through the ecosystem.
Two things have made the story of the radioactive wasp nests feel personal. One is the introduction during the 2025 Legislature of a bill to allow the manufacture of small nuclear reactors in Wyoming while also opening us to being a disposal site for spent nuclear fuel generated both inside and outside the state. This bill did not become law, but there are several proposals for similar legislation to be introduced during the 2026 session. We need to address not only the risks associated with building nuclear reactors and storing nuclear waste, but also the dangers associated with possibly bringing high-level radioactive spent fuel into Wyoming for reprocessing. 
I don’t see how we can engage in further nuclear development until we can guarantee a way to safely and permanently store spent nuclear materials — radioactive garbage. We don’t currently know how to get rid of this stuff and we know that even the proposed new nuclear reactors will generate radioactive waste that will need to be stored for what, in practical human terms, amounts to just about forever. And while the new reactors are said to be safer than the old, safer does not necessarily mean safe. That’s the reality we face.
This brings me back to the wasps who may be building radioactive homes as a result of chewing up radioactive wood left over from radioactive contaminants released in the past. I often sit on my back porch, where I covered the underside of the metal roof with willow branches — hundreds and hundreds hammered in place with 5 penny finishing nails. The smell of willow fills the porch, especially on hot days. It’s beautiful not only to me but to wasps who build their nests in the cracks and crannies made by the overlapping willow branches. I knock the nests down by hand and sometimes spray them like crazy with water. While I never get rid of the wasps, I keep their numbers low enough that they’re not much of a nuisance. Actually, I like wasps, finding them to be elegant creatures living lives far beyond our own. I hate that at Savannah River, they’re being irradiated by activities associated with the production, storage and disposal of radioactive materials. They are examples of what we often call innocent victims, those we are called upon to protect.

A professor responds to the school president’s message about the killing of Charlie Kirk.
The post An open letter to University of Wyoming President Ed Seidel appeared first on WyoFile .","Dear President Ed Seidel,
I write in response to your university-wide Sept. 10 email on the killing of Charlie Kirk. I do not envy your position stewarding the University of Wyoming through our troubling times. Political violence in our nation is now a frequent occurrence. In recent months, a gunman killed a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota’s Legislature and her husband, two Israeli Embassy employees were gunned down, an arsonist set fire to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home while he and his family slept inside and in Boulder, Colorado, a man set fire to people marching in support of Israel.

Opinion

I have no doubt that your intentions in writing this email were good. You end your email imploring the university to “come together to support and protect our community in the face of such a terrible event.” I worry, though, about the unintentional message of your email that leaves members of our UW community feeling marginalized, unseen.
In “On Rhetoric,” Aristotle identifies a branch of persuasive speech he describes as epideictic rhetoric. This is a social rhetoric that concerns itself with cultural values. We find it in communicative acts that bring communities together under communal bonds. Wedding toasts, obituaries, memorial events such as a 9/11 commemoration, a message from the president after a tragedy, for example, are instances in which we use epideictic rhetoric. Typically, epideictic communication promotes the shared values of a community. Moreover, it reinforces community boundaries. Epideictic rhetoric implicitly makes arguments about who belongs and who does not.
Your email, sent just hours after Mr. Kirk’s assassination, is a form of epideictic rhetoric. It reiterates shared communal values in its condemnation of political violence. It reaffirms commitments to open discourse. I worry, though, about the way your email constructs the UW community and who, based on this email, feels a sense of belonging and safety on campus. The email focuses on the university’s connections to Mr. Kirk. Specifically, you point out that Mr. Kirk recently “spoke on campus to a large crowd” and that he was “invited by UW’s student chapter of Turning Point USA.” You go on to write that “we join many sharing our deepest sympathies to his friends, family, and supporters.” None of that is necessarily objectionable. It’s what’s left out that raises my concerns. Mr. Kirk was a divisive political figure who said and wrote things that many people consider homophobic, racist, antisemitic and misogynistic. Many people across the country felt threatened by Mr. Kirk. Many people at UW did as well.

Mr. Kirk occupied a position of tremendous political power that reaches across campuses, that is influential in local and state politics, and that stretches to the White House. When Mr. Kirk spoke, there were consequences. Columnists on the political right and left note that Mr. Kirk was a charismatic visionary. He imagined not just the future of American conservativism, which included and empowered young conservatives, but sought to implement that future through the strong political machinery of TPUSA. What frightens many is the question of who is empowered and included in that future. Or, put more appropriately, who is not included in that future. There are a lot of UW community members who do not see themselves in Mr. Kirk’s vision.
As president of UW, you hold a special responsibility. Your words sent through official channels linked to the office you hold carry consequences. The email explicitly addresses members of our community who have real and felt connections to Mr. Kirk. It invites them into the imagined community of the email. You do not directly address members of our community who find his discourse objectionable or who have fears about the future he worked to create. As such, they are made peripheral in the outlines of the community formed by the epideictic function of your email.
Extreme partisanship and political violence are real problems for our nation. Pundits from across the political spectrum fret over our political divisions and worry if and how it can be repaired. American campuses have long trained students for civic life and democratic engagement. I believe your email is a missed opportunity for bridging divides, for encouraging engagement. We deter further violence and division by starting with our words. I do not make a plea here calling on others for better debate or to honor respectful discourse. These appeals are not enough. We — the administration and faculty — occupy positions of institutional leadership. We must use our advantaged positions to leverage institutional infrastructures and resources that create forums and spaces for engagement in the everyday spaces of campus life, that structurally promote exchange among people, that assemble community. We, as leaders, must create multi-vocal spaces on campus that invite students (and faculty and staff) into discourse about community values and that allows students agency in shaping their community based on our shared values.
In graduate school I was taught that if you don’t like an article someone wrote you should write the article you wish they had written. Here is my attempt:
The assassination of Charlie Kirk is one of many recent acts of political violence in our nation. The increase in political violence is troubling and leaves many of us afraid, distraught and even angry. On our campus, Mr. Kirk had many supporters and many critics. Regardless of our feelings, his death from an act of political violence affects us all. Our local and national communities are harmed by violence. We, each of us, are harmed by this kind of violence. We should use this moment as an opportunity to reflect on our commitments to building an inclusive campus that honors our differences, and which promotes peaceful and curious engagement across those differences.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)WAUSAU — In his first event since launching his campaign for governor of Wisconsin, U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany made the case for his governorship and promised the large crowd seated and standing around a barn on Wednesday that he’ll work hard to win in 2026.
The 2026 race will be the first open election for governor of Wisconsin in over 15 years as Gov. Tony Evers decided to retire at the end of his second term. Tiffany became the third Republican candidate in the race on Tuesday. Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien are also running in the Republican primary for the office. The Democratic field is growing with at least six candidates so far. The primary is scheduled for August 2026.  
“We are making America great once again,” Tiffany, who stood in front of an American flag, told the crowd. “Now we need a governor that’s going to lead Wisconsin to prosperity. Are we going to be one of those states that chooses prosperity like Texas and Florida and Tennessee and Ohio or are we going to be one of the laggards like New York or California?”
Tiffany declared during his speech that he is “the leader” in the race as he called for people to join him in his work. 
“I will put every ounce of my energy into this… but I cannot do it alone,” Tiffany said. “I am going to need your help.” 
Berrien, who has never held elected office, criticized Tiffany as a “career politician” in a statement after his launch. 
“We need builders who will create prosperity for all through work, revitalize the manufacturing infrastructure that lies dormant in our state, and jumpstart our economy,” Berrien said. “As the only builder in this race, I’m the strongest general election candidate Democrats will face — and they know it!”
Schoemann, meanwhile, welcomed Tiffany to the race. 
“Looking forward to a Republican primary focused on ideas and winning back the governor’s office,” Schoemann said in a social media post on Tuesday. 
In his 16-minute speech, Tiffany highlighted his childhood on a dairy farm in Elmwood, in the western part of the state as one of eight children.
“Growing up on the farm, we learned to work hard. We learned how to work hard, and we learned to live on a budget, and there are no excuses on the farm, you pick up the shovel, you pick up the pitchfork and you go to work,” Tiffany said. “That’s the way it is. There’s no excuses when those chores start to pile up, and it’s kind of the Wisconsin way.”

The crowd of attendees, some wearing “Make America Great Again” hats, Turning Point USA shirts and even vintage Tiffany for Senate shirts, cheered enthusiastically throughout the speech. 
Linda Michalski, a Wausau resident who retired from working for Marathon County as an  accountant, said she got an invite to Tiffany’s event from the Marathon County Republican Party, of which she is a member. She said she hasn’t researched the other Republican candidates in depth, but that she believes Tiffany’s name recognition will give him an edge.
Michalski said Tiffany’s backstory stuck out to her. 
“Dairy farmers work hard. You can’t just let things slide. You can’t just go on vacation if you’re a dairy farmer, in a dairy farmer family. Things have to get done, and they can’t… If more people had a strong work ethic, they wouldn’t be faced with financial difficulties,” Michalski said. 
Tiffany is hoping to lean on voters like Michaski in the areas of the state where he is most at home, telling reporters after his speech that he needs to “juice up” turnout in northern and western Wisconsin in order to win in 2026. 
“I’m driving all over the state of Wisconsin today, and I was talking to people that were making commitments, and I think you’re going to see more people climb on board here,” Tiffany said. “I got to prove myself to people, the state of Wisconsin.” 
Tiffany, who lives in Minocqua, has represented Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District, a massive area encompassing the northern part of the state, in the House of Representatives since 2020. Before he went to Washington D.C., Tiffany served in the Wisconsin Legislature, first in the Assembly for about three years, followed by nearly eight years in the state Senate, where he was a member of  the powerful, budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. 
Tiffany told reporters that he is expecting that he’ll have to raise $30 or $40 million, and that his campaign is “off to a good start.”
Republicans in the gubernatorial primary are anxiously awaiting a possible endorsement from  President Donald Trump. Tiffany said his last conversation with Trump, which centered mostly on the 7th CD, was in August. 
“We will see how he responds. If he chooses to endorse me, I will certainly welcome that endorsement,” Tiffany said. 
In his speech, Tiffany said he would freeze property taxes and said the annual $325 school revenue limit increase that districts receive due to a partial veto by Evers would be “dead on day one.” 
The annual revenue limit increase gives school districts the option to bring in additional revenue, though without additional state aid, their only option to benefit from the increase is to raise local property taxes. Many school districts throughout the state have been leaning on property taxes to help with costs, since state aid to schools has not kept pace with inflation for almost two decades.
Michalski, a homeowner, said that a freeze in property taxes would be a “welcome relief.” She said her own property taxes have jumped nearly $1,000 recently, a hike that she blames on the Wausau Common Council. 
“Our current government is — it’s awful. It’s just awful, what Gov. Evers is doing. He’s pushing away businesses, he’s adding taxes upon taxes, and… he’s imposing a tax on property owners for 400 years,” Michalski said.

Tiffany didn’t have additional specifics when it came to exactly how he would freeze property taxes while talking to reporters after his speech. 
“There’s plenty of money in Madison that I think we can help out those local municipalities to do the property tax freeze taxes at the local level. Where are the schools and the local municipalities going to get their money, right? I think the state can help out, especially after the spending blowout with this budget,” Tiffany told reporters after his speech. 
Asked by a reporter if he would seek a suspension of school referendums, Tiffany said he hasn’t “dug that deep into the details” and would “have to study that a little bit.” 
Kevin Lund, a nurse from Kronenwetter, said he appreciates the “Wisconsin First” message that Tiffany delivered. While he identifies as a libertarian, not a Republican, Lund said he has been following Tiffany since he took over from former U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy in 2020. 
“He’s paralleling a lot of the conservative type of sentiments that have been kind of nationwide,” Lund said, adding that he is happy about that. “He’s winning on the 80-20 issues, and as long as he can continue to convey that message throughout the state, I think, he’ll find a lot of success.” 
Those issues, Lund said, include immigration and the economy. 
“When you have money, all of a sudden, everybody’s a little bit happier,” Lund said, adding that young people in particular are dealing with challenges trying to afford a home and are “seeing a stagnation in wage growth.” 
“That’s got to be concerning to the younger generation. I’ve got a daughter that’s young, and… I’m wanting to see young people be able to have the chance to succeed in the state,” Lund said.
Tiffany, speaking about his tenure in Congress, highlighted his visits to the southern border where he said he saw “the damage that was being done to America, where every state had become a border state.” Tiffany, who is a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, has been supportive of Trump’s crackdown on immigration during his second term. 
During his speech, Tiffany repeatedly blamed Democrats for problems in the state and played up cultural issues.
“For too long, Democrats have torn down what has been built up in Wisconsin,” Tiffany said. “If we give them four more years? Buckle up! Buckle up! Because you’ll see illegal aliens having driver’s licenses. You’ll see men playing girls’ sports and cheap foreign labor will replace you.” 
Tiffany also declared that there would be “no sanctuary cities” in Wisconsin under his leadership and called diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) “unconstitutional and un-American.” 
“I talk to parents, and they have a simple message in regards to education, they just say, ‘Just educate our kids. Don’t indoctrinate them. Just get them a good education.’” Tiffany said, adding that he would seek to ensure that “dollars for education are going to students, teachers, and communities, not the system.”

Last week they launched a new initiative to improve immediate disaster relief. They’re also lobbying lawmakers to reform the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, a cooperative of more than 100 river communities between Minnesota and Louisiana, held its annual meeting last week in Minnesota’s Twin Cities. The mayoral gathering came on the heels of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and after months of threats from President Donald Trump’s administration to roll back FEMA’s role in natural disaster response.
“Emergencies and crises — they are indeed happening more often,” said Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, Minnesota. “And so we all need to be prepared.”
This year, the Mississippi River corridor experienced flooding and drought. Severe storms and flooding soaked West Tennessee, particularly communities along the Mississippi River and one of its tributaries, the Obion River. Tornadoes devastated communities in Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and Tennessee. An EF-3 tornado with wind speeds of up to 160 miles per hour swept through Selmer, Tennessee on April 3, leaving 332 structures damaged and five people dead.

Stacey Kinder, the mayor of Cape Girardeau, Missouri — which also saw two tornadoes touch down this year – said her state has suffered.
“Yet, in the face of over $2 billion worth of losses since March, just for Missouri, the future of FEMA and the U.S. disaster mitigation and response apparatus remains in considerable flux,” Kinder said.
Earlier this year, Trump said that FEMA could be phased out in favor of individual states carrying the burden of natural disaster response. Although his administration has reversed course on outright abolishing the agency in recent months, Trump officials are still working on an overhaul. The FEMA Review Council, which was created by an executive order, is supposed to make recommendations to change the agency by mid-November. Meanwhile, an Associated Press analysis found major disaster declarations are taking longer under Trump than historical averages. 
In response to FEMA’s uncertain future, the MRCTI announced a new program to deliver assistance to its members “within 72 hours of a disaster event,” said Kinder. That aid could include food, water, hygiene supplies, and other immediate needs, according to Ethan Forhetz, a spokesperson from Convoy of Hope.
Partnership to focus on immediate needs 3 days post-disaster
MRCTI’s executive director, Colin Wellenkamp, said in surveys mayors have consistently said they need help during the first 36 to 72 hours after a disaster, for which there’s rarely money in their budgets.   
The initiative is being done in partnership with Convoy of Hope, a Missouri-based non-profit. The organization provided food and supplies after the May tornado in St. Louis. It helped respond to more than 50 U.S. disasters in 2024, according to its website.
“By working together before disasters strike, we can reduce response time, position resources where they’re most needed, and make sure families receive help quickly and with dignity,” said Stacy Lamb, the non-profit’s vice president for disaster services. “This partnership isn’t just about responding, but it’s about building resilience.”
MRCTI did not disclose how the partnership will be financed.
The program is available immediately for partnering cities and towns and surrounding communities.
“Convoy is committed to working with any city along the Mississippi River, and beyond, during times of disaster,” Forhetz said.
West Tennessee mayor: ‘We do need it to be as quick as possible.’
Ridgely, Tennessee was one of several Northwest Tennessee towns flooded after torrential downpours in April. Ridgely Mayor Shane Hamilton said his community in Lake County is among the most poverty-stricken in the state. 
Hamilton is one of the Tennessee mayors that make up MRCTI, alongside the mayors of Memphis and Tiptonville. He said the Convoy of Hope partnership will be helpful to meet the immediate needs of vulnerable community members following future disasters. The town is home to many elderly residents and a nursing home.
Ridgely has its own emergency management team that works with the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency and FEMA after disasters, but the process takes time. For Tennessee counties that suffered damage from storms in early April, federal assistance wasn’t unlocked until President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for the event more than two months later.

Hamilton said Ridgely has recovered well and was fortunate that the flooding did not greatly impact residents’ homes. Agricultural fields were soaked, and it took longer to plant crops than usual, he said. But if homes were severely flooded, time would be of the essence.
“(Waiting) does put some displacement on people if we have a disaster,” he said. “We do need it to be as quick as possible, but everybody knows that’s not the case, a lot of times, when you’re dealing with the government.”
Hamilton said he’s not aware at this time of any costs to Ridgely associated with being part of the new initiative.
Working toward improved disaster response in the basin
Melisa Logan, the mayor of Blytheville, Arkansas, said the partnership is designed to “fill the largest gap in U.S. emergency response … capacity.”
The MRCTI is plugging other responsiveness holes, too. At this year’s meeting, mayors announced a new dashboard to more easily monitor water levels in the river and drought, to better predict and communicate the state of the basin. 
In addition, MRCTI announced that it is working with legislators on the Fixing Emergency Management for Americans Act of 2025, also known as the FEMA Act of 2025. The bill would make FEMA report directly to President Trump as an independent agency. The bill’s stated aims are to speed up aid delivery to both states and individuals and reward state preparedness.
MRCTI mayors also want to see a mitigation piece to the bill, including a grant program for projects that address regional disaster vulnerabilities.
“So there’s a lot of moving parts with FEMA right now,” Wellenkamp said. “Where all those moving parts are going to land? Don’t know, but as the mayors pointed out, we know what we have as our priorities and that is the systemic reduction of risk over large landscapes.”

(Photo: Getty Images)No one understands the partnership between the earth and its people better than those who steward the land. But for generations, farmers in the Volunteer State could not make direct sales to the public of temperature-controlled foods or canned goods.
That changed in 2022 when state lawmakers passed the Tennessee Food Freedom Act. The bill allowed farmers and other cottage-food producers to sell certain homemade, nonperishable foods, including baked goods and jams, with no need for inspection or licensing.  
Recently, the Tennessee House of Representatives expanded Tennessee’s cottage-food laws with the passage of HB130, enabling Tennessee farmers and food entrepreneurs to legally sell homemade foods that include perishable foods such as dairy, eggs and poultry. 
“This gives small producers more flexibility to meet the growing demand for local, fresh and prepared foods,” said bill sponsor Rep. Michele Reneau, a Signal Mountain Republican.
The bill does not allow the sale of unpasteurized milk and other unpasteurized dairy products.
“We trust each other with food in our communities,” said Rep. Michele Reneau, a Signal Mountain Republican who sponsored the Food Freedom Act. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Within the past year, lawsuits have been filed against a Florida dairy farm found by the Florida State Health Department to have sold unpasteurized dairy products linked to at least 21 cases of campylobacter and shiga toxin-producing E. coli. The cases include a pregnant mother who consumed raw milk, became sick and lost her unborn baby.
Elizabeth Stuart has farmed her Crossing Creeks Farm in Shelbyville for the past 12 years, practicing regenerative farming to raise beef cattle, pigs, turkeys and chickens for meat and eggs.
Though the farm has a commercial kitchen, Stuart realizes the importance of the Food Freedom Act for those farms that do not.
“We believe that the Food Freedom Act is an important asset to Tennessee farmers and artisans,” she said. “For example, farmers who have a bumper crop of vegetables, or chicken, meat or eggs, now have the ability to turn that into a value-added product instead of it becoming waste. This increases the amount of local food sources within the state.”
The welfare of local farmers and food entrepreneurs is at the heart of the bil, saud Reneau.
“This bill is about freedom and opportunity,” Reneau said, adding that the new legislation negates the need for inspections and commercial licensing that costs food producers nearly $500. 
“Tennessee families love buying directly from people they know and trust, and small farms and home kitchens want the ability to serve their communities without unnecessary red tape,” she said.
Reneau compares the Food Freedom Act to shared community meals, such as pot-luck dinners with friends and neighbors.
“We already trust each other with food in our communities,” she said. “This simply extends that same trust to local farmers and food entrepreneurs so more of them can start businesses or expand what they offer.”
The Food Freedom Act enables farmers and small-food producers to diversify their offerings, from soups and stews to casseroles with perishable ingredients, such as poultry and dairy, giving the “little guy” a fairer chance to compete or get started in  the food business. 
The idea is to create an incubator of sorts, a stepping stone that may lead to commercial operations in larger cities, while giving those in rural areas with no access to commercial kitchens a viable option to sell locally.
The 2022 Food Freedom Act enabled farmers to sell shelf-stable items requiring no refrigeration or special handling. Now, prepared chicken, such as rotisserie chicken, soups and pot pie, plus butter, eggs, yogurts, hard cheeses and kefir can be sold directly to consumers.
Bird Fork Farm is a Certified Naturally Grown small seed-to-bottle apothecary farm in Dunlap. The farm produces organically grown vegetables, fruits and herbs in addition to locally grown or foraged teas, spices, extracts, syrups, body care products, ferments and vinegars. 
Alysia Leon of Bird Fork says the Food Freedom Act has allowed her farm to cut down on food waste and offer farm-fresh products year-round.  While the farm does not produce meat and dairy products, updates allowing the sale of temperature-controlled foods opens revenue resources once denied Tennessee farmers.
“We know this update has allowed other farmer friends the ability to expand their operations,” Leon says. “It cuts down on food waste to create value-added products, and it gives farmers the benefit of the doubt that they are doing things the right way.”
The bill has received overwhelming approval from cottage-food producers, Reneau said.
“Many have told me they’ve been waiting years to sell more of the foods they already make at home, but costs and regulations have prevented that. Customers are just as excited,” she said. “They want more local choices and more ways to support their neighbors. 
“It’s truly a win-win for producers and consumers, and I hope Tennessee’s Food Freedom Act becomes a model for other states.”

From Shark Tank to the real lives of challenged communities, a virtual pitch show is changing entrepreneurship. I first learned about an innovative approach to global service at a recent Pocatello Rotary Club meeting, where Entrapov founder Ben Davidson gave an inspiring presentation about a program that’s revolutionizing how we think about helping others.
What if you could help someone escape poverty forever in just one hour? A new virtual service project called “Shark Pond” is making that possible for families, businesses, and community groups across America.
Inspired by the hit TV show “Shark Tank,” Shark Pond connects aspiring entrepreneurs from impoverished areas in Africa with potential investors through video conferencing. But unlike the cutthroat television version, this program emphasizes encouragement and genuine support.
“We’re creating real change, one business at a time,” explains Davidson. “These aren’t just feel-good moments. We’re helping people build sustainable livelihoods that lift entire families out of poverty.”
 How it works

The process begins months before the virtual pitch show. Aspiring entrepreneurs undergo intensive three-month training programs where they develop business plans, learn accounting basics, and practice their presentations. They create detailed income statements, cash flow projections, and business proposals; just like contestants on the real Shark Tank.
When pitch day arrives, groups of “sharks” — which could be Rotary clubs, corporate teams, church groups, or even families — log into a video conference to hear business proposals. The entrepreneurs, who all speak fluent English, share their personal stories and business dreams. Proposals range from egg farms and food carts to metalworking shops and tailoring businesses.
After hearing the pitches and asking questions, the groups decide which entrepreneur to sponsor with startup grants. The entire event takes just one hour and costs participating groups around $1,000.
 Real impact, real relationships

Unlike traditional charity models, Shark Pond creates ongoing relationships between sponsors and entrepreneurs. Monthly updates arrive with photos, videos, and success stories showing how the businesses are growing.
“You’re not just writing a check and hoping for the best,” says Shark Pond volunteer Rich Kirkham. “You get to see exactly how your money is being used and build a genuine friendship with someone on the other side of the world.”
The program promises that 100% of donations go directly to Africa for those in need (the entrepreneur and their local mentor), with no money deducted for administrative overhead. This direct-funding model ensures maximum impact for every dollar contributed.
 Perfect for groups

Shark Pond events work particularly well for organizations looking to build team spirit while making a difference. The format requires no travel, minimal time commitment, and creates shared experiences that strengthen group bonds.
Corporate teams have used Shark Pond events during regular meetings, while service clubs incorporate them into their monthly gatherings. The interactive nature of the pitch process encourages participation and discussion among group members.
For communities and organizations seeking meaningful ways to help others without major logistical challenges, Shark Pond offers a compelling solution. It combines the excitement of entrepreneurship with the satisfaction of direct, personal impact. This proves that sometimes the most effective help comes through believing in someone’s dreams and giving them the tools to achieve them.
For more information about hosting a Shark Pond event, interested groups can contact Davidson to work on a virtual service project. See entrapov.com.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A conservative activist shot and killed at an Utah college campus. A gunman fatally shoots a Minnesota legislator and her husband, and mortally wounds their beloved dog. Judges and legislators increasingly get threats — and in 2020 a judge’s son was murdered when an assailant came to their door. Roughly 140 law enforcement officers were injured in the Jan.  6, 2021, politically-motivated assault on the U.S. Capitol.
Political violence rightly offends us to the core when we read about it. The lessons are stronger and clearer, however, when it directly comes to your life. This happened to me, my wife, and our church congregation on July 27, 2008. 
That day dawned warm and bright as an unemployed truck driver, Jim David Adkisson, put a modified shotgun into a guitar case and drove to Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in Knoxville. He also had a bag with 76 shells of #4 shot. He was envisioning a massacre, ending in his death in a police standoff.
The gunman’s home held few books, mostly hate-filled ones penned by talk radio hosts. He had scribbled a note that because he could not kill national liberals and Democrats, he’d kill those who voted for them. He had added some homophobic rants to the notes.
Minnesota House Democratic leader dead after ‘politically motivated assassination’

At the church, a special performance was just beginning — Annie Jr., a condensed version of the musical done almost entirely with a child cast. The one exception was my friend and fellow University of Tennessee professor John Bohstedt, chrome-domed and dressed as Daddy Warbucks, waiting for his entrance.
Adkisson entered the church and reached the back of the sanctuary facing the stage. He removed his gun from the guitar case, pointing it toward the pews stage left and in front of him.  Usher Greg McKendry was near the gunman. Some say he was caught off guard. Others say he stepped toward the shooter. Greg’s broad body took most of the first blast, saving many lives — including, very likely, mine.
Like many, my first indication of the attack was an ear-shattering bang. Instinctively, I dove under the pew. On the way down, I caught a glimpse of the gunman — curly gray hair, silver barrel of a gun in hand, eyes fixed and expressionless — a portrait in the ferocious banality of evil.
Adkisson got off another shot before Bohstedt and several others bravely jumped on and restrained the killer. Our congregation had so many heroes in those moments who kept things from getting worse.
My friend Greg McKendry bled out on the cold floor of the church he loved. Linda Kraeger, a visitor from Westside Unitarian Universalist church and there for the play, also died. Six others were seriously injured.
The short- and long-term aftermath from that day revealed many things. The next few days found the fellowship hall filling with flowers and food, messages from around the globe; counselors were available. Police and prosecutors treated us well, and followed a majority sentiment that Adkisson should be convicted and sentenced to a life term so he never again walks freely among civilized people.
The better angels of our nature were on full display at a nearby church for a special service. Congregations from all over Knoxville were there to uplift us Unitarian Universalist survivors.  Two local UU pastors spoke, as did the president of the Unitarian Universalist Association.



ach year many more people have a searing personal experience with political violence. It leaves you with a deep understanding of how hate festers.  


At the conclusion, children from the play walked, unannounced, to the center of the altar, accompanied by the music director. They sang “Tomorrow” from Annie. The crowd joined in: swaying, hugging strangers, shouting the chorus to the rafters. Becky and I left the event to a steady rain. I quoted to Becky some lines from the old blues lyric “The Sky is Crying.”
The congregation grew and reclaimed our space. The fellowship hall now is named after Greg McKendry. The church library is named after Linda Kraeger. Minister Chris Buice cooperated with a University of Tennessee sociologist who interviewed Adkisson to assess whether a restorative justice model and contact would work. That sociologist classified the shooter as someone who would use contact as an opportunity to inflict more harm – in this case psychological.
Tragically, each year many more people have a searing personal experience with political violence. It leaves you with a deep understanding of how hate festers. You catch yourself from referencing opponents as enemies. You reach out, when possible, to find common ground. You try your best to criticize ideas, not people. You realize that political violence has many causes and triggers, but that gun safety laws could have a beneficial effect. They won’t stop every shooting, but could stop some — and have the added benefit of reducing gun tragedies from accidents and suicides.
You find yourself encouraging critical thinking, fighting for truth, and resisting a world view that elevates sides over learning. Perhaps moved by the deep recesses of memory, you hug a bit more closely, express joy more freely, retain your sense of humor and whimsy, and mention your love to those you love.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A failed Ohio secretary of state candidate backed Tina Peters’ release from prison in a proposed amicus brief filed in federal court in Colorado over the weekend.
In the filing, lawyers for Terpsehore Maras argue that a denial of bail for Peters violates the former Mesa County clerk and recorder’s First Amendment rights and would be an uneven application of Colorado’s bail standards.
“Denying bail to a non-violent defendant with a pending appeal — where state law permits release — serves no legitimate purpose and operates solely as punishment. That result is compounded here by the state’s indifference to Ms. Peters’ health, turning confinement into cruelty,” the filing says.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Earlier this year, Peters, 70, submitted a petition to get a federal court to free her on bond while she appeals her state-level conviction that stems from her scheme to allow an unauthorized person access to her county’s Dominion Voting Systems machines in 2021. She was sentenced to nine years in prison and is currently incarcerated at a medium-security facility in Pueblo.
Peters, a Republican, espoused debunked claims about election security and voter fraud after former President Joe Biden won the 2020 election.
During a hearing in July on Peters’ habeas corpus petition, Chief Magistrate Judge Scott Varholak said he could not find a precedent where a federal court granted habeas — or release — on an appeal bond.
Maras — who is also an election denier, podcaster and QAnon supporter — argued in her brief that the bond denial was a punishment for Peters’ statements about election systems rather than a decision to protect the community.
“Colorado law permits bail pending appeal when a defendant is not a flight risk or danger to society. While the decision to grant bail is discretionary, that discretion cannot be exercised in a way that infringes upon constitutional rights. Here, the trial judge’s own words reveal that bail was denied not to ensure appearance or protect the public, but to punish and silence Ms. Peters,” the brief says.
Maras claims the decision would violate Peters’ rights under the First, Eighth, Ninth and 14th Amendments.
“If allowed to stand, this ruling establishes a precedent that bail may be weaponized to silence dissent, chill public discourse, and punish citizens critical of government conduct. That is not the purpose of bail, nor the role of courts in a constitutional democracy,” the brief says.
The brief asserts that, in addition to Maras, there are 3,057 signatories to it whose names lawyers could make available to the court. Anyone can propose an amicus brief, though they are not automatically accepted.
The Colorado attorney general’s office has asked for the habeas corpus petition to be dismissed because federal court does not have jurisdiction in the state-level case. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has called for Peters’ release multiple times.
On Sept. 17, Varholak gave parties in the petition case two weeks to address the merits of Peters’ habeas petition on First Amendment grounds.

(Photo courtesy of Steven Allen Adams) BECKLEY, W.Va. — Aaron Siri stood at a podium in a third-floor courtroom of the Raleigh County Courthouse in Beckley earlier this month. Consulting a legal pad of notes, the attorney cross examined Dr. Cathy Slemp, who had testified earlier that morning.
“Doctor, what’s the federal Vaccines for Children Program?” he asked the former state health officer.
“It’s a program that the federal government does, that they have federal contracts for vaccines that allows states to purchase off those contracts so that it’s at a lower cost,” she answered.
Just two days earlier, Siri was in Washington, D.C., testifying before the U.S. Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations during a hearing entitled “How the corruption of science has impacted public perception and policies regarding vaccines.”
Siri, a New York-based attorney, has represented federal health secretary and vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the anti-vaccine Informed Consent Action Network. Last fall, he reportedly helped Kennedy pick health officials for President Donald Trump’s administration. He’s also petitioned the federal government to suspend or remove approval for the use of the polio vaccine in infants and toddlers until a safety trial is done. 
Now, Siri is part of a legal team representing parents of school children in Raleigh County in their lawsuit against the West Virginia and Raleigh County boards of education. The families are suing the school boards to allow their students to attend class with a religious exemption to the state’s school immunization requirements. 
All states require children attending school to be vaccinated for certain infectious diseases, including polio, chickenpox and measles. West Virginia is one of only five states in the country that do not allow children to opt out of the requirements because of religious or philosophical objections to the shots. Gov. Patrick Morrisey seeks to change that. 
The governor issued an executive order early this year requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. The executive order — based on the state’s 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act — has not been rescinded even though the West Virginia Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have put the exemptions in state code. 
Raleigh Circuit Judge Michael Froble in July issued a preliminary injunction allowing the children in the case to attend class with a religious exemption to the state’s school vaccination requirements. Attorneys representing the families have asked the judge for class action status. 
When West Virginia Watch asked Siri about his interest in the lawsuit, and in West Virginia’s compulsory school vaccination law generally, Siri referred a reporter to his Dec. 20, 2022 post on the social media platform X, to his recent congressional testimony, and to his book, “Vaccines, Amen: The Religion of Vaccines.”
“Mandates are the tool of bullies, criminals and dictators,” he wrote in the post. “If a patient refuses a medical product after being conveyed its benefits and risks, then that is called informed consent. They were informed and did not consent. Mandating over this objection is immoral and illiberal.”
He added in an email, “Protecting everybody’s right to [informed] consent and medical liberty is important no matter what state they are in.”
While Morrisey has expressed support for the families suing the boards of education, the state is not compensating Siri for his work representing the plaintiffs, according to Morrisey’s office. 
Froble held a two-day hearing on a permanent injunction in the case on Sept. 10 and 11. 
Attorneys and the judge heard from Slemp, who argued that the state’s school compulsory vaccination law — without religious or philosophical exemptions — is the best way to protect the state’s public health goals. Even a small number of religious or philosophical exemptions would increase disease, she said. 
The school board has appealed the judge’s preliminary ruling to the state Supreme Court, which has signaled that it would consider it no sooner than early next year. 
The hearing on a permanent injunction in the case is expected to continue in Froble’s Beckley courtroom’s Oct. 8 and 9. The judge has subpoenaed the state’s current acting state health officer, Dr. Mark McDaniel, who agrees with Morrisey on religious exemptions, to testify during that hearing.

Tammy Baldwin | Collage of screenshots via ZoomLast time the government was on the brink of a shutdown, Democratic leaders rushed to negotiate with Republicans and reached a deal to keep federal agencies open and basic services flowing. Now that deal is about to expire and there seems to be little appetite for compromise in Washington. 
President Donald Trump has directed Republicans “don’t even bother dealing with” Democrats, and the House rammed through a near-party-line resolution to keep the government open that ignored Democratic demands and had no Democratic input at all. 
“We’re not sure how serious they are about actually trying to have something done by September 30,” Wisconsin Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, told reporters in his Madison office Wednesday. Trump had just canceled a meeting with Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, and the House isn’t even in session during the last days of September, as the shutdown clock winds down. 
Still, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) called the Democratic caucus back anyway, “so I’ll be flying Monday out to Washington,” Pocan said.  “Hopefully they’ll decide we’ve got work to do. But you know, this is something where we don’t run the House or the Senate or the White House.” In other words, if the government shuts down, it’s the Republicans’ fault. Republicans, who don’t appear worried about a shutdown, say the opposite, rolling their eyes at Democrats’ demands that a stopgap government funding bill must reverse Medicaid cuts and extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year and without which an estimated 5 million Americans will no longer be able to afford any health insurance at all.
A shutdown means hardship for people who depend on government services and could harm the whole economy, “But at the same time,” Pocan said, “we’re trying to fight for people who lost their health care and other things from what we call the Big, Ugly Law.”
Pocan cited data from the nonpartisan health research organization KFF on likely health insurance premium hikes in Wisconsin if the ACA tax credits are not extended. A KFF calculator estimates premium increases for families of different sizes and income levels in every state. A family of four earning $130,000 per year in Wisconsin could see premiums jump by as much as $1,588 per month or $19,081 per year, according to the calculator.
Nationwide, premiums will soar by more than 75% if the credits expire, according to KFF.
Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin has called for legislation she introduced earlier this year to make the enhanced premium tax credits permanent to be included in any stopgap bill to avert a shutdown.
In a joint statement, Democratic leaders of the House and Senate criticized House Republicans for ignoring their pleas to address the expiring ACA tax credits, writing, “at a time when families are already being squeezed by higher costs, Republicans refuse to stop Americans from facing double-digit hikes in their health insurance premiums.” 
The sudden jump in health insurance premiums, combined with high costs for consumer goods because of Trump’s tariffs, will hit voters just ahead of the midterm elections, which take place right after the ACA tax credits are set to expire. Politics alone should make the idea of forestalling the sudden cliff appealing. But this is no ordinary Republican party. Back in their districts, ducking in-person meetings with constituents, members of Congress who voted for the Big Beautiful Bill Act to slash health care, food assistance and federal agencies that serve their constituents are still in lockstep with Trump. No wonder they don’t care if the entire government grinds to a halt.
A shutdown will be bad. But what Trump and the Republicans have in store for Americans is worse. 
More than the effects of a shutdown, said Pocan, “I’m far more concerned about what they just did to people that we need to try to fix, and if they’re not willing to have those conversations with us — that’s a big problem.”

And this work is just beginning. We’ve launched a 55 county tour to shine a light on the largest cuts to health care in our nation’s history.
I’ve had the pleasure of being an occasional guest on MetroNews Midday with Dave Allen and Amanda Barren to talk about health care and emerging policy that will affect West Virginian’s ability to afford and access health care. I always enjoy the experience and look forward to educating West Virginians about the realities of how policy choices made by our representatives — on our behalf — can affect their families and their daily lives.  
On my most recent appearance, I was asked how is it that you say Medicaid cuts will devastate West Virginia’s health care infrastructure, yet Sen. Shelley Moore Capito was just in our studios and said Medicaid was not cut at all?
My response: I don’t understand how the senator can claim that. Surely, she has read the bill.  
Medicaid is West Virginia’s single largest source of federal funding. It sustains thousands of jobs, keeps rural hospitals and clinics open, and injects billions into our local economy each year. In fact, Medicaid spending in West Virginia totals $5.5 billion annually, with 82% of that supported by federal dollars.
Read that again: 82% of our state’s Medicaid funding — the largest health insurance program in our state — comes from the federal government. 
Over 500,000 West Virginians count on this coverage — from our youngest to our oldest, and everyone in between — including working families, people with disabilities, and those who need expensive or long-term care they couldn’t afford on their own.
According to Families USA, , H.R. 1 is devastating for West Virginia, stripping more than $666 million each year in federal Medicaid funding. The damage will only grow as the provider tax is reduced and gradually phased out in Medicaid expansion states like ours, all while a moratorium blocks any new or increased provider taxes. 
This matters. The provider tax — a levy placed on hospitals, nursing homes and managed care organizations — is a critical source of state revenue for Medicaid. It serves as the primary funding mechanism for the state’s share of Medicaid costs, allowing West Virginia to draw down billions in additional federal dollars. Those funds support both mandatory and optional Medicaid services. Limiting or phasing out this tax, is in effect, a direct threat to the foundation of Medicaid’s funding in our state. 
Mandatory essential services 

Early and periodic screening, diagnostic and treatment: Comprehensive health services for individuals under 21
Federally qualified health center services
Home health services for those who are eligible for nursing facility care
Inpatient and outpatient hospital services
Laboratory and X-ray services
Nurse-midwife services
Nursing facility services for adults over 21
Physician services
Rural Health Clinic (RHC) services
Transportation to and from medical care 

Optional services 

Ambulance transportation
Dental services: West Virginia covers dental for children, but coverage for adults is generally limited to emergency services
Eyeglasses and optometry services
Hospice care
Intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities
Mental and behavioral health services
Personal care services
Prescription drugs
Psychological services
Rehabilitation service.
Speech, hearing, and language services
Waiver services including: 

Aged and disabled waiver
Children with serious emotional disorder waiver
Intellectual and/or developmental disabilities waiver
Traumatic brain injury waiver



What do our lawmakers cut first — dental care, mental and behavioral health, nursing home care or the waiver that supports West Virginians with disabilities? These are the devastating choices that Capito Care has forced onto our state lawmakers and onto our communities.
It doesn’t have to be this way. H.R. 1 was a choice — a policy decision led by our senior senator, Shelley Moore Capito, and backed by Sen. Jim Justice, Rep. Carol Miller and Rep. Riley Moore. Capito Care weakens Medicaid across the board, straining our health care infrastructure, reducing access, and raising costs for everyone. The truth is: Medicaid didn’t need saving, but after these reckless cuts it does. These cuts must never see implementation.

(Photo: Getty Images/bluecinema)North Carolina’s Problem Gambling Helpline answered more than 8,100 calls in the last fiscal year, more than an 11% increase from 2024.
The numbers were unveiled Wednesday by Amanda Winters, the state’s problem gambling program administrator, at the North Carolina State Lottery Commission’s September meeting.
Winters said over the past 16 years, the lottery has always been the primary reason people called the helpline. This year, sports betting was the top reason. Casinos came in second.
“When we looked at the demographics in the helpline of sports betting compared to non-sports betting, we found that the people who were calling were of a younger age between 18 and 34,” said Winters. “And with sports betting, people were likely to experience the problem for less than one year, which means that they went from no harm or minimal risk to severe risk within a shorter time span.”
That differs from non-sports bettors who tend to be slightly older (age 24-44) and may have gambled longer (more than three years) before realizing there was a problem.

One troubling trend is that sports bettors were less likely to accept treatment, Winters said. They were, however, more likely to text or chat, something that correlates to the younger age-range of participants.
The report also revealed that when it came to how others were affected, 25% of those seeking help were spouses of non-sports bettors. In the case of sports-betting, 50% of the calls were coming from concerned parents.
Winters said she could attest to those stats. As she was getting ready to start the presentation, her dedicated line that she affectionately calls “the bat phone” rang.
“More than likely it’s somebody’s parent calling me.”
Programs like GamFin have helped individuals who are experiencing problems with gambling, better understand their relationship with money, and helped reduce anxiety.
But Winters acknowledged it is challenge to reach today’s youth, who spend hours each day in front of a screen.
“Adolescents and 20% of adults who played free games moved to commercial games.” she warned. “So, we need to consider the digital world and digital media literacy as a way to educate youth on what they’re engaging with. We also want to focus on emotional regulation, so they don’t look for activities like online distractions to cope with difficult emotions.”
Another study found 34% of video gamers have engaged in online gambling.
She suggested the state needs to start educating young people and debunking myths at an earlier age.
Winters cited a recent survey of understudied populations by East Carolina University’s Gambling Research and Policy Institute (GRPI) that found 46% of college students believed they would eventually win big. Forty percent said they believed they could win back their losses; nearly one-third (32%) believed that gambling would solve their financial problems.
“That’s alarming,” Winters told lottery commission members.

GRPI has created a Betting Blueprint to help educate college students on what is healthy gambling, financial wellness, and how to evaluate risk. The program also helps students understand how social media influencers and loyalty programs are merely marketing tools used to draw them in.
“Sounds like there are a lot of moving parts with emerging trends,” said Ripley Rand, chairman of the state lottery commission. “The information is very helpful.”
The North Carolina Education Lottery contributes $1 million to the state’s problem gambling helpline annually. When sports betting was authorized, the legislature earmarked an additional $2 million for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services’ Problem Gambling Program.
Greg Bowers, chief financial officer for North Carolina’s lottery, said total lottery sales for fiscal 2025 totaled nearly $6.6 billion.
“That represents the highest sales total since our inception. And was $1.2 billion more than sales generated the year before in fiscal ’24,” Bowers told the group. “All of the surplus can be attributed to digital instants sales.”
While traditional lottery sales were down by 6% from the prior year, games played online generated $2.6 billion for the fiscal year, the first full year for this category.
And in August, North Carolinians spent $463 million on paid sports wagering, outpacing August 2024 numbers by about 30 percent.

A new analysis put New Jersey at the top of the list of states without enough funds to cover all government costs and debt obligations. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Half of American states do not have enough funds to pay their bills, according to a new analysis released Thursday. 
The nonprofit Truth in Accounting, which advocates for more transparency in public finance, released its Financial State of the States report. It concluded that 25 states were unable to cover all their financial obligations at the end of fiscal year 2024, which for most states ended June 30. 
While most states mandate balanced budgets, the report says elected officials often use workarounds by excluding exclude certain costs such aslike future pension obligations and deferred maintenance from their budget calculations.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

“This practice essentially shifts these financial responsibilities onto future taxpayers, leaving them to cover the expenses that should have been accounted for in the current budget,” the report states.
In total, Truth in Accounting calculated states hold $2.2 trillion in assets and $2.9 trillion in debts. At $832 billion, unfunded pension obligations are the largest driver of state debts, according to the report. 
Truth in Accounting sorts states based on their ability to cover their debts. The top “sinkhole states” — states lacking the funds to cover their costs — were New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, and California.
Conversely, 25 states touted a surplus of funds relative to their total costs and debts. The top surplus states were North Dakota, Alaska, Wyoming, Utah and Tennessee. 
Rather than funding promises of pension payouts and retiree healthcare, some elected officials in those states have used those funds to keep taxes low and pay for politically popular programs, the report said. That can make a state budget appear balanced, though its debt continues to increase — the equivalent of charging “a credit card without having the money to pay off the debt.”
The report grades the finances of each state, including a look at its total assets, unfunded liabilities and debts. It also calculates the overall costs to each resident: Kentucky, for example, would need $11,500 from each of its taxpayers to pay all of its outstanding bills, according to the report.
Truth in Accounting lobbies for greater transparency in government and has suggested legislation on the matter. The organization says governments should publish budgets that show the full scope of their debts and future obligations. 
“A representative form of government depends on an informed electorate; however, due to current practices in accounting and budgeting, a state’s true financial health is usually obscured, and citizens are deceived or, at best, misled,” the report said. “Without access to truthful, timely, and transparent information, how can citizens be knowledgeable participants in their governments?”

Rep. Brett Guthrie, Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Rand Paul objected to interference by Brendan Carr, chair of the Federal Communications Commission, in the controversy over remarks by late-night talker Jimmy Kimmel about the assassination of conservative leader Charlie Kirk. Their pushback, and that of others, likely led Carr to back off and ABC to reinstate Kimmel’s show, which it had suspended after Carr bluntly intimidated the network and its affiliates.
U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)
Contrary to the beliefs of many Kirk fans, Kimmel said nothing bad about him. On the day of the murder, he used social media to condemn it and send love to Kirk’s family. He said on his show, “The MAGA gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” His second assertion was accurate, but his first rested on a bad presumption that the killer was a MAGA man. There was some evidence suggesting that possibility at the time Kimmel spoke, but it soon proved off base, giving Carr an opening.
Carr said in a podcast interview, “In some quarters there’s a very concerted effort to try lie to the American people about the nature, as you indicate, of one of the most significant, newsworthy, public-interest acts that we’ve seen in a long time, and what appears to be an action, appears to be action, by Jimmy Kimmel playing into that narrative that this was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person.”
Saying he was trying to strengthen the FCC’s enforcement of the law that requires broadcasters to serve the public interest, Carr went overboard: “Frankly, when you see stuff like this, I mean, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or, you know, there’s gonna be additional work for the FCC ahead. . . . There’s calls for him to be fired; you could certainly see a path forward for suspension over this. The FCC is gonna have remedies that we could look at.”
U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)
It didn’t take long for Nexstar Media Group, which is seeking FCC approval of a merger that would violate current local-TV ownership limits, to say that its 20-plus ABC affiliates would stop airing Kimmel indefinitely. The suspension quickly followed, and Carr exulted, “We’re not done yet.”
Not so fast. The next day, Thursday, Sept. 18, Guthrie said “We have to be extremely cautious to not try to use government to influence what people say.” Guthrie chairs the House committee that oversees the FCC, so he probably got Carr’s attention.
Three days later, on “Meet the Press,” Paul said, “Brendan Carr’s got no business weighing in on this. … I’ll fight any attempt to get the government involved with speech.” 
Massie, who has drawn Trump’s ire and an effort to defeat him, called Carr’s remarks “antithetical to the First Amendment.”
The strongest objection came from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who said Carr’s “easy way or the hard way” line was “dangerous as hell” and sounded like the mobster movie “Goodfellas.”
Sen. Mitch McConnell agreed with Cruz. “As a First Amendment guy, I think he’s probably got it right,” said McConnell, who selectively picks his battles with Trump and commented on X after I made an inquiry to his office Monday. He added, “You don’t have to like what somebody says on TV to agree that the government shouldn’t be getting involved here.”
Rep. James Comer replied to my inquiry: “The federal government must never interfere with Americans’ constitutional right to free speech.” Republican Reps. Hal Rogers and Andy Barr, who wants Trump’s endorsement for the Senate, didn’t reply before my Tuesday morning deadline. The only Democrat in the Kentucky delegation, Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Louisville, said, “This administration is blatantly threatening broadcasters’ licenses as a punishment because Donald Trump disagrees with what’s being said about him. That’s a clear case of censorship, it should be disavowed by everyone, and shake our country to its core when we see the President actively silencing his critics.”
Some conservatives say Carr’s remarks were analogous to Biden health officials asking social-media platforms to suppress misinformation that might have made the Covid-19 pandemic more deadly. But they made no gangster-like threats, which our proto-dictator and some of his allies seem to enjoy.
In December, X owner Elon Musk said, “Legacy media must die.” That’s a rejection of the basic concept of the news business, which pays for journalism. (They are separate things.) When the nation’s electronic news business becomes dominated by corporations who stand to gain or lose billions at the hands of the government, and the government pressures them to squelch certain voices, we begin to look more like Hungary than the country we have always known. So let’s be glad some Kentucky Republicans spoke up. And wish they would on some other stuff.

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin criticized the Palmyra Police Department in Jefferson County, saying it is “partnering hand in glove with ICE to carry out this regime’s plan to deport our immigrant neighbors and loved ones.” 
In a statement to the Examiner, interim police chief Paul Blount said the department’s focus is on criminals who threaten public safety and that this is “not a blanket immigration enforcement program.” Blount was not immediately available for an interview. 
“If we find out that we have to participate in that aspect of it, where we’re actually going out, actively enforcing immigration policy and procedure and door to door, looking for undocumented individuals, then I would go on record on saying that we won’t participate in that,” Blount said, according to WISN 12 News. 
He said that the agreement could be what keeps a local police department in the village, due to financial challenges, according to WISN 12 News. He also said there is a $100,000 incentive for the first arrest of an undocumented person that has been involved in a crime or is wanted, and $7,500 for each subsequent arrest. 
According to WISN 12 News, Blount said that if the federal government approves the agreement, he would not move forward without approval from the village board. ICE’s online list currently shows Palmyra as a participating agency and includes Monday, Sept. 22 as the date of signature. 
The Task Force Model serves as a “force multiplier,” according to ICE. It allows officers to enforce limited immigration authority while performing routine police duties, such as identifying a person who is not a U.S. citizen or national during a driving under the influence stop and sharing information directly with ICE. Agencies can carry out immigration enforcement activities under ICE supervision and oversight. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin said the department is “even taking it a step further than other agencies, instituting the most aggressive 287(g) model that gives officers the green light to stop people they think might be immigrants on the street, question them about their citizenship status, and even take them into custody.”
The 287(g) program allows a local law enforcement agency to enforce certain aspects of U.S. immigration law. According to ICE’s online list,  Palmyra is the only police department in the state with a 287(g) agreement. There are 13 Wisconsin counties with a sheriff’s department partnering with ICE. These partnerships use the warrant service officer model or jail enforcement model, which are focused on local jails. 
In the statement to the Examiner, Blount said that if the program is approved, it would allow officers to work in closer partnership with federal authorities. He said officers would gain access to databases and resources that help investigations and help combat serious crimes, such as narcotics trafficking and human trafficking. 
“This is a tool, not a blanket immigration enforcement program,” Blount said. “Our focus is on criminals who threaten public safety — not law-abiding residents. The core mission of our department remains unchanged: responding to emergencies, enforcing traffic safety, and preventing crime in our community.” 
The ACLU of Wisconsin also raised concern about racial profiling. Stateline reported that the task force agreements with ICE were discontinued in 2012 after a Department of Justice investigation found widespread racial profiling and other discrimination in an Arizona task force. 
“This program tears apart communities and instills fear, and we must reject it in Wisconsin and everywhere else,” the ACLU said. 
According to WISN 12 News, Blount said he will ensure there is a policy or procedure in place if the village does move forward so that residents “are protected from being profiled.”

Kevin (Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)Voters in Colorado for decades could be confident their information was secure in the hands of election officials. The behavior of the Trump administration puts that confidence in doubt.
The administration is rifling through voter rolls obtained from states, including Colorado, in a nefarious search for noncitizen voters, even though the purported phenomenon of noncitizen voting is virtually nonexistent. The exercise is really a bad-faith voter suppression effort directed by President Donald Trump and undertaken amid a raft of administration attempts to undermine elections.
While Colorado election officials have taken steps to defend the state’s election system, which experts often laud as the “gold standard,” individual voters can take an active role in protecting their own rights. Authoritarians want the people to be pliant, but Coloradans can refuse to bend.

The Trump administration’s election saboteurs have made Colorado its primary target. Starting in May, the U.S. Department of Justice demanded that states hand over election information, including detailed voter lists and other sensitive data. Colorado received the most sweeping request. A top Justice Department official, citing an unspecified allegation of election record “noncompliance,” demanded that Jena Griswold, the Colorado secretary of state, supply “all records” related to the 2024 election.
At least 36 states received demands for election records, and all 50 states reportedly can expect to receive one. The administration’s mass compilation of voter data might violate federal privacy law, say some election law scholars.
Some state election officials have welcomed the demands. The Republican secretaries of state in Indiana and Alabama have agreed to work with federal immigration officials to search for noncitizens in their own voter rolls. But others have rebuffed the administration. 


Every Colorado voter should apply for confidential status. 


New Hampshire’s Republican secretary of state David Scanlan, citing a state prohibition, said he wasn’t authorized to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter roll. Maine’s Democratic secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, has been the most outspoken election official in rejecting the administration’s attempts to gather voter information. Her response to the DOJ: “Go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The administration’s true aim is to subvert democracy, many election experts argue.
“This isn’t just a clear violation of voter privacy — it’s a major federal overreach and an attempt by a corrupt Department of Justice to attack Trump’s political opponents and undermine our electoral process,” said Ariel Hayes, the executive director of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of States.
Griswold agrees.
“I think the bigger picture is Donald Trump is continuing to try and rewrite the 2020 election and destabilize the ’26 and ’28 elections,” Griswold told Stateline in July. 
However, Colorado did turn over some data to the administration. This comprised two copies of the state’s master voter list — one from 2022 and one from May — and one copy of the master voter history list dating from after the election in November, according to Jack Todd, a spokesperson for the secretary of state.

This is all public information. It includes the names of voters, their residential addresses, birth year, and, if provided by the voter, phone numbers. It does not include a voter’s social security number, driver’s license number, month and day of birth, signature or email address.
Members of the public can buy the statewide voter list and the voter history list for $50 each, but the state gave it to the Department of Justice for free. Unlike elsewhere, such as New Hampshire, where state law precluded release of voter information to the administration, Colorado was legally bound to supply the information, Todd said.
Earlier this month, the administration confirmed that the Justice Department had shared state election data with the Department of Homeland Security in an effort to “scrub aliens from voter rolls.”
Colorado election officials were dismayed by this development.
“DHS has provided conflicting information on this subject,” Todd said in an email. “Earlier this month, Secretaries of State were told by a DHS official that the DHS has not received voter data and would not use such data — shortly before the opposite was reported. The Department is extremely concerned by this communication and that DHS may be actively misleading to election officials.”
Now that their information is exposed to federal agencies that are hostile to their rights, Coloradans can push back. Every Colorado voter should apply for confidential status. The state allows voters to restrict release of their information if they attest to fear of harassment or bodily harm. All Coloradans can now demonstrate a credible risk of harassment from their own federal government, and they can substantiate that fear simply by citing multiple statements from Griswold.
“Trump is abusing his power in an attempt to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box,” she said in April.
“What they’re going to do with all this data, I don’t know … But I’m sure they will use it to push their ridiculous disinformation and lies to the American public,” she said in June.
More than 109,000 Coloradans are already confidential voters. Confidential status might not help voters who appear on the lists already transferred to the administration, but it could protect new voters, and it could safeguard the Colorado electorate if administration mischief persists into the 2028 presidential election cycle.
Coloradans should also monitor their voter status. A page on the secretary of state’s website allows them to check their registration and verify it’s active.
The administration’s demand for voter information is just one aspect of its wide-ranging efforts to make elections less free and fair. Trump is attempting to eliminate mail-in ballots — the kind of ballot that goes to every active voter in Colorado every election. Trump’s recent deployment of National Guard troops to areas of the country led by Democrats is seen by some, such as Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, as a prelude to military patrols around polls next year.
How can people respond to such intimidation?
“Speak up, megaphones and microphones, however you can, and make sure you show up and are absolutely focused on getting to the ballot box and voting,” Pritzker said.
That’s more advice Colorado voters should heed.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)As the Virginia Military Institute’s Board of Visitors awaits the state Supreme Court’s determination on the future of several gubernatorial appointments, the governing board has continued its duties, including making recent, significant changes to its bylaws and modifying the board’s responsibilities relating to diversity and inclusion.
The changes, which also included reassigning mental health oversight responsibilities, come amid pushback by conservatives who oppose diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, specifically in schools, and after the school renamed its DEI office in 2023.
“This is all a routine review of the bylaws, which we do regularly to ensure clarity and compliance with any legal updates,” Sherry Wallace, a VMI spokesperson, replied when asked to clarify the rationale for the changes.
The board moved the responsibilities of “mental and physical health” and “diversity and inclusion” from its Cadet and Personnel Affairs Committee to the renamed Operations and Personnel Affairs Committee.
The committee’s responsibilities now state it “shall have oversight of all matters related to human resources, classified and administrative/professional faculty compensation, inspector general, Title IX, inclusive excellence, information technology, VMI police, and post safety, security, and emergency management.”
VMI published an earlier version of the proposed bylaws, which excluded any mention of diversity and inclusion, last week. The board voted on a second version, published on Monday, during Wednesday’s business meeting.
VMI’s approach to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives has been widely scrutinized since April 2023, when Martin Brown, the state diversity, opportunity and inclusion office director appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, remarked that “DEI is dead” at the institute.
In 2022, Youngkin renamed the state’s DEI office to Diversity, Opportunity and Inclusion. The institution then renamed its office as well, which is “responsible for implementation of the Institute’s inclusive excellence program,” Wallace said.
The Spirit of VMI PAC, a political action committee comprising alumni, parents, and students, has expressed strong opposition to DEI initiatives. 
The PAC urged supporters to “reject the woke assault on VMI,” which ultimately led to the removal of Wins, who had worked to implement DEI reforms and expand related offices.
Virginia state law requires agency heads to follow specific responsibilities regarding personnel management and the establishment of diversity, equity and inclusion strategic plans, which includes creating an infrastructure to “effectively support ongoing progress and achievements” by reporting DEI goals in coordination with the DEI director’s initiatives.
Board Member Thomas Gottwald, appointed by Youngkin, stated that the bylaws have been updated five times in the last four years, noting that “they need to adjust as our practices change and to make sure we stay in compliance with state code.”
He said the revisions are also in realignment with the board’s committee structure and responsibilities, which vary. The board can have up to 16 members. Currently, the board has 10 voting members, all of whom have been appointed by Youngkin. 
The Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections rejected the VMI board appointees, among others, made by the governor, and sued three university leaders over the matter. The administration wants the Virginia Supreme Court to overturn a lower court’s decision that temporarily suspended the appointments of these individuals, along with others at George Mason University and the University of Virginia.
VMI’s list of changes to the bylaws also includes transferring several responsibilities to the executive committee, such as providing advice to the board president on committee structure, appointments and meetings, as well as overseeing the institute’s government relations programs. 
The board voted to rename the External Relations Advancement Committee to the Advancement Committee and added the responsibility of oversight for “all strategic communications and marketing, as well as for coordinating between the Board and the VMI Alumni Agencies for alumni relations initiatives and strategic fundraising priorities.”
The changes include designating up to 30 minutes during meetings for public comment, with individuals limited to three minutes, and eliminating the Nominating and Governance Committee (N&G). The executive committee will take up the N&G committee’s responsibilities. 
Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, a VMI graduate, questioned some of the changes.
“The VMI BOV President, Jamie Inman, appears to be consolidating authority to himself and the executive committee with no oversight,” Carroll Foy said in a statement to the Mercury.
VMI board ousts first Black superintendent in controversial vote

She also questioned the board’s intention to expand the executive committee’s “reach” to include fundraising, which she said “has always been under the purview of the Alumni Association and the Keydet Club.” And, she insisted that the board’s recent action is a “power grab by the VMI Board to significantly change the bylaws and the operation of the board before the next election.”
VMI’s Board of Visitors also welcomed its 16 superintendent, retired U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Gen. David Furness, to his first business meeting on Wednesday. The board announced the Furness’ hiring of the institution’s 16th superintendent last month after ousting Ret. Maj. Gen. Cedric Wins, the first Black superintendent. The updated bylaws will now give the superintendent the authority to call special meetings as permitted by state law.
Previously, special meetings could only be called by the board president, majority vote of the executive committee, or at the request of a majority of board members.

(Photo courtesy Dominion Energy)After the State Corporation Commission heard nearly 100 public comments earlier this month mostly opposing the peaker gas plant the state’s biggest utility wants to operate in Chesterfield, arguments for the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center started Tuesday.
It’s up to the SCC to decide if the project is needed and reasonable for ratepayers to cover. The plant planned by Dominion Energy – dubbed the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center (CERC) – would only run about 37% of the time but the project has neighbors sparring over if it should be built at all. 
Dominion touts the plant as critical to ensuring the grid does not collapse on high-use days amid skyrocketing energy demands, in part due to the growth of data centers in the commonwealth.
“Dispatchable generation resources are an integral component of this solution, and in the near term, this means new gas required resources, including the CERC,” said Joseph Reid, an attorney for Dominion. “It is clear that no single resource will comprehensively address this question, but CERC is an important installment that will meet the need for cold start peaking capacity, and it can be operational within the next four years.”
The 1000 megawatt CERC is slated to be built on the site of a former coal plant just north of the Dutch Gap conservation area, near neighborhoods made up mostly of Hispanic and Black people. The coal plant fully retired in 2018 after burning for over 70 years. There are still two gas units that run year-round on site generating about 420MW of power. Considering these facts, opponents say the planned plant would constitute environmental discrimination.
“The company’s own documents reflect that the gas plant’s operation would emit at least eight other regulated pollutants, and healthcare costs associated with exposure to these pollutants are not included in the company’s economic analysis,” said Rachel James, an attorney for Appalachian Voices and other organizations in the case against the plant. “The Commission cannot ensure that no group of people bears a disproportionate share of any negative environmental consequence of the gas plants construction and operation based on this record.”
The CERC is the first of six proposed gas plants that Dominion says are needed in order to meet the growing energy demands of the commonwealth and the PJM grid at large, which encompasses multiple East Coast states. The CERC will have the ability to power up in a matter of minutes to help ease grid strain on the hottest and coldest days of the year when power demand is highest. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin recently spoke at the multi-state technical conference for PJM, the regional grid provider. He said that relying solely on wind and solar power would not be enough to meet the state’s needs, and added he has been working to expand Virginia’s energy profile into an “all of the above” plan. He has repeatedly joined other governors in petitioning PJM to speed up their process to bring more power projects onto the grid to increase reliability.
“We need energy and power strategies that deliver and being ignored by PJM just flat doesn’t work. … We are working on legislation that will allow Virginia to reassess if Virginia can continue to be a part of PJM,” Youngkin said.
Residents in the area who oppose the plant told the SCC that under the terms of the Virginia Clean Economy Act, the multi-billion dollar project would have to be retired by 2045. They also pointed out that coal ash only recently stopped being released in the community and they don’t want additional pollutants being emitted in the air. They also said they believe the energy needs can be met with solar, wind, and battery storage.
“The commission should also be concerned about the long term implications of approving this project, regardless of how the mission rules here, the VCEA still presumptively requires fossil fuels to retire by 2045 approving a fossil plant of CERC size will make it that much harder to retire the company’s carbon emitting fleet without significant reliability concerns,”  Claire Horan, an attorney representing the Sierra Club, said.
Multiple public hearings for the plant and its air permit application have drawn hundreds of community members and support from some lawmakers, who said they are concerned about being sure the lights will turn on when they flip the switch each day. State Sen. Glen Sturtevant, Del. Mark Earley, and Del. Kim Taylor signed on to testimony for the case in favor of the new plant.
“Our citizens, employers, hospitals, schools, and critical infrastructure require a stable, reliable, and affordable supply of electricity. While renewable sources are an important part of our energy portfolio, they are by their very nature intermittent. During periods of peak demand, severe weather, or low renewable output, natural gas generation is indispensable to maintaining grid stability and avoiding blackouts,” their testimony read.
Conversely, 20 Democratic state legislators signed a letter against the CERC project. Among those on the list are Del. Rip Sullivan of Fairfax, who helped craft the VCEA and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, who is running for lieutenant governor.
“This proposed gas-powered plant undermines Virginia’s commitments to transition to a clean and renewable economy by 2050, ignores the Commonwealth’s policy on environmental justice, and endangers the public health and safety of environmental and fence-line communities,” the letter read.
Dominion is currently building the largest offshore wind project in the county, which is slated to come online in 2026. They also run large utility-scale solar projects. Despite those clean energy investments, the company insists gas must be part of the energy profile to ensure reliability.
The SCC commissioners are expected to make a decision on whether the project can move forward in the coming months.

For solar energy, 2025 is the best of times and the worst of times. It’s the fastest growing energy source in the world and the largest source of new power capacity additions in the U.S. for the fifth year in a row. Even in the absence of tax subsidies, solar is the cheapest source of new electricity in Virginia, and indeed almost everywhere. 
Yet the congressional Republican budget law’s early termination of tax incentives for solar, together with the Trump administration’s determined efforts to restore fossil fuel dominance, make these dark days for the solar industry. The EPA is relaxing pollution standards for power plants and refusing to enforce regulations, and the same law that cut clean energy credits provided tens of billions of dollars in tax subsidies for drilling and mining activities. (What, did you think they wanted to level the playing field?)  
As a result, analysts project a sharp drop-off in solar installations in the coming years, posing a challenge to energy reliability and affordability. With data centers driving up the demand for electricity, the loss of tax credits for solar will mean higher costs for our utilities, and therefore higher utility bills for customers. Virginians who worry about high electricity bills should be very unhappy with the rollback of these incentives. 
 How the rollbacks could push solar forward (at least for now)

Ironically, though, the coming end of tax credits has goosed the U.S. solar market in the near term. The industry has never been busier, as companies scramble to get projects completed in time to qualify for the tax credits before they expire. With careful planning, solar developers will be able to stretch tax credit eligibility to cover projects for a few more years, softening the blow for consumers. 
And in the long term, the solar industry feels confident that the technical and cost advantages of renewable energy will win out in America as they continue to do abroad. Politics and policy aside, utility-scale solar is the cheapest, cleanest and fastest-to-build electricity source available in most of the U.S. The technology continues to push efficiencies up and costs down, while protecting Americans from the pollution and fuel costs of coal and gas. With energy storage technologies following the same price trajectory as solar, it is hard to imagine the U.S. willingly turning its back on clean energy for long.
Data centers approved, solar farms rejected: What is going on in rural Virginia?

In Virginia, of course, utility solar still faces rural resistance. But having embraced data centers, Virginia will have to find the energy to power them, and price has a way of winning out. 
While the solar industry overall will survive, the loss of federal tax credits is landing hard on the segment that serves homeowners and businesses. The economic case for distributed solar has never been a slam-dunk in Virginia, given the higher costs involved. Now the question is whether it can remain even a reasonable investment.
The Virginia solar industry has grown a lot in the past decade and now includes 199 companies employing close to 5,000 workers, almost double the number employed in coal mining. I haven’t seen numbers specific to distributed solar, but installing solar on rooftops is more labor-intensive than utility solar. More importantly, these jobs tend to be local to Virginia, and most don’t require a college degree. 
Distributed solar is also important to our energy supply and resilience. Sunny rooftops could potentially supply as much as 20% of Virginia’s electricity, yet less than 3% of Virginia homes have solar now, leaving plenty of room for growth. Rooftop solar is also a vital component of community resilience; when batteries are added to solar, buildings can remain powered during storms and other events that take down the wider grid. And of course, solar and batteries can form the basis for virtual power plants that support the grid and reduce the need for utility investments. 
 A trifecta of solar success

Three policies have enabled the industry to succeed here, and all three have been subject to attack. The first, of course, is the federal tax credits, which allow owners of solar arrays to recover 30% of project costs through their tax returns. For residential customers, availability of this credit will now expire at the end of 2025. 
The good news is that structuring residential solar installations as leases or power purchase agreements puts projects under a more favorable provision that gives commercial owners of solar panels until July of 2027 to begin construction. This won’t work for everybody, and residential power purchase agreements are currently legal in Virginia only for low-income customers, but it does offer some breathing room. 
The second policy critical for rooftop solar is a Virginia program that lets owners of solar arrays earn money from the sale of solar renewable electricity certificates (SRECs) associated with the electricity they put onto the grid. The Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) requires Dominion Energy Virginia to buy SRECs to meet a small fraction of its renewable energy purchase obligation. Customers with solar who choose to sell their SRECs can offset some of their costs this way, making solar more affordable. (Since SRECs represent the “bragging rights” to solar – the legal right to claim you are powering your home or business with solar – not everyone wants to sell theirs.)
Customers and industry members say, however, that the Virginia SREC market is neither robust nor transparent. The price that Dominion pays for SRECs would have to be substantially higher to overcome the loss of federal tax credits. Some advocates have floated the idea of asking the tech companies to support the distributed solar market through voluntary SREC purchases, which could raise SREC values and help localities build more solar on schools and other public buildings.
A bipartisan-backed bill that Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed this year would have increased the percentage of Dominion’s electricity that must come from distributed solar generation. This would have incentivized more rooftop solar and possibly resulted in higher SREC prices through the normal economics of supply and demand. But so far there is no plan to set a floor on SREC prices.
The third supportive policy for distributed solar is net metering, which ensures that customers of Dominion and Appalachian Power get credited at the retail rate for surplus electricity they supply to the grid. Customers pay the utility only for the net energy they purchase. While this doesn’t make rooftop solar cheaper, it does mean customers don’t actually lose money on their surplus generation, as they would without net metering.
Appalachian Power’s effort to undermine rooftop solar meets stiff opposition

Dominion and APCo have tried repeatedly to undermine net metering, so far without success.
The State Corporation Commission recently rejected a proposal from APCo to replace one-for-one credits with a payment system valuing distributed solar at the utility’s avoided cost for energy – about one-third of retail. The effect on customers would have been severe, making it impossible for most new buyers to recoup the cost of solar panels. In rejecting APCo’s proposal, the SCC cited expert analyses showing that the value of customer-sited solar to the grid and the public equals or exceeds the retail cost of energy. 
Dominion has also filed a proposal to gut net metering in its territory. Its replacement program differs from APCo’s, yet it too results in a greatly reduced compensation rate. The SCC has not ruled on Dominion’s request yet, but it’s hard to see how Dominion could succeed where APCo failed.
Net metering is the rock that Virginia’s rooftop solar industry is built on, so the SCC’s decision preserving the program was critical to the industry’s very survival. Net metered solar will also remain an appealing hedge against rising electricity rates for many people. Still, there is no getting around the fact that losing the 30% tax credit is the kind of blow that can send an industry off a cliff.  
 What’s next

What can the industry, or policy-makers, do to counteract the loss of tax credits?
The most obvious step is for the General Assembly to once again pass legislation increasing the requirement for utility SREC purchases (and this time with the governor signing the bill). The bill has other good provisions, like making residential power purchase agreements legal beyond the low-income market, and these will also help the industry. 
Virginia should also consider adopting a streamlined permitting protocol for onsite solar, as states like Florida have done. Some Virginia localities have already adopted automated permitting software, such as SolarAPP+, a free platform developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Permitting in some other localities, however, reportedly remains so arduous that it adds significantly to costs and delays in installing rooftop solar. 
Speaking of permitting, Virginia could pass a law like Utah’s to allow so-called balcony solar, plug-in solar panels that don’t require professional installation. The kits still require national certification before they can hit the market, however. 
Virginia could devote some emergency preparedness funds to onsite solar and storage at schools and senior centers to make local communities more resilient. These microgrids would save on energy costs for taxpayers and ensure people have a place to go that still has power when the larger grid is down. 
Utilities could once again be tasked with funding solar on low-income housing, as they did in response to Republican-sponsored legislation passed in 2019. Localities could be allowed to require solar panels on parking lots in some new developments, as provided in a bill the governor vetoed this spring. Legislation to increase goals and funding for solar on closed landfills, coal mines and other brownfields would also bring more solar to places where everyone agrees it is welcome. 
Finally, our Department of Energy has done a very good job supporting solar energy through both Democratic and Republican administrations. It could now be asked to convene meetings with the solar industry to plan a pathway to solar on more homes and businesses. They could start with a program of government-backed advertising and outreach to educate more consumers about the value of solar, its cost, and how to hire trustworthy installers. Customer acquisition is one of the biggest costs for solar companies, so reaching potential customers will reduce costs.   
Meanwhile, what can the average resident do? Talk to your elected leaders and candidates and get them to put in pro-solar bills and support the legislation you want to see. If Virginians want more home-grown clean energy,  we need to make it happen.

(U.S. Coast Guard photo) I once sat next to my Air Force three-star general boss in an otherwise empty auditorium in Montgomery, Alabama, listening to two junior officers rehearse a briefing on U.S. space security efforts. At the time, I was the Air War College resident civilian space expert. The two officers tag teaming on statements about U.S. defensive programs also spoke about offensive efforts aimed at particular countries. 
I leaned over and asked the general if we were at war with these countries. 
“Good question,” he whispered back.
“ARE WE AT WAR?” he then shouted out to the briefers.
One firmly answered yes.
The other said no. 
The general was understandably taken aback. “Seems like we ought to have that figured out before going on the offensive,” he replied. 
This happened nearly 30 years ago. But the general could very well make the same common sense statement today, relevant to three U.S. military attacks in the Caribbean that could trigger a war with Venezuela.
The first took place on Sept. 2 when the U.S. military carried out an airstrike against a civilian speedboat the Trump administration said was carrying drugs in international waters off Venezuela, killing 11 people. Then on Sept. 15, a strike on another boat killed three people. A third strike on Sept.19 killed three more people. In each instance, President Donald Trump stated the attacks were against narco-terrorists, members of the Tren de Aragua cartel, on their way to the United States. 
Rhode Island’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, has spoken out against what he calls the illegality of the assaults, calling them “reckless, unauthorized operations” that could “drag our nation into a conflict we did not choose.” Reed pointed out that miscalculation on anyone’s part during or after the attacks could have triggered a war. California’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff further stated that “blowing up boats without any legal justification risks dragging the United States into another war and provoking unjustified hostilities against our own citizens.” 
Questions regarding the illegality of the attacks stem from both international and domestic law. International law allows attacks on a naval vessel in international waters during an armed conflict, which did not apply in this instance, and in peacetime if the vessel is suspected of engaging in terrorist activity, or posing a threat regarding weapons of mass destruction. 
Where drugs are involved, vessels are subject to seizure as part of law enforcement efforts. Using the U.S. military to blow up suspected drug trafficking vessels without any proof of who or what was aboard, offered either before or after the strikes, extends beyond allowable circumstances. 
The Trump Administration has justified the attacks as necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the United States. Preventing and deterring drugs from reaching American shores has been and must continue to be a national imperative. But the U.S. drug crisis — and it is a crisis —  is not only or even primarily one of supply. The global market is lucrative, and dealers could and would go elsewhere were it not for high demand in the United States. Addressing the demand problem is also an issue worthy of immediate and holistic — though largely unattended — government action.
Domestically, questions have been raised regarding whether the attacks were a potential overreach of executive authority, both because the U.S. military was used as law enforcement and because Congress is authorized to take the nation into war, not the president. According to the U.S. War Powers Resolution, passed in 1973 to check presidential ability to conduct military actions without Congressional consent during the Vietnam War, the president is required to consult with Congress before introducing the nation’s armed forces into hostilities. 










This happened nearly 30 years ago. But the general could very well make the same common sense statement today, relevant to three U.S. military attacks in the Caribbean that could trigger a war with Venezuela.


Congress was not involved in decision making prior to the attacks, nor provided much information or transparency regarding the rationale afterwards. After the first two attacks, Democratic Sens. Schiff of California and Tim Kaine of Virginia introduced a joint resolution under the War Powers Act to block the U.S. military from engaging in hostilities with certain nonstate actors without congressional authorization, to little avail. Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a libertarian with a long history of questioning executive overreach, has argued the U.S. can’t simply kill people suspected of wrongdoing without due process.
The recklessness of the actions raises the question of whether the Trump administration was deliberately trying to provoke a military response from Venezuela as an excuse for expanded U.S. military action. During Trump’s first term in office, tensions between the United States and Venezuela reached a point where he asked advisers about invasion as an option. He was strongly advised against it. Trump reportedly has said that invading Venezuela would be “cool.”  Then in March 2025, less restrained in muscle-flexing than during his first term, Trump issued an executive order levying a 25% tariff on countries that directly or indirectly imported Venezuelan oil.  
Oil. The United States has a history of getting into long wars with unanticipated and unintended consequences over oil. 
The number one customer for Venezuelan oil is China. Choking Venezuelan oil hurts China. The U.S. starting a war with Venezuela would have even further direct implications for China. China already voiced its support for Venezuela after the first two attacks, warning the U.S. against “bullying.” Like the renaming of the Defense Department to the Department of War, picking a fight with Venezuela seems at least in part another chest-thumping shot at China.
Starting a war for the administration to flex its political and military muscles would not be “cool” from any perspective because it puts American blood and treasure at risk. If we are not at war — and Congress has not authorized such — then these illegal, provocative, political-theater attacks must stop.

Fani Willis blew it.
Give her credit for this much: The Fulton County district attorney did have the guts, the courage and the ambition to attempt to bring Donald Trump to justice for his role in trying to overthrow the 2020 election here in Georgia. For all we know, Willis might also have had the evidence needed to convict him and his co-defendants, both in the eyes of a jury and in the eyes of the nation. 
But she never got the chance to present her case.
Why?
Because she blew it. Yes, she made a series of questionable calls, but she blew it by starting up a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she hired to help her prosecute the case against Trump, and compounded it by stubbornly mishandling the subsequent scandal. In December, the Georgia Court of Appeals disqualified Willis as prosecutor in the case, ruling that the appearance of impropriety made it impossible for her to continue. Earlier this month, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected her appeal, ending Willis’ involvement and all but ending the case as well.
In fairness, those rulings come off less like reasoned legal opinions and more like attempts to make a controversial, politically awkward case go away. If so, it’s not an unreasonable tack to take. 
But again, Willis has only herself to blame for being in that position in the first place. A local district attorney who is attempting to prosecute a former (and future) president on politically charged crimes had better do everything by the book, showing good judgment throughout, to have a decent chance at success. Even defenders of Willis have a hard time making the case that she met that standard.
When she filed the case against Trump and 18 other alleged co-conspirators, Willis did so under the state RICO, or racketeering conspiracy case. That decision guaranteed that what followed would be a complicated, far-flung case in which a lot could go wrong, especially against top-flight defense counsel attracted by a rich defendant and a crime-of-the-century case. 
Indeed, in an unrelated RICO case involving the Atlanta rapper Young Thug and 27 co-defendants, Willis and her office did nothing to build confidence that they were capable of succeeding under such conditions. The Young Thug trial devolved into a carnival, the longest running trial in state history, and in the end most defendants went free after getting credit for time served.
Last November, Willis won re-election, in part because the Trump and Young Thug cases fell apart too late in the political calendar for major challengers to put a campaign together. She now has three-plus years to try to redeem her reputation and to hope that memories fade.
It’s also important to note that Willis launched her grand-jury investigation into Trump’s attempt to steal the election in February 2021, at a time when federal authorities were showing little stomach for doing so. It should not have been left to a local prosecutor to handle a case of such magnitude and consequence.
If she blew it, then Attorney General Merrick Garland and the federal Department of Justice blew it even worse.

More than 100 central Ohioans protested in front of the Columbus ABC affiliate WSYX ABC 6 in response to Sinclair Broadcast Group choosing not to air Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show after Disney reinstated it. 
Indivisible Central Ohio hosted a free speech protest Tuesday, in response to the Disney Company originally deciding to suspend Kimmel’s late-night talk show “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr threatened ABC on a podcast. The threats came after Kimmel made comments about the murder of political activist Charlie Kirk on the show.
“The MAGA gang (is) desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said during his show last week.

Disney announced Monday it was bringing Kimmel’s show back starting Tuesday night. 
“I am incredibly grateful that Jimmy Kimmel is going to be on television again,” Common Cause Ohio Executive Director Catherine Turcer said at the protest. “But I am scared of how quickly Disney and ABC essentially said, ‘Oh, they’re coming after us. Oh, they’re things that we need from the government. We can’t push back. We can’t actually protect free speech.’ And that decision was really, really painful.”
The canceling of Kimmel’s show led to major backlash, with some people calling it limiting free speech and a violation of the First Amendment. 
“It was scary because this is not what democracy should look like,” Turcer said. “This is not what a functioning republic should look like. … If (President Donald Trump is) willing to go after talk show hosts, do you think they really want us speaking? No … We deserve free speech, and we need to protect it.” 
However, not every ABC station is airing Kimmel’s late-night show.

Sinclair — which owns the Dayton and Columbus ABC affiliate stations — is not broadcasting Kimmel’s show. Instead, those ABC affiliates are preempting the show and airing news programming during the time slot, according to The New York Times. Nexstar said it is pre-empting Kimmel’s show indefinitely. 
“Mr. Kimmel’s remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country,” Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith said last week in a statement. “We believe broadcasters have a responsibility to educate and elevate respectful, constructive dialogue in our communities.”
Sinclair is calling on Kimmel to issue an apology to the Kirk family and make a “meaningful personal donation” to the Kirk family and Turning Point USA. 
“We can all see something that’s funny, hear something that’s funny, and it makes us think more deeply,” Turcer said. “This was an attack on our ability to actually think and work through things, and an opportunity, not just for Jimmy Kimmel to have a voice, but for all of us to have a voice now.”
This is bigger than Kimmel, ABC, and Sinclair, said Gary Daniels, ACLU of Ohio’s legislative director. 
“Free speech does not protect itself,” he said at the protest. “People protect free speech. You protect free speech.”

(Photo courtesy of the Oregon Department of Transportation)States are scrambling for the money to fill potholes, plow roads, maintain bridges and pay bus drivers as they confront inflation- and tariff-driven cost increases and declining gas tax revenues. 
States also face uncertain federal funding as the Trump administration reduces the size of government and zeroes out some Biden-era transportation programs. As the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act expires next year and Congress considers its next transportation funding bill, cities are clamoring for the federal government to bypass states and give cities a larger share of federal infrastructure money distributed by formula. 
Drivers will have to pay higher vehicle registration fees and gas taxes to make up for the shortfalls. Long-planned construction projects and safety improvements will be delayed. And bus riders may see fewer routes and longer wait times.
The chaos in a pair of state legislatures on either side of the country illustrates the dire state of highways and transit systems – and might foretell a bumpy road ahead.
Deep cuts to bus and rail services loom across big cities, small towns

In Oregon, nearly 500 transportation employees, about 10% of the department’s workforce, might lose their jobs as state lawmakers consider a transportation funding bill in a special legislative session. The political balance is so delicate that lawmakers have delayed a vote on a $4.3 billion transportation package for more than two weeks while a Democratic state senator recovers from surgery; his vote is necessary to pass the funding measure, a tax increase that requires a supermajority. The Senate is now expected to vote on Sept. 29. 
And in Pennsylvania, a budget impasse over transit funding between the state’s Republican-dominated Senate and Democrat-led House continues. Philadelphia’s transit system, SEPTA, has said it will reverse deep cuts that threatened a near-shutdown of the  buses and trains in one of the country’s largest transit systems. 
The move, approved by Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, allows the transit agency to shift $394 million from capital funding to operational expenses for the next two years. 
Shapiro said he acted after he learned there was a 63% increase in late arrivals to Philadelphia schools when the service cuts began, according to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star. 
“It was just clear to me that is not something we can allow to continue,” Shapiro said at a news conference.  
Pandemic-era funding ends
Pennsylvania and other states are confronting the end of pandemic-era federal funding that kept transit systems afloat. The so-called fiscal cliff threatens to bring about fare hikes and service cuts to bus and rail systems in both big cities and rural America in the coming years. To address the shortfalls, many states are, like SEPTA, shifting money that was earmarked for capital investment toward operating expenses.  
“It’s financial gymnastics,” said Joe Kane, a fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who studies transportation issues. “We fundamentally as a country have a challenge in reliably and durably having a revenue source to pay for these improvements across the country. It’s put even more pressure on states and localities to cobble together the resources — however and wherever they can — to make up for some of those gaps.”
The funding crisis has been particularly drastic for the country’s transit systems, said Corrigan Salerno, a policy manager at Transportation for America, an advocacy organization for safe transit. Ridership hasn’t fully recovered from pandemic-era declines, he said, meaning that transit agencies aren’t collecting as many fares as they did before 2020. The cost of labor, parts, software and fuel to maintain and operate transit systems has exceeded inflation, too. 










We fundamentally as a country have a challenge in reliably and durably having a revenue source to pay for these improvements across the country. 


– Joe Kane, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies transportation issues


Without high-quality or frequent-enough service, buses and trains are unable to attract riders, he said. Service cuts and fare hikes can make the system less attractive to riders, as well as bring in less money from riders. 
“And that’s really the nature of the fiscal cliff and the death spiral that transit agencies are really trying so desperately to avoid,” Salerno said. “Because once they have to make these service cuts to square their budgets, people are going to stop riding some of these systems.” 
Chicago; San Francisco; Seattle; Tucson, Arizona, and the state of Rhode Island have all faced transit funding gaps in recent months, Salerno said. In North Carolina, voters will consider a ballot measure in November to increase a local sales tax to support transit and road improvements in Charlotte, the state’s biggest city. In California, local transit agencies are seeking temporary operating loans from the state. 
Eliminating bus routes
In Oregon, lawmakers have been at work on a transportation bill for several years, but the funding crisis came to a head after the legislature failed to pass a new spending plan before the end of the regular legislative session in June. 
The state’s Department of Transportation faced an immediate $300 million shortfall in the two-year budget cycle that began July 1. The transit agency for the Portland area, Tri-Met, announced it would eliminate up to eight bus lines as well as reduce the frequency of service on other lines as soon as November. 
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, announced this summer that the state would lay off 483 transportation workers and close a dozen maintenance facilities. Among those who may lose their jobs are programmers who maintain software for Driver & Motor Vehicle Services, and maintenance workers who stripe roads, clear brush, and clean up graffiti and debris. 
Kotek pushed back the layoffs after House lawmakers passed a new funding plan during a special session that began in September. But if the Senate fails to approve the measure, the layoffs are scheduled for Oct. 15. 
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

The transportation package would raise the state gas tax by six cents a gallon, increase vehicle title and registration fees, and temporarily double a statewide payroll tax for transit from 0.1% to 0.2%, according to the Oregon Capital Chronicle. 
The legislation would allow the payroll tax to sunset in 2028, a move that critics warn will force the state, once again, to confront how to avoid cuts to bus service. It also requires electric vehicle drivers to pay a mileage fee to support road maintenance, a move that could dampen EV sales, but that captures some of the gas tax revenue lost to the transition to electric cars.  
Without new funding in Oregon, local road departments will continue to face impossible choices that lead to reduced services and delayed implementation of safety projects, said Lamar Wise, the political director for Oregon AFSCME, the union representing 850 road workers, engineers and surveyors in the state. Failure to increase taxes and fees means asking fewer workers “to do more with less,” putting their safety and the driving public at risk, Wise told a legislative committee in August, as it considered the transportation package.  
“It is about keeping our roads safe and ensuring that the public can count on reliable transportation in every corner of the state,” Wise said. 
In Portland, the state’s largest city, it’s impossible to absorb more cuts to service, Mayor Keith Wilson told the same panel. If lawmakers don’t pass a spending plan, the city will likely lose 50 transportation staffers who repair streetlights, upgrade traffic signals and manage construction projects. The city bureau has faced cuts each of the past seven years, Wilson said. 
“If you drive down the streets of Portland, or ride on a bus or a bike, the roads under your tires are crumbling,” he said.
But Jake Seavert, a county commissioner in Union County, a rural county of 26,000 in Eastern  Oregon, told lawmakers that his constituents object to the spending plan, particularly the increase in fuel taxes and registration fees. The hike in annual registration fees places an undue burden on businesses and rural families who require multiple vehicles, he testified. 
Oregon’s Department of Transportation must look for efficiencies, Seavert said, a nod to the Trump administration’s lacerating cuts to federal jobs and spending. 
“Do more with less,” Seavert said.

Jeanne Shaheen (left) and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin speak at a press conference on Sept. 16, 2025, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)A tax credit used by almost 50,000 in New Hampshire to pay for their health care through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace is set to expire at the end of the year. But congressional Democrats, including U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, have made preserving those credits a key priority amid the spending fight to keep the government open.
“We need to ensure that people can continue to get their health insurance,” Shaheen said in a phone interview with the Bulletin. “It’s important for the workforce. It’s important for our employers.”
If and when the tax credit expires, premiums for those using them could spike dramatically. In New Hampshire, 49,757 people have used the tax credit in 2025, according to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. If the credits expire, a single person in their mid-40s earning $31,300 in New Hampshire annually could see their total annual premiums increase $1,344, according to analysis from New Futures, a New Hampshire-based health policy advocacy group, and Families USA, a national health policy advocacy group. A couple in their 60s earning $90,000 annually could see their premiums increase $14,712, per the same analysis.
The history of the tax credits
In 2010, the Affordable Care Act created the ACA Marketplace, where people from all 50 states could purchase health care coverage. Within that marketplace, people could receive tax credits to subsidize their health care. However, over the years, as the cost of living increased, particularly in states like New Hampshire, lawmakers felt this baseline premium tax credit was no longer sufficient to help people afford coverage.
In 2019, a group of congressional Democrats proposed the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit, essentially an increased credit that covers a larger portion of the cost of health coverage and expands eligibility. Shaheen introduced the legislation in the Senate.
In 2021, after President Joe Biden took office, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which incorporated provisions from Shaheen’s bill to create the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits. However, the bill made the credits temporary until the end of 2022. That year, the credits were extended to the end of 2025 through the Inflation Reduction Act. Unless Congress acts, the increased tax credits will expire at the end of December.
The fight today
In January, Shaheen and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, introduced the Health Care Affordability Act, which if enacted would make the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits permanent. The two senators have tried unsuccessfully to pass the legislation in previous years. This year, the bill has not yet made it out of committee roughly nine months after being introduced.
Meanwhile, Shaheen and Baldwin are working to elevate the issue as Congress debates a stopgap spending plan. If Congress doesn’t come up with a spending plan by Sept. 30, it risks a shutdown of the federal government. Republicans have proposed a plan to keep the government open through Nov. 21 using mostly current levels of federal spending as well as an additional roughly $88 million to increase security for government officials in the wake of conservative pundit Charlie Kirk’s assassination. However, Democrats, including Shaheen, proposed an alternative that would fund the government through Oct. 31 and spend an additional roughly $1 trillion to extend the increased tax credits and reverse some of the cuts Republicans made to Medicaid and other health programs when they passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July.
Neither party has accepted the other’s proposal.
Shaheen told the Bulletin she hopes the threat of a looming shutdown “means there will be incentive for people to sit down and work together and figure out how we can get this done.”
“I think it’s important to keep the government open, and I also think it’s important to ensure that people don’t lose their health care,” she said. “So I think there are lots of ways to do this, but what we need to do is to work together, get everybody at the table and say, ‘These are two challenges that we have. How can we work together to get this done?’”
She argued her constituents want Democrats and Republicans to work together rather than have Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, operate without Democrats’ input.
“That’s what I hear from people in New Hampshire, that they want us to work together,” Shaheen said. “They want us to address the issues facing the country. And this is a perfect example of being able to sit down together and do that. It’s not helpful to have President Trump say to the Republican majorities in the House and Senate, ‘You shouldn’t even talk to Democrats.’ That’s not what people in this country want. It’s in everybody’s interest to work together to address the problems we face.”
Shaheen said she’s open to trying to get the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits extended or made permanent through means other than in a spending plan. While she would like to see them made permanent, she said it’s “negotiable” and would support another temporary extension.
Republicans aren’t completely opposed
Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, expressed openness to extending the increased tax credits, but ruled out doing so as part of legislation to keep the government funded and avoid a shutdown.
“I think that we are open to the conversation about what we do with the Obamacare premium tax credits,” Thune told reporters last week. “That’s something in which members, Republican senators and I think, for that matter, Republican House members, have an interest as well, but this isn’t the place to do that.”
Shaheen said she’s had conversations with Republican colleagues who see a need to extend the credits as well.
“More and more they’re understanding that this is going to have a huge impact on their constituents,” she said. “We’ve heard from two of President Trump’s pollsters who have said if the Republicans don’t get this done, they’re going to pay for it at the ballot box.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shaheenbaldwin-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-25 05:57:32.357310

With the exception of Entergy, which was given a “C” grade, both SWEPCO and the cooperative were given an “F” by the report authors, who cited the energy firms’ trailing adoption of renewable energy sources.
The report evaluated 75 electric utilities nationwide on three criteria: efforts to retire coal plants by 2030, to not build new gas plants through 2035 and to build clean energy through 2035. The 2025 report notes that most utilities it evaluated have “failed to plan for the clean energy transition” since it first began grading in 2021.
The average score of the graded utilities was an “F” this year — a drop from consistent “D” grades in the first four years of the report. While 65% of graded utilities have improved the clean energy component of their ranking since 2021, overall, 51% have seen their overall score worsen since the 2021 report due to many also “doubling down on fossil fuels.”
“This year, the U.S. faces dual pressures: a shift in federal support away from clean energy due to the effective elimination of much of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and a surge in projected electricity demand, also known as load growth,” the report says.
Despite these pressures, the report says it is imperative that utilities still transition away from fossil fuels by 2035, as “the window of opportunity to create and implement cost-effective plans is closing.”
Entergy’s score, which dropped considerably compared to its “A” on last year’s report, was in large part due to the impending shutdown of two coal plants in the coming years and its plans for additional solar and wind generation, the report said. The Sierra Club said the utility could score better “if it’d focus on renewables more than expensive gas generation to address future load growth.”
Entergy announced in July plans to build a 754-megawatt natural gas-fired generating plant near its White Bluff coal-fired power plant in Jefferson County, which is scheduled to stop burning coal in 2028.
In response to a request for comment on the Sierra Club report, Entergy Arkansas spokesperson Matt Ramsey said the utility “is maintaining our goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.”
The Sierra Club criticized the utilities it ranked for not moving faster to adopt cleaner alternatives to coal, especially as increases to the cost of electricity outstrip overall inflation. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, electricity bills in the South increased 6.7% in the 12-month period ending in August. The region’s overall inflation rate over the same span was 2.6%.
The Sierra Club called out Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. specifically for having “one of the lowest renewables scores in the entire United States,” with the club saying this was due to AECC not having any planned solar or wind power despite projected increases in demand.
An AECC spokesperson said the cooperatives use a “balance of power approach” in order to provide customers with reliable power, and criticized the Sierra Club’s efforts to “prematurely” shut down the coal plants.
“While the preferred generation of Sierra Club, neither wind nor solar generation resources are capable of providing the necessary reliability, at an affordable cost, to serve as replacement generation for these important baseload generating assets,” Marine Glisovic wrote in an emailed statement. “AECC will always continue to meet its obligation to serve in a responsible manner that meets all state and federal environmental regulations and remains an advocate for reliable, responsible, and affordable power for present and future generation of its members.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/power-plant-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-25 05:57:32.357310

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/25/ct-unions-break-talks-lamont-past-due-raises/,"State employee unions continue to spar with CT Gov. Ned Lamont over raises, with two more bargaining units breaking off talks late Wednesday.","State employee unions continue to spar with Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration over past-due raises, with two more bargaining units breaking off talks late Wednesday with the executive branch.
Correction officer supervisors and education professionals both declared impasses, bringing to six the number of units that now can seek arbitration over wages and working conditions.
“Governor Lamont doesn’t know what it’s like to work inside these facilities every day — and his latest offer makes that clear,” said Lt. Thomas Titus, president of the Correction Supervisors’ Council.
Titus didn’t disclose specifics of wage or other proposals but added, “we won’t accept a lowball offer. Our members have earned fair pay and we’re going to keep fighting for it.”
Union leaders have said the Department of Correction is dangerously understaffed and employees often are pressed into excessive, mandatory overtime.
The department accounted for $118.8 million or 38% of state agency overtime spending last fiscal year, according to the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis.
Jennifer Corti, president of the unit representing education professionals in five state agencies, said workers likely will be stretched thinner in the coming years as Connecticut grapples with huge cuts in federal assistance.
“Our members, and the people we serve every day, deserve to know that Governor Lamont is serious about protecting Connecticut from the fallout of federal chaos,” Corti said. “So given the stakes, and the lack of progress at the table, declaring impasse and moving toward arbitration is now the only responsible option.”
The governor has countered repeatedly that state employees have received raises every year since he took office in January 2019, and that would continue under the new agreements.
“There shouldn’t be any confusion” among workers about the administration’s desire to award raises, Lamont said shortly after four unions broke off talks in mid-July. “They know we have well over $100 million earmarked in this budget. They know that we’ve said, ‘You’re going to get a raise.’”
Lamont, a Democrat, has been accused by Republican legislators and conservative groups of being too generous with state employee compensation.
During the past four fiscal years, all unions have received annual cost-of-living raises of 2.5%. And all but the most senior workers remain eligible for a yearly step hike as well, which reflects increased experience and typically adds another 2 percentage points to the value of the raise.
Thirty-five bargaining units, which represent the overwhelming bulk of state government’s 40,000-plus workforce have been negotiating new wage hikes since January. And they’ve been working under expired contracts since July 1.
The lone exception is the state police troopers’ union. Lamont negotiated a 2.5% cost-of-living hike plus a step raise for that group last spring, and legislators ratified the deal in mid-May.
The governor, who is expected to seek a third term in office next year, has been at odds with most of his labor base this year, despite assurances that raises are forthcoming.
The union representing 1,300 probation officers, information technology analysts, assistant clerks, counselors and other judicial branch support staff announced July 2 it would seek arbitration.
Six days later, two more bargaining units, representing judicial marshals and their immediate supervisors, also ended talks. In all three instances, labor officials charged the administration was offering $2,000 one-time payments in lieu of ongoing raises. The governor’s office countered there had been a misunderstanding and that ongoing raises were on the table.
Still, a fourth bargaining unit, representing rank-and-file correction officers, declared an impasse on July 16.
Contract negotiations typically address work conditions and other issues besides compensation. And though neither side has discussed negotiations in this area, talks were expected to include one particularly sticky point: working from home.
The governor and many Republican legislators in recent years have expressed increasing concerns over remote-work rules, which were established shortly after COVID struck Connecticut in spring 2020. Unions have been reluctant to alter those work-from-home rules, arguing they have helped many workers become more productive.
Union leaders and the fiscally moderate governor don’t see eye-to-eye over controversial budget caps that have generated unprecedented surpluses in recent years. Connecticut has used those caps, which Lamont strongly supports, to generate an extra $8.5 billion to reduce its pension debt. Labor officials, and many of Lamont’s fellow Democrats in the legislature, counter Connecticut is saving too aggressively for its pensions, leeching needed dollars away from education, health care and other core services.
And tensions between the governor and some unions also have been heightened recently by Lamont’s interest in investing state pension assets in the Connecticut Sun to keep the WNBA franchise in the state.
Council 4 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the single-largest union in state government, representing more than 14,000 workers, released a statement last week urging Lamont to suspend that effort and focus on wage negotiations.
“State employees have been without a contract since July,” Jody Barr, Council 4’s executive director, said Wednesday, adding that the two sides have been negotiating wage and working conditions since January. “They think that this governor’s focus should be at the table negotiating for his employees.”
The Connecticut Police and Fire Union joined that debate late Tuesday, also urging Lamont to put basketball on the backburner.
“Enough is enough Governor Lamont,” the union wrote in a statement posted to its website. “Return to the table with us. Finish our contract, give our members the confidence their future will be secured, and let’s stop losing our people to municipalities and career changes. Until all our members can feel protected by their contract and retirement agreements, any discussion about investing our pension funds should be ceased.”
The union represents about 950 police, fire and other public safety personnel who protect state colleges and universities, office buildings, mental health facilities, airports and parks. It’s members also include Department of Motor Vehicles testing officers and state liquor control agents. The union does not include state police troopers.
But the governor said earlier this week that Council 4’s objections weren’t giving him pause.
“No, I think their concerns were probably more about a contract than the Connecticut Sun,” he said. “But more importantly, it’s a good investment, and I can tell you that the treasurer wouldn’t do a deal regarding the Connecticut Sun if it wasn’t a good investment.”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Despite Ohio only having one candidate per party receiving widespread support, many decisions still need to be made ahead of the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Ohio Republicans continue to rally behind their candidate for governor.
“It’s now Ohio’s turn to lead the way,” Ramaswamy said during an event he hosted with U.S. Senator Jon Husted in Columbus on Monday evening.
More than a year before the Nov. 2026 election, and months before the primary, Ramaswamy has continued clearing the path as he tries to succeed Gov. Mike DeWine.
Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel, who previously expressed interest in running for governor, bowed out Friday.
“I believe that our crucial opportunities in the areas of education and workforce deserve my full attention for the remainder of our term,” Tressel wrote on social media.
That leaves Ramaswamy as the only candidate in the Republican primary race with widespread support. Now, he has laid out his priorities, which include making Ohio more attractive to people, eliminating the income tax, and promoting economic and educational development.
“It is a top goal for me to make sure that our young people actually remain in this state rather than moving out to pursue opportunity elsewhere,” Ramaswamy said.
On the Democratic side, COVID-era health director Dr. Amy Acton remains the most prominent party candidate in the race.
“I will always be focused on Ohioans and whatever it takes to move them forward and solve the issues that affect their everyday lives,” she said in an interview with WEWS last month.
But former Congressman Tim Ryan has been floating a run for governor, with his team saying he would decide by the end of September.
“I am not one for hypotheticals,” Acton said when asked about Ryan. “We’re very, very excited by how we’ve been received, certainly, setting records for any Democratic candidate.”
While the Democrats figure out their candidate, the next step for Ramaswamy is to choose his second-in-command. He left an event on Monday without taking questions from reporters, but he’s previously told us he will be working with the legislature on all of his policy ideas.
“That’s the type of leadership we need to build upon the foundation that we’ve already set in this state to make us not just the best in the Midwest, but the best in the entire country,” Senate President Rob McColley (R-Napoleon) said after the event.
Strategists have continued to suggest McColley could be Ramaswamy’s running mate because he can navigate the lawmakers.
McColley said the decision was up to Ramaswamy when asked whether the Senate President would be the best fit, given his role in leadership.
“My enthusiasm is behind him no matter what as a candidate, because he has the ability to have that bold, transformative leadership that’s going to take this state to the next level,” McColley said.
The only other names consistently mentioned by strategists are Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague, Secretary of State Frank LaRose, state Sen. Kristina Roegner (R-Hudson), and former state Rep. Jay Edwards. Sprague is running for secretary of state, LaRose is running for auditor, and both Roegner and Edwards are running for treasurer.
Of the five, McColley was the only one to attend the event on Monday. The others were asked what their priorities would be as lieutenant governor and if they had been communicating with Ramaswamy’s team.
Sprague’s team declined to answer questions but said he had a scheduling conflict. Neither LaRose nor Edwards replied.
“I am honored that my name has been mentioned,” Roegner said. “I have great confidence in Vivek’s leadership and look forward to his governorship. While speculation may continue, my full commitment right now is to winning the Treasurer of State office.”
Although he hasn’t announced that he is running for another position due to being term-limited in the Senate, McColley could potentially run for Congress, as strategists from D.C. have said he is being courted to run for District 9 against longtime Democratic U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur.
McColley was asked by WEWS on Monday about the potential to face Marcy Kaptur.
“You love asking speculative questions that are based off of rumors and innuendo and everything like that,” he said, smiling. “I suppose it’s your job to do that, but I don’t really have any comment on any of that. I, at this point, have kind of told people, ‘Look, I’ve got to figure out what I want to do when I grow up.’”
The president continued that he is evaluating all options.
“I don’t know what that’s going to be,” McColley said. “I might just go back and be a lawyer in Northwest Ohio. We’ll see what it looks like, but it’s just been a pleasure to serve in the Ohio Senate as president, and we’ll see what the future holds.”
Gubernatorial teams need to be announced by February.
Other candidates who have started campaigning for governor include Republican Philip Funderburg, Democrat Jacob Chiara, and independent Tim Grady. Heather Hill had previously announced she would run as a Republican, but later stated she would run as either a Libertarian, an independent, or a member of Elon Musk’s America Party — a party that is not yet recognized in Ohio.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Imagine a protest outside the funeral of a popular political leader, with some of the protesters celebrating the death and holding signs that say things like “God Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11,” “America is Doomed,” and “Don’t Pray for the USA.”

No matter the political leanings of that leader, most Americans would probably abhor such a protest and those signs.
What would tolerate such activities, no matter how distasteful? The First Amendment.
The situation described above is taken from an actual protest, though it did not involve the funeral of a political figure. Instead, members of the Westboro Baptist Church protested outside the funeral of Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder, a U.S. service member killed in Iraq.
Through demonstrations like this, members of this group were conveying their belief that the U.S. is overly tolerant of those they perceive as sinners, especially people from the LGBTQ community, and that the death of U.S. soldiers should be recognized as divine retribution for such sinfulness.
Snyder’s family sued for intentional infliction of emotional distress, among other claims. A jury issued a $5 million jury award in favor of the family of the deceased service member. But in a nearly unanimous decision issued in 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the First Amendment insulated the protesters from such a judgment.
This holding is particularly instructive today.
The Trump administration has vowed to crack down on what it calls hate speech. It has labeled antifa, a loosely organized anti-fascist group, a terrorist organization. And it has sought to punish figures such as TV host Jimmy Kimmel for statements perceived critical of conservative activists.
What the First Amendment makes clear is that it does not just protect the rights of speakers who say things with which Americans agree. Or, as the Supreme Court said in a separate decision it issued one year after the case involving the funeral protesters: “The Nation well knows that one of the costs of the First Amendment is that it protects the speech we detest as well as the speech we embrace.”
But free speech is not absolute. As a legal scholar who has studied political movements, free speech and privacy, I realize the government can regulate speech through what are known as “reasonable time, place, and manner” restrictions. These limits cannot depend upon the content of the speech or expressive conduct in which a speaker is engaged, however.
For example, the government can ban campfires in an area prone to wildfires. But if it banned the burning of the U.S. flag only as a form of political protest, that would be an unconstitutional restriction on speech.
Protected and unprotected speech
There are certain categories of speech that are not entitled to First Amendment protection. They include incitement to violence, obscenity, defamation, and what are considered “true threats.”
When, for example, someone posts threats on social media with reckless disregard for whether they will instill legitimate fear in their target, such posts are not a protected form of speech. Similarly, burning a cross on someone’s property as a means of striking terror in them such that they fear bodily harm also represents this kind of true threat.
There are also violations of the law that are sometimes prosecuted as “hate crimes,” criminal acts driven by some discriminatory motive. In these cases, it’s generally not the perpetrator’s beliefs that are punished but the fact that they act on them and engage in some other form of criminal conduct, as when someone physically assaults their victim based on that victim’s race or religion. Such motives can increase the punishment people receive for the underlying criminal conduct.
Speech that enjoys the strongest free-speech protections is that which is critical of government policies and leaders. As the Supreme Court said in 1966, “There is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of (the First) Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.”
As the late Justice Antonin Scalia would explain in 2003, “The right to criticize the government” is at “the heart of what the First Amendment is meant to protect.”
Restrictions on government action
The First Amendment prevents the government from taking direct action to curtail speech by, for example, trying to prevent the publication of material critical of it. Americans witnessed this in the Pentagon Papers case, where the Supreme Court ruled that the government could not prevent newspapers from publishing a leaked – and politically damaging – study on U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.
But it also applies when the government acts in indirect ways, such as threatening to investigate a media company or cutting funding for a university based on politically disfavored action or inaction.
In 2024 the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the state of New York’s efforts to punish companies that did business with the National Rifle Association because of the organization’s political positions violated the group’s First Amendment rights.
Similarly, in recent months, courts have ruled on First Amendment grounds against Trump administration efforts to punish law firms or to withhold funds from Harvard University.
And just last week, a federal court in Florida threw out a lawsuit filed by President Trump against The New York Times seeking $15 billion for alleged harm to the president’s investments and reputation.
Nevertheless, some people fear government retribution for criticizing the administration. And some, like the TV network ABC, have engaged in speech-restricting action on their own, such as taking Kimmel temporarily off the air for his comments critical of conservative activists in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s killing.
Before Kimmel’s suspension, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr described his negotiations with ABC’s parent company, Disney, to take action against him. “We could do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said. And Trump said that some media companies might “lose their license” for criticizing the president. It is encouraging that, in the face of these threats, ABC has reversed course and agreed to put Kimmel back on the air.
The First Amendment protects speech across the political spectrum, even speech Americans do not like. Both liberal comedian Jon Stewart and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson have recently agreed on this. As Carlson said recently, “If they can tell you what to say, they’re telling you what to think. … There is nothing they can’t do to you because they don’t consider you human.”
Just last year in the NRA case referenced above, the Supreme Court clearly stated that even indirect government efforts to curtail protected speech are indeed unconstitutional. In light of that ruling, efforts to limit criticism of the administration, any administration, should give all Americans, regardless of their political views, great pause.

They made the changes with two provisions — one, a so-called ‘piggyback’ homestead exemption, and the other, a nearly 1 mill (or 0.1%) rollback of the county’s inside millage.
The move comes as Ohio lawmakers wrangle over several proposals to rein in property taxes, and a property tax working group set up by Gov. Mike DeWine finalizes its set of proposed fixes. Lawmakers still haven’t given up on overriding the governor’s property tax vetoes from the budget. All the while, organizers continue collecting signatures for a constitutional amendment repealing property taxes.
Commission President Don Dixon said Ohio’s property taxes are a mess, and it’s state lawmakers’ job to clean it up.
“Commissioners have no legislative authority. We can only do what the Ohio Revised Code says we can do,” Dixon said. “The responsibility to fix it, clearly, is only in the hands of the state legislature.”

The county’s changes
In a press release, Butler County officials said they’ve returned roughly $50 million to homeowners through their most recent rollback, and two previous reductions in 2022 and 2024.
The piggyback homestead exemption will give seniors and permanently disabled homeowners in Butler County a little more breathing room. The standard statewide homestead exemption shields the first $28,000 of a homeowner’s appraised value from taxation. The county’s piggyback exemption effectively doubles that protection.
“We felt that the homestead reduction would help seniors and those, you know, on the edge,” Commissioner Cindy Carpenter said. “That additional, whatever the amount is, $100, $200 a year, makes a big difference to some people.”
The county’s inside millage cut brings their rate down from 1.92 mills to 1 mill for taxes they’ll collect next year. For a hypothetical home with a taxable value of $100,000, that reduction would take their tax bill from $192 to $100. The rollback will only be in place for one year, reducing the amount of property tax revenue the county collects in 2026.
Commissioner T.C. Rogers said he hopes the proposals demonstrate to Butler County residents that, “we hear you, we work for you and we give back to you.”
“Even a drunken sailor”
Dixon argued the changes were necessary because the county, like many others in Ohio, is buckling under the pressure of rising home values. Following its most recent triennial update, Butler County’s median home value rose by 37%.
“I mean, even a drunken sailor would be able to realize that these numbers are just astronomical,” Dixon said. “And no one, even if you had your own printing press, could keep up.”
In an email, County Auditor Nancy Nix warned those increases weren’t a one-time thing. Her office has been working all year on the upcoming 2026 re-valuation, which will impact tax bills in 2027. She expects values to climb another 13% to 25%, which could translate to tax increases of as much as 15%.
Dixon expressed frustration that lawmakers balked at overriding DeWine’s vetoes over the summer. Instead of overriding three provisions, the House voted on one. The Senate hasn’t weighed in yet.
“There’s a process to override that veto. It takes 60%, and I’ll be damned, they couldn’t even get 60% to support their own legislation,” he said. “So, if you don’t think that’s a mess, I don’t know what a mess is.”
Dixon promised to lead a group from Butler County up to the state capitol “to show those folks that look, you just can’t pat us on the back and tell us thanks for coming and do nothing.”
Dixon also said county leaders “have a card to play” at the ballot box. While organizers gather signatures to repeal property taxes, he threatened to start collecting signatures for an amendment of his own. He didn’t share specifics but suggested there should be “guardrails” to limit tax increases.
“One way or another, we’re going to have to fix this,” Dixon said. “We’re not going to sit here and take it quietly. We’ve played by the rules, went through all the proper procedures and got lied to, and lied to, and lied to, and now it’s time we take a stand and this is it.”

Small solar-panel kits that can be assembled as easily as an Ikea bookcase and plugged into a regular residential outlet could be coming soon to New Hampshire and Vermont. Lawmakers and advocates in both states are preparing legislation that would make these plug-in solar systems accessible to residents who don’t have the space, money, or inclination to install a larger, conventional rooftop array.


“It’s really about energy affordability,” said Kevin Chou, cofounder of Bright Saver, a nonprofit that advocates for the adoption of plug-in solar. ​“It’s about access for people who wanted solar but haven’t been able to get it.”


These systems — also called ​“portable” or ​“balcony” solar — generally come in kits that even a novice can put together at home. They plug into a standard outlet, sending the power they generate into a home’s wires, rather than drawing electricity out.


Unlike rooftop arrays, plug-in systems don’t generate enough power to meet all, or even most, of a household’s needs, but they offset enough consumption to pay for themselves within four or five years, even without incentives like tax credits or net metering, Chou said. Models now on the market start at about $2,000. If the equipment becomes more popular and prices come down, the payback period could get even shorter.


“You don’t need any subsidies to make this work,” Chou said. ​“The pure economics are so attractive, it’s one of the best investments you can make.”


These systems have taken off in Germany, where more than a million have been deployed, but have been much slower to catch on in the United States.


Recently, though, the idea has gained traction in the U.S. In March, Utah lawmakers, working with Bright Saver, unanimously passed a law authorizing and regulating the equipment, making it the first state to lay out the welcome mat for plug-in solar. Last month, a Pennsylvania state representative announced plans to introduce a similar law, and Bright Saver is having conversations with lawmakers in about a dozen additional states about possible legislation, Chou said.


All of the legislative proposals follow the same principles as Utah’s law: They would define a new class of small, portable solar systems, and establish the right of households to use the systems without submitting applications or paying fees to the state or utilities. They also define safety standards for the systems, including that they be certified by Underwriters Laboratories, or UL, a company that sets standards and provides safety certifications for a wide range of products.


At the moment, two manufacturers make plug-in solar systems with inverters that have been certified as complying with safety requirements, Chou said. Because the market for portable solar is so new, however, UL has not developed standards for entire systems.

(Leigh Vogel/Getty Images for National Women's Law Center)Most Americans assume that schools are legally required to protect students from sexual harassment and assault under Title IX — the federal law enacted in 1972 that bans sexual discrimination in education.
I am a law professor and researcher who has spent more than a decade examining the disconnect between what Title IX promises on paper and what students expect it to deliver in practice. What’s happening now isn’t just another policy shift — it’s a dismantling of protections many assume still exist.
 
Title IX’s 37 words
The main text of Title IX is just 37 words and reads: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
This legal text doesn’t define sex or discrimination, or explain what kinds of behavior the act covers. For decades, the Department of Education filled in those gaps by writing detailed rules, providing guidance to schools and investigating when schools failed to comply.
In 2020, the Trump administration adopted much narrower rules. Colleges and universities have to act only when top officials — such as deans or Title IX coordinators — receive a report, and even then, their responses only have to avoid being “clearly unreasonable.”
In 2024, the Biden administration tried to widen those protections by requiring schools to step in whenever employees other than doctors and therapists learned of possible harassment, and to do so promptly and effectively. But in January 2025, a federal court blocked those rules before they could take effect.
Today those less protective 2020 rules remain in place, and the agency responsible for enforcing them is being dismantled.
In March 2025, President Donald Trump ordered the Department of Education to close. Legally, an executive order cannot abolish the department outright. That would require an act of Congress.
But the order has still reshaped the agency in practice by cutting staff and shuttering offices. The Office for Civil Rights, which handles Title IX and other discrimination complaints in schools, was especially hard hit. About 260 employees were laid off, and seven of its 12 regional offices were closed, even though more than 6,000 investigations were unresolved as of January.
A federal judge has since ordered those employees to be reinstated, with staff scheduled to return in phases through November 2025. It is not clear how these and other changes are going to affect how the office functions.
 
A system under strain
Beyond the headlines about layoffs, the deeper question is what happens when students turn to Title IX for protection.
The Heritage Foundation’s long-term vision provides a clue: Project 2025 proposes to move the Office of Civil Rights into the Department of Justice and limit its role to litigation of intentional discrimination cases.
While Trump distanced himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, his Cabinet includes authors of this policy blueprint. And in less than a year, the administration has moved forward with nearly half of Project 2025’s goals, including over 40% of the policies aimed at the Department of Education.
If the Department of Education can no longer resolve discrimination complaints within the agency, students will be left to pursue their claims directly in federal court. But the numbers show why that path cannot absorb the caseload.
In 2024, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights received 22,687 discrimination complaints, including nearly 12,000 related to Title IX. By comparison, federal courts in 2024 nationwide heard fewer than 1,000 education-related civil rights cases.
Federal courts are understaffed, and even if federal judges had the capacity to absorb 20 times more cases, most students simply cannot afford that path. Lawsuits demand lawyers, months of preparation and often years before any resolution.
The Office for Civil Rights offers something fundamentally different from going to court. It provides low-cost investigations, mediation that could resolve cases in weeks instead of years. Its settlements address not just individual harm but institutional failures.
Some cases drag on, but students do not need lawyers, and the OCR often secures broader reforms through negotiated settlements — from campuswide training programs to complete overhauls of complaint procedures.
The office also published policy guidance and answered more than 11,000 public inquiries in 2024, providing clarity for schools and students alike. These tools didn’t eliminate the backlog, but they showed that the OCR could deliver meaningful results without the cost and delay of court.
But this system is exactly what’s at risk if Project 2025’s vision becomes reality. If the OCR loses its authority to resolve complaints, students will lose the only clear path to quick, affordable results and reliable information.
 
What this means for students
For schools and their students, that shift away from federal agencies would be dramatic. It would mean no more negotiated agreements, no more policy guidance, and no administrative investigations into systemic issues. Courts would decide what Title IX means, forcing students to file expensive lawsuits that drag on for years and require much stronger evidence of discrimination than the Office of Civil Rights ever demanded.
The administration has offered an alternative: “return our students to the states,” as President Donald Trump put it on March 20, 2025, when he signed the executive order outlining his plan to close the Department of Education.
But states cannot fill the enforcement gap left by eliminating the Office for Civil Rights’ role in resolving complaints and guiding schools. The OCR had the infrastructure to investigate cases, mediate disputes and issue clear policy guidance — capacities that most states simply do not have.
State laws addressing sexual discrimination in education vary dramatically — some provide strong protections, while others offer only limited coverage or lack enforcement mechanisms altogether. Kansas, for example, has antidiscrimination laws that do not explicitly cover education, leaving it unclear whether any state agency can investigate student complaints.
And in half the country, LGBTQ+ students still lack explicit statutory protection. In practice, that means a student’s rights depend less on Title IX itself than on where they happen to go to school.
The problems run deeper than just inadequate alternatives. Even under the current system, protections are already narrow: Schools must act only if complaints reach officials with the power to make institutional changes. A report to a trusted coach, professor or resident assistant may lead nowhere. When schools do respond, the standard is remarkably low — acknowledging a complaint or opening a limited investigation often satisfies legal requirements.
These narrow protections are becoming even less reliable as transparency erodes. The Department of Education stopped updating its public list of investigations in January 2025 and only resumed in June, after months of silence. As of August 2025, just 10 resolutions involving sexual discrimination at colleges had been posted — and half predated Trump’s second inauguration. Without accurate information, students have little insight into whether schools are being held accountable at all.
 
The narrowing scope of federal protection
Title IX was written to ensure equal educational opportunity regardless of sex. But weak regulations, enforcement delays and shrinking federal oversight are steadily eroding that promise.
For students, the reality is stark: telling the wrong person about a complaint may trigger no response; minimal efforts by schools often satisfy legal requirements; and the federal agency once charged with oversight is being sidelined. If a litigation-only model takes hold, most students will have no realistic path to relief unless they can hire a lawyer and withstand years of court proceedings.
As I further explain in a new law review article — “No Department, No Enforcement” — Title IX remains law, but without meaningful enforcement it risks becoming a guarantee in name only. For students, that means rights promised but rarely delivered.

Millard Tawes Crab and Clam Bake to trade barbs and make political points, an annual pilgrimage repeated Wednesday.","Gov. Wes Moore (D) fist-pumps Wednesday for a crowd of his supporters at the J. Millard Tawes Crab and Clam Bake in Crisfield. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/ Maryland Matters)They came to Crisfield by boat and by car, moving in packs with bused-in entourages, or in quiet solitude.
Pulled by tradition and strict electoral calendar observance, candidates for governor — the announced, the filed and the explorers — arrived at a patch of marina blacktop Wednesday that is home to the J. Millard Tawes Crab and Clam Bake. The annual event draws locals for a day of crabs, corn and beer and it draws the political class from far-flung corners of the state who come to crack crabs, kibitz and talk political smack.
That started with Gov. Wes Moore (D), who name-checked a growing list of potential Republican challengers to his 2026 reelection before dismissing them for refusing to speak out against President Donald Trump (R) and his policies.
“We’ve heard nothing from them,” Moore told reporters. “So, to be honest, it kind of doesn’t matter to me who gets in the race, whether it’s Andy Harris or [John] Myrick or [Steve] Hershey or [Larry] Hogan … because they’re all saying the same things when it comes to lifting up the people of Maryland and defending the people of Maryland, which is absolutely nothing.”
Hogan was the only one on Moore’s list who was not in attendance Wednesday. For more than a decade, the two-term former governor was a mainstay at the event, a consummate retail politician. But not this year, despite talk that he might make an appearance in the tent of Annapolis power lobbyist and Tawes booster Bruce Bereano.
But Hogan was still part of the Tawes conversation.
Sen. Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore), who is exploring a run for governor, said he has “had a number of people ask about it and ask me how the exploratory aspect of it is going.”

“You know, we’re doing well. We’re getting a lot of people interested,” he said, before adding, “I think a lot of people are still waiting to hear what Gov. Hogan wants to do.”
When asked if he was among that group waiting on Hogan, Hershey said: “Yes.”
Hershey entered Somers Cove Marina through a back entrance, and did not bring a campaign with him. Not so Moore,  who arrived at the event by boat, fresh off a tour of Smith Island.
The governor, who announced his re-election bid two weeks ago, was joined by Lt. Gov Aruna Miller, who did not join her running mate on the boat but quietly mixed in with the throng following Moore. That included several dozen not-so-quiet supporters decked out in campaign shirts and signs, chanting in support of Moore.
“This is grassroots,” Moore said of the supporters, some of whom said they were bused to the event from Prince George’s County and Baltimore City.
The crab feast – in its 48th year — is named for J. Millard Tawes, a former governor and state comptroller who hailed from Crisfield. Once a fundraiser for Tawes, the event has since morphed into a fundraiser for the Crisfield Chamber of Commerce.
For decades it has been a popular destination for political leaders — especially in election years — and regular folks. This year’s event is the last before the 2026 primary next June.
Before arriving Wednesday, Moore sought to bolster his bipartisan credibility by releasing a list of Republicans who support him.
“We actually have a series of Republican lawmakers who represented over 200,000 Marylanders and who are coming out and saying that despite the fact that I happen to be a Democrat, and they happen to be a Republican, that they are coming out to support our re-election,” Moore said. “And it is because we have kept to our word to leave no one behind.”
Washington County Commission President John Barr and Rising Sun Mayor Travis Marion are on the list of Republicans endorsing Moore, along with two Allegany County officials, Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton and Lonaconing Mayor Jack Coburn.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Also on the list were former Del. Carl Anderton and former Carroll County Commissioner Ed Rothstein. Moore’s release did not mention that both now have jobs within his administration: Anderton was named director of rural strategy in the Maryland Department of Commerce last year and Rothstein was named secretary of the Department of Veterans and Military Families in July.
“So, in other words, a paid political announcement by employees of Wes Moore,” Hershey said.
Moore dismissed the critique as “ridiculous.”
“I understand that there are people with fledgling campaigns they are trying to get off the ground. It’s not my job to try to lift them up. My job is to support the people of this state,” he said. “So, when I hear ridiculous comments and I’m asked for comment, my comment is I don’t have a comment.”
Anderton said his support rose from Moore’s efforts to assist a regional airport and medical center.
“That was enough for me right there,” Anderton said. “A friend in need is a friend indeed. He’s never denied us. To me, that’s value.”
Moore dissent
As Moore’s crowd chanted — clad in their matching T-shirts, with their matching signs — a few counterprotesters emerged from the tents nearby, including Don Howell, a bearded Eastern Shore resident wearing a “Jesus” T-shirt, with a sticker for Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) attached.

The “We want Moore” chants, he said, were interrupting his time feasting on steamed crabs and talking with friends.
“He’s already taken all my money,” Howell said of the governor. “Now he wants to take my conversations?”
The 68-year-old, who lives in the Eastern Shore’s Mount Vernon, near Princess Anne, said he supports Republican John Myrick in next year’s gubernatorial contest, in part because of Myrick’s “commonsense” approach to pocketbook issues. He pointed to Myrick’s proposals for property tax credits for retirees.
“I’m a senior citizen, and I’m trying to survive on Social Security. My wife still works, but it’s hard,” Howell said. “Our electric bills are going sky high.”
Howell argued that Moore has funneled money to “illegal aliens” and energy affordability programs, wasting a surplus handed down by Hogan. He decried recent increases in government fees, including for car registrations and hunting licenses.
“You’re a thief!” he shouted as the governor passed by. “You’re a criminal! You don’t belong in government, you belong in jail!”
He also yelled “Go back to Prince George’s County” at Moore’s chanting supporters.
Myrick came to Tawes for the chance to take shots at Moore, as he angles for a general election face-off. He brushed off concerns about a potential primary challenge from Hogan.
“I entered this race for a general election race. That man is my opponent,” he said, pointing toward the governor, who was close by. “I really don’t care about what Gov. Hogan does.”
Myrick, a Prince George’s County resident who grew up in Harford County, said he is canvassing around the state, including stops on the Eastern Shore.

“The people that I’m hearing on the lower Eastern Shore have been forgotten about for a long, long time. The only time the politicians seem to come down here is the Tawes event,” Myrick said.
Even though Moore included Harris on his list of potential opponents, the eight-term congressman from the Eastern Shore said Wednesday at Tawes that he will not be jumping into the fray.
“We do need a governor — not a presidential candidate — to run the state,” Harris said, poking Moore over persistent gossip that he wants to run for president. “But I’m not going to run for governor.”
Harris said he is taking his time when it comes to deciding who to endorse in the governor’s race, in part because Maryland has two former Republican governors who would be eligible to run again: Hogan and Robert Ehrlich. The filing deadline for the race is not until Feb. 24.
“There’s obviously at least one or two very high-profile former governors who don’t need to file early,” Harris said. “So, look, I’m waiting until February to see what happens.”
Harris, a staunch supporter of Trump, backed the president on several issues Wednesday. He said the administration raised “valid concerns” that the effort to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge with federal dollars will follow state law requiring minority-owned business participation.
He also said he stands by Trump’s effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy, though it has meant some 15,100 Marylanders have lost federal jobs since January. Harris pointed to the Moore administration’s voluntary separation offers for state employees in response to the state’s budget crunch.
“I don’t understand why he’s criticizing the president. He’s doing exactly the same thing in the state for state employees,” Harris said.
Harris also attacked the Moore administration for fee increases engineered to address the state’s budget crisis.
“The governor can go around saying he provided some minuscule tax break on income taxes, whereas every Marylander who opens up their car registration renewal understands that the fees are out of control,” Harris said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1313-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-25 02:57:05.438235

(Photo courtesy of Rita Gomez)When I was growing up in Pensacola, the local radio station often ran ads for a tire repair business whose slogan was, “Tires ain’t pretty.” I thought of that simple declaration this week when I heard the story of a big fight in Dunnellon over used tire disposal.
The person who told me the story is a woman in her 70s named Rita Gomez. She lives on a 30-acre parcel of land with a horse, a herd of cattle known as Zebu, and quite a few gopher tortoises. She’s far enough out in the country that her driveway is a mile long.
Next door to her is a 15-acre homesite whose owner has posted a sign calling it his “Black Fortress.” The primary feature of Black Fortress: its walls. They are made of stacks and stacks of black tires — truck tires, tractor tires, you name it.
It looks like someone invaded a Krispy Kreme to stack a bunch of the donuts on top of each other in rows. There are more than 1,500 tires forming this immense fence, perhaps as many as 2,000, Gomez said.
The property owner, whose name is Derek Peoples, has surrounded his entire property in Marion County with the stacks of used tires. Each tire is filled with dirt, mulch, or even (pee-ew!) horse poop, Gomez told me.
Now Peoples has begun lining his driveway with them too, she said.
“Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,” Robert Frost once wrote. I think that goes double for a wall made of smelly old tires.
“There is no justifiable reason for this environmental hazard in our community to continue to exist,” Gomez told me.
She sent me pictures of the tires as well as a photo of a sign that Peoples placed in front of the property advertising that it’s a government-run site. But it’s not.
“It is incorrect to claim your property is either a government facility or a solid waste facility,” an official of the state Department of Environmental Protection wrote to Peoples in February. The DEP informed him that his sign “is not accurate or correct” and warned him not to bring in any more tires.
So far, the sign is still there, and Gomez says she’s seen him bringing in more tires, too.
Still, Peoples’ fortress-like farm fence is far from the worst way that Floridians have disposed of old tires.

Like the moon
Tire disposal has been a problem ever since part-time Florida man Harvey Firestone first sold a set to go on one of part-time Florida man Henry Ford’s Model Ts.
The original plan was just to junk them. Toss those bald tires in the nearest landfill! Fill it to the rim with radials!
By the 2000s, there were some 300 million used tires thrown on the scrap heap annually, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But they would routinely fill up with rainwater, breeding mosquitoes and attracting rats.
As another option, you could burn them.
But tire fires “often become major hazardous incidents affecting entire communities — frequently requiring neighborhood evacuations and long, drawn-out fire extinguishing operations” the EPA noted. “In 1983, a 7 million tire fire in Rhinehart, Va., issued a plume of smoke 3,000 feet high and nearly 50 miles long with air pollution emissions deposited in three states. It burned for nine months, polluting nearby water sources with lead and arsenic.”
Then someone came up with an even worse idea.
Beginning in the 1960s, people around Florida began lashing old tires together and dropping them in the water offshore to create “tire reefs.” Millions of tires went into these offshore sites over the next 30 years.
“At the time, it was thought that tire placement would increase reef populations, promote tourism and fishing activity, and improve habitats for fish species with minimal economic or environmental costs,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported.
Except it turns out the tire reefs were actually harming both the fish and the waterways. Oops!
“Unfortunately,” NOAA said, “after years of monitoring, scientists determined artificial tire reefs often have not improved fish populations as intended, and the tires have instead caused significant environmental harm. Tires can leach toxic chemicals into the water and can degrade into smaller particles, contributing to microplastic pollution.”
Osborne Reef via U.S. Navy
The most notorious tire reef in Florida is the Osborne Reef off Fort Lauderdale, which consists of more than 1 million tires. They’re damaging a real coral reef nearby, too.
A diver interviewed by NPR in 2007 described the underwater Osborne scene this way: “It’s like the moon or something. It’s weird. It doesn’t look like anything you can imagine. It’s just tires for as far as you can see down there.”
Dedicated divers have been steadily pulling the old tires out, but by one estimate there are still 500,000 left out there. Completing the cleanup may take another decade.
A similar but smaller disaster happened off Pinellas County.  Evidence of what could go wrong cropped up just last year.
“A reef project from the 70s is turning into an environmental problem in Pinellas County as old tires wash onto the beach,” WTSP-TV reported in December. “Back-to-back hurricanes dislodged the tires, which were placed in the water decades ago to create artificial reefs.”
NOAA has awarded Pinellas a $2.2 million grant to clean up the mess it created, a process expected to take at least two more years.
OK, so piling the tires up in a landfill is bad. Burning them is bad. Dropping them offshore is bad. How about grinding them up and turning them into your child’s playground?
Nope. Turns out that’s bad for the kiddies.
“Children playing on tire crumb could potentially be exposed by ingestion of the product directly, by ingestion of surface water runoff through the product, by inhalation of dust, or by skin contact with the material or surface water runoff,” a 2005 study found.
Steven J. Laux via UF
I contacted Steven J. Laux, a solid waste expert at the University of Florida, to ask if there was any safe way to dispose of old tires. He said recycling works. The shredded components can become part of a new road, he said, meaning you could use new tires to drive on old tires. Your new tires could contain bits of old tires, too.
Because I am a curious guy, I checked. Guess where the biggest tire recycling plant in Florida is located: Marion County.
And I don’t think their perimeter fence is made out of Michelins, either.
Chicanery and clear springs
Dunnellon was founded more than a century ago amid some deliberate chicanery.
The town founder was a close-mouthed Ocala banker named John Dunn (where the “ellon” part came from, I don’t know). In 1890, he worked with the elaborately mustachioed Albertus Vogt and a chemist named R.R. Snowden to secretly amass as much acreage as possible after Vogt discovered a phosphate deposit while sinking a well.
They managed to pull together 13,000 acres, dug up as much phosphate as they could excavate, and shipped it out via river and then railroad. So many people showed up hoping for a piece of the action that Dunnellon got the unlikely nickname “Boomtown.”
By the 1920s, the phosphate deposit had played out, and the mining moved southward to Polk County. Little Dunnellon hung on, but just barely. In an official history of the city, the next significant event mentioned is the on-location filming of the 2001 horror movie “Jeepers Creepers”
Rainbow Springs State Park via Florida Park Service
To me, though, Dunnellon’s finest feature is Rainbow Springs State Park, which began life as a privately owned tourist attraction in the 1930s.
he Bahama Belles performing at Rainbow Springs via Florida State Archives
The park offered glass-bottom boat tours, waterfalls built atop the old phosphate mines, and a monorail. You could enjoy watching a swim team called the Bahama Belles and even an occasional mermaid like at Weeki Wachee Springs.
But that rodent-oriented theme park in Orlando drew most would-be visitors away, and the new interstate bypassed the region, making the tourist tires turn elsewhere. In 1974, the Rainbow Springs private attraction closed. It reopened as a state park in 1995.
Needless to say, the main attraction remains the crystal waters. But Rainbow Springs, like many springs around the state, is now facing some serious problems, including nitrate pollution and decreases in the historic flow due to over-pumping of groundwater.
Now add “contaminated tire runoff” to the mix, and you can see why using tires to build a wall might be a problem.
Don’t tread on me
I tried multiple times in multiple ways to contact Peoples, the Fortress Builder, but he didn’t respond to my calls, texts, or emails.
I read in some Marion County court records that when a process server tried to hand him a notice about being sued by a bank, he told her she was trespassing and ordered her off his property.

On the other hand, the somewhat confusing sign on his fence specifically says, “No Trespassing, Harassment, Threatening Violence or Lying Against Sanctioned Government Facility Will Result in Criminal Prosecution, Charges, Fines and Tort. You Will Lose. This Sign Is Exhibit B.” (No mention of what Exhibit A might be.)
Instead of “Black Fortress,” perhaps he should have just posted a picture of a bald tire with the slogan, “Don’t Tread On Me.”
I asked Rita Gomez how the tire wall got started four years ago.
“One day he dropped one tire,” she recalled. Gomez asked Peoples’ wife what was going on, and remembers her saying, “Don’t worry about it, this has nothing to do with you.”
But of course, it has had everything to do with the neighbors and the whole community.
Gomez told me when she saw what he was building, she began making repeated complaints to both Marion County and the state DEP. She was particularly steamed when she saw that the wall of tires was blocking the path of a threatened gopher tortoise.
I contacted both DEP and Marion County code enforcement about what’s happening with this literal embodiment of the “tires ain’t pretty” concept.
“The property owner originally used a limited number of tires filled with soil as planters and barriers,” Sarah Fayed of the DEP told me via e-mail. “In 2021, DEP issued a letter outlining limited beneficial use, but this was not intended as a perpetual authorization.”
After that February letter that told Peoples to stop bringing in tires, “any new tires placed since that time are not authorized by DEP,” she wrote. “DEP continues to monitor the matter and will evaluate next steps as appropriate.”
And Marion County spokesperson Stacie Causey told me that Peoples’ ever-growing tire collection is the basis of “an open investigation” for code enforcement.
Gomez shared with me a text that Peoples sent her four years ago, after getting wind of her first complaints about what he was doing. He threatened a lawsuit that he never filed.
“You all cannot dictate what we can do on our land,” he told her.
Yet, as any student of American civics knows, your local government’s zoning code and state and federal environmental regulations can and should dictate what you do or don’t do on your property.
That’s because — despite all the Florida politicians we’ve heard ranting and raving about the importance of property rights — what you do on your property can affect everyone around you, either via the air or the water. There is no “right to pollute” in either the state or federal constitution.
Legally speaking, this is where the rubber meets the road.

The Gov. Ned Lamont rightly vetoed HB5002 due to opposition from towns who were concerned about overreach and implementation. 
There is a way forward without a heavy handed, top-down bill that does not recognize the variety in the state.
One of the issues from HB 5002 was that it was a mash up of 30 something bills that do not seem coordinated for implementation. Fair share was included, but does not recognize private market middle housing for improving supply nor pricing of housing. Fair share seems to prioritize large, multi-million-dollar complexes from distant owners and managers of property that many of whom seek government grants and tax deferrals/abatements. 
The rest of us do not qualify for those benefits and the distant owners may not care one iota about what they leave behind. Some of these projects are started to falsely pretend to be housing when they are really natural resource extraction, leaving towns with no way to actually enforce the construction of the project they changed the zoning rules for.
Our country was founded on free will and choice. Political polarization is often the result of one perspective telling others how they need to live their lives, despite being in different circumstances. Whether the culture wars of the right, or progressive admonitions of the left, resentment is bred among half of the population. There is a better way.
In the 2023 and 2025 sessions, Montana decided to build housing like we used to, with much less restrictive zoning. Some zoning is good but perhaps has become too stringent in the 21st century; nullifying meeting the needs of people now, vs 50 years ago. Many people like the old town centers and cities that were mixed use, intensively developed, walkable with a variety of retail and service providers readily accessible. That is not for everyone, but a choice that many would like to have again.
The 2023 session in Montana outlined potential 15 changes for municipalities of over 5,000 people to consider and required adoption of five. That lets towns decide what plan is appropriate for their residents and includes all sorts of ideas to expand affordable housing. Whether detached or attached, subsidized or not, cheaper housing all shares lower land cost from increased units/acre and smaller construction cost per unit. 
Choice is the key to acceptance by the general public that elected leaders are listening to their constituents.
Montana’s 2023 session SB 382 required towns to adopt five of the following 15 changes:

Allow for at least two residential units per lot on the majority of land zoned residential
Allow mixed-use zoning
Zone for increased density near transit, employment, higher education, and other appropriate population centers
Provide decreased parking requirements
Reduce/eliminate local fees for development including housing
Allow Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU) in all zones
Allow single room occupancy developments
Create Community Land Trusts and rezone those Land Trust Lands to higher density
Reduce or eliminate impact fees for ADU’s
Allow triplex or fourplex residential units/lot
Reduce or eliminate minimum lot sizes
Reduce or eliminate aesthetic, material, shape, bulk, size, height, floor area, and other massing requirements
Provide zoning that specifically allows or encourages the development of tiny houses
Reduce or eliminate setback requirements
Allow residential development in all areas zoned to allow office, retail, or commercial development as a permitted use.

I do not walk in each person’s shoes in Connecticut, and do not expect carte blanch acceptance of this list; however, as the Chair of the Independent Party of Connecticut, I firmly believe in the party’s commitment to listening to the best ideas no matter where they originate. 
I believe Montana’s approach is a good start to revise HB 5002 to a bill that can pass and be accepted by the majority of stakeholders including homeowners, renters, state and local government, developers, property managers and landlords. 
Our problem with the cost of housing and the availability of housing in the state is solvable when you have the right leaders in the room representing every stakeholder and collaborating as empathetic peers to drive towards the best outcomes. 
More choice and market-driven solutions will solve the housing problem, not government largesse.  Looking to other states for inspiration can provide us with a proven path forward that could be adopted to let all Connecticut residents have the life they aspire to.

Comptroller Sean Scanlon estimates somewhere between 103,000 to 171,000 people could lose their Medicaid coverage due to $13 billion in cuts over the next decade, and the state could pay as much as $173 million a year just to maintain current SNAP services.
Access Health CT, the Affordable Care Act program, also estimates a loss of up to 50,000 enrollees by 2034 due to higher costs, and it could run $32 million a year to offset lost federal subsidies.
This threatens a maternal and infant health safety net that Connecticut legislators and public health agencies have been working on for years, marked most recently by legislation tackling issues ranging from birthing centers to maternal mental health.
And for us this situation heightens concern that the rate of infant deaths may rise, reversing an overall decline in Connecticut infant mortality rates since 2015, even though racial disparities persist – Black infant mortality rates are three times higher than white – and Medicaid coverage for Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska native peoples is also three times higher.
The threats from this increase would be both health-related and societal.
If women become uninsured, their access to prenatal care is reduced, putting them at higher risk for preterm birth and low birthweight babies.  And this risk cascades: preterm birth and low birthweight babies are also at greater risk for Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID), a sleep-related cause that includes Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), unknown causes, and Accidental Suffocation and Strangulation in Bed. It is the number one cause of death for U.S. infants in their first year of life.
The societal threat is that greater stress will be put on daily life under social determinants of health and the families who navigate it. Economics, systemic racism, limited access to resources, and other factors are the backdrop against which decisions regarding infant sleep are made.
The Office of Child Advocate names unsafe sleep-related death as number one in preventable infant deaths in Connecticut, with no decline in ten years. The American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep guidelines have babies sleeping on their backs alone, on a firm, flat surface with no bedding or loose materials to reduce the likelihood of unsafe sleep-related death. However, parents or caregivers exhausted from work and childcare may instead place their crying infant in bed with them, either out of lack of knowledge, or desperation.
Connecticut lawmakers are “getting it” that maternal and infant health depends on an integrated safety net to counter the health and societal pressures, but many enacted programs are still in development stages. And now hospitals face declining Medicaid reimbursement and reduced provider taxes. The new federal law will offer some rural health provider funding, termed “modest” by Scanlon.
Nonetheless, Connecticut must do whatever it can to safeguard its maternal and infant health infrastructure. This includes applying for the $50 billion five-year Rural Health Transformation Program, and meeting in legislative special session this month to assess shortfalls and how the Rainy Day fund and general fund surplus can help offset them. SNAP changes hit in late 2026 and Medicaid in 2027, effectively around the corner.
This may also be the time to change Connecticut’s infant safe sleep public health messaging.
In 2015 Connecticut legislated that hospital maternity facilities provide written safe sleep guidelines based on American Academy of Pediatrics standards. But a 2020 study found that while there was no significant change in SUID or SIDS rates post-legislation, more infants died from positional asphyxia than before. Study authors suggested that the effectiveness of this legislation should be re-examined.
Our organization has been teaching AAP safe sleep to health care professionals since being a part of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-led Back to Sleep campaign in the 1990s, which cut national SIDS rates by 50%. Rates have since largely levelled off, while racial disparities have grown.
These facts have made us re-evaluate our effectiveness and make changes to reduce rates of unsafe sleep-related death. Today we take a community-based approach to meet with families where they work and live, in partnership with trusted community members  – doulas, social workers, lactation consultants – as well as peers.  The sessions are regular, informal, non-judgmental yet purposeful in talking about safe sleep, breastfeeding, and family challenges and needs. We also collaborate with hospitals to meet in NICUs.
The qualitative research feedback on our programs indicates positive changes in awareness and behavior around caregiver decisions as to how and where an infant sleeps, indicating a community-based approach could be an effective addition to the public health messaging to bolster Connecticut’s maternal and infant safety net.

Chris Murphy’s call to ban private capital investment in Connecticut’s healthcare system.
Recent cases of mismanagement of healthcare facilities in the state clearly show what can happen when bad actors put profits ahead of patients. Hospitals are left in limbo, patients are left without access to care, and the vulnerable communities they serve are left to pay the price. However, not all private investment is created equal, and we must not overlook the positive role that responsible private investment continues to play in the healthcare ecosystem.
Across the country, responsible investors have stepped up to secure access to healthcare for patients by rescuing struggling healthcare facilities. By introducing innovative and tech forward approaches to treatment and providing administrative support that stabilizes operations, private capital can give providers the tools they need to focus on patients. That is the difference between exploitative practices and sustainable investments that truly strengthen our healthcare infrastructure.
Take for example, American Family Care (AFC). With the help of private capital investors, AFC has grown into one of the nation’s most successful urgent care providers, with 16 centers serving Connecticut communities. By leveraging advanced technology for billing, record keeping, and patient services, AFC provides patients with convenient, affordable, and accessible care when they need it most.
Senator Murphy has rightly called out cases of mismanagement and we support efforts that would address these specific issues. However, painting all private capital with the same brush risks doing more harm than good. A balanced approach is needed to differentiate between bad actors and responsible investors.
Connecticut shouldn’t rush to curtail much-needed private investment and overlook the many examples of responsible investors that put patient-centered care at the forefront of their operations. We welcome the opportunity to discuss how to navigate these complexities while fostering the responsible private investments that provide a needed lifeline to struggling facilities and improve patient care.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A national free speech watchdog is calling for a Montana State University-Northern professor to return to work after she was placed on a leave of absence following social media comments critical of Charlie Kirk.
The issue in Havre highlights the conservative firestorm over how people talked about the late right-wing influencer’s career. A movement immediately following Kirk’s death sought to expose those who spoke in ways they perceived to be negative of right-wing influencer, which was fanned by U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and got late night host Jimmy Kimmel suspended from his show.
Kirk, who was 31 at the time of his death, was a controversial right-wing influencer noted for his reach among young people and as a passionate defender of free speech.
High-profile right-wing influencers targeted Montanans for social media posts they made in the days that followed Kirk’s death. This has led to threats against people and businesses across the state as well as suspended a professor.
Samantha Balemba-Brownlee, an associate professor at MSU-Northern in criminal justice, was put on leave by the school earlier this month following comments she made on Facebook critical of Kirk.
This led to a letter in her defense from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression to MSU-Northern last week. Balemba-Brownlee’s comments were also included in the letter.
“Not condoning violence, but maybe people are sick of the garbage he spews, perhaps?” they read in part. 
She also wrote, “He was a misogynistic, racist, homophobic, xenophobic a–hole. He spread hate. He harmed society. He cut down women at every turn. No, I do not mourn the man.” And “Update: He died. Aw shucks. Thoughts and prayers.”
The organization sent the letter to Greg Kegel, the school’s Chancellor, on Sept. 17, asking for a response by Sept. 23. 
 MSU-Northern did not respond to a request for comment.
A spokesperson for the state board of regents said they do not comment on personnel matters.
“If MSUN chooses to ignore its free speech obligations and punish protected faculty speech, it will open the door to censorship of countless views on campus and chill others from sharing their opinions,” the letter reads. “Both of these outcomes are unacceptable at an institution bound by the First Amendment.”
The letter also added that any criticism of Balemba-Brownlee’s comments was also protected speech.
“To be sure, this principle does not shield Balemba-Brownlee from every consequence of her speech — including criticism by other students, faculty, or the broader community,” the letter reads. “Criticism is a form of the ‘more speech,’ the remedy that the First Amendment prefers over censorship. But MSUN’s obligations under the First Amendment limit the types of consequences it may impose, and investigating faculty for their protected expression clearly violates that commitment.”
Much of the issue was stirred up on social media and Balemba-Brownlee received death threats, Lee Newspapers reported.
In the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s death, conservatives — especially online influencers — began to track negative or perceived bad-taste comments made about Kirk’s life. 
One of the biggest names was Chaya Raichik, who posts online as “Libs of TikTok” and boasts 4.4 million followers on X. Raichik posted about Balemba-Brownlee on Sept. 17.
“Samantha is allegedly not even a U.S. citizen!” Raichik wrote in a post that showed the Facebook comments and reached more than a half million views. “Her visa should be REVOKED @StateDept @SecRubio We do not want foreigners who justify m*rder in our country!”
Raichik’s claim could not be verified. Balemba-Brownlee did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
An hour before her MSU-Northern tweet, Raichik posted about a Billings teacher, Dan Johnson. Raichik posted a screenshot of a Facebook post from Johnson.
“Charlie Kirk’s death is literally chickens coming home to roost. Rouse me for something worth anyone’s time,” reads the screenshot of a post, purportedly written by Johnson.
Raichik tagged the Billings school district in her post. Inquiries to the Billings Public Schools sent by the Daily Montanan went unreturned. Johnson did not immediately return an emailed request for comment.
The social media whiplash against criticism of Kirk in Montana was not limited to teachers, state employees were targeted too.
In yet another post, Raichik went after an employee of the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services.
“Keith Leathers is a Child Support Investigator for the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services,” Raichik wrote. “He reportedly posted “He was a white nationalist. He isn’t worth remembering.” Our tax dollars pay his salary. What’s @DPHHSMTdoing about this?”
The DPHHS did not immediately return a request for comment. When reached, Leathers said he was not sure if he was cleared to speak to a reporter. Raichik’s DPHHS post got more than 200,000 views and quoted a post from a local far-right news source, the Missoula Sentinel. 
In a post on its website, the Sentinel collected more than a dozen screenshots from various people in Montana criticizing Kirk.
Businesses in the state were targeted too, including Five on Black in Missoula and a coffee shop in Bozeman. 
An account with nearly 70,000 followers, posting with the handle “@Missus_Massacre” posted about both Montana businesses. Those posts spread over the right-wing social mediasphere, with one quoted by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani that included the Bozeman coffee shop’s phone number. 
In Missoula, a Five on Black employee shared a meme laughing at Kirk’s death, leading to backlash. The Missus_Massacre account posted a screenshot of the employee’s post, and included the name as well as the addresses and phone numbers for both Five on Black locations.
That post was seen more than 400,000 times and Five on Black’s owner, Tom Snyder, responded on X, saying he had a “direct and difficult” conversation with the employee, but would not be firing him.
Snyder then spoke to threats that had followed.
“My staff and I have been flooded with angry calls, hateful emails, racial slurs sent to my personal email, and hundreds of one-star reviews,” Snyder wrote. “Young employees, both right leaning and left leaning, feel nervous coming into work, worried someone will come in angry or threatening. A 20-year-old employee cannot be expected to field hundreds of abusive calls.”
Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte addressed negative comments of Kirk in a statement on X. He also brought up a 2023 law that prohibits employees from being fired for social media posts.
“It’s disgusting to see people using their freedom of speech to celebrate Charlie Kirk’s murder on social media and further divide our country,” Gianforte’s statement reads. “I swore an oath to uphold the laws of Montana and our Constitution, including the freedom of speech, regardless of how vile it is.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kirkmemorialservice-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 23:58:09.777777

Buttgereit struggled to afford health coverage after her husband’s death and was uninsured when she slipped on some ice in Montana and broke her arm. The surgery bill was nearly $98,000, well above the initial estimate the hospital provided. (Parker Michels-Boyce for KFF Health News)As soon as she fell, Deborah Buttgereit knew she couldn’t avoid going to the hospital.
“I could hear the bones moving around in my elbow,” said Buttgereit, who was 60 when she slipped on a patch of ice in December outside her apartment in Bozeman.
Emergency room scans showed she had fractured her left arm near the joint. Doctors told her she needed surgery to repair it.
At the time, Buttgereit didn’t have health insurance — she had struggled to afford coverage after her husband’s death. The local health system, Bozeman Health, estimated Buttgereit would have to pay $50,560 out-of-pocket for the outpatient surgery to have her elbow pieced back together.
The estimate noted: “You could be charged more if complications or special circumstances occur.”
Four days after her fall, Buttgereit went in for surgery, which took about three hours. During a follow-up visit, she said, her doctor told her the procedure ended up being more complicated than expected.
Then the bill came.
  The Medical Procedure 

Buttgereit broke her humerus, the upper-arm bone that meets two other bones and forms the elbow. The way the bone splintered is known as a distal humerus fracture. It’s rare as far as breaks go, accounting for only about 2% of all fractures among adults. But older people, as well as kids in high-contact sports, are more prone to the big falls that lead to such fractures. The injury is painful and can make it impossible to move the elbow.
Some of these types of fractures heal with time in a splint, but most often surgery is the only fix. The patient is put under anesthesia while a surgeon repositions fragmented bones with plates and screws.
  The Final Bill 

$97,998. That includes at least $44,300 for the operating room and anesthesia administration, plus more than $50,000 for medical supplies and implants, such as screws and plates. After the hospital applied a self-pay discount, Buttgereit was on the hook for $78,398.40.
  The Problem: Surprise Complications, Surprising Charges 

The hospital said the price for Buttgereit’s surgery increased because doctors encountered complications midprocedure.
In particular, the fall had shattered Buttgereit’s bone into more pieces than her surgeon anticipated, according to operating notes. That meant it took more time, skill, and supplies to reconstruct her elbow. And, since she was uninsured, Buttgereit alone faced the burden to pay the higher costs.
“I’ll make payments the rest of my life to pay it all off,” she said.
Buttgereit’s husband died suddenly in 2023. About a year later, she left her job with the company that had employed them both. The memories of him in that space were too difficult, she said. That also meant leaving behind her health coverage. She moved to Bozeman to be closer to one of her daughters and found a health plan at healthcare.gov that the federal government subsidized because of her limited income.
But she also faced a higher cost of living in Bozeman than her Social Security benefits could cover, and she needed part-time work. While that new income helped pay her bills, Buttgereit said, she no longer qualified for the same level of subsidized coverage and couldn’t afford her plan. So she dropped her health insurance.
About two months later, she fell.
After getting the surgery bill, Buttgereit began calling and emailing the hospital’s customer service team, asking how the price had risen from the $50,560 estimate to nearly $98,000. The hospital had automatically applied the self-pay discount of $19,600 to Buttgereit’s bill — 20% of the total. But that still left her with a tab of more than $78,000.
After more time to think pain-free, she said, she also wanted to know why the initial estimate was much steeper than those she found online for similar procedures.
Specifically, Buttgereit asked how to dispute her bill. When she felt she wasn’t making progress contesting the charges with the hospital, she asked about her options under the No Surprises Act, a federal consumer protection law.
According to emails reviewed by KFF Health News, a Bozeman Health billing employee incorrectly told Buttgereit the law applies only to ER services. The employee later said Buttgereit had the right to dispute the bill but gave her an incorrect deadline.
Hospital staffers recommended Buttgereit set up a payment plan and apply to the health system’s financial aid program.
Erin Schaible, a spokesperson with Bozeman Health, told KFF Health News that online estimates don’t reflect the specific details of a patient’s care. In addition to the shattered bones noted in Buttgereit’s surgery notes, Schaible said the physician identified nerve damage midsurgery that required additional work to fix.
“This situation highlights the importance of clear and compassionate communication,” Schaible said. “In response, our team leaders are revising internal protocols for escalating patient concerns and are reeducating staff on best practices for communicating cost estimate changes.”
  The Resolution 

Buttgereit refused to apply for financial aid, opting instead to challenge what she sees as inflated pricing. Using Healthcare Bluebook, an online price comparison tool that draws on insurance claims data, Buttgereit found similar procedures ranged from $8,000 to $40,000.
She said she believes that there are also errors on her bill and that the complications didn’t justify the price.
“I felt like going through financial assistance means that I’m OK with the price of the bill,” she said. “I want to get the bill reduced on the front end and then, if I need financial assistance, go through it.”
A billing employee emailed Buttgereit in May to offer an additional $7,000 discount if she set up a payment plan. If she later qualified for financial assistance, “we will adjust the amount accordingly,” the email said.
In June, the employee told Buttgereit her account would be put on hold before a collection process was initiated, “so that you have time to decide what to do.”
Buttgereit agreed to a payment plan of $100 a month, though she continued to contest the total charges.
At that rate, it would take about 60 years to pay off the debt — or longer, if the health system were to charge interest.
Buttgereit made one more bid for help: She emailed the White House.
This month, in the same week she got a detailed letter from the hospital standing by its charges, Buttgereit said she received a call from an official with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, saying she could dispute the bill to federal health officials.
  The Takeaway 

The best time to push back against a price is before surgery, upon receiving a hospital’s best guess on costs, known as a “good faith estimate.” Otherwise, undergoing surgery is considered tacit acceptance of that price as a baseline.
Patricia Kelmar, director of health care campaigns at the national consumer advocacy group U.S. PIRG, follows ways in which people get tangled financially in the health industry. She said patients should compare cost estimates by searching their hospital’s online pricing tool (as well as those of nearby hospitals) to see whether the estimates align. But not every procedure makes those lists, especially those for uncommon injuries, nor is every hospital’s list easy to access and navigate.
Post-surgery, patients have few resources to fight big bills, but a little-known rule in the No Surprises Act could help, Kelmar said.
The law, which took effect in 2022, is best known for protecting patients from surprise bills for out-of-network, emergency care. But it also created a formal dispute process for uninsured patients, or those paying completely out-of-pocket for nonemergency procedures, if their final tab is $400 or more than the initial estimate.
“This is a valid, important part of making sure that patients who are cash-pay have a watchdog,” Kelmar said.
People can start the patient-provider dispute process online, through the CMS website, by providing medical records and paying a $25 fee. Patients must initiate the process within 120 days of receiving the bill, and the bill may not be sent to a collection agency while under review.
An independent reviewer evaluates whether the final price is drastically different from what a health insurance company would have paid and whether the complication was predictable. If the review finds that the health provider erred on either front, federal health officials could require them to reduce the bill to match the original estimate or the median price insurers pay.
Buttgereit said she initially opted against pursuing that formal dispute process because, after such a review, the floor would be the hospital’s initial estimate, and she still had questions about how it would work. But after hearing from CMS, Buttgereit said it’s the path she plans to take.
“You’ve got to fight for yourself,” she said. “I don’t know where this is going to end up, but I feel a little bit more hopeful.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — State Superintendent Ryan Walters will resign from office with more than a year left in his term for a new position leading a conservative teacher organization, he announced Wednesday night while speaking live on FOX News.
Walters said he will become the CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, a newly formed group that markets itself as an alternative to teacher unions. He expects to resign in early October, his campaign manager and senior adviser Matt Langston told Oklahoma Voice.
His resignation means Gov. Kevin Stitt will have to appoint a candidate to lead the Oklahoma State Department of Education and the state Board of Education through the rest of Walters’ term, which ends in January 2027. Stitt has not yet said who he will choose.
In a brief appearance on FOX late Wednesday night, Walters said he is “excited” to step down and accept his new position. He said his goal is to “destroy the teachers unions.”
“We have seen the teachers unions use money and power to corrupt our schools, to undermine our schools,” he said. “We are one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the country. We will build an army of teachers to defeat the teachers unions once and for all. So, this fight’s going national, and we will get our schools back on track.”
The Teacher Freedom Alliance has 2,617 enrolled members, according to its website.
Langston said he plans to leave the Education Department on Sept. 30. The Texas-based political strategist has been a top leader at the agency since Walters took office in January 2023 while at the same time working on various political campaigns.

Walters, a former teacher turned far-right-wing firebrand, was elected to a four-year term as Oklahoma’s top education official in 2022. He could have been eligible for a second term had he run for reelection.
For much of his two years and 10 months in office, he’s been at the center of numerous controversies, most recently for being at odds with Stitt, a former ally, and the state Board of Education.
His tactics frustrated even fellow conservatives when he abruptly and sometimes silently made significant changes to state education policy. Doing so prompted frequent criticism from both Republicans and Democrats that Walters sought self-promotion more than academic improvement in Oklahoma’s struggling public education system.
While he also put money into improving teacher recruitment and student tutoring, Walters spent much of his time in office railing against perceived liberal ideology while promoting education with a conservative, patriotic and pro-Bible lens. 
Although Walters has been widely expected to seek higher office, he mentioned no plans for a future political campaign. His new position won’t require him to move out of state, Langston said.
Like Walters, the Teacher Freedom Alliance is a vocal critic of teacher unions. The Freedom Foundation, a national conservative think tank, created the Teacher Freedom Alliance this year to offer liability insurance, professional development, and “alternative curriculums and pedagogies” to educators.
Walters celebrated the organization’s launch in March by encouraging educators to join it as “an alternative to woke teachers’ unions.”
“Today, Superintendent Ryan Walters announced intent to lead the charge to offer a private industry solution to the far left-leaning Teachers’ Unions that have infected our public education system for decades,” a March 10 news release from his office stated.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota renters who use Section 8 housing vouchers or other subsidies now enjoy the same eviction protections as all other renters, thanks to a Minnesota Supreme Court decision reversing precedent it set in 1995.
Landlords in Minnesota can evict tenants over lease violations, like using drugs or committing other crimes. But If a landlord accepts a rent payment after finding out about a lease violation, they can’t evict the tenant over that specific breach of the lease. In other words, by accepting a rent payment despite knowing about a lease violation, the landlord waives their right to evict.
This protection did not apply to renters who received public subsidies, including Section 8 housing vouchers, until Wednesday. 
“This case actually advances the law and restores fairness to what we thought was the correct outcome prior to the court’s 1995 decision,” said Julia Zwak, managing attorney for housing at Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid, which brought the case. 
The Minnesota Human Rights Act prohibits landlords from discriminating against tenants who receive rental assistance. Wednesday’s court decision brings case law in line with state statutes, Zwak said. 
The previous precedent allowed landlords to bring evictions against subsidized renters at any time based on conduct that the landlord didn’t consider serious enough to warrant an eviction at the time, Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Sarah Hennesy wrote in the decision.
“But even when retaliation is not in play, it is important for landlords to decide quickly whether to evict based on a known breach. When a tenant’s breach harms or disturbs other tenants, the other tenants benefit from a system that requires a landlord to act quickly,” Hennesy wrote.
The case originated from a tenant, Nichole Nalewaja, who was living in Hook & Ladder Apartments in Minneapolis and using a Section 8 voucher to cover rent. The voucher doesn’t cover utilities, however, and she fell behind on electricity bills; her electricity was shut off in early October 2022, according to court records.
Nalewaja and her boyfriend broke into the building’s electrical box to reconnect their service, but accidentally shut off others’ electricity in the process. Hook & Ladder learned about the electrical box tampering — a lease violation — on Oct. 5, 2022. The landlord continued accepting rent payments from the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority, which administers the rental assistance vouchers, over the following months.
The landlord initiated an eviction against Nalewaja in March 2023 over the electrical box break-in, despite having received thousands of dollars in public money after the lease violation. A renter who didn’t receive assistance likely could’ve had the case quickly dismissed because Hook & Ladder had accepted several rent payments between the time of the violation and the initiation of the eviction; Nalewaja could not. 
Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid took on Nalewaja’s case and saw an opportunity to challenge the court precedent. Gary Van Winkle, a 35-year veteran Legal Aid housing attorney, carried the case all the way to the state Supreme Court — and got the outcome Legal Aid was hoping for. 
“Nichole Nalewaja stood up for herself, her neighbors and for all tenants who receive housing subsidies across the state,” Van Winkle said in a statement. “She challenged a 30-year-old court precedent and she won.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_6226-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-24 23:58:09.777777

(Stock.adobe.com photo by Grandbrothers)One day after posting the official results from the Sept. 16 primary election for city offices, the Annapolis Board of Canvassers had second thoughts Wednesday, voting in an emergency meeting to conduct a hand recount of all ballots cast in the race.
In a news release announcing the decision, the board said it called for the recount in the wake of an election night  transcription error — which was caught and corrected during the official canvass — that led to vote totals briefly being assigned to the wrong candidates in the Ward 6 race.
It also comes with the final results posted Tuesday showing the candidates in the Ward 4 race separated by just four votes, with 144 votes for Janice Elaine Allsup-Johnson to 140 votes for Coren Makell. Despite the narrow margin, however, Makell congratulated Allsup-Johnson and all the other Democratic primary winners Tuesday and pledged to “supporting you all in the general election.”
Eileen Leahy, the chair of the Annapolis Board of Canvassers, said the recount is aimed at giving additional assurances to voters that the final results are correct.
“The integrity of City elections is our highest priority,” Leahy said in a statement. “While the certification process worked as intended and the correct outcome was reported, we believe a full hand count audit will provide additional assurance to voters and demonstrate our commitment to transparency and accuracy.

“We appreciate our partnership with the Anne Arundel County Board of Elections and their willingness to demonstrate these values to both candidates and voters,” her statement said.
The city contracts with the board of elections to administer elections, and it will be conducting the audit at its Glen Burnie office beginning at 10 a.m. Thursday. That meeting will be open to the public.
City election officials said that hand count will review all in-person ballots cast in precincts on Election Day, review all mail-in and drop box ballots and verify that the certified results match the original voter-marked paper ballots.
The Board of Canvassers also said Wednesday that the county Board of Elections has put new safeguards in place for the Nov. 4 general election, “including on-site verification of results at the County facility on election night, immediate tape audits by election judges, and more robust checks before releasing unofficial results.”
Except for the possibility of a shift in the razor-thin margin of the Ward 4 race, the recount is unlikely to affect the outcome of any of the other contested city races in the Democratic primary. The closest margin in the other races was 51% of the vote for the winner of the Ward 1 race to 31% for the runner-up.
In the marquee race of the election, for the Democratic nomination for mayor, businessman Jared Littmann won 2,594 votes to 1,271 for longtime City Council Alderwoman Rhonda Pindell Charles, according to Tuesday’s results. Littmann now faces Republican Bob O’Shea in the Nov. 4 general election to succeed current Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who is term-limited after serving two terms.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The second day of Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process saw plenty of fireworks on Wednesday, with Democrats and their dueling redistricting expert clashing with Republicans. 
The Utah Legislature’s newly convened Legislative Redistricting Committee’s heated exchanges reached a crescendo when the committee’s only two Democrats — Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, and Rep. Doug Owens, D-Millcreek — brought their hired expert, Daniel Magleby, a professor at SUNY Binghamton in New York, to present their preferred congressional map.
During their presentation, Magleby and Owens questioned whether Republicans’ retained redistricting expert — Sean Trende, a senior elections analyst for RealClearPolitics who drew a set of five maps that were presented to the committee on Monday — used a method that incorporated partisan data on the front end of his process, which Democrats and Magleby alleged would be a violation of Proposition 4, the voter-approved law that established a framework for an independent redistricting process.

Magleby said if he were to “pull maps out of a simulated set where I’ve already screened out those that are not symmetrical, (that) would be illegal, as I understand it, under Prop 4. You’re not allowed to do that.”
Magleby said maps must first be drawn following Proposition 4’s criteria, and only after should they be analyzed for any “undue advantage or disadvantage on a particular group.” He questioned whether, by “culling” out maps that were tested for partisan symmetry, Trende’s map-drawing process would abide by Proposition 4. 
“If I’m only going to look at maps that are symmetrical to begin with, then I’ve already violated Proposition 4, and anything that comes from that is going to be illegal,” Magleby said. 
Owens added that “what he just described as being illegal, we strongly suspect has happened.” 
“We suspect there was a dataset incorporated into the test that Dr. Trende applied,” Owens said, though he also noted that Democrats’ requests to obtain Trende’s full data sets weren’t answered by Wednesday morning to help them verify that suspicion. “It’s as if we’re told to buy a car and we can’t lift the hood and look.” 
The committee’s co-chairs, Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, and Sen. Scott Sandall, then interjected with protests, with Pierucci saying, “That’s a pretty big allegation” and Sandall calling a point of order. 
“You just demeaned us,” Sandall said, audibly angry. “I will not have that. You called us somehow hiding, lying, about everything that we’ve presented. … Our maps, these maps, were not developed with any political data. You just misrepresented that, and that’s out of order.” 
Wednesday’s committee marked the second time this week that the Legislative Redistricting Committee has met as lawmakers try to narrow down which map the full Utah Legislature will ultimately vote on during a special session on Oct. 6 to be submitted to a judge.

That judge — 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson — will ultimately decide which map will replace the 2021 congressional boundaries she voided in a ruling last month, which deemed that map a result of an unconstitutional process after lawmakers repealed and replaced Proposition 4 with a law that turned the independent redistricting commission into an advisory body lawmakers could ultimately ignore. 
While Republican legislative leaders vehemently disagree with Gibson’s ruling and continue to fight it in court — with an appeal pending in the Utah Supreme Court and statements that they also intend to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary — they have said in the meantime they’ll abide by Gibson’s order, which gave the Legislature until Oct. 6 to choose a preferred replacement congressional map. 
The judge also gave the same Oct. 6 deadline to plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit to submit a map for consideration. She has a deadline of Nov. 10 to choose a new congressional map in time for the 2026 midterm elections. 
The Legislative Redistricting Committee did not pick a preferred map on Wednesday. Instead, it left the door open for more map proposals — from both lawmakers and the public — to be submitted through the committee’s website, where the maps are made public. As of Wednesday afternoon, dozens of maps had been submitted to lawmakers since they began taking submissions for the 2025 map last week. 
The judge gave lawmakers until Thursday for an eligible proposed map to be “published” before a 10-day public comment period leading up to the Oct. 6 vote. Sandall said in order for a map to be considered for the Oct. 6 special session and meet the court’s publication deadline, it must be submitted through the commission’s website no later than the end of the day Thursday. 
“The Legislature cannot adopt a map that is not publicly available for comment starting tomorrow, Sept. 25,” Pierucci said. “So when we meet back in a special session, it will be one of these maps that were publicly available to meet the 10-day window that was outlined by Judge Gibson in her timeline and order.”
Sandall said lawmakers are “considering many options and we want to gather as much public comment as possible … so we’re soliciting feedback on multiple maps.”

“Public comment is meaningless if we make a decision today,” he said. 
During Wednesday’s meeting, the legislative committee reviewed all five map options drawn by Republicans’ retained expert, Trende, as well as Democrats’ preferred map drawn by Magleby. They also took comments from more than two dozen Utahns, with many urging lawmakers to avoid gerrymandering and follow Proposition 4, while several also expressed distrust in the Legislature’s stated intentions to carry out a “fair” process. 
Proposed maps
A significant chunk of Wednesday’s committee meeting focused on reviewing the five maps drawn by Republicans’ expert, Trende. 
All of the maps would be relatively more competitive for Democrats when compared to the 2021 map that the court has since tossed out, though Republicans would still have an advantage in most of the districts. Under that 2021 map, Republicans have consistently dominated all four of Utah’s congressional seats. 
Democrats have expressed concerns with all five of those maps, resistant to mixing urban and rural areas. Republican legislative leaders including Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, have said, however, that they want a map that creates four districts that all represent “both urban and rural voices.” 
Utah’s current congressional map is a form of what’s been called the “slice of the pie” approach, dissecting Utah’s urban core and most populated area of Salt Lake County into four separate districts. 
In contrast, what’s known as a “doughnut hole” approach would create a map that may, for example, carve out a district concentrated around the state’s capital of Salt Lake City, the state’s darkest blue Democratic stronghold. 
Democrats’ preferred map, drawn by Magleby and named after Escamilla and Owens, carves out two doughnut-hole shapes, one around Salt Lake City and the northern part of Salt Lake County, and one around the southern part of Salt Lake County and northern Utah County. 
During Wednesday’s committee discussion, several Republican lawmakers expressed preference for maps that split the least number of cities and counties as possible, and those that mix rural and urban voices while following natural barriers to transportation.

Rep. Walt Brooks, R-St. George, said he liked the maps titled options A and B, for those reasons. He said Lake Powell and the Colorado River are also major waterways that are vital for southern Utah, “and to be able to have two Congress individuals to represent that water source is critical to the entire state of Utah.” 
According to Trende’s own analysis of his maps, all of his five comply with Proposition 4’s requirements which are the following criteria, in order of importance:

Equal population
Minimize city splits
Minimize county splits
Compactness
Contiguity and ease of transportation
Preserve traditional neighborhoods and communities of interest
Follow natural and geographic boundaries
Maximize boundary agreement

Map A splits three cities (North Salt Lake, Pleasant Grove and West Valley) and three counties (Davis, Salt Lake and Utah). 
Map B splits three cities (North Salt Lake, Provo and West Jordan) and three counties (Davis, Salt Lake and Utah). Map C splits three cities (Millcreek, North Salt Lake and Pleasant Grove) and three counties (Davis, Salt Lake and Utah). 
Map D splits three cities (Eagle Mountain, Layton and Taylorsville) and five counties (Davis, Salt Lake, Utah, Tooele and Wasatch). 
Map E splits two cities (Cottonwood Heights and Provo) and four counties (Salt Lake, Summit, Utah and Wasatch). 
Democrats’ proposed map, Magleby said, splits 13 cities and four counties (Davis, Morgan, Salt Lake and Utah). He said it was based off of a map drawn by the Independent Redistricting Commission back in 2021.

“When I’ve done my own analysis using the Harvard simulations, it falls well within the accepted range of what we would expect from a neutral redistricting process,” Magleby said. 
Several Republicans on the committee, however, expressed concerns about the number of city splits Magleby’s map would impose and expressed reluctance to support the map, arguing others would better adhere to Proposition 4’s criteria. 
Another map, however, not submitted by either of lawmakers’ dueling experts but by a Utahn, achieved even fewer city splits. 
Why not pick a map submitted by Utahns? 
Stuart Hepworth, a South Jordan resident, has submitted 14 maps for lawmakers to consider. One of his latest drafts would split zero cities and only three counties based on the Legislative Redistricting Committee’s map C. 
“This map outperforms all previously submitted maps (from myself, the legislature, or other members of the public) in complying with Prop 4’s redistricting criteria in the statutory order of priority,” Hepworth wrote with his submission. 
He told the committee that his map has the “bare minimum” county splits, splitting Salt Lake, Utah and “a tiny bit” of Weber county. 
“I followed the committee’s process in drawing the map, not viewing partisan data during the map’s creation,” Hepworth told the committee. “I believe this map is categorically superior to all five of Dr. Trende’s maps and following Prop 4’s criteria.” 
Sandall, however, noted that in the past Hepworth has drawn maps using Dave’s Redistricting online tool, which allows users to toggle views of partisan data. He pointed to a video Hepworth posted on YouTube earlier this month in which he demonstrated drawing a map in under six minutes. Hepworth acknowledged that map was drawn with a political data viewer turned on.

Another commenter, James Carter from Salt Lake City, urged lawmakers to choose a map drawn by members of the public — like from Hepworth — rather than one drawn by their chosen dueling experts. He said any statistics student “knows that there’s no such thing as an unbiased statistical analysis presentation.” 
“Every presentation of statistical analyses will include the motivations, at least, of the presenter. And the motivations that I’ve heard from both the majority and minority caucus, from opposing experts, has been fairly along the lines of ‘how far can we stretch our legal mandate to get what we want and stick it to the other guys,’” Carter said. 
In order to achieve a “fair, representative map” under Proposition 4, he urged the committee to “reject all six maps proposed today” and instead consider maps drawn by Hepworth or others “which have been drawn with fairness and with all of the requirements of Prop 4 in mind.” 
Sandall, however, indicated he had reservations about doing that, saying it’s “impossible to ascertain amongst all the maps that were drawn and submitted if any of them were drawn using political data in the timeframe that we have.
“It’s almost an impossible task,” he said. “Because that is our mandate under Prop 4, no political consideration can be made in drawing a map. And we would have to go in and depose any or all of the map drawers to find out if political data was used, and we just don’t have that time.”

Scams are nothing new – fraud has existed as long as human greed. What changes are the tools.
Scammers thrive on exploiting vulnerable, uninformed users, and they adapt to whatever technologies or trends dominate the moment. In 2025, that means AI, cryptocurrencies and stolen personal data are their weapons of choice.
And, as always, the duty, fear and hope of their targets provide openings. Today, duty often means following instructions from bosses or co-workers, who scammers can impersonate. Fear is that a loved one, who scammers also can impersonate, is in danger. And hope is often for an investment scheme or job opportunity to pay off.
 AI-powered scams and deepfakes

Artificial intelligence is no longer niche – it’s cheap, accessible and effective. While businesses use AI for advertising and customer support, scammers exploit the same tools to mimic reality, with disturbing precision.
Criminals are using AI-generated audio or video to impersonate CEOs, managers or even family members in distress. Employees have been tricked into transferring money or leaking sensitive data. Over 105,000 such deepfake attacks were recorded in the U.S. in 2024, costing more than US$200 million in the first quarter of 2025 alone. Victims often cannot distinguish synthetic voices or faces from real ones.
Fraudsters are also using emotional manipulation. The scammers make phone calls or send convincing AI-written texts posing as relatives or friends in distress. Elderly victims in particular fall prey when they believe a grandchild or other family member is in urgent trouble. The Federal Trade Commission has outlined how scammers use fake emergencies to pose as relatives.
 Cryptocurrency scams

Crypto remains the Wild West of finance — fast, unregulated and ripe for exploitation.
Pump-and-dump scammers artificially inflate the price of a cryptocurrency through hype on social media to lure investors with promises of huge returns – the pump – and then sell off their holdings – the dump – leaving victims with worthless tokens.
Pig butchering is a hybrid of romance scams and crypto fraud. Scammers build trust over weeks or months before persuading victims to invest in fake crypto platforms. Once the scammers have extracted enough money from the victim, they vanish.
Scammers also use cryptocurrencies as a means of extracting money from people in impersonation scams and other forms of fraud. For example, scammers direct victims to bitcoin ATMs to deposit large sums of cash and convert it to the untraceable cryptocurrency as payment for fictitious fines.
 Phishing, smishing, tech support and jobs

Old scams don’t die; they evolve.
Phishing and smishing have been around for years. Victims are tricked into clicking links in emails or text messages, leading to malware downloads, credential theft or ransomware attacks. AI has made these lures eerily realistic, mimicking corporate tone, grammar and even video content.
Tech support scams often start with pop-ups on computer screens that warn of viruses or identity theft, urging users to call a number. Sometimes they begin with a direct cold call to the victim. Once the victim is on a call with the fake tech support, the scammers convince victims to grant remote access to their supposedly compromised computers. Once inside, scammers install malware, steal data, demand payment or all three.
Fake websites and listings are another current type of scam. Fraudulent sites impersonating universities or ticket sellers trick victims into paying for fake admissions, concerts or goods.
One example is when a website for “Southeastern Michigan University” came online and started offering details about admission. There is no such university. Eastern Michigan University filed a complaint that Southeastern Michigan University was copying its website and defrauding unsuspecting victims.
The rise of remote and gig work has opened new fraud avenues.
Victims are offered fake jobs with promises of high pay and flexible hours. In reality, scammers extract “placement fees” or harvest sensitive personal data such as Social Security numbers and bank details, which are later used for identity theft.
 How you can protect yourself

Technology has changed, but the basic principles remain the same: Never click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders, and enter personal information only if you are sure that the website is legitimate. Avoid using third-party apps or links. Legitimate businesses have apps or real websites of their own.
Enable two-factor authentication wherever possible. It provides security against stolen passwords. Keep software updated to patch security holes. Most software allows for automatic update or warns about applying a patch.
Remember that a legitimate business will never ask for personal information or a money transfer. Such requests are a red flag.
Relationships are a trickier matter. The state of California provides details on how people can avoid being victims of pig butchering.
Technology has supercharged age-old fraud. AI makes deception virtually indistinguishable from reality, crypto enables anonymous theft, and the remote-work era expands opportunities to trick people. The constant: Scammers prey on trust, urgency and ignorance. Awareness and skepticism remain your best defense.

(Photo: Getty Images)No one understands the partnership between the earth and its people better than those who steward the land. But for generations, farmers in the Volunteer State could not make direct sales to the public of temperature-controlled foods or canned goods.
That changed in 2022 when state lawmakers passed the Tennessee Food Freedom Act. The bill allowed farmers and other cottage-food producers to sell certain homemade, nonperishable foods, including baked goods and jams, with no need for inspection or licensing.  
Recently, the Tennessee House of Representatives expanded Tennessee’s cottage-food laws with the passage of HB130, enabling Tennessee farmers and food entrepreneurs to legally sell homemade foods that include perishable foods such as dairy, eggs and poultry. 
“This gives small producers more flexibility to meet the growing demand for local, fresh and prepared foods,” says bill sponsor Rep. Michele Reneau, a Signal Mountain Republican.
The bill does not allow the sale of unpasteurized milk and other unpasteurized dairy products.
“We trust each other with food in our communities,” said Rep. Michele Reneau, a Signal Mountain Republican who sponsored the Food Freedom Act. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Within the past year, lawsuits have been filed against a Florida dairy farm found by the Florida State Health Department to have sold unpasteurized dairy products linked to at least 21 cases of campylobacter and shiga toxin-producing E. coli. The cases include a pregnant mother who consumed raw milk, became sick and lost her unborn baby.
Elizabeth Stuart has farmed her Crossing Creeks Farm in Shelbyville for the past 12 years, practicing regenerative farming to raise beef cattle, pigs, turkeys and chickens for meat and eggs.
Though the farm has a commercial kitchen, Stuart realizes the importance of the Food Freedom Act for those farms that do not.
“We believe that the Food Freedom Act is an important asset to Tennessee farmers and artisans,” she says. “For example, farmers who have a bumper crop of vegetables, or chicken, meat or eggs, now have the ability to turn that into a value-added product instead of it becoming waste. This increases the amount of local food sources within the state.”
The welfare of local farmers and food entrepreneurs is at the heart of the bil, saud Reneau.
“This bill is about freedom and opportunity,” Reneau said, adding that the new legislation negates the need for inspections and commercial licensing that costs food producers nearly $500. 
“Tennessee families love buying directly from people they know and trust, and small farms and home kitchens want the ability to serve their communities without unnecessary red tape,” she said.
Reneau compares the Food Freedom Act to shared community meals, such as pot-luck dinners with friends and neighbors.
“We already trust each other with food in our communities,” she said. “This simply extends that same trust to local farmers and food entrepreneurs so more of them can start businesses or expand what they offer.”
The Food Freedom Act enables farmers and small-food producers to diversify their offerings, from soups and stews to casseroles with perishable ingredients, such as poultry and dairy, giving the “little guy” a fairer chance to compete or get started in  the food business. 
The idea is to create an incubator of sorts, a stepping stone that may lead to commercial operations in larger cities, while giving those in rural areas with no access to commercial kitchens a viable option to sell locally.
The 2022 Food Freedom Act enabled farmers to sell shelf-stable items requiring no refrigeration or special handling. Now, prepared chicken, such as rotisserie chicken, soups and pot pie, plus butter, eggs, yogurts, hard cheeses and kefir can be sold directly to consumers.
Bird Fork Farm is a Certified Naturally Grown small seed-to-bottle apothecary farm in Dunlap. The farm produces organically grown vegetables, fruits and herbs in addition to locally grown or foraged teas, spices, extracts, syrups, body care products, ferments and vinegars. 
Alysia Leon of Bird Fork says the Food Freedom Act has allowed her farm to cut down on food waste and offer farm-fresh products year-round.  While the farm does not produce meat and dairy products, updates allowing the sale of temperature-controlled foods opens revenue resources once denied Tennessee farmers.
“We know this update has allowed other farmer friends the ability to expand their operations,” Leon says. “It cuts down on food waste to create value-added products, and it gives farmers the benefit of the doubt that they are doing things the right way.”
The bill has received overwhelming approval from cottage-food producers, Reneau said.
“Many have told me they’ve been waiting years to sell more of the foods they already make at home, but costs and regulations have prevented that. Customers are just as excited,” she said. “They want more local choices and more ways to support their neighbors. 
“It’s truly a win-win for producers and consumers, and I hope Tennessee’s Food Freedom Act becomes a model for other states.”

(Photo by Nicole Pilsbury/Maryland Matters)Former Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, in what may have been one of her first public appearances since getting off home detention, talked about the need for police reform and made her own case to an appreciative audience Wednesday in Washington.
Mosby was part of a panel of lawmakers, lawyers and advocates at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation conference who talked about flaws with public safety in America and envisioned a better future.
The audience was generally receptive to the panel’s arguments that despite some improvements, the criminal justice system and policing in America still has room for improvement. But they were especially enthusiastic about Mosby, who was convicted on federal charges that she says were brought because she pursued convictions of Baltimore police officers.
Audience members chimed in with a “That’s right!” or  “Yeah!” as Mosby answered panel questions, and the end of each of her answers was met with an eruption of applause and cheers. Peoplel swarmed around her as the panel concluded, eager to snap a picture with or have a chat with the former attorney.
Mosby said she was not surprised to be invited to speak on the panel, saying in a brief interview afterwards that, “There was a lot of change enacted as a direct result of what happened in Baltimore City.”

“Baltimore was at the forefront of this progressive movement,” she said.
The panel discussed the nationwide protests and reform efforts that followed the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the 2015 death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore — a crisis Mosby came face-to-face with as the city’s top prosecutor.
The two high-profile deaths in police custody sparked national conversations about police accountability.
“Both cities remind us that public safety is not just about officers on patrol or prosecutions in the courtroom, but about trust, community and a shared belief that every person deserves equal justice under the law,” said Rep. Wesley Bell (D-Mo.), the panel moderator.
Gray’s death was four months into Mosby’s term in office. She and her team worked to charge the officers involved in Gray’s death and the U.S. Justice Department exposed the police department’s discriminatory practices — leading to nationwide reform, Mosby said at the panel. Those reforms included things like body cameras, de-escalation policies and dashboard cameras, she said.
Mosby said that prosecutors were not prosecuting police, and there was a lack of accountability in America at the time. She got death threats and became a “target of the same system I represented” following the prosecution of the officers, she said on the panel.
Bell also described Mosby as a target while asking a question about how prosecuting cases can change public safety and justice perspectives.
Mosby is on three years of supervised release — with one of those being the year of home confinement that concluded in June 2025 — for perjury convictions related to the purchase of two Florida homes.
She said the federal government was not able to find anything after interrogating her neighbors, family, friends, hairdresser and her children’s dance instructor.
“I had no idea that they could come back and say that I am now going to be the target of a criminal investigation for a statute that has never been legally used against anyone else in this country up to this day, and for a vague statute that has never been legally defined by neither Congress nor the IRS,” Mosby said during the panel discussion.

Jason Armstrong, a retired Ferguson police chief who was appointed five years after Brown’s death, spoke on the panel about seeing the payoff and community impact from working to create a “culture of accountability.”
“Like Mrs. Mosby said, the sacrifices that I’m having to put forth in this are worth something,” he said.
Panelist Justin Hansford, a Howard University law professor and the director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center, also referenced Mosby in one of his answers, emphasizing her point that “the justice system isn’t just.”
Mosby said that the federal government opened an investigation on her two months after publishing this Washington Post op-ed that criticized President Donald Trump’s decision and threats to send federal law enforcement officers to cities around the country in July 2020.
“They did it because they wanted to get me out of office, and they were successful,” she said. “Justice is always worth the price paid for its pursuit. I would not do anything different.”

Abigail Salisbury said.","State Rep. Abigail Salisbury (D-Allegheny) speaks during a House Appropriations Committee budget hearing with Community and Economic Development Secretary Rick Siger on Tuesday, Feb. 18, 2025. (Photo courtesy of House Democrats)On Monday, President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. held a press conference claiming a link between Tylenol consumption during pregnancy and autism. It was the latest development in an effort promised in the early days of the Trump administration – to find a cause of what Kennedy has described as an autism “epidemic.”
While the claims drew immediate blowback from members of the scientific community, the way Trump and Kennedy have discussed autism over the past few months has also brought pushback from autistic people and their advocates in Pennsylvania and across the nation.
For example, in April, while announcing an initiative to study the environmental factors that may contribute to autism, Kennedy said the condition is a “tragedy” that “destroys families.” 
“These are kids who will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem,” Kennedy said.
In a recorded cabinet meeting last month, Trump said, “autism is such a tremendous horror show,” while teasing the recent announcement. 
Trump and RFK Jr. are making claims about autism. What do medical experts say?

Two state lawmakers in the commonwealth, both Democrats, are openly autistic. They have decried the administration’s approach to addressing the developmental disorder.
Rep. Jessica Benham (D-Allegheny) was the first lawmaker elected to the House with a publicly known diagnosis. She has been alarmed by the administration’s language when discussing autism. 
“This is not the first time that autism has been politicized by this administration, and we cannot allow the whims of non-experts to determine best courses of medical care,” she said in a statement to the Capital-Star. “It’s critically important that pregnant women continue to listen to real experts and make healthcare decisions in consultation with their doctors.”
Rep. Abigail Salisbury (D-Allegheny), chair of the Pennsylvania Autism Caucus, is also autistic. She criticized how Trump and Kennedy characterized people with the condition. 
“I just became a little bit disgusted with the language they were using to describe people who have autism, as well as the experience of their families,” Rep. Abigail Salisbury (D-Allegheny), chair of the Pennsylvania Autism Caucus, told the Capital-Star. “Imagine you are a child with an autism diagnosis. Let’s say your parents do get divorced, or you have some sort of family issue, what does that do to you when you’re hearing that — when you’re hearing you destroyed your family and you’re the cause of everybody’s problems?”

While some studies have found a link between Tylenol use during pregnancy and autism, many experts have called them inconclusive and said they haven’t established a causal relationship. That’s in part because it’s unclear whether Tylenol, or the underlying conditions and symptoms it was being taken to alleviate, may have contributed. 
Many doctors also agree that an untreated fever during pregnancy can be more harmful to a fetus than Tylenol, which medical professionals say has fewer risks than many alternative treatments.
Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement the announcement was not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and “dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children.”
“It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data” he added.

Last April, Benham, who is also a member of the Pennsylvania Autism Caucus, shared her concerns at a press conference. It was shortly after the National Institutes of Health under Kennedy announced plans to conduct a large study into the causes of autism. 
“RFK Jr.’s comments are offensive,” she said at a press conference in April. “They’re offensive to folks on the spectrum and they’re offensive to those who love us. We need more support and services for autistic people, not insults about how we contribute to society.”
It was reported the study would involve the collection of private medical records from federal and commercial databases, effectively amounting to an autism registry.
Kennedy also hired David Geier to look into the links between vaccines and autism. Geier had previously been involved in retracted studies linking vaccine ingredients and autism, and was disciplined in Maryland for practicing medicine without a license. 
“To weaponize autism research for political purposes is inappropriate and offensive,” Benham said. “We do not need fear-mongering tactics. We do not need scare tactics.”










It’s not great when the president of the United States acts as if a condition that you have is a scourge or a plague on society.


– Rep. Abigail Salisbury (D-Allegheny), who is autistic.


While Salisbury said she supports comprehensive research into the condition, including potential environmental causes, she found Trump and Kennedy’s language alarming. She said she was diagnosed after receiving a negative review at a job that raised issues characteristic of an autism diagnosis, like struggling to make eye contact.
“It’s not great when the president of the United States acts as if a condition that you have is a scourge or a plague on society,” she said. “I understand that I have a sort of privilege, because I’m someone who can get elected to the statehouse, or to borough council before that, or run a law practice. There are many families out there who have children who are non-verbal and will never achieve the kind of dreams that their parents have for them, but that does not mean those children don’t have value as human beings.”

Salisbury has called for lawmakers to convene a panel of experts to discuss what the best available data and mainstream scientific consensus says about the causes of autism.
The request comes as officials in Pennsylvania and around the country have raised alarms about potentially politicized data or public health recommendations coming out of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under Kennedy.
Last month, in a break from precedent, Gov. Josh Shapiro asked the State Board of Pharmacy to vote to bypass the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. 
Every member of the federal panel was fired and replaced by Kennedy, with some of the new appointees having a history of vocal vaccine skepticism. Before taking office, Kennedy himself was a leader in the growing anti-vaccine movement, suggesting a link between immunizations and autism, despite widespread scientific consensus to the contrary.
Pennsylvania has also joined a public health coalition of northeastern states that seeks to make vaccine recommendations and prepare for possible emergencies, amid distrust in the direction of HHS.
While Shapiro has yet to address the claims linking autism and Tylenol consumption during pregnancy directly, on Wednesday, Shapiro wrote in a post on the social media platform X, “Here in Pennsylvania, we support our [intellectual disability/Autism (ID/A)] community. We’re going to continue to follow the science and facts to inform our public health guidance — all while investing in our direct support professionals and ensuring that folks in the ID/A community receive the care that they deserve.”
Salisbury shared a similar sentiment.
“Autistic individuals and our families deserve to know that our lawmakers are listening to data, to doctors and to lived experiences,” she said.
Andrew Nixon, the communications director for HHS, pushed back on claims the agency was being politicized under Kennedy.
“Democrat-run states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates, and draconian vaccine passports during the COVID era completely eroded the American people’s trust in public health agencies,” Nixon said in a statement. “ACIP remains the scientific body guiding immunization recommendations in this country, and HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic.”

As it stands, autism is thought to be primarily genetic, though environmental factors during pregnancy can play a role in fetal development.
Kennedy and Trump have both noted a significant increase in the prevalence of autism diagnoses over the last several decades, from around one in 151 children in 2000 to one in 31 in 2022, according to CDC. OIt’s not clear whether the condition itself has become more common.
Autism has become more widely known and understood by parents as well as doctors. Moreover, the criteria for diagnosing autism has changed, coming to encompass more mild forms of the condition, once known as Asperger’s syndrome.
“I think it’s important, from my perspective, to tell parents that if your child has autism it’s not your fault,” Salisbury said. I think when you start telling people, ‘Oh you took Tylenol, therefore your child has autism,’ you’re blaming. That opens the door for people to look at a family with a child with autism and think, ‘Oh that’s your fault. You did that.’ That’s cruel, and that’s wrong, and we should not be blaming.”
On Wednesday, a coalition of leading autism and disability advocacy organizations released a statement condemning Trump and Kennedy’s approach.
“Autistic people deserve respect and support. There are many policy and program changes HHS could pursue that would materially improve the lives of autistic people and our families,” the statement read. “The targeting of autism is part of a broader initiative led by Secretary Kennedy to undermine public health and well-being, undermine trust in science, and to advance harmful, ableist beliefs that make all of us less safe.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/034_02182025_Approps_DCED_027-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 20:57:26.855244

In the 2025 legislative session, Klimesh was chairman for the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, in addition to serving as vice chair for the Local Government Committee and for the Health and Human Services Appropriations subcommittee.
Whitver announced Sept. 16 that he was retiring from the leadership position, which he has held since 2018, and would not seek reelection in 2026. The 45-year-old Grimes resident was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2024, and has said treatment was ongoing.
In a statement Wednesday, Klimesh thanked Whitver for his time leading the Senate GOP caucus.
“Leading a deep and talented group of senators is an honor, and with that honor comes a great responsibility,” Klimesh said. “I want to thank Jack for his years of service, his exceptional example as a leader, and most of all for his friendship. I can’t imagine anyone leaving behind bigger shoes to fill.”
As leader, Klimesh said he looks forward to “continuing to implement our agenda to reduce taxes, making it more affordable to live in Iowa, reduce barriers to work and invest in this state, expand the economy, and return Iowa schools to their status as the best in the country.”
Gov. Kim Reynolds congratulated Klimesh in a statement Wednesday. “Sen. Klimesh’s influence in the senate has steadily grown over the last four years, and I’m confident in his ability to successfully lead the Senate,” she said.
“I look forward to working with him in the upcoming legislative session to further our conservative agenda and build upon our years of success,” Reynolds said.
Iowa Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, also congratulated Klimesh Wednesday, while thanking Whitver for his service in the Legislature.
“I am hopeful that we can find ways to work together to deliver for and truly improve the lives of all Iowans in the bipartisan manner they expect from us,” Weiner said.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)LINCOLN — The former executive director of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission faces seven felony charges, including some that allege he deprived Nebraskans of his honest work as a public official by letting two Lincoln strip clubs give him cash, lap dances, sexual favors and free drinks.
He visited often enough that employees tallied the amount his visits pulled from the cash register on sticky notes left for their bosses that they labeled “COB” for the cost of the clubs doing business, according to a federal indictment of the state official unsealed this week.
Part of the state official’s job was to help the commission dole out, discipline and rescind Nebraska liquor licenses. That role included weighing in after police investigations of rival Omaha strip clubs the indictment alleges the state official shared with the co-owner of the Lincoln clubs and looking up dancers in law enforcement databases. And the indictment alleges he demanded a total of $65,000 from one bar owner to protect a liquor license.
The grand jury charged former commission director Hobert “Hobie” Rupe with three counts of honest services fraud — the charge that means a public official or employee depriving the people of an official’s honest work — one count of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, two counts of wire fraud and one count of extortion. 
It charged a co-owner of Lincoln strip clubs The Office and The Night Before Lounge, Brent Zywiec, with one count of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud. All are felonies carrying sentences of up to 20 years in prison. All must still be proven in court.
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, who attended a news conference at the FBI’s Omaha office with the U.S. Attorney’s Office to announce the indictment, said it should serve as a warning to anybody who would seek personal gain from public service.
“Nebraskans expect that their public servants give them honest services, that they act with integrity and follow the oath of office they swear to uphold,” Hilgers said of Rupe, who served as executive director from 2004 until June 2025. “That’s not what happened here.”
Gov. Jim Pillen, in a statement Wednesday, expressed disappointment at the “failure of leadership at the Liquor Control Commission.” He said he would do “everything in my power” to make sure the agency, which is run independently of his administration, meets public expectations “going forward.” 
“The conduct alleged in the indictment … falls completely short of what Nebraskans expect of officials placed in positions of public trust,” Pillen said.
Rupe served almost 10 years as an assistant attorney general prior to joining the commission. He did not immediately return calls seeking comment. One former number had been changed. The other went straight to voicemail. The Liquor Control Commission had suspended him without pay from his $130,596-a-year job in May after a search warrant was served.
Liquor Control Commission Chair Bruce Bailey of Lincoln had said in May that Rupe’s alleged offenses related to his “fitness and ability” to serve and required an immediate suspension. No new information had been available until this week.
The shake-up at the Liquor Commission could have impacts beyond liquor cases, because the members of the board also serve on the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission and the two commissions began sharing funds after Rupe’s departure.
A woman who answered the phone at The Office Gentlemen’s Club in Lincoln said the club would have no comment. One person at the club said Zywiec had been “suspended.” No one immediately answered the Examiner’s calls to The Night Before Lounge. Efforts to reach Zywiec were unsuccessful Wednesday.
The indictment alleges that payments and services were offered at the clubs from January 2022 through May 2025. Among the gifts offered and accepted, it said, were free entry into bars that usually charge $20 cover fees, free drinks and cash to cover free lap dances, free VIP dances and services that included oral sex.
A single private dance at the club can cost about $100 for three songs, while a turn in the VIP lounge can cost up to $500. The feds say at least one surveillance video investigators secured showed Rupe receiving sexual favors. Some videos of people in compromising positions were saved to the owner’s iCloud account, the indictment says.
Rupe, in addition to sharing sensitive information with Zywiec about law enforcement investigations into rival clubs, also ignored violations he saw occurring in the Lincoln clubs, the indictment alleges. 
Text messages between Zywiec and an unnamed cohort who is likely cooperating with the feds show the two had developed coded language to speak about visiting the club, the indictment alleges. They used the term “team players” to discuss whether a particular dancer might be willing to offer favors, it adds. The two used the words “book” or “papers” to discuss cash, authorities allege.
“Like I said if I don’t know em. Know em i can’t endorse em,” Zywiec allegedly wrote in one text message exchange. “But that shouldn’t stop you.”
Rupe replied, the documents allege: “You know me. Always on the lookout for team players.”
In another text exchange, Zywiec and an unnamed co-conspirator discussed a “new blond” who “just took Hobie to vip.”
The U.S. Attorney’s Office is requesting a jury trial in Lincoln.

Michelle Lujan Grisham during the State of the State speech on Jan. 20, 2025. Haaland, who is running in 2026 to be the state’s next governor, wrote to the University of New Mexico this week urging higher wages for resident doctors. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland this week sent a letter to the governing board of New Mexico’s flagship university urging it to increase salaries for incoming resident doctors and preserve anti-discrimination language in ongoing union negotiations.
The University of New Mexico’s contract with the resident physicians union, called the Committee of Interns and Residents, expired on Aug. 31. While the contract remains in effect during negotiations, the union and university are still negotiating the levels of pay for residents at the state’s sole academic medical center.
“At a time when our state is grappling with the second-worst physician shortage in the nation, with a third of our physicians expected to retire by 2030, failure to invest in resident physicians now is a decision with long-term consequences,” Haaland wrote in the Sept. 23 letter to the UNM Board of Regents.
Physician shortages are projected to impact states across the U.S. in the next few years, but New Mexico is ranked to have the second-highest rate per capita, according to 2020 data published by the National Institutes of Health.
Resident physicians are doctors who have graduated medical school and are now in training to specialize in their fields of choice—often for relatively low pay and long hours.
Rupali Gautam, a third-year resident training in pediatrics and the regional vice president of the UNM resident physician union chapter, says enacting competitive salaries and benefits for new doctors will help address the state’s shrinking pool of physicians. According to a 2024 Think New Mexico study, the state has seen a 30% decline in primary doctors in recent years.
“With the growing physician shortage in New Mexico, the best way to recruit residents is to provide those incentives for them to apply here,” Gautam said.
In her letter, Haaland contended that UNM has the lowest-paid residency salaries in the Southwest Region, with a starting stipend of $65,550 for a first-year student. The ​​American Association of Medical Colleges data from 2024 shows mean stipends for first-year residents at western schools (New Mexico Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) was just over $75,000.
The University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center disputed that New Mexico’s pay for residents is one of the lowest in the region. Chris Ramirez, the director of communications for UNM Health Sciences Center, supplied data from other universities, in Utah, Arizona and Texas. Ramirez noted that the third-year resident’s salary, which he called “more representative,” is on par with the national median of 10 other area universities and the national median from the American Association of Medical Colleges.
Ramirez said UNM Hospitals appreciated Haaland’s letter.
“We are always happy to keep our community leaders informed on the issues affecting the University and its constituents, while also making sure we are compliant with all applicable laws governing confidentiality and collective bargaining,” Ramirez said in a statement.

The University has also proposed removing specific anti-discrimination language in the contract’s non-discrimination clause, Gautam said, pointing to recent efforts by the federal government to ban “diversity, equity and inclusion,” at universities.
“I think that’s because of the Trump administration pushback that a lot of institutions are getting from a federal level if they are using the words diversity and inclusion,” Gautam said.
Ramirez said he could not speak to UNM’s position on contract negotiations.
“It is unlawful for either party to publicly discuss any terms of the proposals made by either party before it is ratified by the parties,” he wrote in response to Source NM’s inquiry. “However, UNM and UNM Hospital are committed to ensuring compliance with state and federal anti-discrimination laws.”
Haaland said removing the language jeopardizes “a safe, inclusive and equitable environment,” for not only new doctors but also their patients.
“UNM’s mission in providing care is rooted in serving Native American, Hispanic, and other underserved people of Bernalillo County. That mission depends on fostering a workforce that reflects the people it serves and can provide care that is not only clinically sound but culturally competent,” she wrote.
In a statement, Haaland said New Mexico is “uniquely vulnerable to Trump’s attacks on our healthcare,” noting concerns about rising health insurance premiums.
“If we’re serious about lowering costs and expanding access, we have to make smart moves like paying our medical residents. It keeps doctors local to the area at a time when we cannot afford to fall farther behind,” she said.
A voicemail for Board of Regents Chair Paul Blanchard had not been returned as of Wednesday afternoon.. An emailed request for comment to Ben Cloutier, the head of communications and marketing at UNM, to whom Ramirez referred board questions, also remained pending.
Gautam said she was grateful for Haaland’s letter lending attention to the negotiations and said the union wants to reach a resolution with the university to address the physician shortage.
“Patients traveling to other states to get their care are going months, even up to past a year,to get specialty care within different fields,” she said. “I’m a pediatrics resident and a lot of our pediatric specialists are seeing patients months to years out from their initial referral — that’s not great.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-24 23:06:27+00:00,CT Mirror,"Kimmel is back on ABC, but CT affiliate among many still refusing to air show",Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/24/kimmel-abc-wtnh-protest-ct/,"Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show returned to ABC Tuesday, but many affiliate stations — including WTNH in Connecticut — aren't broadcasting it.","Jimmy Kimmel is back on his ABC late-night show, but it’s still a mystery when — or if — viewers in Connecticut and many other markets around the country will be able to see him again on their televisions.
ABC stations owned by the Nexstar and Sinclair corporations took Kimmel off the air last week on the same day the network suspended him for comments that angered supporters of slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Those stations, including Nexstar-owned WTNH in New Haven, kept him off the air Tuesday, when ABC lifted the suspension. The unusual dispute attracted the attention of U.S. senators, who said they wanted to investigate the relationship between the affiliates and President Donald Trump’s administration. 
Kimmel returned with no apologies, but in an emotional monologue where he appeared close to tears, the host said that he was not trying to joke about the assassination. He also paid tribute to Kirk’s widow.
And it got a large audience, with ABC reporting nearly 6.3 million people tuned in to the broadcast alone, despite the blackouts in many markets. As is often the case with late-night hosts’ monologues, there was a larger audience online, with more than 15 million people watching Kimmel’s opening remarks on YouTube by Wednesday evening. ABC says more than 26 million people watched Kimmel’s return on social media, including YouTube.
Typically, he gets about 1.8 million viewers each night on television. The numbers released by ABC do not include viewership from streaming services.
A spokesman for Nexstar said Wednesday that Kimmel will continue to be preempted from its stations while the company evaluates his show. Together, the Nexstar and Sinclair groups account for about a quarter of ABC’s affiliates, many in smaller cities such as Nashville, Tennessee; Lubbock, Texas; or Topeka, Kansas.
“We are engaged in productive discussions with executives at the (ABC parent) Walt Disney Co., with a focus on ensuring the program reflects and respects the diverse interests of the communities we serve,” Nexstar said.
Some of Nexstar’s Connecticut audience is planning a protest outside the ABC affiliate WTNH in New Haven Thursday. Connecticut Citizen Action Group, the organizer behind the protest, said in a statement Wednesday, “This is not just about one late-night show; it is about the dangers of media consolidation, censorship, and the growing impediment to free speech caused by right-wing corporate control of information.”
Dispute highlights relationship between networks and local stations
The dispute focused attention on the business relationships between television networks and the local stations that carry their programming. In the past, local stations occasionally balked at airing a network show, but it was usually an individual market or two worried about pushing boundaries in language or sexual content, said Ted Harbert, a former top executive at ABC and CBS.
What’s different this time is groups that have gobbled up multiple stations acting collectively on content for largely political reasons.
“This is how much the country’s political divisions have seeped their way into something that has been, for the last 50 or 75 years, a relatively orderly business,” Harbert said.
Leadership of ownership groups is generally more conservative than the media and entertainment figures on the stations they broadcast, said Ken Basin, author of “The Business of Television.” Both Sinclair, with conservative political content, and Nexstar have reason to curry favor with the Trump administration, he said. Nexstar is seeking regulatory approval for the purchase of a rival, he said.
“I worry that this is not going to be the only dispute of this nature in the years ahead,” Basin said.
It’s possible that Disney could play hardball if negotiations on Kimmel’s return drag on, such as threatening to withhold other ABC programming — even the “nuclear option” of football games. Its unclear how the affiliate agreements are worded.
But Matt Dolgin, senior equity analyst at Morningstar Research Service, said he doubts the dispute reaches that point. The station groups have a far less diversified business portfolio than Disney, and the expiration of affiliate agreements next year looms as a deadline, he said. They have few good options if they lose ABC programming.
“From a business perspective, the best course on this issue (for Disney) is to stay above the fray,” Dolgin said. “The dollars associated with this show are very low.”
As they climb, the stunning number of YouTube views of Kimmel’s monologue serve to make television broadcasting less important, hurting the negotiating position of the stations.
For the station groups, the biggest goal should be to negotiate their way out of this — while finding a way to save face, he said. Sinclair initially took a strong stance, saying Kimmel would not return to its stations without apologizing to Kirk’s widow and donating money to Kirk’s political organization. That’s not likely to happen.
Kimmel was at risk of losing show entirely
Last week, Kimmel seemed to be in real danger of losing his show entirely until advocates for free speech protested, including many who canceled subscriptions for Disney services.
“The backlash was stronger than they expected, stronger than I expected,” Basin said. “There was a sense of despair within the industry that this was a ‘canary in a coal mine’ moment.”
Four Democratic senators said late Tuesday that they wanted to look into what happened with the station groups.
“If Nexstar or Sinclair traded the censorship of a critic of the administration for official acts by the Trump administration, your companies are not only complicit in an alarming trampling of free speech but also risk running afoul of anti-corruption law,” Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey, Ron Wyden and Chris Van Hollen wrote to the companies.
On Wednesday, another group of senators led by California Democrat Adam Schiff said they wanted to question FCC Chairman Brendan Carr about “implicit threats” made to Disney over Kimmel.
In his monologue Tuesday, Kimmel tried to thread the needle between both sides in a raw political moment, and seemed to realize its difficulty.
“I don’t think what I’m going to say is going to make much of a difference,” he said. “If you like me, you like me. If you don’t, you don’t. I have no illusions about changing anyone’s mind.”
Within hours, many proved his point. Andrew Kolvet, a spokesperson for Turning Point USA, the organization that Kirk founded that is now headed by his widow, posted on X that Kimmel’s monologue was “not good enough.”
In another corner of social media, comic Ben Stiller posted that it was a “brilliant monologue.”

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana students can now qualify for the TOPS scholarship by taking a conservative alternative to ACT and the SAT exams, but it is not currently accepted for admissions to any public university in Louisiana. 
The Classical Learning Test, or CLT for short, evaluates students on math, writing and grammar with an emphasis on classic literature and historic documents that “had a lasting influence on Western culture,” according to the CLT website.
Its primary proponents are conservative educators. In addition to Louisiana, Oklahoma accepts the CLT for qualification for its version of TOPS. 
The Classical Learning Test was launched in 2015 by Classic Learning Initiatives. It is accepted for admissions primarily by private Christian schools and a small number of public schools, primarily in Republican-controlled states, including every state university in Florida. 
The exam is still relatively obscure, but it has recently received high-profile attention when U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth approved it for acceptance into the U.S. military academies. 
Earlier this year, the Louisiana Legislature approved the CLT as an alternative for qualifying for the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students, which provides tuition assistance for qualifying Louisiana students. Last month, the Louisiana Board of Regents approved the CLT equivalent to the ACT scores needed to qualify for each level of TOPS. The equivalencies scores are only good for TOPS qualification, as the CLT is not used for admissions at the vast majority of Louisiana universities.
Earlier this month, a billboard went up in Baton Rouge advertising the Classical Learning Test to students. The display ad refers to one of LSU’s football rivals, the University of Alabama.
“Bama isn’t your team. ACT isn’t your test,” the purple and gold billboard along Interstate 10 near College Drive reads. “Louisiana students take the CLT. Now accepted for TOPS.”
The billboard discourages students from taking the ACT, which in Louisiana is the most popular of the two standardized college admissions tests commonly taken by high school students before they apply for college. But students should know the CLT is not an acceptable alternative for admissions in most cases. 
In Louisiana, only Louisiana Christian University in Pineville accepts the CLT for admissions. Students seeking admissions to any public university or any of the other private universities in the state will need to submit an ACT or SAT score. 
Critics of the Classical Learning Test argue it doesn’t meet the same academic rigor and anti-cheating measures as the ACT. 
The Iowa Board of Regents released a review of the exam and found no peer-review research supporting the test’s ability to predict student outcomes and subsequently recommended the exam not be used for admissions. 
Louisiana high school students were able to qualify for TOPS using the Classical Learning Test starting with the current fall semester. So far, just one student has applied for TOPS using their CLT score, Board of Regents spokesman Chris Yandle said. 
The Louisiana Legislature approved the CLT exam for TOPS with little discussion earlier this year as an amendment to a bill creating a new TOPS award level for high-achieving students. Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, sponsored the amendment. Crews said Jeremy Tate, founder and CEO of Classical Learning Initiatives, asked him to do so. 
Classical Learning Initiatives is a for-profit company, as is Nexus Capital Management, which purchased the nonprofit American College Testing last year. The College Board, which administers the SAT, is a nonprofit organization.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) Louisiana’s Liz Murrill and 16 other Republican state attorneys general have signed a letter to college administrators warning them not to impose a “tax on free speech” by asking student organizations to pay high security fees for controversial speakers. 
The letter, led by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, said that in the wake of the shooting death of ultra-conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University earlier this month, reports have circulated that colleges have used his death as justification to shut down free speech with exorbitant security fees. The letter did not cite any specific examples. 
The attorneys general referred to prohibitive security fees as the “assassin’s veto,” a play on the “heckler’s veto,” a phenomenon in which a controversial speaker’s right to free speech is curtailed by an overwhelming negative response. 
“We trust that you will continue to take steps to keep your campuses safe,” the attorneys general wrote. “And we also trust that you won’t use safety as a pretext to silence debate, at a time when it is sorely needed.” 
Kirk, 31, was known for holding events at universities across the country where he engaged in debate with students. Though he was successful in mobilizing young people to support conservative causes, Kirk was a controversial figure for his often inflammatory comments about race, sexuality and religion. His events often sparked outrage from students with opposing viewpoints. 
Kirk’s appearance at Utah Valley was the first stop on a tour that would have included an Oct. 27 visit to LSU. Turning Point USA, the conservative student organization Kirk founded, has announced the tour would go on without Kirk. The LSU stop will feature Gov. Jeff Landry and Allie Beth Stuckey, a conservative Christian podcaster. 
Colleges and universities have at times struggled to balance their obligations to protect free speech with their duty to student safety. Universities often have small campus police departments that are stretched thin when high-profile, controversial speakers come to campus. 
The AGs’ letter asks schools to confirm their facility use and security fee policies are viewpoint neutral and asks them to develop standards for applying fees. 
“There should be clear protocols for event approval and protecting speakers, ensuring security is the responsibility of the institution rather than a financial barrier on disfavored speech,” the letter reads. 
Courts have held that exorbitant security fees can violate the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees a right to free speech. A fee is especially dubious if it’s applied based on the content of the speech. 
For example, a federal judge last year blocked the University of New Mexico from requiring the school’s chapter of Turning Point to pay a $5,400 security fee to host a campus event featuring anti-transgender activist Riley Gaines. 
The AGs warned in their letter they would investigate all complaints made to their offices alleging universities are curtailing speech. 
Murrill and Bird were joined on the letter by Steve Marshall of Alabama, Stephen Cox of Alaska, Tim Griffin of Arkansas, James Utheimer of Florida, Chris Carr of Georgia, Todd Rokita of Indiana, Kris Kobach of Kansas, Andrew Bailey of Missouri, Austin Knudsen of Montana, Mike Hilgers of Nebraska, Gentner Drummond of Oklahoma, Alan Wilson of South Carolina, Marty Jackley of South Dakota, Ken Paxton of Texas and Derek Brown of Utah.

In a decades-long ministry to feed the hungry, the meals have rotated among five local churches, according to organizers. But that’s changing. Four of the churches have combined to form the new organization.

This story by Cassandra Hemenway was first published in The Bridge on Sept. 23, 2025.
Ask anyone involved with Montpelier’s community lunches and you’ll likely hear as much about community as you will about the free food. Four days a week, the lunches feature generous portions of hearty food, always with a vegetarian option. Anyone can come eat, no questions asked. Takeout is available. 
Amy, a guest at Trinity Church’s Sept. 10 lunch, sat with friends and bounced a baby on her lap. Amy said she was 50 days sober and just moved into an apartment. Before that, she’d been living outdoors for three years, she said. She comes to the meals almost every day they are available.
“I just come here and get lunch and enjoy the company of the community,” she said with a smile. 
In a decades-long ministry to feed the hungry, the meals have rotated among five local churches, according to organizers. But that’s changing. Four of the churches — Trinity Church, Christ Episcopal Church, Bethany Church and the Unitarian Church of Montpelier — have combined to form a new organization called the Community Table. (The fifth, St. Augustine’s Catholic Church, is still serving lunches on Fridays but has not joined the coalition.)
The aim: to open the program up to people who may not feel aligned with a church but do feel aligned with feeding neighbors, said Jay Voorhees, coordinating pastor of the Trinity Methodist Church. 
Becoming a separate organization will also allow the group to apply for federal nonprofit status and to bring organizers together for “cross-pollination,” said Nancy Reid, who volunteers on the Unitarian Church’s “Monday Team.” (Reid is also president of The Bridge’s board of directors.) 
How the meals are organized is changing, but the lunches themselves are not. They are served Monday through Thursday at Trinity (at 131 Main Street), where doors open around 8:30 a.m. for coffee and light breakfast. Guests are welcome to hang out there or return for lunch, which starts at 11:30 a.m. Last winter, when meals were served at Christ Church, that three-hour window turned the place into an unofficial warming space for those who had nowhere else to go in the cold. Staff members from Good Samaritan Haven joined church volunteers to help out. It’s unclear what will happen in the winter of 2025 and 2026.
The evolution of how the free weekday meals are organized started with the COVID-19 pandemic, said Theresa Lever, who coordinates Bethany Church’s “Wednesday Team.” 
Before COVID-19, Lever said, Bethany had big teams of volunteers, a crowd for lunch, and donations that totaled about $100 each week. “We were serving more than 100 people” per meal, she recalled. “It was people who needed that free meal, but it was also the workers who came from downtown. … The meter person would come on her break.”
Then COVID-19 hit. “Everything went outside,” Lever recalled. They and the other churches in town, which were all still offering lunches separately, switched to pre-made takeout. 
Then came the disastrous July 2023 flood, which left most of downtown Montpelier underwater and left only Christ Church with a working kitchen. But Lever says the volunteers didn’t miss a beat. All five churches started cooking meals out of Christ Church, serving meals outside at first, then moving into the church’s community room for indoor dining.
The churches kept their independence, even as they pinch-hit for each other when, say, a volunteer cook had to move on. Each church had its own shelf in Christ Church’s refrigerator and closet-sized pantry, each procured its own food through donations and purchases, and each brought its own team to cook and serve: Unitarians on Mondays, Bethany on Tuesdays, Trinity on Wednesdays, Christ Church on Thursdays, and St. Augustine’s on Fridays.
Meanwhile, Trinity’s flood repairs included an 18-month process of rewiring and moving its electrical service panel up from the basement, which made the kitchen unusable. Repairs were finished in June 2025, about the same time organizers decided to coalesce as the Community Table. Now the four churches use Trinity only, and what had been an effort of separate churches is united.
Despite a wealth of volunteer hours — Monday cook Albert Sabatini estimates it takes volunteers about 576 hours to serve 80 to 100 meals four days a week — donations help. Stephanie Krauss, coordinator of the Community Table and a Trinity member, puts the cost per meal at about $3.55, more than twice what it was five years ago, and half again what it was last year.
Some financial donations come from community members. A $965 grant — the Community Table’s first — recently came in from Hunger Mountain Co-op. 
Food donations come from the Just Basics, Inc. food pantry, the Vermont Food Bank (which also charges for some of its food), and Community Harvest of Central Vermont, Krauss said. Community members also donate baked goods and desserts to supplement the nutritious meals.
The Community Table is currently accepting donations through Christ Church, which has 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, until the group gets its own nonprofit designation. (Donations to the Community Table can be made out to Christ Church with “community lunch fund” on the memo line.) That should allow it to carry forward an already solid tradition many decades into the future, welcoming guests from all walks of life and continuing to strengthen the social fabric that makes up Montpelier.
Krauss said she doesn’t want to erase the fact that the churches have been serving the meals. 
“But the story, to me, is there’s a new way this is happening, which was created by the flood,” she explained. “(We are trying) to open it up to the community more. It’s not just a church thing anymore.”
Gloria Alexander, who works at Another Way, said she eats at the community lunches most days. 
Amid savory smells from the kitchen and the din of people chatting, Alexander said “It’s wonderful. It’s the community which I like. I think if I was well off, I would still enjoy coming here, because it’s the community, you know. It’s the sense of family that most people don’t really have.”

Kim Reynolds said Wednesday her administration’s efforts to implement “science of reading” and math education efforts have resulted in higher scores for Iowa students on national assessments.
Reynolds and school officials held a news conference to celebrate the recent gains for Iowa on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), used to rate student progress around the country. Reynolds said Iowa students’ scores have returned to pre-pandemic proficiency levels in reading, writing and math, and have exceeded previous levels in science.
Reynolds said these improvements showcase why she believes President Donald Trump and U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon’s plan to send funding directly to states instead of going through the federal Department of Education — a proposal opposed by many education groups — would better serve K-12 schools.

“That’s why we submitted the first-in-the-nation unified allocation plan to really align federal programs and resources to Iowa’s state and local education priorities, to bolster school improvement efforts informed by accountability and assessment and support school districts,” Reynolds said. “… With today’s good news, we’re proving that I think we’re up to the task, that we’re definitely on the right track, that we have put the infrastructure in place, that we really are ready and able to take that opportunity and continue strong partnership to move this state forward.”
Reynolds and Iowa Department of Education Director McKenzie Snow linked the NAEP score increases to measures signed into law on reading in 2024 and math in 2025 that provide support for schools, teachers and families that have students struggling in these subjects. The 2024 law focused on children in kindergarten through sixth grade who are not reading at grade-level proficiency, giving these students a personalized plan to assist them until they meet literacy benchmarks.
The most recent NAEP test scores show an 11% increase in reading proficiency among students who were in 3rd grade in the 2023-2024 school year when they were tested again as 4th graders in 2024-2025, according to state officials.
“And just three months ago, I signed the ‘Math Counts’ bill into law, which we believe will replicate our success in literacy,” Reynolds said. Because while math scores are increasing in elementary and middle school, our high schoolers are really lagging behind.”
The law signed this year takes a similar approach to mathematics instruction, providing early screening and targeted intervention strategies for K-12 students who are struggling with the subject, in addition to boosting math teaching resources for families and school staff.
The officials also said chronic absenteeism rates have fallen significantly in recent years. Snow said the average percentage of chronically absent students – defined as those who miss 10% or more of classes in a year – dropped 5.8 percentage points in the last year. That, combined with other improvements for schools in need of support and increased work-based learning attainment, show significant progress for Iowa student achievements, she said.
“Overall school performance is improving,” Snow said. “Schools in need of support are improving, early literacy is improving, science proficiency is improving, attendance is improving and work-based learning is growing. … Our continued commitment to evidence based practices. Instructional leadership and accountability is imperative, and we’re excited to build on this remarkable progress together.”
T.J. Schneckloth, superintendent of Davenport Community School District, said the education department and state Legislature’s work on addressing absenteeism has made a major impact in Davenport schools.
“Our chronic absenteeism has drastically reduced in Davenport, and a lot of that has to do with some of the teeth that’s put into that legislation,” Schneckloth said.
Senate File 2435, the state’s education appropriations bill in 2024, changed regulations regarding absenteeism and truancy for Iowa students, including having school districts notify county attorneys alongside parents and guardians when a student misses 10% of hours in a trimester, and sets up a procedure for creating an “absenteeism prevention plan” with parents and students. If a student misses 20% of nonexempt hours during a trimester or if they and their parents are found violating the agreed-upon plan, the county attorney is notified.
Schneckloth also said the law signed by Reynolds in April that required K-12 public school districts to adopt policies banning at minimum the use of cellphones during instructional periods beginning in the 2025-2026 school year has also had a major, positive impact.
When student representatives on the Davenport school board were asked about the cell phone policy, he said “you took you heard a sigh, because obviously kids would like to have their phones with them all the time.”
“But unanimously, all the way around, every one of those juniors and seniors said, ‘I’m more focused in class,’ and ‘I find, instead of going to my phone, I’ll start a conversation with person next to me,'” Schneckloth said. “And so that level of engagement is exactly what we hear when we travel around and talk to our businesses — ‘we want people show up and we want them to care while they’re there.'”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Attorneys were in court Wednesday as South Carolina’s elections agency continues to face challenges from two directions — a lawsuit over whether it should turn over voter information to the federal government and consecutive firings of its top directors.
Lawyers for a Calhoun County voter, the South Carolina Election Commission and Gov. Henry McMaster appeared before Judge Daniel Coble in the downtown Columbia courthouse to argue whether the governor should be allowed to take part in the lawsuit involving the personal data of the state’s 3.3 million registered voters.
The U.S. Department of Justice last month asked for the information — including names, birthdays, addresses, drivers’ license numbers and final digits of Social Security numbers — as part of a push by the Trump administration to get every state’s voter rolls.
South Carolina voter Anne Crook filed the lawsuit in response, citing privacy concerns.
The court appearance comes a day after the agency’s deputy director, Paige Salonich, was fired for placing a recording device in a room the state Election Commission’s governing board uses for meetings.
It was the second termination of a top election official in less than a week.
The commission fired Salonich after she was allegedly caught on tape placing the “unauthorized device,” according to a copy of a termination letter provided to the SC Daily Gazette through a public records request.
The letter, dated Monday, said Salonich’s action “raises serious concerns regarding trust, confidentiality and workplace integrity.”
She’s accused of leaving the recorder in the room Sept. 17. That’s the same day the commission voted 3-2 following a closed-door meeting to fire Howard Knapp, executive director since 2023, “out of a desire for new leadership.”
No termination documents were available in Knapp’s dismissal, said election commission spokesman John Catalano.
Salonich was initially put on unpaid leave the next day (Thursday).
SC Election Commission fires executive director

The State Law Enforcement Division has since opened an investigation into “allegations of wiretapping,” The State newspaper previously reported. SLED did not respond to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
While state law allows a person to record a conversation or public proceedings without notifying the other people involved, that person must be part of the conversation or in the room for the recording to be legal.
Salonich, whose salary was almost $142,000, is also accused of raising her voice to agency leadership, using profanity and disrupting the office the day of Knapp’s firing. According to witnesses, the letter said, that included “declaring that you were being ‘held hostage at you own (explicit language) job’ and ‘that you would never be a hostage in this (explicit language) place again.'”
The letter said her outburst “left other employees visibly shaken, created an unprofessional environment and undermined the commission’s ability to conduct business in an orderly and respectful manner.”
Salonich, who has worked at the state Election Commission since November 2021, tried to resign Monday but was told via email she was being terminated instead.
A lawyer representing Salonich did not respond to messages from the Gazette. Knapp also did not respond to a message.
Knapp, whose salary was $150,000, remains the subject of another ongoing investigation by SLED, agency spokeswoman Renee Wunderlich previously confirmed. In March 2024, SLED launched the investigation into unspecified allegations of misconduct at the request of the state attorney general’s office.
The commission has previously said the personnel issues are not related to “the conduct of any election in South Carolina.”
“The agency remains fully focused on administering upcoming elections and ensuring that South Carolina voters can continue to have confidence in the process,” Catalano said in a statement Wednesday.
SC can give voter data to Trump administration, state Supreme Court says

Meanwhile, Judge Coble is scheduled to hear more arguments Friday in the ongoing voter rolls case, as Crook’s lawyers seek to temporarily block the voter information release.
The state Supreme Court overturned on procedural issues a previous attempt to stop the information from being shared. Now, Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, who is Crook’s attorney, is trying again.
The elections agency has yet to provide the requested data to the Department of Justice as it continues to negotiate a memorandum of understanding. The federal agency informed the election commission this week it expects to provide a draft agreement “soon,” Catalano said.
“Once we receive it, we will review it to ensure consistency with South Carolina law and to address the technical details of the proposed data transfer,” Catalano said.
Coble also has yet to rule on whether the governor will be allowed to join the case against the agency.
Arguing against the governor’s admittance, Hutto said the governor is trying to “bigfoot” the state’s elections board.
“The governor shouldn’t come in and try and somehow force the Election Commission to do something that state law prohibits,” the Orangeburg Democrat told the judge.
All five members of the agency’s governing board are appointed by the governor to four-year terms. However, state law doesn’t allow the governor to remove them mid-term without cause. Hutto argued that’s meant to ensure the commission’s independence.
Grayson Lambert, the governor’s lawyer, said McMaster is not trying to inject himself into the commission’s ongoing negotiations with the federal government.
“This is not about politicizing anything. This is not about bigfooting the Election Commission,” Lambert said. “This is about defending state law and helping ensure that state law is properly interpreted.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3406-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-24 18:57:13.575890

(Courtesy of Washington State Department of Natural Resources)Washington’s governor and attorney general are both criticizing a federal proposal to lift restrictions on construction, logging, and mining on millions of acres of federal forestland.
Gov. Bob Ferguson and Attorney General Nick Brown separately submitted formal comments this month opposing the rollback of the so-called Roadless Rule. 
The federal regulation, established in 2001, prohibits industrial activity on about 2 million acres of the national forest in Washington.
“The Roadless Rule has become one of our country’s most consequential conservation policies ever,” Brown and seven other attorneys general wrote in joint comments. 
On the other side of the debate, logging interests have weighed in, urging the federal government to move ahead.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which houses the U.S. Forest Service, is aiming to finalize its rewrite of the rule before the end of next year.
The Trump administration’s proposed overhaul of the rule would end protections for about 45 million acres nationwide.
“In Washington state, these protections sustain clean water, fish and wildlife habitat, tribal treaty and cultural resources, and an outdoor recreation economy vital to our state’s identity,” Ferguson said in a letter submitted to Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on Sept. 18. 
Public comment on the federal proposal closed Sept. 19. The Department of Agriculture indicated there will be another opportunity for public comment when a draft environmental impact statement is released in March 2026. 
Washington has a total of 9.2 million acres of national forest land, of which 2 million are protected by the Roadless Rule. 
Roadless areas within the state include parts of the Olympic, Mount Baker Snoqualmie, Gifford Pinchot, Wenatchee, Okanogan, Colville, and Umatilla National Forests. Roadless areas also connect wildlife habitats in Olympic National Park, North Cascades National Park and Mount Rainier National Park, and border waterways such as the Snake and Columbia rivers. 
The 49-page document Brown signed onto was submitted by the attorneys general of Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont.
Brown noted that recreational areas protected by the Roadless Rule in Washington contribute to an estimated $400 million in economic activity tied directly to U.S. Forest Service lands. 
The rule also protects critical habitat for roughly a dozen threatened and endangered species, including Chinook salmon, gray wolves and the northern spotted owl, Brown said. 
Rescinding the rule, he said, would harm Washington’s economy and jeopardize the work the state has put into supporting the recovery of threatened and endangered species. 
Opening new areas up for road construction would also be unwise, Brown said, due to a backlog of national forest road maintenance in Washington. His comments cite estimates of over $236 million in maintenance already needed across 8,500 miles of forest service roads. As the roads erode, they deposit sediment into water systems and harm water quality. 
Rescinding the rule is in line with the Trump administration’s commitment to remove “burdensome, outdated, one-size-fits-all regulations that not only put people and livelihoods at risk, but also stifle economic growth in rural America,” Rollins said in a statement last month.  
As opposition boils up, industry groups, like the American Forest Resource Council, are backing the administration, saying that leaving the forests off limits has allowed them to grow too dense, raising the risks of wildfires and tree disease. 
“The Roadless Rule is based on the false notion that doing nothing is the best way to protect our forests,” American Forest Resource Council President Travis Joseph said in a statement this month. The council advocates for the timber industry in the Northwest. It submitted public comments in support of the proposed rule change with the California Forestry Association. 
In their joint comments, the American Forest Resource Council and the California Forestry Association said the Roadless Rule “unnecessarily prohibits, restricts, or reduces responsible access and active forest management.” They argue that active forest management, which includes logging, is “the most effective way to mitigate fire risk.” 
Opponents, including Brown and his fellow attorneys general, counter that the Roadless Rule allows for wildfire mitigation in the protected areas and argue that more human activity in the forests will increase fire risks. 
The comments from the attorneys general detail a range of procedures the U.S. Department of Agriculture has to follow before it can rescind the rule, including considering a reasonable range of alternatives and ensuring adequate public comment.
If the department does move forward with rescinding the rule, it is also required to work with the affected states and tribes to ensure compliance with other laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.
The American Forest Resource Council maintains that rescinding the rule will not undermine these other environmental safeguards. 
“It simply restores flexibility for local forest professionals to consider limited road access where necessary for science-based restoration or emergency response,” Joseph said.
Ferguson called for the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide a clear framework on how environmental protections will be maintained if the Roadless Rule is axed. 
“Absent such assurances, rescission risks undermining stability, predictability, and trust that communities, tribes, and states rely on,” Ferguson said. 
The lack of that framework, combined with the “abbreviated comment period and lack of tribal consultation” on the proposal, Ferguson said, has caused “significant uncertainty and concern.”
The statements from Ferguson and Brown come after tribal leaders and environmental advocates held a rally at the state Capitol earlier this month opposing the rule’s repeal.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/timber.jpg,,,2025-09-24 18:57:13.575890

Michelle Lujan Grisham joins Delaware and Kansas governors to urge congressional Republicans to extend ACA health insurance tax credits.,"Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly (left), NM Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer (below) held a press call on Sept. 24, 2025, urging Congressional Republicans to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits. (Screen grab)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Wednesday joined fellow Democratic governors from Kansas and Delaware to urge Congressional Republicans to extend the federal Affordable Care Act premium tax credits set to expire at the end of the year.
The health insurance credits have become a sticking point in negotiations over a spending bill Congress needs to pass to avoid a government shut-down at the end of the month.
According to nonprofit health care research organization KFF, over nine in 10 enrollees receive some amount of premium tax credit for their health insurance, which, if they expire, will cause out-of-pocket premiums to rise by more than 75% on average for the vast majority of individuals and families buying coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The tax credits also have also contributed “substantially” to Marketplace enrollment more than doubling to 24.3 million people in 2025, KFF says.
Currently, 75,000 New Mexicans are enrolled in the state’s marketplace, BeWell, for either health and/or dental insurance, according to an August news release from the state’s Office of the Superintendent of Insurance, and 88% of enrollees qualify for federal and state premium assistance. At present, more than 50% of those customers pay less than $10 a month for coverage, as a result of federal and state subsidies, OSI says. The office approved 2026 rates that will have an average increase of 35.7%. New Mexico’s own Health Care Affordability Fund will help offset the loss of the federal premium tax credits, OSI says, and the state Legislature plans to address the issue as part of its agenda for the special session starting Oct. 1.
In her remarks in Wednesday’s press call, Lujan Grisham said that “more than 27,000 folks, given the cost, the increased cost of these premiums, will be forced out of the private marketplace. They will make too much to be eligible for Medicaid, and even if they were, with the cuts to Medicaid down the pike, they are in an unstable, unsure situation.” 
The budget bill enacted by President Donald Trump in July includes cuts and changes to both Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that the New Mexico Legislature also plan to address in next week’s special legislative session.
Lujan Grisham acknowledged that the state’s affordability fund will help counter some of the negative impact in New Mexico if the federal credits expire, but noted that with rising costs, more of the fund will be needed to cover more people and will provide less coverage. “And that’s the problem,” she said. But moreover, she added, “I’m also pitching for America. Kansas doesn’t have one of those funds. California doesn’t have one of those funds. Texas doesn’t have one of those funds…and so we need to make sure that we’re doing something for America.”
Lastly, she added, “most of our providers and coverage entities, our HMOs and insurance companies, are multi-state or national. Some of them are international. This has a chilling impact on the stability of our overall healthcare systems for everyone. I want Congress to do the right thing here and make sure Americans are adequately protected.”
Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer said that extending the tax credits “is one of the simplest ways for Congress to bring relief to working American families that, let’s be honest, are already stretched thin and one of the most effective ways to foster long term economic growth. These aren’t statistics. These are families. These are small business owners. These are neighbors.”
Bottom line, Kansas Gov. and DGA Chair Laura Kelly said: “We’re here today calling on Republicans in Congress to do the right thing, come to the table, correct the fatal error of the budget bill that’s ripping through families and communities across our country, and extend ACA tax credits to help families afford basic health care. As Democratic governors, we represent the majority of American people in blue, purple and red states, we know that access to health care shouldn’t be a partisan issue.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DGAnewsSept242025-1024x583.jpg,,,2025-09-24 18:57:13.575890

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — More than 40 people showed up at a federal courthouse Wednesday for a hearing on the future of a University of South Dakota art professor suspended for a social media post about the killing of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. 
Speaking with that crowd surrounding him and U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier in front of him, Phillip Michael Hook’s lawyer said Hook ought to be immediately reinstated, and that the Board of Regents should not be allowed to proceed with a Monday disciplinary hearing that could end with his termination. 
Some in the audience walked into the courthouse with Hook, with whom they’d been speaking outside the courthouse in downtown Sioux Falls shortly before the hearing. Rick Weiland, a Sioux Falls activist known for his campaigns for Medicaid expansion and other progressive ballot measures, was among those in attendance.
A public sector employee “doesn’t forfeit the right to free speech because they happen to be a public employee,” Rapid City lawyer Jim Leach said.
Kirk was killed Sept. 10. That same day, Hook wrote a Facebook post that used a derogatory term to describe Kirk and questioned the veracity of his supporters’ “concerns” about political violence. The Facebook page was his personal account, but noted his status as a USD professor. He deleted the post within three hours, Leach said.
SD university professor files lawsuit opposing termination for social media post about Charlie Kirk

South Dakota Speaker of the House Jon Hansen soon called for Hook’s dismissal, as did the Legislature’s Freedom Caucus. Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden said he was “shaking mad” about Hook’s post. 
Hook was suspended on Sept. 12 and served a notice of his pending termination.
He was suspended because he angered powerful people in South Dakota with commentary on a “matter of public concern,” Leach said. 
“Yet here, we have the government, at the highest level, punishing Professor Hook for his political speech,” he added, arguing that Speaker Hansen’s communications with USD President Sheila Gestring appeared to be all it took to set the wheels of termination in motion.
Court precedent says a public employee can be fired for speech, Leach said, but there must be evidence that the speech was disruptive to the employer. In Hook’s case, Leach said, there’s no evidence in the record — including in the termination notice — that it was. 
Instead, he argued, the termination notice was an unconstitutional violation of Hook’s First Amendment rights and grounds for an immediate court order that would reinstate him and block the University of South Dakota from proceeding with its disciplinary action and barring retaliatory action. 
Justin Bell, representing the Board of Regents, admitted there’s no evidence in the disciplinary or court record that Hook’s post was disruptive to the workplace. But Bell told Schreier that’s because the court record is barely more than 24 hours old. Hook filed his case on Tuesday. 
Instead of immediately shutting down the Board of Regents, Bell argued, the judge should allow the case to proceed. 
The post, Bell argued, generated “hundreds” of calls and emails to the school, and may have created disruption for students and faculty.
With comments “as insidious as Professor Hook’s, made in a capacity that mentions his status at the university, it’s reasonable to conclude that there’s going to be disruption” for his employer, Bell said.
To say Hook was fired because Speaker Hansen reached out to the school’s president, Bell said, downplays the impact the post had for the university in potentially alienating a yet-untallied number of students, alumni and faculty.
“All we know is that Speaker Hansen is one of the people who reached out,” Bell said.
The First Amendment, Bell argued, “does not protect speech of this nature.” 
Judge Schreier said she would take the request for a temporary restraining order under advisement and issue a ruling in the coming days.

The Arkansas Department of Education issued a press release Friday announcing that a sliding-scale reimbursement structure would take effect Oct. 1 for its School Readiness Assistance Program to “prioritize access for working families and manage program demand responsibly.” The changes aim to reduce the program’s waitlist and sustain services statewide, the department said. 
Funded through the federal Child Care and Development Block Grant, the program provides financial assistance for child care to eligible, low-income families while parents work or attend school. The program currently serves more than 16,000 children in Arkansas. In February, the state created a waitlist (which now has around 1,100 children on it) so seats could be offered as funding became available, according to ADE.
Arkansas Department of Education creates searchable child care provider database

In a statement Wednesday, Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families said the changes to the program will make child care for eligible families less affordable, create barriers for providers to offer high-quality care and make it difficult for providers to keep programs running. The nonprofit called on the education department to delay the changes and solicit input from child care providers, families and community members who depend on quality child care programs. 
“It is disheartening that these changes were made without transparency and blindsided families and the early childhood care and education community,” the AACF statement reads. “The changes were announced on September 19, 2025, and go into effect on October 1. There is no time for providers and families to plan, and children are the ones left to feel the impact.”  
The decision to update rates and copayments on Oct. 1 was “driven by the need to ensure the program remains financially sustainable while continuing to prioritize access for working families across Arkansas,” ADE spokesperson Rachel Starks said Wednesday. Additionally, the state is serving more families “than ever before, and the program was heavily subsidized by COVID relief funds that have now expired,” she said.
“We recognize that implementing these changes on a short timeline can create challenges for providers as they plan budgets and communicate with families,” Starks said. “Please know that our team is reviewing all questions and comments as we work to provide additional guidance, resources, and technical support for providers during this transition.”
The updated copayment structure announced by the education department aligns provider reimbursement rates with Arkansas’ market rate survey so payments reflect current care costs, and adjusts the sliding-scale copay based on family income, according to the department news release. The state is also revising eligibility requirements to reflect the 2026 estimated family State Median Income, “which will allow more working families at the lowest income levels to receive priority,” according to the release. 
Under the changes, providers will be reimbursed at a single statewide market rate, except in Northwest Arkansas where Benton and Washington counties will have a higher market rate, according to ADE. 


Let us know what you think...


 

“Arkansas families rely on child care to work or complete their education, and providers need predictable funding to serve them well,” Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said in the release. “By aligning payments to current market costs, using a sliding-scale copay, and updated income requirements, we can prioritize the youngest children, and focus support where it is needed most.”
Families who are working or enrolled in school with income at or below the state poverty level will not pay a copayment for children before kindergarten, and families above the poverty level will pay a copay scaled to income and the age of the child, according to ADE. A family of three with a child under four and an income below $30,334 qualifies for up to $35 per day in childcare assistance with no copay. Families whose income is just under $64,459, may have a required copay of up to $12 per day depending on their child’s age.
Arkansas education department reduces work requirement for child care assistance program

AACF argued in its statement that more families already struggling to make ends meet will be required to pay a copayment to continue participating in the program as a result of the announced changes. 
“Last year, Arkansas made strides by eliminating copayments for families whose household income was between 40-75% of the state median income (SMI),” AACF stated. “Now, the state is reverting to old ways and requiring payment from those families with incomes over 40% of SMI who just recently got relief.”
Federal rules prohibit copayments higher than 7% of a family’s income, but the new structure lists a dollar rate that could exceed that amount, according to the nonprofit. 
The state’s reimbursement rate structure for providers is also reversing course, according to AACF, who noted that historically, Arkansas incentivized quality by offering higher reimbursement rates based on what quality level a provider earned. 
“Now, reimbursement rates will be a flat rate system, with the rate set depending on the type of care provided, like infant or school-aged,” AACF said. “Participating child care providers in most of the state will experience an average decrease in reimbursement of 18.5%. Some providers will lose $39 per day for each eligible infant enrolled in their programs.”
Noting the LEARNS Act, a wide-ranging education law approved by lawmakers in 2023 that overhauled the state’s K-12 system, “required engagement with stakeholders to create a seamless early childhood educational system that addresses access to quality child care,” AACF argued these new “unilateral changes move the state in the opposite direction.” 
“These changes will likely result in child care staff losing jobs, lower quality child care programs, increased prices for private payers, providers struggling even more to make ends meet, families who cannot afford the copayment losing access to child care, and ultimately, a harsher system for the families who need support the most,” AACF stated.

Vermont State Police identified Brady McGee as the officer who shot a resident at the end of a daylong standoff at a Riverside Avenue apartment complex on Sunday.
Police also identified Aaron Loucks, 32, of Burlington, as the man who was injured in the incident. 
Burlington police officers responded to a disturbance at the complex that morning, but Loucks “barricaded himself inside his residence,” according to a Tuesday press release from the state police. A confrontation with police began when he exited the apartment. 
Officers tried non-deadly force measures that were unsuccessful before McGee “discharged his patrol rifle, shooting Loucks,” the press release stated. 
Following the police shooting, Loucks remains in custody while receiving medical treatment at the University of Vermont Medical Center. He’s facing two misdemeanor charges of aggravated disorderly conduct, one for abusive obscene language and the other for threat of bodily injury or violence. 
Meanwhile, McGee remains on paid administrative leave pending a Vermont State Police investigation into his use of force, according to the press release. 
It isn’t the first time Loucks has faced criminal charges that raised concerns about his mental health. And it isn’t the first time McGee has been placed on leave by the police department.

In 2021, Loucks faced federal charges for possession of a firearm while using drugs after he allegedly threatened to disrupt Covid-19 vaccine distribution. 
“Loucks has struggled with psychological and drug addiction issues since high school,” according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney General’s Office in Vermont about the 2021 charges. 
Court documents show that residents called police after Loucks was yelling death threats and racial slurs out of his apartment window. 
One person reported that Loucks yelled something similar to “I am the bringer of death,” while gesturing with his hands that he was pointing an imaginary gun at them. Another person reported that Loucks was screaming the “N-word” at Black children playing outside the building and called one Black neighbor a “slave.” 
When police responded to the scene, Loucks flashed a knife blade at officers from a second story window and said “I want all of you to die,” court records show. 
One neighbor at the scene on Sunday afternoon told VTDigger she heard the suspect screaming and threatening police, and that the standoff had escalated throughout the day. 
Following the shooting, the Burlington Police Officer’s Association issued a statement in support of McGee’s use of force. 
“We at the BPOA are very proud of how our officers handled this extremely volatile, dynamic and dangerous situation,” the union wrote in its statement. 
McGee joined Burlington’s police department in 2018, then left to join another department in Connecticut in 2022 before returning to Burlington’s department later that year. 
During his second stint with the department, McGee was placed on paid administrative leave in December 2023 after allegedly driving his motorcycle up to 100 miles per hour alongside other police officers while off duty, according to Seven Days. 
For that incident, McGee was charged with negligent operation after the incident and pleaded not guilty, Seven Days reported.

Revenue Secretary Michael Houdyshell said computer access for staff is now limited to what they need for their jobs, and the department’s upgraded computer system logs “every single click” on an employee’s computer. He said the department now has automated alerts for unusual transactions, routes outside users through a secure e-portal, and blocks employees from accessing their own or family members’ records.
Those upgrades followed revelations of former departmental employees creating fake vehicle titles to avoid excise taxes or secure loans.
Houdyshell said the agency has also set up an anonymous tip line, requires annual conflict-of-interest and ethics training, and hired extra staff to ensure the department’s system is secure.
Althoff spoke about a former Child Protection Services employee who stole $1.8 million from the state over the course of 13 years. She was sent to prison earlier this year after being convicted of submitting fraudulent financial requests on behalf of children no longer in the state’s care, depositing the funds into accounts opened under their names, and withdrawing the money in cash for herself. Prosecutors said she did that 215 times between 2010 and 2023. 
“This is a situation where a voucher was being requested or initiated by the same employee that was approving it,” Althoff said. ”Well, that’s a problem. That’s a big problem.”
Althoff said the department has since overhauled its financial protocols. The department now segregates duties and requires multi-step approvals for new providers and payments, automatically closes accounts when a child ages out of the system, and is shifting from paper checks to electronic transfers. The agency also hired extra employees to evaluate risks and additional management for Child Protection Services. 
Committee Chair Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, praised the new safeguards.
“Fraud will always be an issue, but it sounds like you guys are doing a great job of getting a handle on it,” Howard said.
In other recent cases, former state employees faced accusations including self-issuing a medical marijuana card, forging food service inspection reports and spending vouchers intended for foster families on personal expenses.

In response to the run of prosecutions, Attorney General Marty Jackley supported a package of four bills passed during this year’s legislative session that expanded the investigatory authority of the state auditor; strengthened the Board of Internal Controls; instituted mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report; and established protections for whistleblowers.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)States don’t have to help enforce the Trump administration’s immigration policies to get disaster aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a federal judge in Providence ruled Wednesday.
Senior U.S. District Judge William E. Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island granted a motion for a permanent injunction against the Department of Homeland Security, calling a federal directive issued in April “coercive, ambiguous, unrelated to the purpose of the federal grants, and undermine[s] the system of federalism.” 
The directive made enforcing the administration’s immigration detention policy agenda a condition for receiving federal disaster relief aid.
“States rely on these grants for billions of dollars annually in disaster relief,” wrote Smith, a George W. Bush appointee. “Denying such funding if states refuse to comply with vague immigration requirements leaves them with no meaningful choice, particularly where state budgets are already committed.”
A group of 20 Democratic states attorneys general filed suit against the Department of Homeland Security in May, claiming the agency lacked the legal authority to require states to abide by immigration policy in order to receive funding.
They argued in their initial lawsuit that not only was the policy unconstitutional, but violated the Administrative Procedure Act.
Like all Democratic lawsuits, the AGs called the decision “arbitrary and capricious.” The Department of Homeland Security disagreed, arguing that conditions align with its core mission of enforcing federal immigration law.
But that was not enough of a justification for Smith.
“Such platitudes cannot substitute for an actual explanation of why it is necessary to attach sweeping immigration conditions to all the grants at issue here,” he wrote. 
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha called Smith’s ruling a “win for the rule of law” and reaffirmed that President Donald Trump cannot pick and choose what federal laws to follow.
“Today’s permanent injunction by Judge Smith says, in no uncertain terms, that this Administration may not illegally impose immigration conditions on congressionally allocated federal funding for emergency services like disaster relief and flood mitigation,” Neronha said in a statement. “Case closed.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to request for comment.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Legislature will form a new interim committee and is anticipating a special session to handle $500 million expected from the federal government for rural health care over the next five years.
The Rural Health Transformation Program, created by the 10-year budget reconciliation law, makes $50 billion available to states to improve health care in rural communities between 2026 and 2030. 
It was held out by members of Congress as a means to offset losses rural states will suffer from federal cuts to Medicaid approved elsewhere in the bill.
North Dakota will receive at least $100 million each year from the program, said Sarah Aker, executive director of medical services for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services. 
Officials predict only 5% of North Dakota Medicaid recipients will be impacted by program changes

The application was released Sept. 15. States only have until Nov. 5 to apply, which must include plans for how they will use their money.
North Dakota could be eligible for more funding based on the quality of its application, Aker said.
“We really want to make sure that we’re setting up North Dakota to be competitive,” Aker told lawmakers during a Wednesday committee meeting.
The money can be used for behavioral health, workforce, infrastructure development, disease prevention and chronic disease, and other areas described in the bill.
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, announced after Aker’s presentation that Legislative Management would assemble a committee of lawmakers to help the Department of Health and Human Services put together its application.

The committee will likely include members of the standing Human Services Committee, the chairs of the Senate and House appropriations committees and lawmakers who serve on the Human Services Division of the Budget Section, Hogue said.
He acknowledged the state will be under a time crunch to prepare its application, so the committee members should expect a “very aggressive” October meeting schedule.
“They want to get the money out to the states, and they want to see the states spend it in short order,” Hogue said.
Hogue said in an interview he expects a special legislative session, but the timing at this point is unknown.
“There will have to be a special session because the federal legislation says the money has to be obligated,” Hogue said. “We don’t come back until January 2027.” 
House Majority Leader Rep. Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said the shortened application window provides challenges.
“We want to do it correctly so that it benefits the state to the best of our ability,” Lefor said.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

The Department of Health and Human Services also would seek spending authority from the Legislature in future regular legislative sessions.
The Department of Health and Human Services put out a survey to health care providers and members of the public in August to gather ideas on how the state should use the money, Aker said.
Survey respondents identified the retention and recruitment of rural health care workers as a leading priority, according to a presentation to lawmakers Wednesday afternoon.
Aker said the agency will host listening sessions in October to walk through the results of the survey and give the public more opportunities to provide input.
She said previously that the Department of Health and Human Services expects 3% to 5% of the state’s Medicaid population to be impacted by new eligibility requirements authorized in the tax break and spending law.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — A state-spanning sting operation in June drew indictments for the owners of five smoke shops in South Dakota this week, according to Attorney General Marty Jackley.
The indictments, issued between Sept. 16 and Tuesday, were the result of targeted purchases of products marketed as legal in stores in Aberdeen, Sioux Falls, Pierre and Rapid City. 
Authorities suspected the products — some made using hemp-derived but chemically modified ingredients, others made with chemicals marketed as “magic mushrooms” — contained illegal compounds or were sold for the express purpose of intoxication.
“Every one of the five shops where we did buys had illegal drugs,” Jackley said. 
Only one shop owner was indicted on felony charges. In that case, originating with a purchase at Masterpiece Smoke Shop in Pierre, the owner is alleged to have sold felony amounts of marijuana that had been marketed as legal hemp. That charge was tied to pre-rolled “Thumpers” joints, according to court documents. 
Rapid City policing agencies target ‘diet weed’ with compliance checks

That owner is also alleged to have sold a product called “Legal Magic Mushrooms” that allegedly contain a controlled substance called psilocin. The owner also faces a felony charge of distributing drugs in a drug-free zone.
The other shops targeted were All the Smoke in Aberdeen, Puff City in Sioux Falls, Blazin’ Aces Smokes and Vape in Sioux Falls, and ZyGlam Smoke Shop in Rapid City. The charges in those cases are misdemeanors.
Jackley announced the indictments at the Law Enforcement Center in Sioux Falls, flanked by officials from multiple agencies on one side and posters showing a package of “magic mushroom” chocolates on the other. 
Many of the products sold by smoke shops across South Dakota are marketed as being derived from hemp and therefore legal under the 2018 federal farm bill, but Jackley said the packaging makes clear that “these are not agricultural products.”
“They’re clearly packaged for kids,” he said. 
Lawmakers in South Dakota passed a bill in 2024 to bar the sale — but not the possession — of products whose hemp-based intoxicants are chemically modified. That crime is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
Local police in Rapid City conducted a compliance check targeting businesses suspected of selling modified hemp earlier this year. As of Wednesday, the Pennington County State’s Attorney’s Office was still waiting on lab test results for the products purchased from eight shops in that operation. 
In early August, Sioux Falls Police Department spokesman Aaron Benson told South Dakota Searchlight that his department had sent warning letters to smoke shops, conducted compliance checks, and intends to continue doing so.
Of the four shop owners indicted for misdemeanors in the statewide sting, three face the modified hemp charge. Another shop owner was charged with the sale of industrial hemp for smoking. All four misdemeanor indictments include charges for selling a product for the purposes of intoxication, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine.

The project, which cost about $55 million, is one of the largest affordable housing developments built in Vermont in recent memory.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
SHELBURNE — Once the site of an Econo Lodge motel, a nondescript lot tucked off Route 7 has been transformed into this Chittenden County town’s newest neighborhood.
Called Bay Ridge, it is one of the largest affordable housing developments built in Vermont in recent memory. Nearly 100 new homes will be either rented or sold at permanently subsidized rates.
At a ribbon-cutting ceremony Wednesday, elected officials hailed the project — a joint effort by the nonprofits Champlain Housing Trust and Evernorth — as a model for addressing the state’s housing crisis. 
“We want to make more dollars available so that this kind of project can be replicated across the state,” said Vermont Senate Majority Leader Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast, who lives a half-mile away from the development. 
All of the homes in the new neighborhood come with income-restrictions for potential tenants and buyers to qualify.
The development consists of 68 apartments, including one-bedrooms in renovated motel buildings and three- and four-bedroom units in sleek, newly-constructed buildings. Rents range widely; a three-bedroom costs $1,725 monthly, according to the housing trust. Twenty of the apartments will be set aside for people who have been unhoused.

Twenty-six shared-equity condominiums, priced between $170,000 to $190,000 each, line a freshly paved road. Their estimated market values are more than twice that amount, according to the trust’s website. 
The development will feature both on-site and off-site solar arrays to offset energy usage, and it will soon host a playground. Families have already begun to move in.
The project, which cost about $55 million, was among the largest recipients of federal Covid-era funding that Vermont poured into housing development. It also received $14 million in private equity from federal tax credits.
On average, it cost about $584,000 to build each of the new homes, according to a funding source breakdown provided by Champlain Housing Trust. That’s more than double the median cost of affordable rental housing in Vermont before the pandemic, when construction costs skyrocketed.
Champlain Housing Trust purchased the old Econo Lodge more than a decade ago as temporary housing for people experiencing homelessness. As the organization began to redevelop the site, it purchased another hotel across the street, which it continues to run as an emergency shelter.
While the pace of homebuilding in Vermont has picked up over the last few years, publicly-subsidized affordable housing – including projects like Bay Ridge – make up a modest fraction of the overall market. Recent assessments indicate that the state still needs to double or triple the number of homes produced annually to return the market to a healthy condition.  
“Often when we’re here at these ribbon cuttings, people will say, you know, ‘This is great that we have this housing, but it’s a drop in the bucket in Vermont,’” said U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., at the event on Wednesday. “But we have to celebrate the successes. We have to draw attention to the fact that we are making progress.”

(Screenshot via Florida Channel livestream)A Florida Board of Education member said Wednesday that he views local school board members who have defied state directives as “clout chasing.”
During a meeting in Fort Walton Beach, board members again spent a chunk of time voicing displeasure with the Alachua County School Board’s behavior.
On the big screen at the meeting held at Northwest Florida State College, DOE officials displayed a Facebook comment from the Alachua board’s vice chair Tina Certain following the death of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and his memorial service Sunday in Arizona. 
“I didn’t watch any of that Drump rally! I went to see an elder bcs the weight of it all — how a 31 yr old uneducated white boy has been glorified,” Certain wrote in a Facebook comment. “He has a organization bcs a millionaire gave him money & connections to start it. To see the feds & state elevate him angers me. It is heavy but I know I can stay home. Gotta fight despite being tired of it all.”
State board member Daniel Foganholi made known his view. 
“If it’s a mistake, and a true mistake, we show grace. It’s not a mistake,” Foganholi said. 
“I am convinced that this is what we call clout chasing. A lot of these board members are no-names, have no name recognition, and if they do something to get the attention of the commissioner, or the governor, or the community, to get 500-plus complaints on saying something, then they get corrected, then all of the sudden, they’re on CNN being victim.”
During its last meeting in August, the board voted to keep an eye on the Alachua board for the coming school year to ensure that its members do not suppress the First Amendment rights of the public, something state officials claim happened. 
Alachua County School Board falls under close scrutiny from Board of Education

Last month, the Alachua board’s chair, Sarah Rockwell, was criticized by state board members following her posting to Facebook about the death of professional wrestler Hulk Hogan.
Now, state board members expressed to Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas that they are ready to take action against the county board. State board member Marylynn Magar said the Alachua board is “baiting” and “trying to get a reaction out of us.”
“If you want a reaction out of this board, I can tell you, you’ll probably get it,” Magar said.
State board member Esther Byrd said she is “out of words.” “This isn’t workable, it just can’t continue like this.”
“They know what they’re doing. These board members know what they’re doing,” Foganholi said. “All of the sudden, I’m a victim on the evening news, and then all of the sudden you’ll see next year somebody’s running for higher office, I got it.”
Foganholi referenced two incidents in the state. In Leon County, a member of its board criticized Kamoutsas for sending out a letter warning against commenting negatively about Kirk’s death and went on to call Kirk “a racist, misogynist, homophobic Klansman.” In Palm Beach County, board member Edwin Ferguson, during a meeting, called Kirk a “racist bigot.”
“I’m not convinced it’s a mistake, now it’s about clout chasing,” Foganholi said during the Alachua discussion. 
Earlier this month, Hillsborough County School Board member Jessica Vaughn suggested she could run for governor if she is removed from that board for battling with the state over removing books from libraries considered sexually explicit.
“Got board members running for senator, governor — we see it. So I don’t think it’s an accident,” Foganholi said. 
Foganholi previously served as a two-time Gov. Ron DeSantis-appointee to the Broward County School Board. He ran for election to stay on the board, but lost. Days after his unsuccessful bid for the Broward board, DeSantis again appointed him, this time to the State Board of Education.

U.S. Rep. Kat Cammack, a Republican from Gainesville, criticized Certain’s social media comment.
“Instead of prioritizing our children, the @AlachuaSchool board members seem to be teaching a master class in hate,” Cammack posted to X on Tuesday.
“@TinaCert, you have failed our children, you are promoting hate, and for that, you should resign immediately,” the representative concluded. 
WCJB reported that Certain rejected Cammack’s call to resign. In a statement provided to the TV station, Certain said Kirk’s “rhetoric was intended to demean through racism,” citing his previous comments about Supreme Court Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson, former Vice President Kamala Harris, former U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (R-Texas), and political commentator Joy Reid.
Certain told the news station that “Charlie Kirk’s assassination was tragic and horrific, and my prayers are with his wife, his children, and all who loved him,” and “While my personal Facebook comment was poorly worded it does not change the reality of his rhetoric.”
Reactions to Kirk’s death have prompted a national discussion about freedom of speech and speech calling for violence.
“For me, it’s seeing that, and somebody that is a minority, somebody that has experienced racism, you replace that word right there, ‘white boy’ with ‘brown boy or black boy,’ it’s outrage. I don’t care if it’s reverse racism, racism is racism,” Foganholi said. 
“I think we’ve had enough,” Board Chair Ryan Petty said of Certain’s Facebook comment, asking Kamoutsas to research how the state board can take action against the Alachua County school board member. 
The state also sent a letter to Alachua County on Tuesday, informing them they are out of compliance in not reporting School Environmental Safety Incident Reporting data, the department said. Alachua County is the only district in the state that has not submitted the data, Kamoutsas said.
“It”s one thing though to run a sloppy and dysfunctional board meeting, it’s quite another to violate state law,” Petty said. “And that SESIR data as the board in Alachua should be aware, is critical to understanding whether or not there are school safety issues in the county.”
The district had three days from the sending of the letter to respond to the state. If not, Petty said he will call a special board meeting.

Jeffrey Amestoy, chief justice of the Vermont Supreme Court from 1997 to 2004, is best known for authoring the 1999 decision in Baker vs. Vermont that legalized same-sex civil unions. That case laid the groundwork for the legalization of same sex marriage in Vermont a decade later and ultimately led to the U.S. Supreme Court legalizing same sex marriage in 2015.
At the age of 79, Amestoy is still a prolific writer, but in a different genre. His latest book is a true crime legal thriller that he spent years researching. Winters’ Time: A Secret Pledge, a Severed Head, and the Murder That Brought America’s Most Famous Lawyer to Vermont, is the story of when celebrity attorney Clarence Darrow came to Vermont to defend a convicted murderer before the Vermont Supreme Court. The book was just published by the Vermont Historical Society.
Winters’ Time recounts the brutal murder of Cecelia Gullivan, who was killed in her home in Windsor, Vermont in November 1926. Gullivan, a single woman, was the treasurer of the Cone Automatic Machine company in Windsor. Police quickly arrested John Winters, a machinist at her company, and he was promptly tried, convicted and sentenced to death. That’s when Clarence Darrow entered the case after the Winters family called in a favor promised by Darrow’s son.
Amestoy, who was Vermont’s attorney general from 1985 to 1997, set the scene for what would become one of Vermont’s most sensational trials. “By the 1920s you had the first real mass media with radio and newspapers racing to outdo each other in circulation wars that focused primarily on murders and then a tremendous interest in celebrities,” Amestoy said. “Darrow sort of combined two of those: he was an extraordinarily successful defense lawyer, adamantly opposed to capital punishment … And then he was famous for his ability to speak to larger social issues.”
The death penalty was among the issues at play. “There was a tremendous amount of focus on capital punishment in Vermont but not, in fact, from those opposed to it, more about making sure that Vermont had a method of execution that would work,” said Amestoy. Winters would be only the second person executed by electric chair, which had recently been installed at the Windsor prison.
Vermont executed 26 people between 1778 and 1954. The state abolished capital punishment in 1972 following a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The most sensational aspect of the trial of John Winters was the prosecution’s use of the victim’s severed head as an exhibit. “That had never happened in Vermont legal history and as far as I was able to determine, hadn’t ever happened in American legal history either,” said Amestoy.
Amestoy said that the Winters case “gave us a lens on Vermont in the 1920s in terms of gender.” Cecilia Gullivan was an “extraordinary single woman, sort of a modern woman of the time.” He noted that Gullivan was “probably the highest ranking female executive in Vermont, a tremendously capable woman who had the authority for managing the plant.” Her murder was “extraordinary because of the status of the victim, and it immediately became front page news, not only in Vermont, but in Boston and really all over the country.”
There were rumors raised at Winters’ trial that Gullivan was in a relationship with Frank Cone, the owner of the company, who some thought was a suspect in her death. Amestoy noted that women did not sit on juries at that time. Vermont in the 1920s was “not attuned to issues of gender,” said Amestoy.
Clarence Darrow succeeded in winning a retrial for John Winters, who then pleaded guilty to second degree murder on Darrow’s advice, though Winters publicly maintained his innocence. After serving 20 years in prison, Winters was pardoned in 1949 by Gov. Ernest Gibson. Clarence Darrow had saved the convict’s life.
Amestoy is no stranger to sensational cases himself. His civil unions decision, which he famously wrote “is simply a recognition of our common humanity,” changed the national conversation about same sex unions.
“I thought that opinion helped move that issue in a way that allowed Vermonters to address a social issue of extraordinary importance in a way that I think stood as an example to the country. So to have been able to play a part in that was obviously something I was thankful for.”

But the city's officials say their legal fight with CoreCivic is strictly about making the company follow development codes. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Leavenworth officials aren’t backing down from holding private prison company CoreCivic accountable to development regulations even after the U.S. Department of Justice jumped into the case Tuesday.
The DOJ filed a statement of interest in the U.S. District Court case between Nashville-based CoreCivic and Leavenworth, arguing the city was violating the supremacy clause in the U.S. Constitution.
“The federal government’s filing does not change our view of the case or the approach we plan to take,” said W. Joseph Hatley, a Kansas City, Missouri, attorney representing the city of Leavenworth. “The arguments in that filing mirror arguments CoreCivic has previously made, without success.”
The clause says federal laws are supreme over state laws, and in its filing, the DOJ said Leavenworth is interfering in the federal government’s immigration enforcement efforts.
Leavenworth Mayor Holly Pittman has said the city’s fight over reopening CoreCivic’s prison isn’t driven by politics, despite repeated outcry from Leavenworth residents against housing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees. 
She said the city is concerned about holding businesses accountable to their development regulations, which would require CoreCivic to apply for a special use permit.
Earlier this year, CoreCivic announced it planned to reopen its prison facility in Leavenworth to fulfill an ICE contract that would pay the company $4.2 million per month. But Leavenworth officials contend the company must follow the city’s revised development process and apply for a special use permit.
In court filings, the city’s attorneys highlighted issues with CoreCivic’s operation of its previous prison, which closed in 2021, including failing to cooperate with Leavenworth police and failure to report the death of an inmate for six days. Leavenworth officials have said a special use permit would allow them to address such problems.  
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse on Wednesday set a hearing on a CoreCivic motion for a preliminary injunction for 3 p.m. Nov. 25, Hatley said.

In the past few years, he’s personally lobbied local governments and state lawmakers up and down Florida to pass legislation enhancing the state’s ban on texting while driving to get a “hands-free” distracted driving measure into law.
In 2023, distracted driving resulted in the deaths of 3,275 people, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which reported that “texting is the most alarming distraction.”
In the 2025 regular legislative session, a hands-free driving bill sponsored by Sen. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach, was approved in that chamber, 37-9. But its House companion (HB 501) sponsored by Rep. Allison Tant (D-Tallahassee) never moved at all.
The bill was placed in two House committees: the Government Operations Subcommittee, chaired by Pinellas County Republican Linda Chaney, and State Affairs, chaired by Manatee County Republican Will Robinson. Neither lawmaker allowed the bill to come before their committees.
Appearing during the Pinellas County legislative delegation meeting on Wednesday, an angry Branca called out Chaney, who sat with her colleagues on a stage at St. Petersburg College’s Clearwater campus.
“You stopped it cold,” he said to her. “After all the work, all the testimony, all the grieving parents who begged you to act. You chose to not let it through. That was not leadership, that was political cowardice and I’m standing here to look you in the eye and tell you to your face.”

Chaney did not comment at the time. She left the meeting about a half-hour before it concluded and did not respond to a request for comment by a Phoenix reporter later in the day.
A year ago, Branca made equally critical remarks to Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie following a similar legislative standoff. During the 2024 session, Tant’s hands-free driving bill won approval in all three of its committees in that chamber, but a companion bill in the Senate was never heard.
The chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee that year was DiCeglie, and Branca chastised him publicly at the Pinellas County legislative delegation meeting in January for not allowing the bill to advance. The two engaged in a sharp exchange after the event.
But in a Senate committee meeting this April, DiCeglie told Branca that after taking the emotion out of it, he supported the legislation.
“I looked at the statistics,” he said. “I looked at the data, and I looked at what 31 other states did. And I thought of you and I thought of your son, Anthony.”
“I’m proud that you’re standing here in front of us today telling your story,” DiCeglie added. “That has translated into what I believe is good public policy, and I think that’s going to translate into saving lives. And regardless of what happens this point forward, I think that you can look yourself in the mirror and know that you did what was right in your heart.”
A hands-free driving law went into effect in South Carolina on Sept. 1. That makes 33 states in the U.S. that have passed such legislation.
Whether the bill moves in the 2026 Florida legislative session remains to be seen.
“Support the hands-free law,” Branca said in closing. “Bring it back. Pass it. Save lives. Anthony should still be here. I couldn’t save him. You can save the next. Will you?”

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (Alaska Beacon file photos)Alaska Republican U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan signed on to a letter with 10 other U.S. senators, calling on the U.S. Department of Education to reverse the decision to cut millions in congressionally approved grant funding for Native American-serving colleges and universities nationwide. 
The letter, addressed to U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, argues that an estimated $36.1 million in grant funding already allocated under the Higher Education Act should be distributed to colleges and universities serving Native students nationwide. 
Senators wrote the funds are already authorized and appropriated by Congress and should go toward its intended colleges and universities nationwide, “including dollars that are part of ongoing grants – projects, programs, and services that are already in motion and that are serving currently enrolled students,” they said. 
“These institutions are statutorily authorized to receive federal support from the Department to strengthen their capacity to serve American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian students, and rely on this federal support to adequately serve enrolled students,” they said. 
“The Department’s decision to reprogram this critical source of funding for these colleges jeopardizes not just their continued existence, but also undermines the federal government’s trust and treaty obligations to provide Native students an education,” they wrote.
Earlier this month, Sec. McMahon announced that $350 million in congressionally approved funding for minority-serving institutions, a federal grant category that includes funding for Black, Hispanic, Asian-American and Native American students, would be reallocated. McMahon cited “racial quotas” as discriminatory and unconstitutional. “To further our commitment to ending discrimination in all forms across federally supported programs, the Department will no longer award Minority-Serving Institution grants that discriminate by restricting eligibility to institutions that meet government-mandated racial quotas,” McMahon said. 
The group of three Republican and nine Democratic senators rejected the claims, saying “to be clear, these grants do not impose racial quotas or restrict admissions based on race, but support institutions that deliver on the federal trust responsibility to provide an education for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians because of their unique legal status and political relationship with the United States.”
In Alaska, University of Alaska officials say they are still reviewing the extent of the funding freeze, but University of Alaska Fairbanks officials report the grant elimination totals at least $8.8 million across campuses. 
Senators argued that the funding cut contradicts the Trump administration’s expressed focus on career and technical education, and said the funds boost capacity for institutions serving not only Native students, but wider student populations. 
“As such, we again urge you to reverse the decision,” the senators wrote, “to release these funds, as appropriated by Congress, so that the work these schools do to support the trust responsibility, as well as the next generation of leaders as part of our nation’s bright future, can continue.
The letter was signed by Murkowski, as the chair of the US Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and committee co-chair U.S. Sen. Brian Shatz, D-Hawaii; along with Sens. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska; Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii; Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina; Ben Ray Luján, D-New Mexico; Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona; John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado; Michael Bennett, D-Colorado; Mark Kelly, D-Arizona; Tina Smith, D-Minnesota; and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota. 
A spokesperson for Murkowski said as of Wednesday they have not had a response from the department.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A state committee approved a series of changes to the State Health Benefits Program on Wednesday that will raise some member costs in a bid to reduce New Jersey’s spending on employee benefits by $150 million in 2026.
The resolutions approved at the State Health Benefit Program’s Wednesday plan design committee meeting will raise copays, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums, particularly for out-of-network services.
Other changes will increase members’ share of costs for prescription drugs and impose a 50% coinsurance rate on certain procedures — like endoscopies, knee replacements, and colonoscopies, among some others — done by out-of-network providers.
Wednesday’s votes mark the latest attempt to shore up New Jersey’s beleaguered public worker health plans, which have faced years of escalating premiums that threaten a full collapse of some parts of the state plan.
Spokespeople for Gov. Phil Murphy declined to comment, and a spokesperson for the Communications Workers of America, the state’s largest public-sector union, did not return a request for comment.
NJ governor hopefuls split on forcing school districts to merge

Resolutions increasing medical and prescription copays and requiring coinsurance for some out-of-network procedures will apply only to active state workers, not retirees enrolled in the State Health Benefits Program.
The resolutions will increase copays on all classes of prescription drugs, with larger raw increases for higher-cost, brand-name medications. That includes higher copays for GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Wegovy.
Members will be required to pay a $45 copay for a 30-day supply of GLP-1 medications if they are engaged in a lifestyle management program, or $125 if they are not.
The plan design changes were spurred by language in the state’s annual budget that requires officials to identify and implement $100 million in savings within the State Health Benefits Program in the current July-to-June fiscal year. Those savings were meant to total $200 million over the course of 2026.
The state’s actuaries rejected nearly every savings proposal submitted by unions, saying they could not weigh the cost savings they promised.
Aon, the actuary, greenlit a range of proposals made by administration officials, many of which focused on reducing the state’s share of health care costs.
That share, called an actuarial value, sits between 93% and 98% in New Jersey’s existing state plans, though most members are enrolled in plans at the higher end of that range, according to a Treasury report released in May.
Administration and labor officials reached a separate agreement earlier in September that reduced the level of cuts and offered more conservative increases to member costs than were originally proposed by the administration.
“This entire environment was greatly disrupted by the budget bill,” said Micahel Zanyor, a committee member who represents the New Jersey State Troopers Fraternal Association. “It created a situation where tough choices had to be made to protect as many people as we could from rate increases, and I believe these five resolutions we’re voting on accomplish that.”
Staff from the state’s pension and benefits division said the changes approved at Wednesday’s meeting would not be in place when the new plan year begins on Jan. 1 and would not affect the plan’s regular open enrollment period, which runs the entire month of October.
Earlier in September, the State Health Benefits Commission approved a 20% premium increase for state workers’ plan and a 37% increase for local government plans administered by the state.
Local government workers’ plan faces a death spiral as municipal governments flee the State Health Benefits Program for options in the private market, according to a March report from the Treasury. Those departures push premiums higher, spurring more towns and counties to drop state plans.

They were wrong and still are. But the model many were hoping would save the day — nonprofit news that depends on donations and grants instead of subscriptions and ads — is more fragile than expected. That proved true this week when Seattle-based Cascade PBS said it is shuttering its vibrant, award-winning newsroom. It marks the end of an 18-year run for the publication originally known as Crosscut, one of the early entrants into nonprofit news.
The organization’s leadership blames $3.5 million in cuts from the federal government after Congress signed off on President Donald Trump’s demands to stop supporting the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
About a dozen journalists and a handful of others from throughout the organization were given notice that their jobs were ending at Cascade PBS. Similar news is hitting public broadcasting stations around the nation, or will be soon.
I cautiously sang the praises of the nonprofit approach when, in December 2019, I joined Crosscut. It was a few years earlier, in 2015, when Crosscut merged with public TV station KCTS-9. We were at the cutting edge of a movement to combine in-depth journalism with the financial might of local NPR and PBS stations.
I told my friends and my team of talented journalists that Crosscut could continue indefinitely its important work covering the stories the more mainstream media didn’t have time to focus on because we were attached to the PBS station. Who doesn’t love Elmo with their donation dollars?
We paid our reporters decently. We had a dumpy, yet centrally located office, which was upgraded to beautiful new headquarters last year. And the bosses left coverage decisions to me and the other journalists.
Flash forward to this week, and many loyal readers, as well as journalists around the state, are in mourning. Elmo couldn’t save Crosscut. And neither could the donors who dug deep after they heard of congressional action to rescind federal funding already committed to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
Others blame Cascade PBS leadership for making the wrong choice. I’m not going to debate that decision because it is being aired thoroughly elsewhere, and I wasn’t in the room where it was discussed. But I will push back on the comments from one of my former editors who described the Crosscut experiment as a disappointment that “rarely lived up to its potential.”
Here’s a short list of some ways Crosscut journalists met their potential, doing important journalism outside of the daily grind of the news cycle:

Melissa Santos’ nine-month investigation of the way bad cops kept their jobs in Washington, even though everyone knew they were trouble.
Joseph O’Sullivan’s work with Shauna Sowersby shedding light on secrecy in Olympia under the claim of legislative privilege. 
David Kroman’s investigation into racist allegations at Seattle Children’s Hospital.
The Investigation Team’s watchdogging of federal pandemic aid.
Mai Hoang’s efforts to turn the relatively boring but important topic of redistricting into an explanatory series that made sure regular people understood how it impacted them.
Lilly Ana Fowler’s in-depth coverage of immigrant detention, years before most of us were paying attention.
Hannah Weinberger’s deceptively simple environmental stories on how the changing climate was impacting all of us and her advice on how we could cope.
Plus, there were years of legislative and city hall coverage with too many stories to list by Josh Cohen and others.

This small newsroom kept much larger outlets like The Seattle Times on their toes for nearly two decades and made sure Washingtonians understood how government actions affected their lives.
Seattle Times Executive Editor Michele Matassa Flores, like a lot of prominent journalists working in Seattle today, toiled at Crosscut earlier in her career, working as an editor there from 2010-2011. 
“Crosscut has been an important part of the media landscape here for many years,” Flores wrote in an email. “Just looking at the site right now, Cascade is examining the governor’s early months in office, updating its own investigation over wind energy in Eastern Washington, and providing right reporting on arts and culture. These are stories that provide a true public service.”
She acknowledged that Crosscut helped make Times journalists better while strengthening civic engagement. 
“At such a critical time for our democracy, we need more reporting, more voices, more people watching what our government leaders do. Not fewer,” Flores wrote.
She called the politically motivated cuts to public media funding more than sad. It’s frightening. 
For those vilifying Cascade’s leadership and not the federal government over this decision, I want to make sure you know that Crosscut would have died a decade ago if KCTS didn’t recognize the potential for a meaningful collaboration. That was nearly 10 years of great journalism and growth that would not have happened. 
The last writer and editor from the beginning of Crosscut who still works at Cascade PBS today agrees with me that those years were a gift to the community. 
Knute Berger, known on TV, audio and in print as Mossback but also in the journalism world for his time as editor of The Seattle Weekly, describes the early years: “I was part of the start-up group that David Brewster collected to go forth and try to add something new to the regional media ecosystem.”
Berger recalls that Brewster built a community of writers who were all free agents at the time: freelancers, part-timers, retirees — smart people who wanted an outlet for civically minded journalism.
“And it almost worked until the money ran out, and then KCTS-9 saved the day by taking us in,” Berger wrote in an email, where he offered a long list of journalists who made a difference. 
Casey Corr, another of Crosscut’s original writers, spoke at length about Brewster’s vision and how he attracted talented journalists to work for free, which might have been part of Crosscut’s early formula for success. 
But Corr said it was the way Crosscut approached its reporting and writing that attracted readers and gave the publication legs: a focus on behind the scenes, who was influencing who.
“When I wrote for Crosscut, I felt liberated in the sense that I could tell readers this is how it really works. I never felt that way completely writing for either of the daily newspapers,” Corr said.
One of the publication’s early editors, Joe Copeland, spoke of the news organization’s many “near-death experiences” when nonprofit fundraising fell short and grants ran out. He said the merger with KCTS was more than a financial boost; it was good for Crosscut’s journalism.
“In my experience, the best years at Crosscut were after they combined with KCTS. That opened up opportunities for wider coverage,” Copeland said. 
Corr said the merger didn’t just save Crosscut, it gave something to the public TV station as well, by helping it return to its promise of public service journalism. What is going to happen now, Corr asked.
Berger has a similar concern about journalism in general.
“That it is now kaput is a tough loss for those of us who put heart and soul into it, especially at this time and for the reason that Congress, at Donald Trump’s urging, made the decision to defund public media. We are a casualty of that,” notes Berger. His broadcast work at Cascade PBS is expected to continue, as will other local TV production. I can’t imagine the protest that would form outside the station if he were part of the shutdown.
All the people I spoke with hope others will keep experimenting and not give up on public service journalism. So do I.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cascade-pbs.png,,,2025-09-24 17:58:07.137471

A state panel approved a stipulation with John Helfant stemming from a complaint that he directed a police officer to conduct a death investigation, despite not having the required certification.

A retired police chief from Northfield has agreed to give up his law enforcement certification to avoid a hearing over an unprofessional conduct complaint. The complaint alleged John Helfant improperly directed a police officer from the force to investigate a death more than two years ago despite knowing that the officer was not qualified to do that task.
The Vermont Criminal Justice Council approved a stipulation during a meeting last week with Helfant in which he “voluntarily surrendered” his law certification “with no option of recertification.” 
According to the stipulation, council staff received an unprofessional conduct complaint against Helfant related to an incident in January 2023 when he allegedly directed a police officer, Brian Gosselin, to continue an untimely death investigation when he was not certified to perform such an investigation.
“By this direction,” the stipulation stated, “(Helfant) knowingly directed an individual to conduct an investigation beyond their scope of practice.”
Gosselin’s training limited him to responding to alleged crimes in progress and lower-level offenses.
A hearing on Helfant’s certification could have taken place before the full council, according to Christopher Brickell, the Vermont Criminal Justice Council executive director, but did not as a result of the stipulation.

“In the interest of resolving this matter,” the filing stated, “(Helfant) and the State agree to enter this Stipulation and Consent Order, in lieu of proceeding to hearing.” 
Helfant, reached Wednesday, said he agreed to voluntarily surrender law enforcement certification because he had retired from law enforcement more than two years ago.
“I don’t need it anymore,” he said of his law enforcement certification. 
Helfant said the incident happened more than two years ago and he had no memory of it.
Helfant said it wasn’t worth challenging the allegation.
“I don’t need my certification. I haven’t been a cop since June of 2023 and have no intention of being one again,” Helfant said.
Helfant, a former longtime member of the Vermont State Police, served roughly four years as Northfield police chief before retiring in 2023. 
While Helfant was working in law enforcement, the Washington County state’s attorney at the time, Rory Thibault, wrote what are known as Brady or Giglio letters in 2019 to defense lawyers that laid out concerns he had with Helfant’s credibility stemming from his conduct during traffic stops.
In one of the cases, the prosecutor threw out a drug case in 2019 when he couldn’t reconcile information from Helfant’s affidavit with body cam footage. Helfant denied any wrongdoing.
Helfant’s retirement as Northfield police chief in 2023 came shortly after several organizations called for his removal in light of credibility issues that had been raised and Helfant’s public statements disapproving of the local school district’s policies on the rights of transgender students. 
At the time, Helfant denied that he was pressured into retiring, writing on a Northfield group Facebook page, “I could stay, but a bum shoulder that has me on light duty for the foreseeable future and 33yrs in VT Law Enforcement, just makes me want to do something different. It would be nice to be my own boss and take a break from supervising and managing others.”

Sept. 24, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceOn Wednesday, health care providers and drug manufacturers hotly debated legislation looking to ensure hospitals can purchase drugs at a reduced price as part of a federal program intended to support facilities that care for uninsured or low-income patients. 
Members of the Michigan House Health Policy Committee on Wednesday heard testimony on House Bill 4878, which the committee chair and sponsor, state Rep. Curt VanderWall (R-Ludington), called a common sense response on a complicated topic. 
The bill bars drug manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors from imposing conditions, restrictions, limits or outright bans on entities participating in the 340B drug pricing program and their contracting pharmacies that prevent them from acquiring certain medications at a discount.

Additionally, the bill aims to bring more transparency into the size and scope of the program in Michigan by requiring participants to report how much money they receive through the program, how much they pay pharmacies and consultants, their total profits and how much they spend on community care. 
“We believe this reporting will give us a clear picture of the program in Michigan and gives a chance for our healthcare providers to brag about the impact they have on their communities, but it will also shine a light on whether there is, in fact, waste, fraud and abuse in this program,” VanderWall said. 
VanderWall opened testimony on the bills by welcoming representatives from the Michigan Health and Hospital Association to discuss their support for the policy. 
Chip Falahee, the senior vice president of legal and legislative affairs for  Bronson Healthcare, said the program has enabled hospitals to stretch scarce federal resources across a wider group of people. 
Participants consist of facilities who see a high percentage of Medicaid  recipients, as well as children’s hospitals, cancer hospitals, rural referral centers and critical access hospitals, Falahee explained.

Facilities can use the money they save through 340B for a number of services, with Falahee pointing to investments in rural OB-GYN and cancer clinics, mental health and addiction services, and mobile clinics as some examples. 
“In Bronson’s case, [to] give you a specific example, we use that money, those savings, to fund patient assistance programs to offer no charge medications to our low-income and uninsured patients. We also provide oncology medicines for our uninsured cancer patients,” Falahee said. 
By protecting contract pharmacies from restrictions instituted by drug manufacturers, the bill allows the program to function as originally intended, Falahee said, emphasizing that the program runs on private dollars rather than federal funding. 
However, representatives from the pharmaceutical industry argued the program has been exploited to generate profits for large hospital systems, pharmacy benefit managers and chain pharmacies, rather than acting as a safety net for hospitals. 
Emily Gibellina, director of state government affairs for the Midwest region for the pharmaceutical research and development company AbbVie argued the state had no business passing legislation on 340B, as it is a federal program. 
She also argued that the entities covered by the program are left to self-police their claims and that manufacturers are required to pay out discounts on an honor system, without itemized receipts or insight into whether claims may be eligible, or duplicated.
Leslie Baldwin, the co-founder, CEO and president of the Michigan Rare Coalition, a nonprofit focused on advocating for individuals with rare disorders, raised similar transparency concerns, questioning how much money hospitals were making off 340B and how much of that money was going to support patients’ programs.

She also raised concerns about the bill’s language on transparency, which requires hospitals to report their 340B transactions to a hospital trade association contracted with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.
“The current language allows the state hospital trade association to oversee the collection and reporting of data, as well as hiding the name of the hospitals that submit that information by de-identifying it. This undercuts the efforts to require meaningful transparency,” Baldwin said. 
While opponents questioned whether 340B discounts were truly used to benefit patients, Frank Waters, the senior director of policy and government affairs for the Michigan Primary Care Association emphasized the money saved is required to go back into patient care. 
Opponents also credited the 340B program with driving up the cost of care, partly through the purchase of higher priced drugs over lower-cost generics, though Kelli Pardee, the Pharmacy Business Director at Great Lakes Bay Health Centers, said they are required to charge all insurance companies the same amount, with the exception of fee-for-service Medicaid. 
“We don’t charge differently for a 340B drug than a non-340B drug because we can’t. We charge the same to everybody. And where we’re required to charge less, in the case of fee-for-service Medicaid, we make no dollars on those and we charge the state the 340B price,” Pardee said. 
The committee did not vote on the policy, with VanderWall leaving the bill open to potential amendments following testimony.

The state’s local ABC affiliate was among dozens across the country that were not slated to show the comedian’s late-night show on Tuesday even after ABC’s parent company, Disney, allowed the program back on the airwaves.

A week after ABC pulled his show off the air under pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration, the comedian Jimmy Kimmel made a return to late-night TV screens Tuesday night — but not in Vermont, among dozens of other markets nationwide.
In Vermont, Jimmy Kimmel Live! airs on the local ABC affiliate WVNY. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, a national company that earlier on Tuesday announced its local stations would continue to keep Kimmel’s show off the air. 
WVNY is one of nearly 70 local stations across the country that was slated to not broadcast Kimmel’s show on Tuesday, including stations serving Albany, New Orleans and Seattle. Some of those stations are also owned by Nexstar, while others are owned by another national company, Sinclair Broadcast Group.
Vermont’s local affiliate is branded as ABC22 or MyChamplainValley. 
ABC’s parent company, Disney, decided to pull Kimmel’s show off the air last week after the host made comments during a Sept. 15 monologue that seemed to link the person who shot and killed the conservative activist Charlie Kirk the week before with supporters of Trump’s Make America Great Again movement. 
Brendan Carr, Trump’s chair of the Federal Communications Commission, criticized Kimmel’s remarks and threatened federal action against ABC affiliates who aired the show. The FCC has authority over the licenses that allow local stations to broadcast on public airwaves.
“Look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said on a podcast last week. “These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action on Kimmel or, you know, there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”
Disney changed course on Monday, however, after facing intense public backlash to a decision that was seen across the political spectrum as an infringement on constitutional speech protections with little precedent in modern U.S. history. More than 400 celebrities signed an open letter organized by the American Civil Liberties Union panning “government threats to our freedom of speech” in the wake of Kimmel’s suspension.
On Tuesday, however, Nexstar said in a statement that it stood by the initial decision to pull Kimmel’s show and would continue to forgo the program “pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve.”
Nexstar noted that Jimmy Kimmel Live! would still be available on Disney-owned streaming services while, in the meantime, its TV stations “will focus on continuing to produce local news and other programming relevant to their respective markets.”
MyChamplainValley’s general manager, Tina Castano, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon.
In his show Tuesday night, which is available to watch in full on YouTube, Kimmel said it was not his intention to blame any one group of people for Kirk’s killing — though said he could see how his comments would have made people upset.
He also connected the program’s muzzling to broader concerns about censorship.
“This show is not important,” Kimmel said. “What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.”

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Federal officials have not yet made public the list of hazardous materials present at a Tangipahoa Parish petroleum products plant that caught fire and exploded last month, saying that doing so might reveal “confidential business information.”
The Environmental Protection Agency, which has led disaster response efforts and all public communications since the Aug. 22 incident, has known for weeks which specific hazardous and radioactive materials were present at Smitty’s Supply Inc. in Roseland. After the Illuminator repeatedly requested information about the materials, the EPA acknowledged it had such a list but refused to provide a copy, saying the agency needed to first clear it with Smitty’s Supply.
“On Aug. 27, Smitty’s, through its legal counsel, provided EPA with an inventory list of their products and materials at their facility near Roseland,” EPA Press Officer Kellen Ashford wrote Friday in an email. “EPA has worked with Smitty’s to verify the accuracy of the list. However, a question remains on whether the list contains Confidential Business Information (CBI).”
The EPA said it is following federal laws that prohibit the public release of confidential business information or what could be considered trade secrets, which are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and other laws.
Ashford said the agency has asked Smitty’s Supply whether its inventory list should be considered confidential.
“We are currently waiting for their response,” he said.
Records the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has posted on its website list some of the chemicals at Smitty’s Supply, but it’s unclear if it’s a comprehensive list. The state agency also doesn’t distinguish whether the listed chemicals were involved in the fire.
Corinne Gibb, a chemist who works with the Louisiana Bucket Brigade environmental advocacy group, said it seems like the EPA is making more of an effort to keep the inventory list from the public than Smitty’s Supply.
“Every action they are taking makes it suspicious,” Gibb said. “Why would they not ask on day one if it was confidential? Also, surely when the population is sprayed with the content of the inventory, surely the EPA’s duty at this stage is to inform the population as soon as they received the information. It definitely seems to lack transparency.”
The Illuminator’s calls and emails to Smitty’s Supply have gone unanswered.
Oily residue covered surrounding homes, farms and businesses from the Aug. 22 fire, which took two weeks to fully extinguish. Cleanup crews have so far recovered 5.6 million gallons of contaminated material from the site and nearby waterways such as the Tangipahoa River, according to the EPA.
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality records mention some of the hazardous materials known to be on site, including naphthalene, xylene, ethylene glycol and phosphoric acid, all of which have applications in the automotive industry. The state agency has ceded authority to the EPA for the government’s response to the fire.
Estimates of the cleanup costs associated with the Smitty’s Supply fire have climbed past $39 million, according to state records. The company is responsible for covering the expense.
EPA adjusts allowable pollution levels for fire
The EPA has said repeatedly the pollution from the Smitty’s Supply explosion and fire poses no imminent danger to the public.
The agency notes its fine particulate matter readings were below the special levels threshold it established specifically for the incident — 300 micrograms per cubic meter of air — but it has not said how or why it established that limit, which is much higher than standard pollution allowances.
Gibb said she’s never heard of a threshold being set that high before.
For emergency incidents, fine particulate matter over 250.5 micrograms in a 24-hour period are considered hazardous, according to the EPA’s air monitoring guidelines for fires.

Toxic fine particulate matter, even during short exposure periods, can lead to heart attacks, asthma attacks, cancer and other health risks, according to an EPA fact sheet. The agency has regulated particulate matter pollution since 1971 and has revised its standards four times since then.
Gibb said the 300-microgram threshold for the Smitty’s Supply fire is more than 30 times higher than the EPA’s normal safety threshold. She noted air monitoring readings far exceeded normal standards several days following the explosion.
Mobile air monitoring readings outside the facility reached a high of 250 micrograms two days into the fire, according to the data on the EPA’s incident website for Smitty’s Supply.
After the Aug. 24 reading, the EPA paused its mobile air monitoring for nearly 10 hours. Typically, the air monitors take readings roughly every five minutes. When asked about the 10-hour gap, the agency said the air monitors needed to be recalibrated. Other interval gaps in the monitoring data prior to that one lasted around four hours, the EPA website shows.
“Real-time air monitoring requires frequent calibration of instruments due to changing environmental conditions,” Ashford said. “During the active firefighting operations at the site, site conditions changed that resulted in changes to the air monitoring activities, which created time intervals where air monitoring was not active.”
Water testing reveals toxins
Water samples the EPA collected from a pond and a ditch near the facility showed elevated levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, according to a lab report the EPA initially posted on its incident site. PAHs, as they are more commonly known, are produced when fossil fuels are burned. They have been linked to a range of health disorders, including cancer and blood and liver abnormalities, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The water samples also contained elevated levels of heavy metals including arsenic, barium and lead, the lab report said. The levels were higher than what’s allowed in drinking water, though it’s unclear whether the EPA used a different threshold for its water sampling.
Susan Richardson, an analytical chemist from the University of South Carolina who reviewed the findings, said the lack of information and adequate sampling makes it difficult to truly assess the risk to the community.
“What was deposited in the water in that ditch could be indicative of what was in the air and what could be deposited on the ground and other surfaces (homes, vehicles, etc.),” Richardson said.
Industrial X-ray machine still missing
EPA, through its public statements and online hub site, also did not publicly disclose that five fill-level gauges containing radioactive material were present at the facility. Officials said all have been recovered and were undamaged, but a team of radiation inspectors spent two weeks searching for what they thought was a missing sixth gauge. On Friday, the EPA realized a mistake had been made and that the missing device was actually an industrial X-ray machine.
The material in the gauges is Americium 241, a manmade radioactive isotope that is a byproduct of nuclear reactor fission. It is also used in minute amounts in household smoke detectors. It emits alpha and low-level gamma radiation that can penetrate the human skin, but Americium 241 is typically only harmful after prolonged exposure or when ingested or inhaled, according to the CDC.
State officials notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about the situation at Smitty’s Supply Aug. 26 and reported each gauge contained 100 millicuries of Americium 241 — more than a thousand times the amount found in smoke detectors.
Officials initially thought there was a sixth gauge missing but gave up looking for the purported sixth gauge on Sept. 11, state records show.
“As there was no risk of exposure to the public from the five devices containing radioactive materials, EPA continued response operations,” EPA press officer Edward Mekeel said in an email.
About a week later, the EPA learned from Smitty’s Supply that an X-ray machine, and not another gauge, was missing. X-ray machines only produce radiation when they are in use.
“The devices and X-ray machines look similar,” Mekeel said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Frank Menniti shares lab space for his work as chief science officer for a company developing a new drug for Alzheimer’s disease. 
But soon Menniti will have his own pad: The company MindImmune Therapeutics will have new office and research space at Ocean State Labs in Providence, as one of five life science companies selected for the facilities’ inaugural cohort. A roster of state leaders convened Wednesday morning at the labs on Richmond Street in Providence to announce and celebrate the five companies expected to begin using the sparkly new lab spaces early next year.
Menniti went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. And while people say Cambridge is the place to be for cutting-edge scientific research, the city “is not all it’s cracked up to be,” Menniti told reporters.
“This seems like a much better place to be able to thrive,” Menniti said of Providence, citing its central location and closeness to other research centers. “It’s simpler to get around. The quality of the science, the quality of the academics, is every bit as good as it is in Boston, and I went to MIT, so I kind of know. So to us this is like the perfect place to be.”
The Ocean State Labs comprises 30,000 square feet of wet lab and office space. It’s one initiative of the quasi-public Rhode Island Life Science Hub, which was authorized by a $45 million, three-year infusion from state lawmakers in 2023. The hub spent a chunk of 2024 shaping its board and leadership, and the Rhode Island Senate finally named Dr. Mark  A. Turco as its CEO and president in .
“With our five anchor member companies and a healthy pipeline of potential new member companies and the scientific and technology development being done in our region, we are primed for success,” Turco told the crowd of a few dozen people.
Turco said the plan is to have 60 to 80% of the available lab spaces filled within one year of the labs’ scheduled opening in January. The space can accommodate up to 20 or 30 companies. 
In addition to MindImmune, the initial cohort includes:

Pax Therapeutics, which had its start in Rhode Island Hospital labs, and is working on gene-delivery technology to aid ligament and tendon healing to improve mobility.
XM Therapeutics, a Providence-based biotech firm focused on creating therapies that can repair dysfunctions in the extracellular matrix, involved in conditions that affect organs like the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and more.
P53 Therapeutics, a company developing antitumor drugs that target p53, a gene whose mutations are implicated in some cancers.
OncoLux, which is working on optical imaging and AI tools that can guide cancer surgery.

Also in attendance at Wednesday’s event was Gov. Dan McKee, who posed the labs as a crown jewel in his efforts to develop the state’s economy and workforce. 
“Thirty-six thousand new private sector jobs have been added in the last four years, and this project is right at the center of what we’re doing,” McKee said.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi also attended, as did Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat who stood in for Senate President Valarie Lawson, who was unable to attend.

Expanding life sciences capacity
The 150 Richmond Street building will share tenancy with the Rhode Island State Health Laboratory and spaces rented by Brown University. The Life Science Labs will be managed by Portal Innovations, a venture capital firm that runs similar spaces in Chicago, South Boston, Houston, and Atlanta.
John Flavin, the CEO of Portal Innovations, said Big Pharma looks to his company “to try to identify up-and-coming ecosystems that don’t have boots on the ground yet, but are promising in terms of the science.”  
That outside interest is already here, Turco said, noting that a firm from Perth, Australia, visited the state this week to explore a possible presence here. Turco added later that the labs will hopefully form part of a longer pipeline that will keep university and local in-state.
“A lot of the companies that will be coming out of our academic institutions and health systems, hopefully will now be able to be housed here in Rhode Island,” Turco said, adding that companies which “translate out of our academic institutions will be in the incubator for around 18 to 24 months.”
“And then what we want to do is have space for those companies once they have scale to continue to scale, right here in Rhode Island, as opposed to going to other states in the country,” Turco said.
The team at MindImmune certainly wants to stay in the state. They’re working on a biologic drug that seeks to target and slow the progression of Alzheimer’s and other dementias. Recent research has implicated immune system disorder and the resulting inflammation as drivers in dementias.
Robert Nelson, the company’s vice president, said the drug is based on research that suggests immune cells implicated in Alzheimer’s “actually come in from the blood into the brain, and we found a way to keep them out of the brain.”
“The idea, very simply, is, if we can stop that inflammatory response in the brain by keeping the cells from going there in the first place, we’ll have individuals who may still have a head full of plaques, but they are still cognitive,” Nelson said.
Menniti said that MindImmune’s drug, currently known by the codename MITI-101, is a humanized antibody — a drug made from living cells, and the basis of all biologic therapies, which require special handling and storage and work differently from so-called “small molecule” drugs often taken orally.
Biologic drugs have multiplied in the past two decades, firming up clinical options for treating cancers and chronic illnesses which involve the immune system, such as psoriasis, Crohn’s disease, and lupus. A 2023 chart from The Antibody Society shows that antibody-based drugs have received increasingly more approvals by federal regulators since 2000. 
Menniti said the company is developing its cell line that will make the antibodies, after which the drug can undergo toxicity studies. He expects that, if all goes according to plan, the company will be able to apply for Investigational New Drug status late next year — the first step in getting a drug to undergo the clinical trials that precede possible federal approval and marketing. 
Menniti is not sure yet if the company will relinquish its current lab space at the University of Rhode Island (URI). What does MindImmune intend to do at the Providence labs anyway?
The same thing it does at URI, Menniti said: Take slices of brain, expose them to antibodies and dyes, then generate and evaluate pictures for an antibody’s possible usefulness. 
The process involves a lot of microscope slides, Menniti said — so many, in fact, that he told reporters his title is usually “Chief Slide Officer.”

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)A Florida judge Wednesday permanently closed the city of South Miami’s case to determine whether cities must enter into partnerships with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, adding that future attempts would be “futile.”
Jonathan Sjostrom, chief judge for the Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County, sided with Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier by agreeing to dismiss with prejudice South Miami’s case questioning whether cities and towns must enter into ICE partnerships, called 287(g) agreements.
Although the ruling doesn’t weigh in on whether cities must enter into the partnerships, Sjostrom was clear that South Miami had no ground for a case.
“This City’s lawsuit, at least, is premature,” Sjostrom wrote in the Wednesday afternoon decision. “This is a fairly straightforward case, despite the length and complexity of the [city’s] Complaint. Given the relative simplicity of the actual circumstances alleged, this court concludes that additional attempts to plead would be futile.”
This is only the latest legal win for the state in the immigration sphere. Earlier this month, a federal appellate court reversed a lower court’s decision to shut down the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center, handing a massive win to DeSantis and Uthmeier. Florida now has two large detention centers in partnership with ICE, “Alligator Alcatraz” and “Deportation Depot,” and is working on opening a “Panhandle Pokey.”
Why did South Miami sue?
South Miami, under Mayor Javier Fernandez, was the first city to file suit in March against the DeSantis administration to determine whether local governments must enter into 287(g) agreements, which deputize state and local officers as federal immigration authorities. This challenge stemmed from the GOP-dominated Legislature passing a February law requiring counties and sheriffs to enter into these partnerships.
In oral arguments, the state’s lawyers argued that although cities aren’t explicitly required to enter into 287(g) agreements, they’re not allowed to purposely cancel the partnerships once they’ve been enacted. They argue that this constitutes active defiance of Florida’s new law mandating cities use their “best efforts” to combat illegal immigration and qualifies the city as a sanctuary state.
South Miami, meanwhile, accused Uthmeier of politically pressuring cities like Key West and Fort Myers, which had voted to disband 287(g) agreements. They received threatening letters from Uthmeier and reversed course.
Sjostrom — who declined to rule on whether a city receiving Uthmeier’s letter could ask for relief — said South Miami had no ground to cite these letters because it had never received one.
“This court expresses no views as to whether a City that receives a letter … would present a case or controversy sufficient for declaratory relief. But the letter does not create a case or controversy for a City to whom no such letter was directed,” Sjostrom wrote. “Political pressure applied by political actors to other political actors provides no basis for judicial intervention.”
‘Nothing we’re planning to do other than nothing’
South Miami has yet to enter any of its officials into a 287(g) agreement and, according to Mayor Fernandez, they don’t plan on it either.
“What we’ve learned from [this case] is that as long as we don’t do anything, we’re not in jeopardy,” Fernandez told the Florida Phoenix. “The ball is in the governor’s and attorney general’s court. If they believe that by doing nothing that we’re in violation … then I think we would have further legal standing.”
“In the absence of their action, there’s nothing we’re planning to do other than doing nothing,” he continued. “We’ve gotten the clarity we need.”
Sjostrom granted the state’s request to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning the matter is permanently closed.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The head of the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole is retiring after a storied state career that included some high profile positions.
Tom Bates’ retirement is effective Nov. 30, ending 26 years of public service.
“I’ve had the opportunity at each place to lead some really incredible teams of incredible people who did great work on behalf of the people of the state of Oklahoma,” Bates said. “I hope the people of Oklahoma realize how blessed they are to have so many trained and dedicated professionals working in state government, looking out for them every day.”
Bates, 56, previously worked as an assistant attorney general in the consumer protection unit and chief of the multi-county grand jury under former Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson.
Edmondson described Bates as “top notch” and one of the best lawyers he ever had on staff.
“He is someone I called upon on many occasions when we really needed a strong person in a position,” Edmondson said. “He was good. He was careful. And he invariably solved the unsolvable problem I dumped in his lap.”
Under former Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Bates served as chief of the Public Protection Unit and first assistant attorney general.
He took a sabbatical when his late wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, but returned to state service working as a special advisor to former Gov. Mary Fallin. 
He oversaw the implementation of the Pinnacle Plan, which was the product of a settlement agreement to resolve a class action lawsuit challenging how the state provided care for foster care children in its custody.
He was then tapped as interim commissioner of the Oklahoma State Department of Health, which was in the midst of financial turmoil. While he was there, he oversaw the implementation of a state question that legalized medical marijuana.
In 2019, Gov. Kevin Stitt tapped Bates to lead a new initiative, dubbed “Front Porch,” to integrate services provided by the state’s health and human service agencies.
He has led the Pardon and Parole Board for five years, arriving at a time when the agency had a backlog of 3,000 commutation cases and the state was coming out of a moratorium on the death penalty.
During his time with that agency, he has overseen 18 clemency cases involving death row inmates.
“Victims’ families are reliving those situations, those events, those horrible events that led to the loss of someone’s life,” Bates said. “They are hard on board members. They are hard on staff.”
While death penalty cases typically get media attention, other murder cases are every bit as difficult for the agency’s board and staff, he said.
Last month, the Pardon and Parole Board had 41 first-degree murder cases on its docket, Bates said.
Bates said the appointed five-member Pardon and Parole Board needs a pay increase.
He’s asked lawmakers to raise the pay from about $22,000 to close to $50,000, “which is still a bargain for the work these board members do.”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond called Bates the “quintessential public servant.”
“His breadth of experience in Oklahoma state government is extraordinary, and throughout his career he served with the utmost integrity, professionalism and commitment to the people of Oklahoma,” Drummond said. 
Bates said he and his wife plan to travel after retirement 
He said that he may eventually return to practicing law.

Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, during a Sept. 24, 2025 committee hearing. (Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas is one step closer to understanding the feasibility of building more nuclear power to address its growing electricity needs, after the legislature’s Joint Energy Committee approved a contract for a consultant to study the matter Wednesday.
Among other things, the consultant will examine whether small, modular nuclear reactors or microreactors would be feasible in Arkansas.
The year-long contract, which will be executed and paid for by the Bureau of Legislative Research, will cost no more than $305,000. It will still need to be approved by the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Executive Subcommittee on Thursday, before going before ALC Friday for a final vote.
Committee members directed BLR to begin negotiating a contract with Maryland-based EXCEL Services Corporation in June. Act 707 of 2025 directed the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment to study the feasibility of building more nuclear power, but due to a lack of funding, the committee opted to do it instead.
Smaller nuclear reactors spark renewed interest in a once-shunned energy source

If the contract is approved, the feasibility study will determine the economic and environmental impacts of nuclear expansion “without limitation,” according to a draft. It will also make recommendations on “optimal design specifications,” location criteria, safety criteria, potential policy changes and job, tax and supply chain impacts of building more nuclear power.
The state’s only nuclear power plant, Arkansas Nuclear One, located near Russellville, already provides enough power for roughly 56% of Entergy Arkansas’ 730,000 customers, according to Entergy’s website.
Nationally, nuclear power — especially from modular reactors — has been gaining new, bipartisan looks as the need for electricity grows due to artificial intelligence and data centers, both of which require massive amounts of electricity.
The move to enter into the contract comes as Arkansas tries to keep up with other states eyeing nuclear power. Texas passed legislation earlier this year investing $350 million in nuclear expansion, while Three Mile Island — a nuclear plant in Pennsylvania that partially melted down in 1979 and closed in 2019 — is set to be brought back online to power AI data centers for Microsoft.

(File photo from Getty Images)October 2024, at what should have been a joyful nine-week ultrasound, I learned that my pregnancy had stopped developing three weeks earlier.
My doctor explained that the pregnancy was not viable. I was devastated — but the nightmare didn’t end there.
Because of South Carolina’s six-week abortion ban, my doctor would not treat me for a miscarriage until I underwent a second ultrasound 11 days later to confirm what we already knew: There was no heartbeat, and my pregnancy was over.
Each day that passed while I carried my nonviable pregnancy put me at increasing risk of infection, sepsis, and even death.
Women in other states with abortion bans, like Texas and Georgia, have already died under similar circumstances. South Carolina shouldn’t be next.
I needed a common medical procedure called dilation and curettage (D&C) to complete my miscarriage. Reasons for a D&C include miscarriage and abortion treatment.
Under our state’s laws, doctors who provide an illegal abortion face the threat of losing their medical license, a $10,000 fine, and even jail time.
I remembered thinking I should qualify for the procedure because my pregnancy was non-viable.
However, terrified for his own livelihood, my doctor told me he could not help me. So, while grieving my loss, I had to travel to Virginia and pay $3,000 out of pocket to get the care I desperately needed.
Now, lawmakers are considering S.323, a bill that would take things even further — stripping away the few remaining exceptions and putting more women and girls in danger.
If this bill passes, more people will be forced to leave the state or sit at home and hope their bodies do not become septic while waiting for a miscarriage to pass naturally. Some won’t make it.
I was fortunate to have the resources and support to travel. Many South Carolina women do not.
Those without the means will be left to risk their fertility, their health, and their lives because politicians decided their suffering was an acceptable price for a political talking point.
This isn’t just about people like me.
Under S.323, a sixth-grade girl could be forced to give birth after being raped by a family member. A mother of two could be forced to carry a pregnancy with a fatal fetal anomaly, only to watch her baby die shortly after birth.
These aren’t hypotheticals — they are the brutal, real-world consequences of laws like this.
Today, I am in my third trimester of a new pregnancy, and while I am deeply grateful, I remain painfully aware of how fragile pregnancy can be.
Every appointment brings both joy and anxiety, and I can’t help but think about how easily I — or anyone else — could face another crisis.
If something goes wrong again, I could find myself right back where I was last year: begging for care that my own state refuses to provide.
South Carolina lawmakers like to claim they are “protecting life.”
But S.323 would do the opposite: endanger women, girls, and families across our state.
The decision to end a pregnancy should belong to patients and their doctors — not politicians who will never face these terrifying moments themselves.
I want my daughter to grow up in a South Carolina where women’s lives are valued and protected, not sacrificed for politics.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Pregnancyultrasound-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 16:58:16.223045

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)CLEARWATER — A group of Florida voters urged the Pinellas County legislative delegation on Wednesday to oppose an effort led by Gov. Ron DeSantis to pursue a mid-decade congressional redistricting plan designed to keep the U.S. House in Republican control in 2026.
“Floridians have clearly said that they don’t want partisan gerrymandering,” said Amy Weintraub, of the League of Women Voters St. Petersburg branch, referring to the Fair Districts amendments passed by 63% of Florida registered voters in 2010.
The measures say in part that “no apportionment plan or individual district shall be drawn with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or an incumbent.”
Weintraub was one of more than 130 people who originally signed up to comment to the nine-member Pinellas County legislative delegation who gathered at the Clearwater branch of St. Petersburg College (only eight were in attendance, with Democratic Rep. Lindsay Cross absent). It’s a ritual being played out in all 67 counties in Florida in advance of the regular legislative session that begins in January.
“Floridians passed the Fair District Amendments to ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in redistricting,” said Simon Adams, field manager for the group Equal Ground. “These laws must be respected. To ignore them is to ignore the will of the people.”
“Redistricting should be about ensuring that every person’s voice counts equally,” added Geveryl Robinson with the group Black Voters Matter. “Fair maps means that neighborhoods are kept whole. That communities of interest are not spread apart, and that elected officials are accountable to the people they serve, not partisan interests. When lines are drawn unfairly, it undermines trust in the process, weakens voters confidence, and ultimately harms our democracy.”
Gov. DeSantis never mentioned the idea of redrawing Florida’s congressional map this year until late July. That was shortly after President Donald Trump, fearful that the GOP could lose its narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representative in the 2026 midterm elections, called on Texas and other red states to redraw their congressional boundaries to bolster the Republicans’ margins next year.
No government is further along with the process than the Lone Star State. Gov. Greg Abbott signed a new congressional map into law at the end of last month designed to give the GOP five more seats (groups representing Black and Latino voters have filed lawsuits asking that the maps be blocked from going into effect). In Missouri, Republicans have advanced measures to bring a referendum on a new congressional map next year.
The only blue state to move on the matter is California, where lawmakers have approved a proposal that will go before the voters this November asking them to approve a congressional redistricting map that would likely add more Democratic seats.
At least one chamber of Florida’s Legislature is good with DeSantis’ proposal for redistricting ahead of next year’s midterms. House Speaker Daniel Perez announced last month that he has created a selection committee on congressional redistricting. It has yet to meet but is likely to do so later this fall (Senate President Ben Albritton has not assigned a similar committee in his chamber).
The sentiment expressed against a mid-decade congressional redistricting echoes the overall opinions of Floridians when asked about the issue.
A public opinion survey commissioned by Common Cause earlier this month found that a majority of Floridians – 55% – oppose such an effort, with only 26% in support and  another 19% undecided. Among Republicans, 45% oppose the measure, with only 36% supporting it. Among political independent voters, 60% are against a congressional redistricted map in 2026.
Tanya Landry, president of the League of Women Voters of North Pinellas County, said that her organization remains committed to empowering voters and defending democracy.
“Today I rise to honor that mission by standing firmly against mid-cycle redistricting,” she said to whoops from the crowd. “Mid-cycle redistricting threatens the very foundation of fair representation. When district lines are changed during the middle of an election cycle, it undermines stability, fairness, and public trust in our democracy in a number of ways. First and foremost, it destabilizes the electoral process. Voters deserve to know who represents them for the duration of a cycle.”
Florida has 28 members in the U.S. House: 20 of them are Republicans and 8 are Democrats.
While the stated opposition to a mid-decade congressional district map elicited the largest cheers from the audience, there were a couple of other issues that received criticism from attendees.
Senate bill 180 also a focus
One was Senate Bill 180, the piece of legislation sponsored by Pinellas Republican Nick DiCeglie (who was voted chair of the delegation for the coming year by his colleagues) aimed primary to streamline restoration efforts and improve emergency response coordination following a major storm.
However, a provision that bars new local land-use or development regulations considered “restrictive or burdensome,” even if they are completely unrelated to storm recovery, has raised the ire of more than a dozen local governments that have indicated they intend to sue to have the law repealed.
“The original intent of that bill is good policy, and we support most of the provisions in Senate Bill 180,” said Haley Busch, a staff member with 1000 Friends of Florida. But she said that two particular provisions that prohibit updates to comprehensive plans, zoning, or development rules deemed to be “burdensome” is a real problem.
“In practice, this blocks local governments from adopting critical measures like stronger flood plain protections and stormwater protections, or requiring water and sewer connections, leaving communities more vulnerable,” she said. “And it also invites lawsuits that strips citizens of their ability to shape their community’s future growth. So, we don’t think that’s what this Legislature intended. We’re looking to work with senators and representatives to make some changes to the bill.”
Concerns expressed on potential ban on vaccine mandates
Another proposal that the public gathered in Clearwater clearly isn’t for is the measure announced by DeSantis and Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo to eliminate vaccine mandates in the Sunshine State.
“I urge you to stop the surgeon general from eliminating the required vaccines by codifying in the statutes all vaccines in section 1003.22,” said John Bowen, a retired school board attorney. “I also urge you to vote against any proposal to eliminate the immunizations in the statute. Please do not ignore all the existing medical evidence showing the effect of this vaccine over the past several decades.”
Another Pinellas resident was more succinct.
“Please fire the Florida surgeon general,” Johna Holloway, speaking as an individual, said to large cheers from the crowd, referring to Ladapo.

Laura Kelly says Republicans in Congress should work with Democrats to roll back health care cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. She is seen here at a July 9, 2025, news conference at Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly warned Wednesday that the loss of Affordable Care Act Marketplace tax credits will have “disastrous effects” on health care unless they are restored by Congress before enrollment begins Nov. 1.
Her remarks came as a new report predicts 108,000 Kansans will lose their Marketplace coverage because of provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this year.
Speaking at a news conference as chair of the Democratic Governors Association, Kelly called on Republicans to work with Democrats to restore the ACA Marketplace tax credits as part of a deal to avoid a shutdown of the federal government.
“Republicans have the opportunity to come to the table and negotiate a bipartisan bill in good faith that meets the needs of American people and prevents health care costs from skyrocketing because of the changes they made in the ‘one big, ugly bill.’ If they don’t, the consequences for the people we serve will be devastating,” Kelly said.
Democrats hope to leverage resentment for the so-called “big, beautiful bill” to force Republicans to restore cuts that could strip health insurance from 16 million Americans. Republicans control both the U.S. House and Senate but can’t pass a short-term spending plan without help from the Democrats. If the two sides can’t reach a deal, the federal government could shut down by the end of the month.
Kelly joined Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to call attention to the ramifications of letting ACA Marketplace tax credits expire.
“For folks in rural communities like the many we have here in Kansas, access to health care has been further stripped away as rural hospitals face budget cuts that force them to shut down,” she said.
“And it’s the families in these rural towns who will have to face the life-threatening consequences of these closures,” she added. “It shouldn’t be that way, and it doesn’t have to be that way.”
The United Methodist Health Ministry Fund and REACH Healthcare Foundation released a report that shows more than 200,000 Kansans — at least 7% of the population in 45 of the state’s 105 counties — are currently enrolled in the ACA Marketplace. But 108,000 Kansans are expected to lose their Marketplace coverage over the next 10 years as costs increase by 77%, the report said.
The federal government offsets the costs of Marketplace health care plans by providing premium tax credits. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, those credits will expire this year.
“The bottom line is that the cost of health care is going to go up for tens of thousands of Kansans if Congress does not act,” said David Jordan, president of the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund. “The unfortunate reality is that too many of those Kansans will not be able to afford coverage and be forced to go without coverage. This will only lead to an increase in uncompensated care, putting hospitals at greater financial risk and raising costs for everyone else down the road.”
Last week, U.S. Senate Democrats blocked a stopgap spending measure that would fund the government through Nov. 21. Democrats proposed an alternative that would fund the government through Oct. 31 and permanently extend the ACA Marketplace tax credits, and reverse cuts to Medicaid.
The president refused a meeting with Democratic leaders and said in a statement on Truth Social that their plan was “unserious.” The president falsely claimed Democrats were trying to open borders, get rid of consequences for violent criminals, and “essentially create Transgender operations for everybody.”
“We must keep the Government open, and legislate like true Patriots rather than hold American Citizens hostage, knowing that they want our now thriving Country closed,” Trump wrote.
He added: “Otherwise, it will just be another long and brutal slog through their radicalized quicksand.”
Kelly said the president’s statement provides an opportunity for members of Congress “to step up and reclaim their role, their responsibility, their power, their authority to be the appropriators.”
“I can’t believe that there aren’t a number of Republicans in Congress, both the House and in the Senate, who would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to their constituents,” Kelly said. “I just can’t believe that many of them did not like this aspect of the ‘big, ugly bill’ and would welcome the opportunity to sit down with Democrats and negotiate a compromise that allows for people to access their health care affordably.”
Meyer, the Delaware governor, said “the status quo is the intersection of cruel and incredibly expensive.” Families will be forced to choose between paying for housing, groceries or health care, he said.
Extending the ACA Marketplace credits “is one of the simplest ways for Congress to bring relief to working American families that, let’s be honest, are already stretched thin,” Meyer said.
“I think we’re here doing this because we think there are Republicans out there who are receptive to this, who are receptive to the people that they serve, all the people that they serve, and understand that if there’s not action taken soon, health care costs are going to spike,” Meyer said. “And that’s bad for their district, that’s bad for their state, and that’s bad for our whole country.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7090199-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-24 16:58:16.223045

UA System President Jay Silveria selected Jones to replace the institute’s previous director, Cheryl May, who announced earlier this month she would resign effective Sept. 30. 
In addition to leading the institute, May also chaired the 2018 and 2022 iterations of the Arkansas School Safety Commission, which was created by former Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson. May and her fellow committee members made 56 new recommendations to improve school safety in a report issued in October 2022. 
“Over the course of more than 40 years with the University of Arkansas System, she has played a large role in guiding the Institute’s programs and its work with the law enforcement community. We wish her all the best in her future endeavors,” CJI officials said in a social media post. 
With the appointment of Jones as interim director, Silveria said the UA System would begin a strategic review of CJI “to ensure its effectiveness in serving the state law enforcement community while planning for a search for the next permanent director,” according to the news release.
“It’s clear to me that CJI plays a critical role in education and training for our law enforcement community, and I look forward to working with Kim, the excellent CJI staff, and our law enforcement partners to determine the right strategic direction for the institute moving forward,” Silveria said. “Kim’s wealth of knowledge and experience will be vital to this process.”
As the Education and Training Center’s assistant director, Jones oversaw statewide programs in law enforcement management, forensic sciences, drug training, violence against women initiatives, and the Arkansas Center for School Safety, according to the release.
“I am honored by the trust and confidence President Silveria has placed in me to serve as Interim Director of CJI,” Jones said. “I am fully committed to dedicating my best efforts to this role. I’m especially excited to continue working with the incredible CJI staff and look forward to what we will accomplish together during this time of transition.”
Jones earned her Master of Public Administration from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Philander Smith College, according to the release.

This concern prompted the longtime Ward 3 councilmember to reintroduce a youth curfew to tamp down on “nocturnal mischief.” The ordinance, passed Tuesday, bars those under the age of 18 from tarrying on streets or highways, in a park, vacant lots or at establishments after 10 p.m. on weeknights and midnight on weekends or during school hours. It contains a few exceptions, such as running an errand for a parent or being en route to or from academic, volunteer or religious activities.
“If we don’t save them, you might be the next victim,” Stokes said. 
The council unanimously passed the ordinance with little discussion on Tuesday night. But it remains to be seen if Jackson can enforce it as the city currently lacks a place for the Jackson Police Department to take children who violate the curfew, according to Pieter Teeuwiseen, the city’s chief administrative officer. 
Stokes suggested JPD take the children to the Henley-Youth-Patton Juvenile Justice Center. 
“We got a whole youth detention center right down the street in front of the post office,” he said. “Let’s utilize it. We had the lieutenant governor trying to give us the county jail. What we can’t do is make excuses.” 
But a federal juvenile justice law prohibits locking up youth who commit what’s called a “status offense” — a non-criminal act such as violating a curfew that is illegal solely because of the offender’s age — in a secure detention facility. 
The city could hold a child who violates the curfew in a community room at Henley-Young, but the child must be free to leave, according to Melissa Milchman, the executive director of the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that assists states in complying with the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. 
“This gets very tricky,” Milchman said. “If they are going onto the secure side of the facility, that’s a violation. If they are hanging out in the community room where staff hang out and they are free to leave, it’s not a violation.” 
Youth Court Judge Carlyn Hicks said state law further complicates the matter. Status offenders cannot be held in detention for more than 24 hours without a valid judge’s order, per state statute.
“I plan to follow the letter of the law,” she said. 
Hicks told the council last year that she considered the ordinance “unenforceable,” so JPD did not enforce it last year.
Before passing the ordinance, Ward 5 Councilman Vernon Hartley asked if “everything (is) legally sufficient here” and City Attorney Drew Martin indicated it was. 
In general, research has shown that youth curfews do not affect crime rates. 
“It’s putting resources toward the lowest level of offense, not even a misdemeanor,” Milchman said. “It’s taking away the most critical resource a city has to commit to violence and victimization and districting them on things that are not crime.” 
The city of Jackson has historically struggled to enforce a youth curfew, according to archival newspaper reporting. In 2003, the Northside Sun reported that youth court officials found it difficult to know if a teenager was “in the wrong” for being out at night or if they simply were coming home from work. 
In 2011, the city tried to find a place for the children that was not Henley-Young. As part of the federal government’s longrunning consent decree against the facility, the detention center had been cited for putting youth who had violated the curfew in the same building as criminal offenders.

Teeuwissen raised the issue of where to take the children during a work session earlier this week. On Monday, he told the council that the city would have to find a “non-detention facility” to put the children. 
“This is probably a foolish question but is it possible to just bring them home?” Ward 7 Councilman Kevin Parkinson asked. 
Interim JPD Chief and Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones said he “wouldn’t recommend that.” 
“It goes into technically, ‘Are they in custody?’ And once they are in our custody, we assume responsibilities and liabilities involved,” he said. 
This exchange led Teeuwissen to suggest the council involve Hicks in the discussion, but as of Tuesday night, the council had not asked Hicks about reinstituting the ordinance.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/23205304/Jackson-City-Council-2.jpg,,,2025-09-24 16:58:16.223045

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Iowa utilities, along with the majority of utilities across the country, scored an F grade in a report from the Sierra Club that rates utilities’ plans to transition to clean energy and to meet increased demand rates through 2035. 
Iowa utility companies said the report “oversimplifies utility planning” and that they are still striving for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while keeping consumer costs low and maintaining reliability.  
In its 2025 “The Dirty Truth Report,” Sierra Club rated the 50 parent companies that own the most fossil fuel generation in the country, along with their 75 operating companies. The utilities were rated on their plans to retire coal by 2030, plans to not build new gas plants through 2035 and plans to build enough clean energy infrastructure to not only replace fossil fuel generation, but to also meet the growing load needs by 2035. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Collectively, U.S. utilities received an F rating for the first time since Sierra Club began the report in 2021. In the past years, utilities overall received a D score. 
The report notes that this year utilities face “dual pressures” via a change in political outlook toward clean energy from the Biden administration to the current Trump administration, which also canceled a number of clean energy incentive programs, and a “surge in projected electricity demand.” 
According to a report from ICF, a global technology provider, U.S. electricity demand is expected to grow 25% by 2030. By 2050, the report predicts energy demand increases of nearly 80%.
The Sierra Club report attributes “sharply rising” load growth projections to a combination of the energy demand from data centers that power artificial intelligence models and digital infrastructure and the “electrification” of automobiles, buildings and industry. 
“Currently planned clean energy is barely sufficient to replace half of existing coal and gas generation, let alone supply forecast load growth,” the report said. 
While utilities overall scored seven points lower on this year’s report compared to Sierra Club’s 2024 Dirty Truth report, 65% of utilities have improved their clean energy scores, which are based on commitments to solar and wind projects, since 2021. 
But, the report points out, the majority, or 69%, of utilities have worsened their scores in the gas category by planning new natural gas projects. 
These trends fit with Iowa’s main utilities, MidAmerican Energy, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, and Interstate Power and Light Company, or IPL, owned by Alliant Energy Corp. 
How Iowa utilities stack up
IPL and MidAmerican scored high in the clean energy category. IPL received a 72% and MidAmerican a 52%. But, both companies have natural gas plans that lowered their overall scores. According to the report, IPL has plans for 1,275 megawatts of natural gas generation by 2035 and MidAmerican has plans for 1,164 megawatts by 2035. 


Grades explained:
Different from the traditional school grading system, Sierra Club explains that to earn an A, companies must score a 75 or greater, a B between 50 and 75, a C between 35 and 50, a D between 17.5 and 35 and Fs are reserved for companies that score a 17.5 or lower on the scale. 
A perfect 100 would mean the company committed to: retire all of its coal by 2030, not build any new gas through 2035 and build an amount of new clean energy that would cover existing fossil fuel generation and projected growth by 2035. 


Geoff Greenwood, a spokesperson for MidAmerican Energy, said since 2004, MidAmerican has invested in 7,600 megawatts of wind energy and 141 megawatts of solar energy, with more planned in the works, that makes the company a “renewable energy leader not just in Iowa, but in the country.” 
“MidAmerican’s customers expect and trust us to plan for, and deliver on, providing energy every minute of every day – no matter what – now and in the future,” Greenwood said in an emailed statement. “…When the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine, reliable fuel sources are essential to helping us meet customer demand.” 
Greenwood said MidAmerican’s coal generation was 51.8% lower in 2024 than it was in 2024 and the company “will continue to retire the remaining coal units by 2049.” 
A spokesperson for Alliant energy said the company has a net-zero emissions goal by 2050, and plans to eliminate all coal from generation by 2040. The spokesperson said Alliant carbon dioxide emissions in 2024 were 39% lower than the company’s 2005 levels. 
“We are implementing our strategic plan to create a more sustainable future for our customers and communities,” the spokesperson said in an email. “We will continue to review and update our Energy Vision, based on future economic developments, evolving energy technologies and emerging trends in the communities we serve.” 
Sierra Club Iowa Chapter Director Pamela Mackey Taylor said Iowa’s utility companies “keep clinging to gas and coal.” 
“While the wind turbines are hard to miss, it’s Iowa’s dirty secret that there are still 6 coal plants across the state polluting our air and water,” Mackey Taylor said in a statement. “It’s time these companies acted in our best interest, and that means phasing out dangerous fossil fuels to save lives and lower bills.”
Iowa utilities must ‘rapidly’ make use of Biden-era renewable credits to reach emissions goals

Greenwood said as part of the company’s “all-of-the-above approach” to meet current and future customer demand, MidAmerican is moving forward with its 2025 Solar Reliability Project, which will add a projected 709 MW of wind by 2027 and 800 MW of solar by 2028 and its planned Orient Energy Center, a natural gas power plant that will be able to deliver 520 MW during critical times. 
“The Sierra Club’s report oversimplifies utility planning and fails to account for regional differences, regulatory frameworks, the real-world challenges of scaling renewable infrastructure, and the unwavering need to serve customers regardless of the circumstances,” Greenwood said. 
“Here in Iowa, MidAmerican’s planning and progress have resulted in reliable electricity with rates that are seventh lowest in (the) country and 44% below the national average, and the recognition that MidAmerican is a renewable energy leader in the U.S.” he said. 
This was the second year IPL received an F. Its parent company, Alliant, received a C in the report. MidAmerican received an F this year after three consecutive years of scoring a D. Its parent company, Berkshire Hathaway, scored a D in the latest report. 
Per the report, none of the parent companies garnered an A this year, and just three utility companies scored an A in the 2025 report. According to Sierra Club, 16 utility companies “backtracked” this year on previous climate commitments. The report said this “poor planning” from utilities will result in higher bills for customers. 
“Utilities are still not planning for the clean energy transition at the pace and scale needed to address rising electricity costs or protect public health,” Sierra Club said in the report. “Since our first report five years ago, utilities’ aggregate score has declined by 3 points, moving in the wrong direction at a time when acceleration is critical.”

Taiwan Flour Mills Association President Michael Chang, Director General May Lin of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Seattle, Idaho Lt. Gov. Scott Bedke, Idaho Wheat Commission Chairman Cory Kress and Idaho State Department of Agriculture Director Chanel Tewalt attended the deal signing ceremony and exchanged gifts Wednesday in the governor’s office.
Bedke, Chang and Lin said the deal represents a continuation of a longstanding partnership and friendship between Idaho farmers and members of the milling and baking industry in Taiwan.
“We’re very honored here today to have a delegation from the Taiwanese government, as well as the Taiwan Flour Mills Association,” Bedke said during the ceremonies. “They represent a long standing, very vibrant relationship the state of Idaho has had with Taiwan for over 40 years. They are Idaho’s second largest trading partner after Canada, and they’re a very important part of our agricultural markets here.”
 Deal strengthens Taiwan’s decades long bond with Idaho, U.S. trade partners, officials say

Bedke, an Idaho farmer and rancher by trade, said the deal speaks to the quality of wheat produced by Idaho farmers.

Bedke told reporters that the deal means people from all over the world will enjoy eating dim sum in Taiwan that is made from Idaho wheat.
Lin said the new trade agreement strengthens a bond that has developed between Taiwan and its trade partners in the U.S. and Idaho over the past 40 years. Lin said the deal supports Idaho farmers by providing a stable market for wheat and ensures the people of Taiwan will have good food to eat.
“This also represents that both sides have this determination to create a resilient food supply,” Lin said. 
The Taiwan Flour Mills Association imports wheat on behalf of 20 different Taiwanese flour mills, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture said. 
“This agreement is a major win for Idaho agriculture and a testament to the strong partnership we share with Taiwan,” Tewalt said in a written statement. “Taiwan has long been one of Idaho’s most important and reliable trade partners, and their continued trust in the quality of our wheat is a point of pride for our growers and our state.”
The new wheat agreement is one part of a large agricultural partnership between Taiwan and the U.S.
Over the four-year time period from 2026 to 2029, Taiwan will purchase $10.4 billion in U.S. soybeans, corn, wheat and beef, officials said. The wheat provides a source of food security, the corn is critical for livestock feed, soybeans are essential for food processing, while U.S. beef has become a popular choice in Taiwanese steakhouses, officials said. 
Many Taiwanese snacks and noodles are made with U.S. wheat, including Xiaolongbao dumplings.  
“We’re very proud to be in the food business in Taiwan, and that relationship has turned into a friendship,” said Bedke, who has visited Taiwan four times, including most recently last fall. “Our hats are off to the farmers for always providing a predictable, quality product.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-24 19:54:53+00:00,CT Mirror,Will CT use surplus funds to fill gaps caused by big beautiful bill?,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/24/ct-one-big-beautiful-bill-cuts/,Connecticut politicians have about a month to decide whether to use surplus funds to repair programs damaged by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.,"While Connecticut officials still don’t know how much of a toll massive federal budget cuts ordered in July will take on programs here, time is running out to mount their first line of defense.
Legislative leaders and Gov. Ned Lamont have about one more month to decide whether to use a portion of last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus to repair some of the social service programs damaged by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Otherwise, nearly all those funds will be used to continue reducing the state’s hefty pension debt, and efforts to counter cuts ordered by President Donald Trump and Congress likely will wait until Connecticut’s next fiscal year begins in July 2026.
“While the full impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill is still being understood, it will undoubtedly have a devastating impact on millions of Americans, as well as our economy, all for the sole purpose of giving tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires,” Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said. “These are not Connecticut values.”
Trump on July 4 signed the omnibus measure, which orders more than $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to help finance roughly $4.5 trillion in tax relief, aimed chiefly at high-earning households.
[RELATED: What Trump’s ‘big beautiful bill’ could mean for CT residents]
But federal agencies, hampered by the ongoing budget debate on Capitol Hill, still haven’t provided states with detailed estimates of the funding they can expect to lose.
Will CT use its massive surplus to blunt the worst federal cuts?
What Connecticut and other states do know is collectively they will forfeit about $900 billion involving Medicaid and another $190 billion in nutrition assistance between now and 2034.
Connecticut officials expect federal aid here ultimately will plunge by hundreds of millions of dollars per year.
The General Assembly planned two lines of defense last spring, one for the short-term and another for down the road. Both were tied to the huge state budget surpluses it’s forced annually since 2017 to reduce a hefty pension debt and replenish reserves.
State surpluses have averaged more than $1.8 billion annually, or about 8% of the General Fund, over the past eight years. 
Lawmakers began creating a long-term safety net last spring by moving  $600 million from the must-save category back into the General Fund for use in future years. Legislators and Lamont also may need to modify the spending cap before those dollars can be used, and that’s unlikely to occur before the next state budget is adopted in May.
But some reductions in federal aid are happening now, putting pressure on the state to have a safety net for the short-term as well. 
Toward that end, the Democratic-controlled General Assembly last spring created an “emergency public health safeguard account,” a one-time pot of money that could be tapped to solve problems identified this fall or winter.
Anticipating the 2024-25 fiscal year would close June 30 with a $2.5 billion surplus, lawmakers planned to return in an autumn special session and transfer some of that bounty into the emergency account.
But how much?
Both Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, and House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, have said since May their caucuses believe about $500 million should be set aside, and this week added they still anticipate some amount to be transferred in a special session next month.
In some places, the federal cuts are being felt now.
Looney said a state-sponsored children’s behavioral health program — which serves thousands of kids in and around New Haven — already is facing cutbacks from Washington.
The Hispanic Health Council of Hartford announced earlier this month that federal cuts had forced closure of a nutrition assistance program that served 15,000 people per year, CT Insider reported.
The Connecticut Project, a nonprofit policy research and advocacy group, recently invited residents to identify service cutbacks in their communities tied to federal funding. More than 2,000 emails have been collected and forwarded to the General Assembly, said spokeswoman Meghan Holden.
Though “no state can afford to backfill all of the [federal] reductions,” Ritter said, Connecticut needs a “robust fund” to blunt cuts that cause the most harm to its most vulnerable residents.
That would leave plenty from last fiscal year’s surplus, Looney and Ritter added, to reduce Connecticut’s pension debt, which exceeds $35 billion and is one of the largest, per capita, in the nation. A $2 billion payment to pensions would be the second-largest since state officials began depositing surplus into pensions in 2020.
“We have a responsibility to keep paying on our pensions … and we have a responsibility to meet the crisis moment,” Holden said.
Analysis: Federal cuts could cost 8,200 health care and related jobs
At least one analysis warned Connecticut could feel the pain of broader federal budget cuts sooner than some expect.
The Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based health foundation, projected last spring that the Medicaid cuts Congress ultimately approved would trigger the loss of 8,200 health care and related jobs in 2026 alone. This, in turn, would mean state and municipal governments here could collect about $103 million less in taxes.
The fund also projected cuts to food assistance programs would eliminate another 1,200 jobs and almost $21 million in state and municipal tax revenue.
But Congress ordered about 80% of the nutrition grant cuts that the Commonwealth Fund assumed, so the latter’s projections in this area could be inflated.
Nutrition assistance is a “critical lifeline” for about 120,000 Connecticut residents 50 or older, according to a statement this week from the state chapter of the AARP. That population relies on $212 per month in aid, on average, to cover basic food needs.
The AARP also projects it will cost Connecticut $173 million extra per year to offset federal cuts to this program and maintain current benefits.
Access to health care and nutrition are “extremely important in terms of people’s ability to work effectively and productively,” said University of Connecticut economist Fred Carstensen, who agreed that health care providers, farms and other food production industries would impose painful layoffs over the next year.
Trump and Congress ordered the cuts to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax relief over the next decade. They extended 2017 income tax cuts set to expire while adding new deductions for the elderly and for overtime wages.
But analysts are divided over how much this relief will create jobs or stimulate economic growth, since most will go toward the nation’s richest households.
The Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan research center, projected the new federal tax relief, coupled with the inflationary effect of Trump’s tariffs, would leave all but the 20% highest-earning households nationally with less.
The lowest 10% of earning households would see their financial resources drop 6.5% while the highest earning would gain about 1.5%.
“We’re talking about a major siphoning-off of discretionary spending power,” that should dangerously weaken Connecticut’s economy, said Donald Klepper-Smith, the state’s chief economic advisor in the late 2000s under Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell.
Time is running out to temper initial wave of Trump cuts
But Lamont, a fiscal moderate, has been reluctant to tamper with the savings programs  that his fellow Democrats want to scale back to mitigate cuts in federal assistance.
The administration was noncommittal this week when asked whether Connecticut should begin using some of last year’s surplus now to respond to federal cutbacks.
“The administration will collaborate with legislative leaders on a plan moving forward once we have clarity from Washington” on all reductions, said Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee.
Minority Republicans in the General Assembly also have been wary of weakening savings efforts.
“We’ve got to have broader policy conversations,” House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, told the Connecticut Mirror earlier this summer. If lawmakers want to replace vanishing federal dollars with more state funds in one program, they should find offsetting spending reductions in others, he said.
But many Democratic lawmakers, labor unions and advocates for education, human service and municipal aid programs counter that the state is too focused on pension debt, to the detriment of its core services. And with Connecticut facing unprecedented cuts in federal aid, they say, savings efforts must be adjusted.
But Connecticut needs to decide soon how it will use the $2.5 billion left unspent from last fiscal year.
State Treasurer Erick Russell needs to inform pension analysts, who must perform periodic valuations of the program, by early November how much surplus will be deposited into retirement benefit programs.
And once surplus dollars go into Connecticut’s pension funds for state workers and municipal teachers, they cannot easily be withdrawn for other purposes.
Russell, a Democrat, said Tuesday said he believes Connecticut could use some surplus for an emergency response fund without jeopardizing the high grades it’s received from Wall Street credit rating agencies in recent years for wiping out pension debt.
But Russell did not speculate on how much surplus Connecticut could spend before Wall Street might frown, adding he would work closely both with Lamont and the legislature on any emergency response program.
“I think [an emergency fund] is consistent with us trying to position ourselves in a strong fiscal manner … and safeguarding the most vulnerable in our communities,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2277-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-24 15:57:10.606712

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers chose a consultant to conduct a study on the effects of the state’s term limits law, but some lawmakers questioned the need for the study at all.
Members of the Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee heard presentations Tuesday from Garty Consulting LLC and the Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth, but during the meeting multiple lawmakers debated the need to spend up to $225,000 on a study they said would have a predictable result.
“Do we have to choose one?” asked House Minority Leader Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks. “In six months, eight months from now, I’m not going to learn something that I don’t already know about term limits and how it impacts our legislative assembly.”
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, said he didn’t support the study during the legislative session and he doesn’t support it now.
“I think there’s better uses for nearly a quarter million dollars than to study something voters just voted on and the Legislature is already responding to,” Cleary said.
North Dakota lawmakers prepare for impact of term limits

Under the term limits ballot measure approved by voters in 2022, North Dakota lawmakers can’t serve more than eight years in the state House and eight years in the state Senate. The governor is also limited to serving no more than two terms in office.
Up to 69 lawmakers will be termed out in 2028 and up to an additional 72 lawmakers will be termed out in 2030, according to a Legislative Council analysis. 
Legislative Council is looking to hire 25 new staff members for 2025-27, in part to assist new lawmakers as the term limit law begins to take effect.
Senate Majority Leader Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, said the effects of the term limits law will compound each year. He said he believes lawmakers need to have a better idea of what to expect.
“This is just a slow moving, I’ll call it a trainwreck, that will come off the tracks, not in one single rotation of the wheels, but over a period of two to four years where we could have 50% turnover,” Hogue said. “I don’t think we’re structured now to handle that rate of turnover.”
He added lawmakers and legislative staff need an independent study on the term limits law because he believes state lawmakers are “too close” to the issue and could be accused of self-dealing. 
Some of the solutions are obvious, Hogue said. Increasing Legislative Council staff to have more long-term professionals with knowledge of the legislative branch and implementing more educational opportunities for new lawmakers could help preserve the Legislature’s co-equal branch of government status, he said.
North Dakota Legislature to boost program oversight with new hires

Lawmakers earlier this year approved up to $225,000 for the study in the budget for Legislative Council.
Committee members on Tuesday debated postponing choosing a consulting group for the study, but the motion failed.
Legislators chose Garty Consulting in a split vote after lawmakers were reassured by Legislative Council they will be able to provide guidance about the study’s focus to the consulting group as long as it doesn’t increase costs. The study is expected to cost $220,000.
In its proposal, Garty Consulting said it will survey members of the public to gauge their feelings on term limits and organize focus groups and meetings with key stakeholders to assemble data for a final report. 
The consulting firm was recently launched by Jolene Garty, former deputy executive director of operations for the South East Education Cooperative in Fargo. She said the group plans to pivot the focus of the study based on feedback from lawmakers.
The final report on the term limits study is expected by April 2026, according to the group’s proposal.

In 2021, the city of Newport served a no-trespass order to former employee Andrew Cappello. The ACLU of Vermont said it’s part of a pattern of cities barring citizens from public spaces.

A former Newport city employee who was barred from public property by the city has settled a lawsuit over the no-trespass order he received. 
Andrew Cappello worked in Newport’s Parks and Recreation Department for more than a decade before he quit his job because of his tumultuous relationship with his bosses, according to court documents. Soon after, in August 2021, he was issued a no-trespass order while at the city’s Prouty Beach Campground. 
The city’s parks director demanded Cappello leave the public property, and when Cappello refused, the lawsuit alleges, a Newport police officer arrived and issued him the order without any explanation.
In January 2023, the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont filed a lawsuit on behalf of Cappello. This week, the ACLU announced the suit had reached a settlement, dated July 11, in which Cappello received $30,000 from the city, as first reported by Newport Daily Express.
When the ACLU filed the suit, the nonprofit organization cited a pattern of Vermont cities barring citizens from public spaces and forums, including in Burlington, Montpelier and Rutland Town.  
“Forbidding someone from moving freely in a public space and participating in community life is in direct conflict with our most basic constitutional freedoms,” Hillary Rich, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Vermont, said in a press release announcing the settlement this week.

After receiving the no-trespass order, Cappello was unable to volunteer for his kids’ T-ball teams on city property and could not fulfill all the responsibilities of his new job with the NorthWoods Stewardship Center, which required him to access a city-owned beach, according to the suit. He also was given no means of challenging the order, he alleged.
As part of the settlement, Newport Mayor Rick Ufford-Chase issued a statement expressing regret for the events that led to Cappello’s no-trespass order. The settlement also stated that the city’s police department will adopt a policy that it will not issue or enforce no-trespass orders for city property. 
“I’m thrilled to be welcomed back to the City of Newport, and I’m especially pleased to learn that town officials will no longer be issuing vague trespass notices that needlessly block people from visiting parks, beaches, and other public places,” Cappello said in a statement. 
Ufford-Chase, who was elected as mayor in March 2025, was not available for comment before publication.

Board member[...]","Convicted murderer Roy Lee Ward is scheduled to be executed at the Indiana State Prison before sunrise Oct. 10. (Mugshot from the Indiana Department of Correction)The Indiana Parole Board on Wednesday recommended against granting clemency to death row prisoner Roy Ward, setting up a final decision by Gov. Mike Braun about two weeks before Ward’s scheduled Oct. 10 execution.
The five-member panel deliberated behind closed doors and released its recommendation letter to the governor outlining its reasoning. Board members cited the “brutal nature” of Ward’s 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne, emphasizing that Payne was conscious during the attack and her “final hours living with the injuries that Roy Lee Ward inflicted on her.”
“Candidly, this Board reviews thousands of cases a year, many with gruesome facts, but the victimization of Stacy Payne stood out to us,” wrote parole board chairperson Gwen Horth.
The board’s decision is advisory. State law gives the governor sole authority to decide whether to accept the recommendation and commute Ward’s sentence, grant a reprieve or allow the execution to proceed.
Braun has yet to announce his verdict.
Unless the governor intervenes, Ward will be the third person executed since Indiana resumed capital punishment in December 2024, after more than a decade-long pause. Braun denied clemency for another death row inmate, Benjamin Ritchie, earlier this year.
Story continues below.
Roy Ward Recommendation
 
Ward declined to appear before the board. In a written affidavit, he said his autism spectrum disorder diagnosis complicates his ability to communicate, and that he wanted to “avoid any misinterpretation” of his remorse.
Instead, his defense team argued before the board on Monday that his life should be spared. Lawyers pointed to evidence that Ward “has been consistently remorseful” and asked the board to consider his autism diagnosis as a mitigating factor.
The board acknowledged the legal counsel’s argument that Ward was misdiagnosed with antisocial personality disorder during trial, and that autism spectrum disorder would have better explained his behavior. Defense counsel emphasized that those with antisocial personality disorder do not feel remorse, whereas individuals with autism can — and they recounted instances of Ward expressing remorse.
But the board wrote that it gave “little weight” to either diagnosis, concluding that the jury’s findings were supported by the facts and that the preferred autism diagnosis “still does not provide the Board with any information into why this crime occurred.”
The panel also noted that because Ward declined to appear, they were unable to question him directly, as they often do in clemency proceedings. Without that interview, members said they could not gain additional insight into what led to the crime or whether Ward’s remorse reflected genuine rehabilitation.
The state — along with members of Payne’s family and community — urged the board to deny clemency, telling the panel that Ward “deserves no mercy,” and that sparing him would deny Payne’s family the justice they’ve long awaited.
DOC obtains more pentobarbital
The clemency recommendation was handed down less than a day after newly filed court records disclosed significant details about Indiana’s execution drug stockpile. 
In pending federal litigation brought by Ward, the Indiana Attorney General’s office confirmed Tuesday that the Department of Correction has obtained “three sets” of pentobarbital.
Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal said in a sworn declaration submitted to the Northern District judge that two of those sets will expire at the end of October — after Ward’s scheduled execution on Oct. 10 — and the third set expires in March 2026.
As of late August, Braun said the DOC didn’t yet have the necessary execution drugs, but the state would purchase more pentobarbital when necessary.
Story continues below.

The governor previously disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent by former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
State officials have not responded to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s questions about the amount paid for the latest three doses or if any of those are expected to expire before use.
The filings by the attorney general’s office were in response to Ward’s arguments that Indiana’s current protocol creates a constitutionally unacceptable risk of pain and suffering, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
The inmate’s legal team continues to challenge the use of the drug, citing evidence that pentobarbital can cause flash pulmonary edema and sensations of drowning. 
They point to Ritchie’s execution in May, when witnesses reportedly saw the inmate “lurch upward, as if to sit up, in a spasm” after the injection, a reaction they say is “inconsistent with the normal effects of unadulterated pentobarbital.”
More execution drug details
For more than a year, the state has resisted releasing details about its lethal injection drugs.
Attorneys for Ward and other death row prisoners have argued that compounded pentobarbital degrades quickly and can lose effectiveness or become contaminated because it is mixed in small batches by compounding pharmacies rather than manufactured under conditions regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
But the state’s latest court filings stressed that DOC is using “manufactured injectable pentobarbital” — not a compounded version — to carry out executions. Manufactured pentobarbital is produced in sterile facilities under federal quality controls, with longer shelf lives and stricter oversight than compounded alternatives, according to court filings.
Ward clemency hearing: Victim’s family asks for ‘no mercy,’ defense cites autism diagnosis, remorse

Ward’s attorneys proposed that executions could be carried out more humanely if DOC administered a “pre-dose” of fentanyl or another opioid before pentobarbital, but Neal said in his declaration that the department “does not intend to use fentanyl as part of carrying out the death sentence” and that it is not included in the prison’s directives.
Ward also suggested firing squad or nitrogen hypoxia as alternative methods, but the state rejected those options. Currently, Indiana law only permits executions to be carried out via lethal injection.
Public records also outline how DOC previously destroyed expired doses. 
A “DEA Form 41,” used for documenting the destruction of controlled substances, revealed that pentobarbital was “burned” at the Putnamville Correctional Facility on June 6. Another record shows two doses of pentobarbital were destroyed on July 10 at the Indiana State Prison by “pour(ing)” them into “kitty litter.”
It remains unclear where the execution drugs are sourced from, however. State law still protects the identity of suppliers.
Indiana Code prohibits disclosure of “the supplier’s identity through discovery or as evidence in any civil or criminal proceeding” and exempts suppliers from oversight by the pharmacy and medical licensing boards.
State law also does not provide access for journalists to witness executions unless invited by the condemned person. A federal lawsuit challenging that restriction is still pending. Indiana Capital Chronicle is a plaintiff in the case.

(Callista Images via Getty Images)As the debate over vaccine mandates heats up in Florida, there’s a push in the Legislature and the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis to broaden the use of ivermectin.
A Republican legislator from Spring Hill has filed legislation to allow the over-the-counter sale of ivermectin suitable for human use even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not authorized or approved ivermectin for use in preventing or treating COVID-19 in humans or animals.
Ivermectin is an effective treatment for parasites in animals and for use by humans to treat parasites such as head lice and scabies, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
The FDA has not approved Ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID-19, and so far recommends against taking it for COVID-19, instead suggesting people get vaccinated for protection.  
Nevertheless, there was buzz during the pandemic about using it for treatment for COVID-19.
HB 29 sponsor Rep. Jeff Holcomb, R-Spring Hill, did not immediately return Florida Phoenix’s request for comment. If approved, Florida would join the ranks of Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Idaho, and Texas in approving the medication for over the counter sales. 
The governor, First Lady Casey DeSantis, state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, and Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris held a press conference at the University of South Florida Health College of Medicine to recognize World Cancer Research Day and to highlight $60 million in new cancer research grant opportunities.  
There, the first lady said she expected some portion of the new grant funding to be used for cancer research on ivermectin.
“I know we should look at it. I know we should look at the benefits of it. We shouldn’t just speculate and guess,” DeSantis said.
Ladapo, seconded the idea.
“There’s been a lot of chatter about it, and this very simple drug that happens to be very safe, by the way, has unfortunately, you know it’s so much it’s been weighed down by all this politics, especially during the Biden administration.”
Ivermectin is not approved by the FDA for cancer treatment.

The FDA also warns large doses of ivermectin can be dangerous. “Even doses of ivermectin for approved human uses can interact with other medications, like blood-thinners. You can also overdose on ivermectin, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension (low blood pressure), allergic reactions (itching and hives), dizziness, ataxia (problems with balance), seizures, coma, and even death.”

Ladapo and DeSantis defend no mandate push
Meanwhile, Ladapo and his boss DeSantis defended their push to eliminate vaccine mandates from Florida law, rules, and regulations.
“I hope that we continue to reject the normal and we pursue a path that feels righteous, that feels like we’re actually, you know, aiming toward the thing that we want to  improve,” Ladapo said.
 “That opportunity is there. Thankfully, we have leadership, uniquely in this state, to do it. And I hope it spreads like, like all those minor viruses that my critics are afraid of, or something.”
The minor viruses Ladapo referred to includes measles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 1,514 confirmed measles cases this year as of Sept. 23. Six of those confirmed cases were in Florida. There were 11 confirmed measles cases in Florida in 2024.
Measles and other disease outbreaks occur as the percentage of school-age children in Florida who are vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella dips. While the target rate for MMR vaccination is 95%, Florida’s 2024-2025 rate was 88.8%. 
That’s a near 5% point change from the 2019-2020 year, a KFF analysis shows, and well below the targeted 95% needed for herd immunity.

Ladapo and DeSantis avoided directly answering whether their children have been vaccinated. Ladapo said reporters should be asking substantive questions and likened the questions about the children to “silly games.”
“I actually don’t care about sharing information about that. I really don’t care at all. But I won’t. And I won’t because I’m not going to participate in the silly games that so much of the media chooses to partake in instead of the substantive parts of the issues.”
In addition to defending his anti-vaccine mandate push, Ladapo appears on board with the Trump administration’s announcement that autism rates are up because pregnant women are taking acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during their pregnancies.
“They acknowledge that not all the studies show harm, but some of them do show relation. And it’s not a total explanation for autism by any means, but it does appear to be that it’s reasonable to conclude that it may be contributing to the prevalence of autism in children,” Ladapo said.
When asked whether he intended to issue any guidance he said: “We’re still looking at it. So, we may have some more guidance, but it would probably be very much in line with where the FDA is.”

Earlier this year, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Dr. Joshuan Nolan Hicks, 44, with violating an agreement or health contract he entered into with the Iowa Physicians Health Program.
According to the board, Hicks self-reported to the program, which assists physicians with substance abuse and alcohol issues, in June 2024. Sometime in 2025, the board alleges, Hicks consumed alcohol in violation of his agreement with the program and also failed to comply with toxicology testing requirements.
A board hearing on the matter had been scheduled for Aug. 5, 2025, but on July 31, 2025, Hicks agreed to a settlement that has resulted in the indefinite suspension of his Iowa medical license.
The agreement stipulates that before Hicks’ license can be reactivated, he must submit to an evaluation and participate in the Iowa Physicians Health Program if recommended. If Hicks is deemed ineligible for participation in the program, his license will be reinstated subject to three years of probation, according to the settlement agreement.
Board records indicate Hicks was issued an Iowa medical license in April 2017 after receiving his degree from Oklahoma State University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine. The records indicate he has worked as a general practice physician for the Veterans Administration’s Ottumwa clinic.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Hicks for comment.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The former secretary of Oklahoma’s top school board has demanded $100,000 from the state Department of Education, contending the agency wrongfully fired her after she complained department staff interfered with her job duties.
Amy London took the first step toward filing a lawsuit over her July 17 firing by submitting a tort claim to the agency last week with the $100,000 demand, which also alleges she suffered workplace discrimination. She contends state law gives only the Oklahoma State Board of Education, not the department, authority over hiring and firing the board secretary.
Amid ongoing tensions between state Superintendent Ryan Walters and the board, London’s claim states Walters’ chief of staff, Matt Mohler, instructed her not to communicate with board members until 24 hours before their monthly board meetings. Mohler’s directive had her withhold draft agendas and supporting documents until that deadline, leaving the board with limited time to review hundreds of pages of information needed to cast votes, London said.
“When you’ve got other personnel interfering with the board business, it prohibits a well-functioning state board office,” London told Oklahoma Voice.
The Education Department did not return a request to interview Mohler and Walters, nor did it comment on London’s claim. Instead, the agency submitted a brief statement through its spokesperson, Madison Cercy.
“We have extremely high expectations and high standards for every employee at SDE,” Cercy stated. “We have a core mission to empower parents and return education decisions back to core conservative values of our state. We expect all personnel to abide by this and sometimes things don’t work out.”

London alleged Mohler and one of his assistants hindered her, attempted to override her work, and created a “disruptive and hostile work environment,” according to a complaint she filed June 30 with the Education Department’s human resources office, which she shared with Oklahoma Voice. 
Her complaint describes Mohler as becoming more involved and commanding after London made a mistake in the board’s February meeting minutes.
The agency’s head of HR responded to the complaint in a July 10 letter, which Oklahoma Voice obtained, that stated Mohler had apologized to London and that he “intended to offer help and assistance, not to overstep boundaries or cause any upset.”
The HR response also declined London’s request to change the chain of command that had the board secretary report to the agency’s general counsel. London said this was a “conflict of interest” because state law describes the secretary as an employee of the state Board of Education, not the Education Department. 
Feeling the HR process had resulted in little change, London, 61, then took her complaints to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where she reported allegations of age- and sex-based discrimination.
The Education Department fired her six days later, she said.
“They shouldn’t have dismissed me, but the bottom line is they think they can do what they want to do,” London said. “I should still have my job.”
State statute is clear that the board is in charge of its secretary’s employment, said Mike Tinney, an attorney and a state Board of Education member.
Oklahoma law directs the state board to “appoint, prescribe the duties, and fix the compensation of a secretary.” The statute also permits the board to hire an attorney and “all other personnel necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the State Board of Education.”
“Based on that statute, yes, we have the right to hire and fire (the secretary),” Tinney said.

The board voted to hire London in December to succeed longtime board secretary Terrie Cheadle, who retired that month. Before that, London worked as Walters’ office manager at the Education Department.
Board members discovered London was no longer employed as their secretary when they arrived for their monthly meeting on July 24, a week after she was fired. They complained Walters might have exceeded his authority by removing her.
One member, Chris Van Denhende, called for a special board meeting to discuss London’s dismissal and Walters’ powers as the board’s chair.
“I think we need to discuss the appropriate roles of the board compared to the president of the board,” Van Denhende said during the July 24 meeting.
Van Denhende did not comment for this story. Fellow board members Becky Carson and Ryan Deatherage did not return requests for comment.
In the past, the entire board voted in unison with Walters, and its members received agenda information up to 14 days in advance of each meeting, London said.
But, the relationship between Walters and the board changed dramatically in February when Gov. Kevin Stitt replaced three of his board appointees while complaining they and the state superintendent were the source of “needless political drama.”
Stitt’s newly appointed board members — Tinney, Van Denhende, Carson and Deatherage — have been willing to challenge and publicly disagree with Walters, unlike their predecessors.

Internally, Walters’ administration viewed the new board members like “the enemy,” London said. After they were appointed, London received the directive not to communicate with the board until 24 hours before each monthly meeting, she said.
Being caught in the middle of the conflict was uncomfortable, London said, but she believed she could bridge the gap between both sides.
“Do I agree with some of the things the superintendent does, his conservative values and beliefs? Yes, I do,” she said. “But at the same time, he was elected; I was appointed. We have a job to do for the people of Oklahoma, for the next generation of Oklahomans.”
Meanwhile, the newly appointed board members have pleaded with Walters to provide board meeting information further in advance — most notably after they had less than 24 hours to read hundreds of pages describing new academic standards for social studies. 
One board member, Ryan Deatherage, even voted against the new standards in the board’s February meeting, saying he hadn’t had enough time to properly read them. 
Board members would later learn the social studies standards included significant last-minute changes from the original draft, including the addition of language casting doubt on the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. Half of the board said they weren’t aware of the added content and made unsuccessful calls for another chance to vote on the standards. 
The Oklahoma Supreme Court has since blocked the new standards from being taught in schools while a lawsuit is pending over their constitutionality.
Tinney said he and other board members have been wondering why Walters’ administration couldn’t provide information on coming agenda items sooner. He said he was unaware London had been directed to limit the board’s preparation time to 24 hours before each meeting.
“I’m not surprised because that’s when we got it,” Tinney said. “If you attended the meetings, we were always pushing to get it earlier, so we’d have time to review it.”
The state board voted Sept. 3 to start the process of accepting applications for its next board secretary.
London said she has been unemployed since the Education Department fired her. The $100,000 demand would cover both lost wages and damages suffered as a result of the wrongful termination, her claim contends.
She said she would consider accepting her job back if the board secretary’s office moved out of the Education Department building. Working for the agency’s chief of staff was “toxic,” she said, and Walters never responded when she sent him a message with her complaints.
London said she felt betrayed after having grown close with Walters and his family.
“I made birthday cakes for Ryan Walters’ children. I’ve been to his house to celebrate. His wife invited me over for Christmas. I mean, I would visit with his mom,” London said. “Ryan is in between my two sons in age. His wife celebrated my birthday with me in ’24. So it was like, OK, the fact that he could not even respond or have a one-on-one conversation, I think it speaks volumes.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-24 19:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Health care professionals train in mental health support for moms,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/24/health-care-pros-train-in-mental-health-for-moms/,Mississippi health care professionals received training about the profound changes women experience during early motherhood.,"FLOWOOD – Questions of profound transformation during early motherhood – including changes in mind, body and sense of self – were the subject of discussions by more than 100 Mississippi health care professionals working to better serve the women they see every day. 
The internationally established perinatal mental health training this week was free to participants because of a grant from the federal government and the collaboration of two Mississippi health groups.
The three-day course ran through Wednesday at Table 100 restaurant in the Jackson suburb of Flowood. On Monday and Tuesday, participants learned from Postpartum Support International educators how to spot important warning signs, understand lifesaving distinctions and get women and their partners connected to help they need during a time of significant and often misunderstood physical, emotional and identity shifts.
Enrollees included physicians, midwives, doulas, nurses, therapists, lactation consultants, social workers and pharmacists. Many said they have long been interested in learning how to better help the mothers they work with, but the cost of such a course would usually be prohibitive.
“It’s a very professional, well-respected program, so I’ve had it on my wish list and I’d already kind of started to budget it out and was planning on maybe eventually going to it in New Orleans. But then when I heard about this, I jumped on it,” said Bianca Wooden, a lactation consultant in Ocean Springs.

Scholarships were made possible because leaders from Mississippi Public Health Institute, a nonprofit that promotes wellbeing, and Champ4Moms, a referral service at the University of Mississippi Medical Center for providers who treat mothers, allocated funding from federal grants. Both groups’ grants came from the Health Resources and Services Administration. 
Between 2019 and 2023, Mississippi had the highest rate of pregnancy-related death. The leading causes include mental health. 
About 1 in 5 women suffers from postpartum depression – a number that is likely closer to 1 in 3 due to underreporting, said Paige Bellenbaum, a Postpartum Support International trainer based in New York.
And it’s not just postpartum depression. Perinatal mental health encompasses many conditions that arise during pregnancy all the way up through 12 months postpartum. If untreated, conditions can last well beyond that. Anxiety can be just as common as depression and can be crippling for new moms.
There’s also panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, not to mention preexisting conditions such as bipolar or post-traumatic stress disorder that become exacerbated or changed by the demands of motherhood. 
Globally, about 1 in 3 women experiences some form of physical or sexual abuse, and PTSD from those experiences is often triggered by pregnancy and birth.

“I assume everyone has a history of trauma until proven otherwise,” said Birdie Gunyon Meyer, a registered nurse with a master’s degree in psychology and counseling who serves as the director of education and training at Postpartum Support International. 
Panelists stressed the importance of having a diversity of providers trained in perinatal mental health, since new mothers see their obstetricians alarmingly infrequently for just a few minutes at a time.
It’s often unclear to doctors whether evaluating mothers for mental health conditions falls on them, speakers said. Having many professionals who encounter women throughout their pregnancy and postpartum period trained in perinatal mental health helps eliminate those misses.  
The providers who are seen as less clinical may even have better luck getting patients to open up. And while they can’t diagnose or give medical advice, they can refer those patients to professionals who can.
“I think the reframe for our ally professionals is you might be able to get that ‘in’ before I do as a therapist,” said Patience Riley, a Georgia-based licensed professional counselor and trainer for Postpartum Support International. “People are going to tell you their stories before they tell me their stories. They feel more relaxed, they feel more comfortable, so use that to your advantage to then offer the referral to the therapist, to the prescriber, to the clinic.”
Attendees learned how not to make assumptions around pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood, such as: getting pregnant is easy or difficult, being pregnant means being in a loving relationship, a C-section is easy, strong women don’t need medication, being a mother is instinctual or breastfeeding will come naturally.
They also learned important distinctions such as the difference between the intrusive thoughts of harming one’s baby that are due to OCD and are very unlikely to occur, versus those due to psychosis which are more likely to occur.  
Activities involved asking participants to recall a time they met someone who was using substances during pregnancy or motherhood to examine their biases and reflect on how to suspend judgment, as well as learning how to perform intake assessments and earn patients’ trust.
Providers who completed the training are eligible to take an exam at a Pearson testing center to gain internationally accredited certification through Postpartum Support International.

That certification helps assure parents that the provider has legitimate training, but trained providers who choose not to take the test will still help fill in gaps in care, the educators said. 
“Motherhood today can be such a lonely and isolating experience just based on the composition of families and geography,” Bellenbaum said. “A long time ago we had cousins and aunties and grandmothers and moms around, to not only support baby but to support mom. And we just don’t have that community for a lot of families anymore.”
For moms, having a support group or working with a doula, an acupuncturist or another health care provider “can be a part of this fabric to help you through that transition,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/23115653/3X0A9767.jpg,,,2025-09-24 15:57:10.606712

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The University of Minnesota will no longer lease its Rosemount gun range to outside groups, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has had a contract with the university to lease the range since 2022.
The range, which has operated for over 40 years, will continue to be used by University of Minnesota public safety officers, according to a statement from the U. The webpage for renting the university’s firearms range was active at the beginning of August, but has since been taken down.
A Reformer analysis in April found four contracts between the university and ICE, the most recent amounting to $18,867, for the federal agency to use the firearm range for training. Around a third of the most recent year-long contract amount — $6,200 — was used by the time the contract ended in May. According to public spending data, it was ICE’s only existing contract with a university at the time.
The Reformer report spurred months of advocacy from university students and Rosemount residents, according to the university’s chapter of Students for a Democratic Society. Isaac Stets, a sophomore at the U and a member of SDS, said the campaign to end the gun range lease overlapped with existing efforts by several student organizations to protect noncitizen community members from ICE.
The efforts are a response to the Trump administration’s aggressive expansion of immigration enforcement by, at times, masked agents repeatedly accused of violating due process rights.
In March, ICE agents detained Turkish student Doğukan Günaydın. Though Günaydın has since been released, Stets said there remains a “lingering fear for most of the international and immigrant students at the university” from the incident.
Rosemount residents also emailed university president Rebecca Cunningham to denounce the contract, said Jake Ameca Luna, a Rosemount resident and political operative, who said he sought to raise awareness in Rosemount.
The university’s statement made no mention of community advocacy or ICE in the decision to stop leasing the gun range to outside groups.
Instead, the “operational decision” was made after “careful consideration of investments in staffing and maintenance as well as potential liability risks,” said Erik Swanson, U of M interim police chief, in the written statement.
Those involved in the campaign against the gun range rental, including Stets, said they are skeptical.
“It seems very convenient that, this spring, there are mass uprisings about cooperation with ICE, and one of their grad students gets [detained] and held illegitimately and students are pissed about it, that they suddenly run into maintenance problems or issues with liability,” Stets said.
Stets pointed out the difference in tone between Swanson’s statement and the university’s 2020 statement limiting its relationship with the Minneapolis Police Department — temporarily, it turned out. Former university president Joan Gabel’s statement at the time made explicit reference to the police killing of George Floyd. In the case of the university’s contract with ICE, “they’re kind of just shoving it in the corner,” Stets said.
The gun range rental and the university’s response to student activism is just one part of a “pattern of cooperation between university administration and these kinds of federal repressive policies that are being put in place,” Stets said.
U students have raised other concerns about UMore Park, the 3,975-acre parcel of land in Rosemount that’s home to the gun range. For instance, this summer, students protested — once through vandalization of homes — the sale of UMore land for a new aerospace center, the Star Tribune reported.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 14:58:19.433319

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley) WURTLAND  — Though he may not agree with late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel on much, Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul reiterated that the government should not be involved with taking him off the air. 
The Kentucky senator was one of a few conservatives Kimmel thanked in his monologue that aired Tuesday night as he returned to his show on ABC after the network suspended him for comments he made about the death of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. 
“Maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don’t support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” Kimmel said. 
Kimmel also thanked another Kentucky Republican , U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell.
Talking with reporters after a forum in Greenup County Wednesday morning, Paul said with a chuckle that it was “the first time I’ve ever been on his program.” 
“I’m sure he and I probably don’t have a lot of agreements, but I don’t think the government should be involved, and I stick with that,” Paul said. “The government should not have anything to do with the content of a comedian’s monologue.”
Paul also said that if ABC felt like Kimmel had said something inappropriate, then it should have the ability to fire him. 
“There are reasons why you can be fired. You have a right to speech, but you don’t have a right to employment,” Paul said. “So, it becomes complicated, but I think it’s important that people know you can still have a strong opinion. I knew Charlie Kirk very well, and I have a very strong opinion of anybody who thinks to make light of that.”
Paul had blasted  Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brandon Carr’s criticism of Kimmel as “absolutely inappropriate” in a Sunday interview on NBC’s Meet the Press.
“The FCC was wrong to weigh in. And I’ll fight any — any — attempt by the government to get involved with speech. I will fight,” Paul said at the time. 
Paul is traveling throughout Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District with Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie Wednesday and Thursday for a mix of political and campaign events. 
After Paul commented on Kimmel’s mention, Massie added that he did appreciate one of Kimmel’s jokes from last night.
“He said that the result of this is everybody was forced to watch Jimmy Kimmel’s show, and that to take attention off of this, the administration might have to release the Epstein files,” the congressman said.

Sept. 24, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan Advance A cadre of unions representing a wide swath of workers across Michigan on Wednesday demanded that the Legislature, at long last, agree to a budget deal before the current fiscal year ends next week.
Michigan is careening toward a government shutdown because the House and Senate have yet to come to terms on how to fund the state in the coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
All manner of services, parks, inspections and other vital government functions will cease if the state shuts down due to the budget impasse. Schools are without state funding resources as they enter October, and it’s quite possible that the state might not be able to provide them with their first payments expected later that month.

Even worse, a prolonged shutdown could affect the state’s credit rating and have other unintended financial consequences. Still, the House and Senate have not been able to break the gridlock of divided government despite Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer trying mightily to bring the two sides together.
With those consequences in mind, members of the Michigan AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Teachers, SEIU Michigan, AFSCME, the UAW and the Michigan Education Association all linked arms, so to speak, during two separate rallies held outside Lansing City Hall – adjacent from the Michigan Capitol – to urge the chambers along.
Terrence Martin, president of AFT Michigan, said the moment has reached critical mass.
“We are a week away from ensuring our students’ future,” Martin said. “We cannot allow legislators to drop the ball in this moment. It is critical. It is crucial.”
Eric Rader, AFT’s vice president focused on higher education issues, warned against lawmakers continuing to raid the school aid fund – which primarily funds K-12 public schools – in order to fund higher education. With massive cuts coming at the federal level as fallout from President Donald Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act spending plan, the legislature needs to focus on making college affordable and not have it compete for state dollars dedicated to K-12 schools.
“That’s not fair to K-12,” Rader said. “It’s certainly not fair to higher education.”
Jennifer Hollander, an educator in western Oakland County’s Huron Valley Schools, said the state needs to pass an equitable education budget that fully funds local schools and the programs that children rely on to succeed, like literacy coaches and universal meals.

Ron Bieber, president of the Michigan AFL-CIO, said that no matter how crazy things have gotten in Washington, D.C., he has not seen dysfunction on the level the state Legislature has stooped to in the current budget cycle. Bieber said a worker-first budget would fully fund the state’s occupational hazard and safety agency, career technical programs for skilled trades, protections for prevailing wages and universal free school meals.
“Instead of these practical common sense investments, Michigan House Republicans have been inspired by Trump and his billionaire buddies who are trying to slash and burn our government,” Bieber said. “Republicans in Michigan think if they break our budget and cripple critical services, people will lose faith in the government’s ability to serve the people, allowing them to make even deeper cuts next time it’s a never ending cycle. It’s got to stop.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)The Florida governor’s office is vowing continued vigilance at the state’s detention centers hours after a now-deceased shooter killed two detainees and injured another at a Dallas ICE facility Wednesday morning.
“Florida will continue to be vigilant in ensuring safety and security at our detention facilities,” Molly Best, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ press secretary, told the Florida Phoenix in a statement.
“Alligator Alcatraz” and “Deportation Depot” are Florida’s two main migrant detention centers working in conjunction with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They were mostly constructed by the Florida Division of Emergency Management at the direction of top leaders, and together can hold over 5,000 people. Specific security details at the facilities were not provided by the state due to cited security risks.
FDEM did not respond to a request for comment.
According to the Department of Homeland Security, a gunman attacked an ICE Dallas field office Wednesday morning, firing “indiscriminately” at both the building and a van near the entrance. This is where three detainees were shot, killing two and putting the third in critical condition.
The gunman then committed suicide, DHS continued.
“We can confirm, the shell casings were found with anti-ICE messages on them. This was an attack on ICE law enforcement,” the statement posted on social media says. “This horrific attack occurred amidst the 1000% increase in assaults against @ICEgov.
“Politicians and media pundits must stop the vile lies and smears designed to demonize and dehumanize ICE law enforcement. This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences,” the agency added.
The Dallas attack came a month after an individual was arrested for threatening Dallas ICE officers with an alleged “detonator” on his wrist.
“Alligator Alcatraz,” located deep within the Everglades and Big Cypress National Preserve, was the nation’s first major ICE facility constructed after Donald Trump assumed the presidency. Trump joined DeSantis and other top federal and state officials on July 1 to celebrate the center’s opening.
Since then, Florida has opened “Deportation Depot” in Baker County and has floated the “Panhandle Pokey” in northwest Florida. Florida also has four other, smaller, state-run centers.

Josh Stein's administration overseeing Hurricane Helene recovery testify in front of state lawmakers on Thursday, May 22, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)As Gov. Josh Stein’s top lieutenants for Hurricane Helene recovery sat before North Carolina lawmakers on Wednesday, they recited a familiar line: federal aid money was arriving far slower than the state was able to work.
Days before the storm’s one-year anniversary, the officials told the General Assembly that applications submitted for a major grant program had been pending before FEMA for months. And although the state stood up its homebuilding program in record time, federal regulations and processes meant that the first full reconstructed home likely would not be complete until January.
Those projections led lawmakers from both parties toward the same line of questioning: is there any way to make all of this go faster?
“Should we really, in the state, be in the housing business?” asked Rep. Brenden Jones (R-Columbus). Rep. Zack Hawkins (D-Durham) wondered if “maybe the state will be better off being more invested in some of the state-funded solutions.” And Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe) asked whether the state could effectively pre-empt reimbursement from the feds on a key grant program: “Is that the way it works? Or do they actually look at every (application)?”
“All we need from FEMA is their checkbook,” Sen. Tim Moffitt (R-Henderson) said.
The slow trickle of aid is familiar for major disaster recovery, a years-long process that takes billions of dollars. But the Trump administration’s operation of FEMA — requiring top-level sign-off on all spending and enforcing new layers of scrutiny on all aid — has slowed the flow of money even more to western North Carolina and frustrated state officials and lawmakers alike. North Carolina has received federal funds to cover 9% of total damages; Stein has requested funding to cover 48%.
Trump, as well as some Republican members of Congress, have on multiple occasions expressed a desire to move the bulk of disaster response operations and funding down to the state level. But for now, that responsibility remains with FEMA.
Money for Helene does continue to flow piecemeal. FEMA greenlit an additional $48 million for North Carolina on Monday, and $64.2 million the week prior. But Matt Calabria, who leads the governor’s western recovery office, said Wednesday that the state’s applications under a specific rebuilding grant program had been waiting for action by FEMA since February.
“That’s a good exemplar for the kinds of dynamics we’re running into right now,” Calabria said.
That chunk of money, called the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, is designed to fund projects to prevent future disasters: relocating developments on floodplains, installing levees and floodwalls and retrofitting older buildings. North Carolina could be eligible to receive up to $1.6 billion under the program, officials said Wednesday. Both local governments and property owners can apply for grants. But “no homes have been approved” for the program as of Wednesday, Calabria said.
FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the status of North Carolina’s hazard mitigation grant applications.
Jonathan Krebs, Stein’s advisor for western North Carolina, told lawmakers the state couldn’t go ahead with projects under the program and hope for reimbursement from FEMA later. The most likely result from that, he said, would be rejection — though he admitted that would be better than the current limbo.

“We would love for them to say no, because then we could move onto other solutions,” Krebs said. “Right now, they’re saying nothing.”
Meanwhile, the state continues to trudge toward rebuilding homes under Renew NC, the state’s homebuilding operation that will use around $800 million in federal dollars.
State officials have kick-started casework on applicants despite still waiting on that federal money, using $120 million provided by state lawmakers. Renew NC has completed repairs on one home, and four others are now in the “pre-construction” phase, according to a state dashboard.
Work on the first home to need full reconstruction is expected to start “fairly soon,” said Stephanie McGarrah, who leads the Department of Commerce division overseeing the program. She estimated that construction could be complete around January.
Jones, the House majority leader, had heard testimony earlier from Samaritan’s Purse — a Christian aid organization that has been rebuilding homes in western North Carolina separately from government programs. The group is currently building 30 mobile homes and 40 fully furnished homes in the region, vice president Luther Harrison said Wednesday. Jones wondered whether the state was better off leaning on groups like Harrison’s for a larger chunk of work.
North Carolina has received more than 3,000 applications to its Renew NC Single-Family Housing Program to help low- to moderate-income families who experienced significant storm damage.
“Do you think it would be wise for this body to start funding the outside groups … that can move way faster than state government?” Jones asked.
Those organizations fill valuable gaps on construction that “the federal government cannot fund,” Krebs responded. But many of the properties handled by non-government groups are often lower-cost ones; for more expensive projects, its a harder sell, he said.
“When that average value starts getting really high, I think that’s where state and federal solutions start having to step in,” Krebs said, referencing major bridges specifically.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1875-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 14:58:19.433319

The announcement marks the fifth special election for state legislative seats in 2025. While Republicans came out of the 2024 election season with supermajorities in both chambers, Democrats were able to break the supermajority in the Iowa Senate with two special election victories — Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, won a January special election to replace Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer as she joined Reynolds administration, and Sen. Catelin Drey, D-Sioux City, won in an August special election following the death of Sen. Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton.
House Republicans still have a 66-33 supermajority after Sexton’s resignation.
The winner of the Iowa House District 7 special election will hold the position for the remainder of Sexton’s term — until January 2027.

“Access to courts, including the right to appeal, is a fundamental right for the purposes of equal rights and opportunity under the law,” Circuit Judge Daniel Green wrote.
This law, he said, “impinges” on that right because it only grants authority to appeal a preliminary injunction in which a state or state official is involved, and then only to the attorney general. 
“There is no compelling governmental interest achieved in allowing only the attorney general to appeal a preliminary injunction where a court has found that a challenged state law is flawed and granted injunctive relief,” Green wrote.
Officials with Missouri Attorney General Catharine Hanaway’s office in a statement Wednesday said they “strongly disagree” with Green’s decision.
“We will move to appeal that aspect of the judgment to safeguard the General Assembly’s legislative intent and protect the rights of Missourians,” the statement read.
Green ruled in a case filed in April by attorney Chuck Hatfield on behalf of longtime progressive activist Sean Nicholson. They argued that several provisions of the law run afoul of the state constitution, including provisions revising how ballot title challenges are handled by the courts. 
But in his ruling, Green upheld most of the bill as constitutional. 
Under the law, any ballot title deemed insufficient or unfair is sent back to the secretary of state up to three times for revision. If, after three attempts, the courts still find the language unacceptable, a judge is then allowed to write the language. 
The new ballot title challenge procedure is being used for the first time in a separate case in Green’s court.
On Friday, Green ruled that the ballot title for a measure passed by lawmakers, which failed to plainly state that the amendment would ban abortion, was “insufficient and unfair” and must be rewritten. 
That amendment seeks to again ban abortion in Missouri, with limited exceptions for survivors of rape and incest and for medical emergencies. The ballot title, as prepared by lawmakers, does not mention that it would make most abortions illegal.
Green gave Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins until Friday to draft new language. 
The new law also increased the length of summary statements for ballot measures proposed by the Missouri General Assembly, to 100 words rather than 50. The law also moves up the deadline for completing all court challenges to 10 weeks before the election – two fewer weeks than what was previously allowed 
Hatfield on Wednesday morning maintained that the rest of the bill was “procedurally improper” and said he plans to appeal Green’s decision to uphold the rest of the law as constitutional. 
“It’s an important issue because it changes the way we do ballot title re-writes,” Hatfield said.  “And there are several cases right now in Cole County that involve possible ballot title re-writes.” 
Missouri First Lady Claudia Kehoe tapped as treasurer for 2026 abortion ban campaign

Ongoing legal battles over access to abortion in Missouri were the impetus for the new law.
Ahead of the 2024 General Election, Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem ruled the ballot title written by then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft for the abortion rights amendment was “problematic” and rewrote the language himself.
In November, Missouri became the first state to overturn an abortion ban after voters narrowly approved an amendment guaranteeing the constitutional right to abortion up to the point of fetal viability. 
But a series of laws regulating abortion providers prevented Missourians from immediately accessing abortion following the election. 
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state over these regulations, and in the coming months a Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang found some of the regulations to be unconstitutional under the new abortion rights law. 
In issuing two preliminary injunctions, Zhang blocked state laws that requiring a 72-hour waiting period for abortions, requiring physicians performing abortions have admitting privileges at a local hospital, and requiring a licensing requirement for abortion clinics. 
This judge used a preliminary injunction to temporarily strike down these abortion provider regulations, opening up access to in-clinic abortions in Missouri beginning in February.
In April, the Republican supermajority in the legislature passed the new law giving the attorney general the power to appeal the preliminary injunction. Then-attorney general Andrew Bailey immediately put the new law to use by appealing the abortion preliminary injunction.

In oral arguments in the Missouri Supreme Court Wednesday morning, Lambda Legal attorney Nora Huppert said the November judgment “relies on evidence that was expressly excluded for its truth, and it draws conclusions from testimony that are the opposite of what that testimony says.” 
For that reason, and others, Huppert argues the decision should be reversed.
But the Missouri Attorney General’s office, represented Wednesday by Solicitor General Lou Capozzi, rejects the notion that the law is discriminatory in nature.
“Appellants have no evidence for their allegation that this could be only motivated by animus when the state presented a mountain of evidence that it is concerned about the health and safety of children,” he told the judges.
The law, passed in 2023, bars health care providers from prescribing or administering cross-sex hormones or puberty-blocking drugs, or performing gender-transition surgeries, for anyone under 18. Provisions barring gender-affirming hormones and puberty blockers are set to expire on Aug. 28, 2027, though lawmakers have shown intentions to remove the sunset.
In his November ruling, Wright County Circuit Court Judge Craig Carter determined that the restrictions weren’t discriminatory and could only be subject to rational basis review. This is the most lenient standard, requiring challengers to prove that there is no basis that the law can stand.
The legal standard for reviewing the law is a key part of the case. Statutes that violate Missouri’s equal protection clause, which says everyone is entitled to “equal rights and opportunity,” are subject to heightened scrutiny.
Attorneys from Lambda Legal, a civil rights law firm focused on LGBTQ+ litigation, and the ACLU of Missouri argue heightened scrutiny should be applied because the law “classifies based on sex and transgender status.”
Evidence — and the quality of it — is also a point of contention.
Huppert said Carter’s judgment “adopted largely verbatim” the state’s proposed findings of fact, which was filed at the conclusion of trial and before the court’s transcript was complete. The filings confirm Carter’s findings of fact outright mirror the state’s, adopting the same subheadings and copying paragraphs verbatim.
This makes the judgment deeply flawed, appellants’ brief argues, because these findings misconstrued testimony from the trial and refer to exhibits that were not allowed into the court record.
During the two-week trial last year, the attorney general’s office employed a tactic of questioning witnesses using articles and studies not accepted into the court record.
Capozzi pointed to a section of the judgment which expanded on testimony from medical ethicist Dr. Farr Curlin as proof the two documents were not 100% identical.
“The trial court was not just copying and pasting,” he said. “And the implication that the trial court was lazy or didn’t do its job is not proper.”
Judge Craig Carter, a Wright County judge serving in Cole County for Missouri’s gender-affirming care trial, listens to a nurse practitioner testify during the September 2024 trial (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Carter’s judgment acknowledges the overwhelming amount of evidence presented during the extensive trial, describing “binders of evidentiary documents that were piled so high on the bench that (his) was at times obscured.”
“This was a very lengthy and complex case,” he wrote. “It would be impossible for the court to make factual findings for each witness. The court reporter’s transcript in this case is several thousand pages.”
A clear look at the evidence, Huppert argued, would show the law is unconstitutional no matter what level of scrutiny is applied.
“The record reflects that the care ban for minors actually harms minors rather than protects them, and for that reason, the law is wholly irrational as well,” she told the judges.
Interpreting the evidence in this case is not straightforward. From the beginning, the law’s challengers and the state have not agreed on the factual background of the case and those disagreements continued Wednesday.
For example, Capozzi opened his argument by describing the law as “bipartisan,” misconstruing a compromise that led Senate Democrats to end a filibuster. But no Democrats in either the House or Senate voted in favor of the legislation.
The state’s argument also rejects claims that gender-affirming hormone therapy and puberty blockers treat gender dysphoria, a condition describing distress that occurs when someone’s sex as assigned at birth misaligns with their gender identity.
In the trial, experts largely spoke about the effectiveness of treatments as it relates to adolescents. But part of the challenged law bans the state’s Medicaid program from covering gender-affirming care for minors and adults.
Carter upheld the Medicaid restrictions, saying challengers “failed to develop any argument specifically tailored to challenging the Medicaid provision.”
Huppert said that argument was “throughout” filings. Appellants included Medicaid ban as part of “the act” in filings, challengers’ brief said, but the state claims the argument wasn’t explicit.
Judges had almost no questions during the arguments Wednesday, apart from a question from Judge Ginger Gooch asking how the case differs from a challenge of Arkansas’ gender-affirming-care ban. A federal appeals court upheld Arkansas’ ban in August.
The states’ statutes have some differences, Huppert said, and Missouri’s equal protection clause is more extensive than the federal protections relied upon in that case.
Capozzi said the statutes are “almost identical,” also pointing to similarities in Tennessee’s gender-affirming-care restrictions which the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in June.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Betsy Gardner.","Born March 6, 1939
Newark, New Jersey
Died Sept. 20, 2025
Colchester, Vermont

Grace Elizabeth “Betsy” Patten Gardner, who made a long career helping people die well, passed away on September 20 at the McClure Miller Respite House in Colchester. She leaves three children, eight grandchildren, a brother, sisters-in-law, nephews, nieces, and many dear friends.
Born in New Jersey in 1939, her family moved to Cuttingsville when she was still an infant, and except for short periods in Connecticut and Virginia, she remained in Vermont for the rest of her life. She deeply loved Shrewsbury, where her parents, Arthur and Peggy Patten, were prominent members of the community. She and her siblings John, Judy, Joe, and Will went first to a one-room schoolhouse and then Rutland High School, where she graduated in 1957.
At age three, while in Connecticut, she contracted Polio. She lost the strength in her right leg and gained an intimate knowledge of children’s hospitals. Wearing her brace, and later using canes and a chair, she spent her life striving to not just keep up with her peers, but to surpass them.
She graduated from UVM nursing school in 1961 and went to work in various wards at the DeGoesbriand, including the Psych ward, where she became very good at Ping-Pong. She joined the Visiting Nurse Association in 1976. In 1991 she began working in the Hospice program—her favorite nursing experience—and helped in the early days of Respite House in Williston. She not only touched the lives of hundreds of families, supporting them in the care of their loved ones; she also mentored and inspired a generation of Hospice nurses, physical therapists, home health aides, and volunteers. In 1996 Dr. Jim Madison requested Betsy to be his hospice nurse, and her care and integrity inspired him, Dr. Joan Madison, and her friend Estelle Deane to create the Madison-Deane Initiative to promote hospice care and support the training of hospice nurses. In 2017 a scholarship through Madison-Deane was named in her honor.
Betsy married William Lawrence Gardner in 1962 and together they raised three children: Kate McDaniel (John), Geoff Gardner (Wendy), and Alex Gardner (Rosario) in St. George.
In 2000 her mother Peggy and her ex-husband Larry both died, and feeling the need for a break, she retired and moved to Virginia to be near her daughter and three grandchildren. But she missed Vermont too much, so she returned in 2003 and settled at the Pines on Dorset Street. She immediately became active in the community, joining the Friends of the South Burlington Library, organizing talks through EEE, writing a community newsletter, and bringing in speakers to educate her neighbors on what she enjoyed calling pre-death preparations.
She traveled the country with her elder sister Judy; visited her son Alex in Italy, China, and Tibet; traveled in England with Alex and his family, and again with her nephew Jamie and his wife Marcia. With Judy she went deep into her Brewster and Patten family archives, typing out letters from the early nineteenth century and cataloging multiple boxes of documents that will be donated to the Connecticut State Historical Society. She published a book detailing her parents’ marriage based on the weekly letters they both wrote to their families.
When she received a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer in her left pleura in December 2024, she decided to limit treatment to comfort and pain management and accepted her position on the receiving end of Hospice care. Her family and friends helped her remain independent until the end. Special thanks to Jamie and Marcia, her niece Jessie, and brother Will for visiting and running errands when her children were not in town.
She and the family are grateful for the warmth and kindness of her neighbors at the Pines, particularly Diane Coil and Jackie Mastrianni; for the kindness and attention of her nurse Hailey Duquette and the rest of the Hospice team; and to Dara Stimpson, who aided her enormously in bringing her life to a close.

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.A 28-year-old woman was charged with wire fraud Wednesday for what federal prosecutors allege is her role in a $14 million scheme to defraud Minnesota’s Medicaid autism treatment program — the first person charged as part of what is believed to be a wide-ranging investigation.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for Minnesota charged Asha Farhan Hassan for what they say is her role in the theft from the state’s Early Intensive Developmental Behavioral Intervention services program, which is supposed to assist people under 21 with autism spectrum disorder. The Reformer first reported the autism Medicaid fraud investigation last year.
Prosecutors also said Hassan used her business to defraud the Federal Child Nutrition Program that was at the center of the massive pandemic-era food aid scandal known as Feeding Our Future, according to court documents.
The Reformer left a message with Hassan’s attorney, Ryan Pacyga, who didn’t immediately respond.
In 2019, Hassan began Smart Therapy with several partners to purportedly provide one-on-one therapy to children with autism. To be reimbursed by the state, Smart Therapy needed to enroll children with autism, and Hassan and her partners approached parents in the Somali community to recruit and enroll children, according to court documents. Some of the children were not diagnosed with autism.
Hassan and Smart Therapy paid monthly kickbacks ranging from $300 to $1,500 each month to the parents who enrolled their children with Smart Therapy, according to court documents.
Smart Therapy quickly became one of the state’s biggest autism treatment providers.
Smart Therapy also employed 18- or 19-year-old relatives with no experience related to the treatment of autism and had no formal education beyond high school, according to court documents.
Smart Therapy obtained over $14 million from 2019 to 2024 from Medicaid through the Minnesota Department of Human Services and U Care, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
The Reformer reported in 2024 that a former supervisor at Smart Therapy made repeated attempts to report what she said were negligence and fraud to state officials.
Growth of spending on the Minnesota autism program has exploded in recent years. The number of providers — who are supposed to diagnose and treat people with autism spectrum disorder — has increased 700% in five years, climbing from 41 providers in 2018 to 328 in 2023.
While allegedly defrauding the autism program, Hassan also used Smart Therapy to submit fraudulent claims to Feeding Our Future, according to court documents. Between 2020 and 2021, Hassan claimed to serve nearly 200,000 meals to children in Smart Therapy, for which she received about $465,000, the documents said.
Hassan shared the fraudulent dollars with her partners, sent hundreds of thousands abroad and used some of the money to purchase real estate in Kenya, according to court documents.
Wednesday’s charge is another instance of the alleged defrauding of a Minnesota public program.
“Today’s charges mark the first in the ongoing investigation into fraud in the EIDBI Autism Program,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson.  “To be clear, this is not an isolated scheme. From Feeding Our Future to Housing Stabilization Services and now Autism Services, these massive fraud schemes form a web that has stolen billions of dollars in taxpayer money.  Each case we bring exposes another strand of this network.”
Hassan is at least the 76th person charged in the Feeding Our Future investigation.
Last week, Thompson announced charges against eight in another Medicaid fraud scheme through the state’s Housing Stabilization Services program.
The latest charges are likely to be more fodder for opponents of DFL Gov. Tim Walz — who announced last week he’s running for a third term — who say his administration was asleep on the watchtower as fraudsters looted state programs.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/P1207877-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 13:58:14.340791

Derrick Van Orden’s proposed bill intended to cut off federal funds from any entity that employs individuals “who condone and celebrate political violence and domestic terrorism”.
In Eau Claire, Van Orden has threatened federal funds to the city because of statements made by two city council members in the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk. He also recently threatened to defund the Mayo Clinic in Eau Claire for similar reasons. 
Many of the protesters at the event wore hazmat suits because, they said, Van Orden is “toxic” to Wisconsin. The group marched on Farwell St. and chanted their protests against Van Orden’s attempts to limit free speech.
After an introduction from organizer Cindy Greening, former Democratic state Rep. Dana Wachs spoke at a brief press conference at the event. “The thought that a United States congressman would threaten an entire community because he doesn’t happen to like what a couple of folks said or allegedly said, is beyond outrageous,” Wachs said. “This person must not be in Congress.”
Eau Claire City Council President Emily Berge also addressed the crowd. “We are here because our community has come under attack, not from the outside, but from our own congressman,” Berge said. “In a series of statements and proposed legislation, Rep. Van Orden has threatened to strip millions of dollars in federal funding from our city, punishing 80,000 people for the words of two individuals. Let’s be clear, this is not just political theater. This is a direct attack on free speech, the cornerstone of our democracy, the First Amendment.”
The protesting and marching continued after the press conference, garnering many honks and waves from people driving by on Farwell.

He and five other Senate Republicans are convening a task force on health care, saying Democrats have not addressed medical malpractice reform or other health-care-related issues. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Republicans in the New Mexico Senate announced this week that they’re convening a legislative task force to tackle the state’s health care challenges, saying their Democratic colleagues have “refused to take action,” according to a Tuesday news release.
The task force will meet on Sept. 29 in the Sandoval County Commission chambers in Rio Rancho. According to an agenda, the three-hour meeting will address medical malpractice reform and elicit testimony from local hospital leaders, government reform groups and patients. New Mexico Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie will also speak.
The meeting “is a direct response to ongoing public interest and concern regarding New Mexico’s deteriorating access to quality healthcare,” according to a news release from the Senate GOP. “Furthermore, this hearing was organized in large part due to the fact that despite official requests from Republican legislators, Democrats in the legislature have refused to take action or host meaningful discussions on this topic during the interim legislative committee process.”
The hearing will occur two days before a special legislative session focused on anticipated federal cuts to Medicaid, among other topics. Republicans previously called on Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, to include medical malpractice reform on the Oct. 1 session agenda, though she has not done so. They subsequently pushed back at the limited scope of the special session and requested additional topics, including interstate medical compacts, which would allow health care workers licensed in other states to practice in New Mexico.
NM Gov will add vaccine policy to Oct. 1 special session agenda

Think New Mexico, a nonpartisan policy organization, found in a report published last year that New Mexico has one medical malpractice lawsuit for every 14,000 New Mexicans, more than twice the national average. Also, a spate of high-dollar judgements has raised costs of medical malpractice insurance, sometimes by as much as 500%. The organization also has said high medical malpractice insurance costs are a major contributing factor to a statewide doctor shortage. 
Think New Mexico, whose leaders are scheduled to speak at the GOP hearing on Monday, also advocates for the state to join more interstate medical compacts to address health care worker shortages,, and last week said failure to do so quickly could put the state’s rural hospitals at risk.
The state’s health care labor landscape came up Tuesday during a meeting of the Legislative Finance Committee, during which analysts released results from a secret shopper survey from August. LFC analysts called 256 primary care physicians and 259 doctors for behavioral health care appointments under Medicaid. They found it took six phone calls, on average, to secure an appointment.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The executive director of Indiana’s public retirement system cautioned lawmakers Wednesday that an effort to aggressively pay down unfunded liabilities won’t immediately free up more dollars — instead saying further analysis would be needed.
The Indiana Public Retirement System oversees nearly $55 billion in assets for 551,000 members across 16 accounts. The overall funding status of the system increased from 81% to 83.2% in the last year.
The state’s largest unfunded liability continues to be the Teachers’ Pre-1996 Defined Benefit Account, which has $3.1 billion in unfunded liabilities. The state budget dedicates $1 billion annually to pay down that account — which is on-track to reach funded status by 2028 or 2029, depending on market conditions.
“Everybody is anxious for that day that this money gets 100% funded,” said Steve Russo, INPRS’ executive director. “Anxious about, maybe, what they do with the money. But I want to be sure that it’s well understood the potential risk of this thing.”
He warned that the state would have to continually monitor, and potentially pay, to keep that funded status as market conditions shift. There’s also always a risk of a major economic downturn. 
“We definitely look forward to engaging and collaborating, not only with just the leadership, but also the administration and the legislature,” Russo said. 
Lawmakers, particularly Senate Republicans, have added large chunks of cash to accelerate payment of the debt in recent years when the state was flush with revenue. And leaders have eagerly waited for the day the state no longer pays $1 billion annually toward the fund. Those dollars could, instead, be used to invest in other programs or to further trim down Indiana’s marginal income tax rate.
Russo also assured members of the Interim Study Committee on Pension Management Oversight that investments complied with requirements to divest from foreign adversaries, including China.
This comes after the Indianapolis Star pointed out the state had holdings in Hong Kong. Now the agency will divest.

MILFORD – At a time when understanding democracy is critical to the health of the nation, Milford Senior High School is earning national attention for its commitment to civics education. Leading that effort is educator Shae Parks, a seventh-year teacher whose work to make civics engaging and relevant has earned her the prestigious American Civic Education Teacher Award (ACETA).
Parks, who holds a Master of Science in Curriculum & Instruction from Kansas University, is one of only a handful of educators nationwide recognized by the Center for Civic Education, Indiana University’s Center on Representative Government, and the National Education Association. The award honors classroom teachers who provide students with both the knowledge of how government works and the skills and motivation to participate in civic life.
Bringing Civics to Life
As a dedicated civics educator, Parks believes the subject is far more than memorizing facts—it’s about understanding how government decisions affect everyday life and how citizens can influence them. She uses current events, local issues, and community partnerships to connect students to the civic world, organizing Civics Learning Week activities, collaborating with the League of Women Voters of Delaware, and inviting local and state leaders to speak in her classroom.
“Teaching civics has been essential since our country was founded,” Parks said. “For our democracy to thrive, citizens must have the skills and the knowledge to participate in government—and the desire to do so. That disposition to be an engaged citizen can only be developed through meaningful interactions with others, and that’s not something you can easily re-create outside of a school building in today’s world.”
Empowering Student Voices
Outside the classroom, Parks advises Milford’s Student Government Association, helping students organize pep rallies, homecoming, and prom. But she views student government as much more than school spirit.“Student government, and student-led organizations like it, are what build the sense of responsibility and empowerment that students need to be impactful members of society,” she explained.
Her dedication to civic engagement has also earned her two selections to the University of Delaware Biden School of Public Administration’s Democracy Project Institute for Teachers, where she shares strategies for strengthening civics education statewide.
Looking Toward America’s 250th
As the nation approaches the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, Parks is focusing on helping students bring America’s founding ideals to life. “Right now my biggest focus is finding ways to bring our founding documents to life for students,” she said, noting that the milestone offers a powerful opportunity to connect the past to today’s civic challenges.
A Community Commitment
The ACETA program highlights the unique role schools play in sustaining democracy. “A free society relies on the civic knowledge, skills, and virtue of its citizens,” the award’s mission states. “Schools bear a unique responsibility for developing civic competence and civic responsibility.”
Through her innovative approach, educator Shae Parks ensures Milford students graduate with more than just textbook knowledge. They leave with the confidence and commitment to participate in civic life—proving that strong civics education is not only vital to the classroom, but to the future of the community and the country.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shae-Parks.jpg,,,2025-09-24 13:58:14.340791

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Nearly two years into the war in Gaza, a Florida Republican proposes to ban state agencies from mentioning the West Bank, the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory, and enforce “Judea and Samaria” as the official name for the middle eastern battleground.
Rep. Chase Tramont, a Port Orange Republican, introduced HB 31 Tuesday in hopes of replacing the “West Bank” phrase with the biblical name for the regions north and south of Jerusalem and widely used by right-wing Israelis to describe the Jordan River territory.
The move comes amid strong Floridian support for Israel and an overall split in foreign politics on whether to back Israel in its campaign to eradicate Hamas, a designated terrorist organization backed by Iran, or recognize Palestine as a state following allegations that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is orchestrating a genocide.
“It is the intent of the Legislature to refer to the land annexed by Israel from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War by its historical name of ‘Judea and Samaria,'” Tramont’s bill reads. “A state agency may not use the term ‘West Bank’  to refer to Judea and Samaria in an official government material or use moneys to create an official government material that refers to Judea and Samaria as ‘West Bank.”
It does create an exception for agency heads to waive the prohibition if they determine using “West Bank” is in Florida’s “best interest” and send a written explanation within a month of the realization to the Senate President and Speaker of the House, the bills says.
A congressional copy…
HB 31 is a near replica of a federal bill introduced in February by House and Senate Republicans, although the measure has yet to advance to a vote. It referenced Israel’s annexation of the territory from Jordan in 1967, citing its historical claim to the ancient “Judea and Samaria.” Since then, the Israeli military has occupied the area.
“The Jewish people’s legal and historic rights to Judea and Samaria goes back thousands of years,” Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton said at the time, The New York Times reported. He asked for the U.S. to “stop using the politically charged term West Bank.”
Following Hamas’s ambush and murder of more than a thousand Israelis during music festival on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has launched a no-holds-barred counter-offensive deep into Palestinian-occupied areas in the Gaza Strip. Florida officials reacted quickly, passing resolutions strongly backing Israel and punishing businesses that boycott its government.
Gov. Ron DeSantis hosted a slew of press conferences statewide to decry pro-Palestinian protesters setting up encampments on university campuses, encouraging the U.S. government to revoke their student visas. Months later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio obliged.
Since then, Netanyahu has come under fire from prominent peace organizations including the United Nations. A UN commission of inquiry released a report last week claiming he’s led a genocide in Gaza. Despite this, top U.S. officials continue to tout their strong relationship with Israel, a leading Middle East ally for the United States, to the point that President Donald Trump in June dropped bunker-buster bombs in Iran in coordination with Israel.

The 10 members present at Wednesday’s meeting voted to refer House Bills 4556 and 4557 to the House floor for further consideration. The policies were introduced by state Reps. Tom Kunse (R-Clare) and Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth). 
Michigan’s merit examination consists of three components:  the College Board SAT, the ACT’s WorkKeys job skills assessment and the Michigan Standardized Test for Educational Progress – or M-STEP test – for science and social studies. The three exams are administered to 11th grade students and eligible 12th graders every spring.
If these bills pass, schools would no longer require students to complete an essay portion as part of the SAT, and their scores in each subject area would not be included on their high school transcript, which is used in college admissions. 
“Students leading up to the SAT are going through study sessions, they’re going through all these different academic strategies, all these things to try to do the best they can on this test,” Koleszar told committee members during a previous meeting. “They take the test, and then after this exhausting test is over they’re handed a writing portion to the SAT that schools are not using the data for, that it has no impact on their college admission whatsoever.” 
Schools similarly do not use the data from the ACT WorkKeys assessment, or the M-STEP test, Koleszar said, emphasizing the strain the assessments place on students.
“[Students] are beat, they’re exhausted and schools aren’t using the data, so the question begs to be asked, why would we put those scores on a transcript?” Koleszar said.

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Time to lawyer up.
That’s the conclusion of the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council, which voted unanimously at its Tuesday meeting to enlist its legal counsel to crack down on Quidnessett Country Club for failing to comply with state coastal rules.
The decision comes after more than two years of warnings, negotiations and deadline extensions as coastal regulators tried to reach an agreement with the North Kingstown country club over the removal of a 600-foot-long rock wall built without permission along its shoreline. 
Opposing sides continued to butt heads Tuesday over details of the required plan to remove the wall and restore the shoreline along Narragansett Bay to its natural state. 
Jennifer Cervenka, an attorney representing the 1,000-member country club, continued to make the case for replacing the rock wall with a row of biodegradable, geotextile sandbags to shield the club’s golf course from rising sea levels. But coastal staff maintain the products from Florida company Trapbag violate state coastal restrictions, which expressly prohibit anything but non-structural barriers in environmentally sensitive coastal habits like the shoreline overlooking Narragansett Bay.
Also in dispute: how far inland to put any barrier to meet state public access law and other coastal requirements, and the type and amount of native vegetation that must be replanted after the stone wall is removed.
“The restoration criteria are not arbitrary,” Emily Hall, a CRMC coastal geologist, said Tuesday. “To disregard any of the three requirements would allow prohibited activities to continue on the shoreline.”
Yet Cervenka insisted the country club was not “recalcitrant,” pointing to the seven versions of a shoreline restoration plan submitted over the last year, even though all were rejected by agency staff for failing to meet coastal requirements. 
“The last two [plans] in particular, we believe, struck a proper balance between what’s required under the program and the protection of our property,” said Cervenka, who previously chaired the appointed panel of coastal regulators.


Lurking unspoken but present in the debate: two lawsuits brought by Quidnessett against the CRMC. The first, filed in July in Providence County Superior Court, contests the procedural process the council followed in reviewing the case. On Sept. 8 came a second complaint, alleging the agency violated the country club’s constitutional property rights and asking a Superior Court judge to redesignate the coastal waters to allow for development.
The dispute over the water type designation started shortly after the CRMC issued a cease-and-desist order against the country club in August 2023, followed by a series of warnings threatening fines. The club initially defended the wall, built the previous winter, as an emergency measure necessary to protect its signature 14th hole. 
After being sanctioned, the country club’s representatives said the “Type 1” designation for the section of Narragansett Bay along its shoreline was incorrect and pushed for a less restrictive label that could allow development such as a rock wall.
The CRMC rejected the application for the water type reclassification in January, shifting focus to details of the location and materials used to restore the shoreline to its pre-wall condition.
Hall acknowledged the multiple concessions made by coastal staff to accommodate Quidnessett. But it was obvious to CRMC Chair Ray Coia the two sides reached an impasse over the Trapbag solution. 
“Where do we go from here?” Coia asked. Turning to Cervenka, he said, “I see no concession from Quidnessett because you feel, in your opinion, that Trapbags are allowed. And staff, in looking at the rules and regulations, strongly defend that they are not allowed.”
Council member Kevin Flynn suggested Quidnessett needed to reconfigure its golf course to meet state coastal requirements.
“We’re talking about grass and sand here, Flynn said. “We’re not talking about protecting a building here, or protecting a school.”
Flynn proposed turning the par-5 14th hole into a shorter, par-4 to avoid butting up against the eroding shoreline.
But Cervenka defended the preservation of the golf course in its original 1960 state, as designed by architect Geoffrey Cornish. The rock wall built two-and-a-half years ago was vital to protecting “imminent harm to property and persons,” she declared.
Michael Reuter, the newest appointee to the CRMC who was confirmed in March 2025, shrugged off Cervenka’s plea.
“If it was so vital, you should have come to us first,” he said. “Why not get an emergency permit?”
The council’s vote Tuesday does not specify how its legal counsel will seek to enforce its existing order requiring removal of the rock wall and restoration of the shoreline. And negotiations over plan details can still continue if Quidnessett is willing to work toward resolution, Anthony DeSisto, the council’s attorney, said. 
The council’s June 10 order gave the country club three months — until Oct. 8 — to remove the wall and restore its shoreline.
Robin Main, another attorney representing Quidnessett, declined to comment in an emailed response Wednesday. 
Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, said it’s still unclear how the case is going to play out in an interview Wednesday. 
Thorp outlined various scenarios that could follow. One: a court order setting a deadline for Quidnessett to take the wall down and/or details of a restoration plan, a prospect he expected the country club would appeal. Or, a judge could side with Quidnessett in its initial lawsuit arguing that the CRMC should have referred the case to its hearing officer. That would force a redo of the entire review process before the agency’s designated lawyer for disputed cases. Finally, there remains the possibility of settlement outside court.
“What matters to us at the end of the day is when is this wall going to get taken down and when is the site going to get restored,” Thorp said. “Whatever option gets us to that quickest is what we’re going to want to see.”
The council ended its meeting with a scheduled, closed-door discussion about the lawsuits filed by Quidnessett. Members returned to open session after 10 minutes, voting unanimously to authorize its legal counsel to act on its behalf. The CRMC has not yet submitted responses to either of the Quidnessett lawsuits, according to public court dockets.

To safeguard people and communities we must protect existing natural flood control features, like wetlands, fully fund pre-disaster programs, and ensure federal and state agencies coordinate with local needs. Today, our wetlands are at risk, disaster preparedness programs are defunded, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is hobbled.
Wetland Flood Protections Undermined
In 2023 the U.S. Supreme Court issued its Sackett v. EPA decision severely limiting wetland protections. Experts warned the outcomes could range from bad to catastrophic. New federal guidance now points toward the catastrophic end of that spectrum.
Research by Environmental Defense Fund scientist Dr. Adam Gold shows that 500,000 to 3.6 million acres of wetlands in North Carolina may no longer be protected depending on federal and state rules. With the EPA proposing an extreme interpretation of the Sackett decision, more than 3 million acres of wetlands across North Carolina could now be destroyed, putting more people and communities at-risk of flooding.
Disaster Preparedness Programs Defunded
Hurricane Helene was only the latest in a string of costly disasters to hit North Carolina. Communities need proactive investments to break the cycle of repeated losses. FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program offered exactly that.
Created in 2018 with bipartisan support during the previous Trump Administration, BRIC funded projects to build flood protection and ensure resilient infrastructure and communities.The program’s value was clear: one dollar invested in resilience saves $13 in avoided damages. Yet earlier this year, the Trump Administration defunded BRIC entirely.
For North Carolina, this means halting at least $164 million in projects already selected across the state. That’s money that would have protected families, businesses and tax dollars from future storms. Instead, communities remain exposed, and recovery costs will only rise. The math is simple: the cost of doing something now is far less than the cost of doing nothing or trying to do it later.
Coordination and Capacity Diminished
Local communities and individual residents should not be expected to prepare for and recover from Helene-sized storms by themselves. Yet FEMA is being hollowed out and weakened. The ability to train, coordinate, and support local communities is diminished.
FEMA has also ended its door-to-door outreach in disaster areas, a change that makes it harder for vulnerable residents, like the elderly or those without transportation, to access aid. It also places undue burden on our rural residents who have to drive even greater distances.
Local and state governments often must front recovery costs while waiting for FEMA reimbursements. Delays and freezes now leave counties struggling to repair infrastructure and maintain services. For small towns already operating on tight budgets, this is an impossible burden.
Taken together, these federal rollbacks leave North Carolina communities more vulnerable to both storms and slow recoveries.
State and Federal Action Urgently Needed
In a bipartisan effort, a US House of Representatives committee advanced the FEMA Act by a vote of 60-3 earlier this month. The legislation establishes FEMA as a cabinet agency and makes changes to pre- and post-disaster policies, programs, and processes in an effort to simplify disaster assistance for victims, incentivize disaster preparedness, improve coordination amongst federal agencies, and increase transparency and accountability.
North Carolina Representatives Rouzer, McDowell, and Foushee all voted in favor of moving the bill through committee. Representative Edwards, while not on the committee, is a co-sponsor of the legislation.
In North Carolina, the General Assembly should recognize the bipartisan need to reduce flood risks and future disaster risks by prioritizing wetlands conservation to safeguard natural flood defenses and supporting nature-based solutions like restoration opportunities and green infrastructure, which are affordable, rapidly deployable and provide multiple benefits for clean water and wildlife.
North Carolina has endured storm after storm. We know what’s at stake. It’s time for our leaders to act – before the next hurricane reminds us, yet again, of the cost of doing nothing.

Lee Rupp of Columbus, a longtime lobbyist for the University of Nebraska, with his dog Lucy. (Courtesy of the Rupp Family)LINCOLN — Former Nebraska State Sen. Lee Rupp wore many hats during his lifetime — Marine, lawmaker, conservationist, lobbyist, volunteer firefighter and faithful member of a Columbus coffee club.
But his friends, including Gov. Jim Pillen, say he would want to be remembered for his service to others.
“He was just one of those guys who gave back. I don’t know where he got that, but he gave and gave and gave,” said long-time friend Jerry Engdahl of Columbus.
Rupp, who served seven years in the Nebraska Legislature, died Sunday. He was 87.
Rupp was born near Monroe, Nebraska, and worked as a fisheries biologist for the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission until 1982, when he won a seat in the state Legislature. In 1989, he resigned to become the director of legislative affairs for the University of Nebraska, a post he held for 11 years.
As a state senator, he supported legislation that involved wildlife and agriculture. Rupp won support for opening a hunting season for elk in Nebraska — a hunt he joked he never got to enjoy because he never was able to draw a permit, Engdahl said.
An avid hunter, Rupp’s dedication to the outdoors led the Nebraska Wildlife Federation to name him “Conservationist of the Year” in 1978 and the Game and Parks Commission, in 2021, to rename a wildlife area south of Monroe the “Lee Rupp Wildlife Management Area.”
He also was a faithful member of the Picket Fence Coffee Club, which meets six days a week at a downtown Columbus cafe, and the OFC, or “Old Farts Club,” a group that holds regular dinner meetings.
Pillen, a life-long friend who grew up near the Rupp farm, posted a statement this week saying that Rupp had a significant influence on his life and his decision to run for governor.
“Lee had a passion for Nebraska. He enjoyed the outdoors, understood agriculture and was deeply committed to preserving our state’s natural resources,” the governor said. “I appreciated Lee’s counsel throughout the years and will greatly miss his friendship.”
Kay Rupp, the senator’s widow, said by text message that Lee would want to be remembered for “his love and pride for his family, his state and his country.”
“And he tried to reflect that by serving others throughout his life,” she wrote.
Former Nebraska Lt. Gov. Kim Robak, who grew up in Columbus, said Rupp was a steady advocate for the University of Nebraska, who never put the institution in a bad light.
Besides his wife, Rupp is survived by two daughters, Lori Hodtwalker and Lisa Brestel, a son, Mark, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
A funeral service is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Friday at Peace Lutheran Church in Columbus.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)  With the November election just six weeks away, experts for and against the statewide referendum question proposing a red flag law participated in a televised town hall Tuesday night. 
Proponents were represented by psychiatrist David Moltz and former Public Safety Commissioner Anne Jordan, while David Trahan, the head of the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine, and Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) spoke for the opposition. 
The four presented their reasons why Maine voters should support or reject Question 2 on the November ballot. It will read: “Do you want to allow courts to temporarily prohibit a person from having dangerous weapons if law enforcement, family, or household members show that the person poses a significant danger of causing physical injury to themselves or others?”
Maine already has what’s known as a yellow flag law, which allows law enforcement to take guns away from people after a mental health evaluation. 
Though law enforcement has reported that the law is cumbersome, there has been increased use since the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston in which 18 people were killed. In late August, the state Department of Public Safety announced that more than 1,000 orders to seize dangerous weapons have been issued since the law took effect in 2019.
The shooting in Lewiston reinvigorated the conversation around extreme risk protection orders after an independent commission found that local law enforcement had sufficient probable cause to both take the perpetrator, Robert Card II, into protective custody under Maine’s yellow flag law and start a petition to confiscate his firearms. 
“Our yellow flag law, as you’ve discussed, was an experiment — the only one like it in the nation — and it failed,” said Jordan, who also served as executive director of the independent commission that gathered facts about the Lewiston shooting.
She went on to say that a red flag law would provide another “effective tool” to allow families and household members to petition the court when they have concerns about someone’s potential for danger to themself or others. 
If the referendum passes, it would not replace Maine’s current law, but would be an additional tool police or the general public can use to temporarily confiscate weapons. 
However, Trahan pointed out that Maine State Police argued in a public hearing before the Legislature that having both laws on the books would be confusing. 
“That is the very agency that we depend on,” he said, “that is supposed to keep the public safe. When they stand up there and say, ‘This is going to make it less safe and more dangerous for everyone involved,’ then we should listen to them. Vote ‘no’ on 2.”
What is a red flag law?
Red flag laws are active in twenty-one states, including four states in New England. Maine is the only state with a yellow flag law. 
The referendum proposes allowing a family member, household member or law enforcement officer to file a petition, along with an affidavit of facts, for an extreme risk protection order if someone is suspected of posing a significant danger of causing physical injury to themself or another person. That protection order would prohibit the person from purchasing, possessing or controlling a “dangerous weapon.” 
A court would be required to schedule a hearing within 14 days of when the petition is filed. If the court finds the individual does pose a significant risk of causing physical injury, the court must issue an order prohibiting them from purchasing, possessing or receiving a dangerous weapon for up to one year. The person would need to immediately surrender any dangerous weapons in their possession to law enforcement.
A person could request to have the order terminated if they can show evidence that they no longer pose a risk of physical harm. Conversely, an order can also be renewed for up to one additional year.

In March 2023, former Elgin City Clerk Rhonda Dales was named in a state audit report that identified $131,213 in improper disbursements by the city and an additional $7,532 in disbursements for which there was no supporting documentation.
The questionable spending cited by the auditor included:
— Excess payroll payments to Dales: $60,726.
— Unauthorized comp time for Dales: $27,451
— Unauthorized paid time off for Dales: $9,863
— Improper reimbursement payments to Dales: $19,204
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The report noted that much of the questionable spending was tied to pay and benefits collected by Dales in violation of city policies. However, the report also noted that regardless of the policy, city council members did not agree as to whether Dales, as a part-time employee, was entitled to such payments.
According to the auditor’s office, its investigation stemmed from a May 2021 Elgin City Council meeting at which Dales was informed she was being fired due to concerns with her job performance. Because of the concerns, city officials asked state auditors to review the city’s financial records from 2017 through June 2021.
Within days of the auditor’s report being released in 2023, Fayette County officials criminally charged Dales with felony first-degree theft. Dales pleaded not guilty, and the case was initially scheduled for trial in July 2023.
Court records show that over the next two-and-a-half years, judges granted 14 continuances in the case, and on Aug. 22, 2025, Fayette County prosecutor Jason Dunn reduced the charge from felony first-degree theft to misdemeanor fourth-degree theft, alleging Dales stole no more than $750 worth of property from the city.
Dales pleaded guilty to the charge and on Sept. 3, 2025, was fined $430 and placed on informal probation for one year. There was no restitution ordered in the case.










This is very disappointing ... I feel bad because I'm also a taxpayer with the City of Elgin.


– Elgin Mayor Jim Knobloch


“This is very disappointing,” Elgin Mayor Jim Knobloch said Tuesday, adding that he was surprised by the outcome of the matter given the $37,000 in expenses the city incurred just for commissioning the state audit.
“The courts of the land have spoken and are saying this is worth a $430 fine,” Knobloch said. “It is what it is. I feel bad because I’m also a taxpayer with the City of Elgin.”
Knobloch said that at one point, he met with a county prosecutor about the case but “I just felt, like, ‘I’m wasting my time here.'”
Dunn and Fayette County Attorney Nathan Lein did not respond to calls Tuesday from the Iowa Capital Dispatch.
In an interview Tuesday, Dales said Dunn had indicated to her earlier this year that he wasn’t sure how to prosecute the case “since no money was missing,” and that the state attorney general’s office had declined to take over the case.
Dales said the criminal case stemmed from local officials’ desire for “revenge” against after she reported that Knobloch appeared to be sexually harassing her. Knobloch said all of the allegations of harassment against him were “debunked” by the Iowa Civil Rights Commission.
“That was all thrown out,” he said. “That was false.”
Dales said that’s not the case and provided the Iowa Capital Dispatch with a copy of the right-to-sue letter the commission granted her on Dec. 12, 2024. While the letter doesn’t amount to a ruling on the merits of Dales’ civil rights complaint, a right-to-sue letter is issued only in cases where there’s a finding of probable cause, allowing a complainant to pursue litigation.
As for the findings of Iowa Auditor of State Rob Sand, Dales said Sand wanted to make a name for himself by claiming to have ferreted out wrongdoing by local officials. “He used this as a platform to get his face out in public,” Dales said of Sand. “He went around the state telling people how many clerks he had charged with embezzlement.”
“Elgin city officials asked for this investigation, and we’re glad they did,” Sand said in a written response to Dales’ claims. “We stand by our report, which showed over $130,000 of improper self-dealings. Any prosecutor in the state of Iowa who has questions about how to do justice for taxpayers knows how to get a hold of the Attorney General’s Office or me.”
Dales pointed out that many of the auditor’s findings were tied to her receipt of insurance coverage, comp time and other benefits as a part-time employee of the city. “My harasser was saying I wasn’t entitled to it because I was only working 30 hours per week, and so I broke the law by collecting those insurance benefits,” she said. “There is no such law, but Sand went along with it.”
According to the auditor’s report, the findings of wrongdoing were based on the benefits being contrary to city policy. The report highlighted several deficiencies in financial oversight by the council, noting that the city didn’t follow its own personnel policies and, as a result, Dales “periodically paid herself” for more hours worked than the council had ever authorized.
“The lack of appropriate oversight and the failure to ensure implementation of adequate internal controls permitted an employee to exercise too much control over the financial operations of the city,” the report concluded.

(Courtesy photo/Innovation Law Lab)A wildland firefighter who was arrested by immigration agents while fighting a wildfire in Washington state has been released from detention by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, his attorneys said Wednesday.
Rigoberto Hernandez Hernandez was freed Tuesday after nearly four weeks in detention at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington. Hernandez is now back home in Oregon with his family, said Matt Adams, legal director with the Northwest Immigration Rights Project, which is representing him.
The group, along with attorneys at Oregon-based Innovation Law Lab, said that the arrest of Hernandez was illegal and violated due process. The groups’ petition for habeas corpus is still pending.
Firefighters question leaders’ role in Washington immigration raid

Adams said the government has dismissed its proceedings to remove Hernandez from the country.
“They’re acknowledging that there’s no justification for this arrest or this type of enforcement action targeting people who are on the front lines working to keep our community safe,” Adams said in an interview.
Attorneys for Hernandez filed the habeas corpus petition on Friday, and the government’s response was due at noon on Tuesday, Adams said. Rather than refuting the claims of due process violations, ICE released Hernandez around midday on Tuesday.
“I am glad that I am home, and I am excited to see my family,” Hernandez said in the statement issued by the legal groups. “I want to give my thanks to everyone — for their prayers, for the rallies, for sharing about what happened to me and the other firefighter. So many people stepped up to help, and now I want to help others just like they helped me.”
The immigration raid last month at the Bear Gulch fire in Washington state sent shockwaves through the wildland fire community. Wildfire veterans say it was a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Hernandez and another firefighter were arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which claimed they were in the country illegally. Federal immigration officials have also falsely claimed that the crews were not firefighters. 
According to Innovation Law Lab, Hernandez has lived on the West Coast since he was 4 years old and worked as a firefighter for the past three years. He applied for a U-visa in 2018, an application that is still pending due to government backlogs. 
“This story just highlights how far astray this whole immigration enforcement regime has gone,” Adams said. “They’re out there in the middle of a disaster zone randomly targeting firefighters. This has nothing to do with community safety, it’s just this message of this war on immigrants.”

Tim Taylor, fifth from right, listen to testimony at a hearing Wednesday, Aug. 27 in Macon. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)
Members of a special House committee talked Tuesday through a multitude of potential solutions to relieve the tax burden facing Missourians.


“The committee’s goal is to find common sense reforms and solutions that will protect homeowners, promote economic stability and share capability,” said Rep. Tim Taylor, R-Bunceton, chair of the Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform.


The committee conducted six hearings in five separate cities across the state this past summer. In the 25 hours of testimony, they heard complaints from residents and local officials related to property tax evaluation and assessment.

Republican members of the committee agreed that there is no “one size fits all” option when it comes to deciding the allocation of taxation at the county level. Taylor noted that 72% of property taxes fund public schools.


In response, Rep. Del Taylor, D-St. Louis, said he wants the state to get involved because it is the buffer when local districts fall short on funding for schools in particular.


Multiple potential solutions were mentioned at the meeting.


Among the proposals was the committee chair’s idea of expanding the ability of districts to institute a sales tax instead of a property tax to fund public schools. Others raised concerns of possible double dipping under that model.

“I would be opposed to anything that allowed any level of governance to double collect taxes,” said Rep. Darin Chappell, R-Rogersville. “I would be absolutely opposed for the opportunity to exist for both methodologies to be active at the same time.”


The committee is faced with navigating 40-year-old bill language to deal with modern assessment and taxation issues. Rep. Rodger Reedy, R-Windsor, laid out the term plainly: “We as legislators have failed to keep up with the times.”


Further complicating the potential for solutions is the Hancock Amendment, enacted in 1980 to limit the amount of money that can be extracted through taxation. A provision in the amendment states that property tax rates have to be adjusted to avoid windfall revenue increases as a result of rapid increases in values.


The amendment is one of the many challenges the committee faces. Members agreed that they had no appetite for attempting to change the Missouri Constitution by seeking to adjust the Hancock Amendment.

“The more I’ve been in this committee, the more I’ve felt that we have got a large sandbox we can play in when it comes to statute. Can we try to play in that sandbox and stay away from the constitution for now?” said Rep. Kathy Steinhoff, D-Columbia.


Both Steinhoff, and Rep. Dean Van Schoiack, R-Savannah, said they felt that the discussion went well and that progress towards a potential bill was made. Both said they anticipate further meetings and discussions that could continue into the start of the legislative session in January.

Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, announced Wednesday he will run for U.S. Senate in 2026, challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Warner. (Photo courtesy of campaign)Virginia state Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, launched his campaign Wednesday for the U.S. Senate, setting up a high-stakes 2026 challenge to three-term Democratic Sen. Mark Warner.
Reeves made his announcement on social media, leaning heavily on his background in the military, law enforcement and the General Assembly.
“I’ll never back down when it comes to protecting Virginia,” Reeves wrote. “From the Army to walking the streets as a cop to the State Senate, I have always put our families first. Now I am running for U.S. Senate to protect our way of life and secure a stronger future.”
Reeves could not immediately be reached by phone Wednesday.
Democrats quickly moved to cast him as out of step with the state. Chris Bolling, executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said Reeves’ campaign is proof Republicans are already looking past this fall’s elections.
“In yet another sign that Republicans have given up on this year’s governor’s race, candidates are starting to announce for elections over a year away,” Bolling said. He dismissed Reeves as “a perennial candidate who is best known for running and losing elections” and argued that his record would weigh him down.
“Now he’s gearing up to lose another by tying himself to (President Donald) Trump’s deeply unpopular agenda of cutting taxes for the richest while attacking Virginians’ health care,” Bolling said. 
He pointed out that Reeves opposed Medicaid expansion in Virginia, which he noted has provided coverage to hundreds of thousands across the commonwealth. “Virginians know Mark Warner delivers results and they won’t trade that for another Trump loyalist looking for a promotion,” Bolling added.
According to his campaign website, Reeves, 58, grew up in modest circumstances, often citing his mother’s advice that education was about service and leadership. He and his brother were the first in their family to attend college, with Reeves earning recognition as a Distinguished Military Graduate from Texas A&M before serving as an Army Ranger and infantry officer.
After leaving the military, Reeves worked as a narcotics detective in Prince William County. He later entered politics, winning a seat in the Virginia Senate in 2011.
Following redistricting, Reeves was elected in 2023 to represent the newly drawn 28th District, which covers Culpeper, Greene, Madison, Orange and Rappahannock counties, as well as portions of Fauquier and Spotsylvania counties.
In the Senate, he serves on the Commerce and Labor, Finance and Appropriations, General Laws and Technology, and Rehabilitation and Social Services committees. He also co-chairs the General Assembly Military and Veterans Caucus and the National Conference of State Legislatures’ Military and Veterans Affairs Task Force.
In recent years, Reeves has pursued legislation on issues ranging from hate crimes to fentanyl trafficking. 
In 2024, he carried a bill to update Virginia’s hate crime statutes to better address rising antisemitism and other forms of ethnic animosity. He also sponsored legislation that classified non-medical fentanyl as a “weapon of terrorism” and pushed for the establishment of a Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Advisory Committee.
Reeves backed economic ties with Taiwan, sponsoring a bill that ultimately led Gov. Glenn Youngkin to order a cost-benefit analysis of opening a Virginia trade office there.
Outside the Capitol, Reeves has cultivated an image as a community volunteer and conservative family man. He lives in Orange County with his two dogs, Ozzy and Gator, and has served as a youth football and lacrosse coach, a Christian deacon and missionary and a mentor.
Reeves says that experience fuels his bid to represent Virginia in Washington. His website portrays him as a fighter who “will lead the fight against the radical left, defend our conservative values, and work with President Trump to deliver real results.”
Warner, a former governor first elected to the Senate in 2008, has not formally announced his reelection bid but is widely expected to run. Seen as a centrist Democrat, Warner — who  served as Virginia’s governor from 2002 to 2006 — has won three consecutive terms, though Republicans view the seat as a potential pickup if national trends break their way.
Reeves is the second Republican to officially declare for the race, after Fairfax County resident Kim Farington announced her bid.

The hub launched with original research from the Possibility Lab, which describes itself as “a team of policy researchers and practitioners who partner with government and community to design and scale data-driven innovations for the public good.”
“Too often, groundbreaking research gets published, placed on a shelf, and forgotten, rarely reaching the policy staff and decision-makers who might benefit from it the most,” said Amy E. Lerman, professor of political science and public policy at UC Berkeley and executive director of the Possibility Lab. The Knowledge Hub will include research reports, data, tools and explainers that meet CalMatters’ standards for quality and accuracy. 
In the first installment of its series, the research team at the UC Berkeley Possibility Lab explores the trade-offs, perspectives, partnerships, and policies that can help California build fast while also building fair, to ensure access to essential goods and services for all state residents, called “People-Centered Policymaking.”
The exclusive launch partnership will enable the Possibility Lab to spotlight new reports from its Abundance Policy Research Consortium, as part of its Abundance Accelerator. The Lab will also release reports related to its partnerships with state departments and agencies focused on its IMPACT Model for civic engagement. The Lab is providing financial support for the launch of the Hub. Researchers from around the state will be invited to share materials through the Hub beginning in Winter 2026.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/01_Home_Main-graphic.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 12:57:57.061825

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)A majority of children in the United States rely on Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program at some point by their 18th birthday, and many experience periods of coverage loss, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal JAMA.
By their 18th birthday, about 3 in 4 children nationwide relied on Medicaid, CHIP (which subsidizes health care for children and pregnant women in families that earn too much for Medicaid), or the subsidized insurance marketplaces established through the 2010 Affordable Care Act — or experienced a period during their childhood without health insurance, the study found.
Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health conducted estimates based on analyses of national data from 2015 to 2019, looking at cumulative coverage rates over the course of childhood.

The study comes as states grapple with federal Medicaid cuts under President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The tax and spending law will reduce Medicaid funding by $1 trillion and cut enrollment by 10 million to 15 million people over the next decade, according to projections by the Congressional Budget Office.
About 42% of children suffered a period of losing health coverage at any point in time by their 18th birthday, the Harvard researchers found, and 61% had at some point enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP. About 78.5% were at some point enrolled in employment-based insurance.
Rates of children who lost insurance coverage were higher in states that hadn’t expanded Medicaid income eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, often known as Obamacare. Roughly 59% of children in non-expansion states had periods without any insurance coverage — compared with 36% in expansion states. Overall, about 2 in 5 children experienced periods without health insurance, the study found.
And states with the strictest income thresholds saw the highest share of kids losing coverage who previously were covered by Medicaid or CHIP at birth.
“Upcoming changes to Medicaid could affect a significant portion of children and worsen already substantial insurance gaps,” senior author Nicolas Menzies,an  associate professor of global health and faculty member in the school’s Center for Health Decision Science, said in a statement. 
“We’re particularly worried about explicit loss of public insurance eligibility for noncitizen children; spillover effects through parental Medicaid coverage losses due to work requirements and more eligibility checks; and state-level cuts to Medicaid.”

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday joined a private prison company in its legal fight with Leavenworth, Kansas, city officials, accusing the city of “aggressive and unlawful” interference with immigration enforcement.
The DOJ filed a statement of interest in the case in U.S. District Court, signed by the assistant U.S. attorney general’s office.
“The United States has a strong interest in countering state and local efforts to harass federal contractors, in the proper application of the Constitution and its Supremacy Clause, and in the foundational principles that protect the Federal Government from unconstitutional state and local interference,” the filing said.
A statement of interest authorizes the U.S. attorney general to become a non-party in a suit pending in any court in the country, the filing said.
CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth have been fighting in court for months over the city’s requirement that CoreCivic go through its development process to receive a special use permit before reopening its prison facility at 100 Highway Terrace.
Nashville-based CoreCivic announced in March that it would reopen the prison facility, which closed in 2021, to house Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees.
CoreCivic and the city have a hearing scheduled Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Topeka as part of an appeal of a Kansas court’s decision barring CoreCivic from housing ICE detainees while the case about the development permit is being heard.
CoreCivic has alleged in multiple filings that Leavenworth officials are violating the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution and interfering with the operations of the federal government. That clause sets federal laws as supreme over state laws.
The U.S. government’s statement Tuesday pushed that argument forward, saying that it is “especially true” in relationship to immigration.
“Defendants have violated the Supremacy Clause by attempting to stymie the Federal Government’s immigration-related operations at 100 Highway Terrace,” the federal filing said, citing multiple cases to support its arguments that federal contractors are free from state control.
“This well-settled principle has been consistently applied to invalidate state and local laws that impose requirements on federal contractors,” the filing said.
The city’s efforts to prevent CoreCivic from housing immigration detainees at its prison, recently renamed the Midwest Regional Reception Center, is an attempt to regulate the federal government’s efforts to house detainees at that facility and violates the supremacy clause, the filing said.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)New Mexico lawmakers on Tuesday had their first chance to press the state Ethics Commission chair about its recent lawsuit alleging state probation officers referred immigrants under their supervision to federal immigration law enforcement.
The lawsuit’s allegations, if true, could violate a law the Legislature passed with a wide margin earlier this year that prohibits state employees from sharing private personal information, including immigration status, with non-state actors, including ICE. The law went into effect July 1.
Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez (D-Albuquerque), a sponsor of the Nondisclosure of Sensitive Personal Information Act, applauded the commission for moving so quickly to enforce a bill she championed. 
“I was outraged that so soon after it was passed, that these probation officials would [allegedly] violate it so blatantly,” she said during the Legislature’s interim Courts and Criminal Justice Committee meeting in Albuquerque, adding that she hopes other law enforcement agencies step up and start investigating similar violations of law that “really put our people in New Mexico at risk of danger.”
The commission alleges probation officers lured at least three immigrants with long ties to New Mexico to their offices under false pretenses for Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainment. The three people have either been deported or remain in ICE custody.

The suit also alleges that probation officers initially began contacting ICE agents to remove “problem probationers” — ones convicted of serious crimes or difficult to supervise — but that recently the practice has extended to “any individual who certain probation officers suspected of having an unlawful presence in the United States,” according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment from a judge that the commission can move forward with a lawsuit against the Corrections Department for its employees’ alleged conduct. The commission writes that a potential conflict may exist with federal laws and is asking the judge to weigh in.
The suit names Corrections Secretary Alisha Tafoya, who has not yet been served with the lawsuit, according to court filings. A spokesperson for her agency previously declined to comment on Source New Mexico’s questions about the lawsuit for that reason. 
Tafoya also declined the committee’s invitation to appear during the hearing Tuesday, according to Chair Sen. Joseph Cervantes (D-Las Cruces).
Jeremy Farris, the commission’s executive director, did appear before the committee, but he said he was largely limited in what he could say, given the ongoing lawsuit. Still, he explained some of the context surrounding the suit, including why the relatively new Ethics Commission is taking the lead.
The commission, first created in 2018 to look into governmental misconduct and election code violations, is also empowered under the NSPI Act to investigate alleged violations, along with local district attorneys or the New Mexico Department of Justice, Farris said. 
So when the commission received a “complaint” recently containing the allegations, commission staff quickly interviewed witnesses, pored over court documents and prepared for an executive session meeting with the bi-partisan commission board to approve the lawsuit.

Farris did not say who filed the complaint or when. 
The commission’s lawsuit prompted Rep. John Block (R-Alamogordo) to suggest the agency  was prioritizing the investigation of deportation of criminals over his and other ethics complaints.
“I’ve filed complaints before, and usually it’s a very lengthy process,” he said. “Usually it goes to some retired judge who looks at it, takes 1,000 years, and then finally will make a determination if it has standing.”
Farris responded that the authority the NSPI Act gave the commission to investigate violations invokes a different process, more akin to the authority that prosecutors have, than the one individuals undertake when asking the commission to rule on potential ethics violations. 
Shortly after the hearing, Block posted on social media, criticizing the commission for using its authority “to fast-track this case because they are apparently angry that three law-breaking criminal aliens are being deferred to federal law enforcement agencies.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0990-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 11:59:38.091438

Here in Vermont, we know access to nature is more than a nicety. We have a responsibility to speak out and make progress from the ground up.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Shelby Semmes and Drew McConville: How Vermonters can lead as Washington backslides on conservation.","This commentary is by Shelby Semmes, of Warren, and Drew McConville, of Montpelier. Semmes is the vice president for the New England Region at the Trust for Public Land. McConville is a senior fellow for conservative policy at the Center for American Progress.


In the shade of towering pines, a dozen Vermonters laughed, chatted and occasionally stood in silent awe as they toured the newest public lands expansion in the Green Mountains in the spring. 
Some came as interested neighbors, some as committed supporters and others — like the two of us — attended as hosts, interpreters and advocates for the important work of protecting America’s parks and forests. Surrounded by people immersed in the wonders of ancient trees and boosted by the adrenaline of a speedy hike, conservation work can feel effortless. 
But in the face of strong headwinds from the White House and Congress, there’s little easy about it today. 
The longstanding reality is that Americans love their public lands. Yet, right now, these treasured places are under threat. Drastic policy proposals and budget cuts mark a troubling departure from our nation’s bipartisan commitment to protecting the lands we share. This comes at a time when climate change impacts are accelerating, biodiversity is declining and too many children lack safe, easy access to nature. 
Here in Vermont, we know access to nature is more than a nicety. We have a responsibility to speak out and make progress from the ground up.
Earlier this summer, Congress nearly sold off millions of acres of national forests and other public lands through the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”. The Senate version of the bill made more than 250 million acres of public lands eligible for mandated land sales — including popular trails, cultural sites and vital wildlife habitat. Only massive public outcry forced lawmakers to back down.
In the meantime, the Trump administration has fired thousands of park staff, foresters, rangers and land managers while proposing a budget that would cut $4 billion from public lands and hand off smaller national park units for states to manage.
They have also proposed cuts to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which would be especially damaging to Vermont. This successful bipartisan program has helped protect significant sections of the Green Mountain National Forest, the Green River Reservoir State Park, and countless local parks and trails like those at the Catamount Community Forest.
These actions are clearly out of step with Americans’ overwhelming support for conservation. A national survey this year found that the vast majority of Americans — Republicans and Democrats alike — oppose selling or shuttering public lands. In fact, they vote consistently to fund conservation initiatives when given the chance, like in 2024, when ballot measures passed in 11 states, generating more than $16 billion in land conservation funds.
This is especially true in Vermont and across the New England region. From the northern tip of Lake Champlain to Long Island Sound, our natural lands are the backbone of our regional identity and economy. These lands filter our drinking water, clean our air and buffer our towns from increasingly dangerous storms and floods. They fuel an outdoor recreation economy that generates $30 billion annually across New England while also supporting our physical and mental well-being.
But these benefits are not guaranteed. If current trends continue, New England could lose 1.2 million acres of forests and farmland over the next four decades. While many enjoy easy access to nature, those benefits are not equitably distributed — particularly across racial and economic lines.
Meeting this moment means speaking out against the bad ideas flowing from Washington. But it also requires proactive steps from states, communities and individuals working together to build on the strong ideas and leadership already emerging across our region.
In Vermont, state leaders have committed to conserve 30% of the state’s lands by 2030, and communities are leaning toward the goal. Recent expansions to the Green Mountain National Forest — like the 500-acre woods we walked near Wallingford in spring — are raising the tally. 
So are new community forests, like the 735-acre shared backyard of the Wolcott Community Forest, which strengthens the town’s natural defenses against floods, delivers outdoor access near the town center and offers destination-worthy trails for economic development. But to meet our conservation targets on schedule, Vermont will need creative funding and financing streams, and an approach that improves daily living for Vermonters while meeting ecological and climate goals.
Across New England, similar momentum is building — but it also needs support. 
Stretching across state lines, the Connecticut River Watershed Partnership is bringing together governmental and non-governmental partners to protect a landscape that delivers drinking water for nearly 5 million people. Meanwhile, our neighbors in Massachusetts are exploring a Nature for All Fund, which could dedicate a portion of an existing tax on sporting goods to parks and conservation — a funding approach at work in both Texas and Georgia.
As the first leaves of autumn turn, people will return to the forests, trails and mountaintops they treasure. These natural havens support public health and happiness, boost businesses, and strengthen climate defenses for communities large and small. 
Whether it’s a town forest in the Northeast Kingdom or a remote stretch of woods in southern Vermont, these places share something in common. They’re available to everyone because, at some point, people worked to protect them. 
Now, in this challenging moment, it’s up to us all to carry that legacy forward with our voices and actions.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers approved draft legislation Tuesday that aims to clarify how legislators respond when a governor vetoes bills after a legislative session concludes.
The move comes after confusion involving a line-item veto from Gov. Kelly Armstrong that prompted legislators to consider a potential special session.
The draft bill, approved by the interim Legislative Procedure and Arrangements Committee, would set the third Wednesday of June as the date for reconvening the Legislature to reconsider a vetoed bill. The decision to reconvene would be made by Legislative Management.
Emily Thompson, director of the legal division of Legislative Council, said lawmakers would not be limited to discussing the vetoes. Legislative Management could still recall the assembly to Bismarck at any time, she said. 
Lawmakers are limited to meeting 80 days every two years. The governor has 15 business days to act on bills after lawmakers adjourn.
The proposed bill also would allow the secretary of the Senate or the chief clerk of the House to request and receive the vetoed bills from the Secretary of State’s Office for reconsideration.
Thompson said the draft legislation addresses a 1991 attorney general’s opinion that stated the Legislature could not act on a governor’s veto after lawmakers adjourn because the Legislature was no longer in possession of the bill. 
North Dakota lawmakers weigh new legislation after governor veto confusion

The committee approved the bill draft unanimously. 
In August, the committee advanced a different bill draft that lawmakers say will prevent conflicts over interpreting a governor’s veto.
The issue arose last May after Armstrong indicated in a veto message he was vetoing $150,000 for a Native American homelessness liaison, but a staff member also crossed out $25 million for affordable housing and $10 million for homelessness in the bill markup. 
That led to a disagreement involving the state’s legislative and executive branches over how to interpret the line-item veto.
The draft legislation indicates that when a governor’s line-item veto message and bill markup conflict, the markup would take precedence over the governor’s message. That’s in contrast to Attorney General Drew Wrigley’s recent opinion that said bill markups are visual images and should not change the substance of a veto.
Both bills drafts will be considered for advancement to the 2027 legislative session by Legislative Management.
The state dollars that were the subject of the veto confusion, $34.85 million, were dispersed to the North Dakota Housing Finance Agency on July 1.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)WURTLAND  — Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie says he will soon have the 218 signatures needed to force a U.S. House vote on releasing federal investigation files on convicted sex offender and financier Jeffery Epstein.
Massie, who has led the crusade to release the files much to the ire of Republican President Donald Trump, spoke about his discharge petition during a community forum in rural northeastern Kentucky. He said the results of the special House election in Arizona Tuesday night ensure the petition will receive support from the required number of U.S. House members.
“Both of the candidates on the ballot promised to sign my discharge petition,” Massie said. “And one of them won, obviously, and so now we’re going to have 218 signatures, and we’re going to force a vote on releasing those files.”
The winner of the special election was Democratic candidate Adelita Grijalva.
Earlier this month, Massie appeared with victims of Epstein who supported the release of the files. 
House Republican leaders oppose Massie’s efforts and are backing an investigation by the House Oversight Committee, which is chaired by another Kentucky Republican, U.S. Rep. James Comer.
Massie told reporters after the forum that D.C. leaders are “in full panic” following the election. He also added that they politically “threatened” Republican co-signers of the petition.

If Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson tries to use “some special parliamentary procedure” to stall the petition, Massie said it also would require 218 votes. 
“And if you participate in that vote to sideline the discharge petition, now you’re part of the coverup. So, they’re going to have a vote. I think they’re coming to terms with that,” Massie said.
He added: “And I’m going to bet the speaker is probably going to hand out hall passes to some congressmen, because this is an 80-20 issue. He may be advising some of the members of the Republican Party to vote for my discharge petition.”
Epstein’s death in federal custody in 2019 was ruled a suicide, although many Trump supporters have speculated that he was murdered to keep him from revealing embarrassing information about prominent people. Trump fueled speculation about Epstein’s death during his 2020 campaign. In 2024, Trump said he would declassify the Epstein records if returned to the presidency.
Trump has previously vowed to find a candidate to oust Massie in the Republican primary for Kentucky 4th Congressional District. The area has become a stronghold for Republicans who back Massie, but has also voted for Trump in presidential elections. 
Massie appeared at the Greenup County stop with Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul. The two are traveling the district Wednesday and Thursday for a mix of official and campaign events. 
Paul told reporters that some members of Congress may vote to object to changing the rules, not just on the petition. 
“So, I think you actually might get even more of a groundswell if he tries to turn off the discharge petition,” Paul said of possible efforts by House Speaker Johnson.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5239-1024x811.jpg,,,2025-09-24 10:58:25.078250

(Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)The American Civil Liberties Union of Maine filed a class action lawsuit on Monday challenging the denial of bond hearings to people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
This lawsuit comes after a federal judge ruled on Sept. 19 in favor of a man unlawfully detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in Maine. The ACLU of Maine had filed a habeas petition on behalf of the man, who is the organization’s client.  
Now, the ACLU of Maine is seeking relief for others in similar situations.
“Indefinitely detaining people and separating them from their families, communities, and jobs is not only cruel – it’s against the law,” Max Brooks, an immigration attorney with the ACLU of Maine, said in a statement Tuesday. “Millions of people who have been waiting for their day in court are now at risk of being jailed indefinitely over civil violations.”
The recent ruling 
While a preliminary victory, the federal court for the District of Maine ruling in Petitioner v. Stamper et. al. on Sept. 19 indicates that this man’s, and perhaps others’, claims could eventually prevail in court. 
The court granted the ACLU of Maine’s request for emergency relief, therefore blocking the federal government from transferring the man out of Maine. But the judge also concluded that he is likely to prevail on his claims that his due process rights were violated.
According to the ACLU, the man was transported over 200 miles and detained in Fort Fairfield after local police arrested him near Waterville and transferred him into CBP custody. He was denied contact with his family or legal counsel for nine days, according to the lawsuit. 
The lawsuit alleges CBP violated his due process rights by denying him the opportunity for a bond hearing, as required under federal law.
The new case
The class action lawsuit, Orellana v. Moriz, similarly alleges that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice has misclassified people arrested by ICE and denied those people of their right to a bond hearing.
Attorneys blocked from routine ICE check-ins in Maine, Pingree says

Along with the ACLU of Maine, the ACLU of Massachusetts, ACLU of New Hampshire, law firm Araujo and Fisher, law firm Foley Hoag and the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. 
These groups argue the federal government’s recent actions have upended decades of settled law and established practice in immigration proceedings. District courts in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York have already concluded such violations in similar cases. 
The lawsuit cites federal statute that stipulates people arrested inside the U.S. while their immigration cases proceed are entitled to bond hearings before an immigration judge unless they are deemed a threat to public safety or a flight risk. 
In 2022, however, the immigration court in Tacoma, Washington, began misclassifying people in that scenario as “mandatory detainees” under another statute, which covers people stopped at the border or ports of entry who can be held without bond hearings.
In April, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington ruled that this practice was likely illegal and ordered a bond hearing for a wrongfully detained litigant. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security started asking immigration judges to deny bond hearings in July 2025. Earlier this month, the Board of Immigration Appeals, a Justice Department body that reviews immigration court decisions, issued a precedential decision that made that new policy binding on all immigration decisions.  
“This statute has never been applied to people arrested in the interior of the United States and placed in removal proceedings, and this practice blatantly goes against its plain language,” Brooks said in a statement. “However, CBP and ICE have begun indefinitely jailing people who are undergoing civil immigration proceedings that can take months or years. This is a clear violation of the due process rights of immigrants as outlined by federal law.”

Historically, nothing else comes close.","With apologies to all the rest, the best and most meaningful college football rivalry involving a Mississippi team has been the one that matches Ole Miss against LSU. Historically, nothing else comes close.
The two teams play again Saturday at Oxford. Both are undefeated. Both have looked like FBS playoff teams. LSU is ranked No. 4, and Ole Miss is ranked No. 13. Surprisingly, at least to this column, Ole Miss is favored, albeit by the slimmest of margins.

Rick Cleveland
I have covered probably 30 Ole Miss-LSU games in person, but my introduction to the rivalry was not in person or even on TV. No, it came on Halloween night, 66 years ago. LSU was ranked No. 1, Ole Miss No. 3. My father and I listened to the radio at our kitchen table with a yellow formica top on 26th Avenue in Hattiesburg. Our beige Philco radio was tuned to 870 AM, WWL in New Orleans. As was usually was the case at night, WWL came in loud and clear. LSU broadcaster J.C. Politz was on the call.
Ole Miss led 3-0 when Jake Gibbs punted late in the fourth quarter. We heard Politz say Billy Cannon gathered in the punt on a bounce at his own 11-yard line. We heard Politz say Cannon stumbled momentarily at the 20. And then, we couldn’t hear anything Politz said. All we could hear was the roar of the crowd. But, even at age 7, I knew what was happening.
The rest is college football lore. Cannon broke several tackles en route to an 89-yard touchdown. It won the game for LSU and the Heisman Trophy for Cannon. It cost the greatest football team in Mississippi history the outright national championship. Ole Miss absolutely dominated the game, except on the scoreboard. The Rebels gained 19 first downs and 363 yards to six first downs and 74 yards total for LSU. In a Sugar Bowl rematch, Ole Miss hammered LSU 21-0. If not for Cannon’s punt return, that Ole Miss team probably would be remembered as the greatest college football team of all time. Those Rebels outscored 11 opponents, including mighty LSU twice, 349-21
Fifty-four years later, in 2013, Cannon and his LSU coach, Paul Dietzel, attended a meeting of the Jackson Touchdown Club. Also in attendance were several of the ’59 Ole Miss Rebels. Beforehand, Cannon and Dietzel posed for a Clarion Ledger photographer while the former Ole Miss players stood off to the side and watched. And then Marvin Terrell, the biggest and strongest of all the ’59 Rebels, brought down the house when he bellowed, “Hey Billy, come try to run through us now.”
Wisely, Cannon declined.

The LSU-Ole Miss series has provided so many more poignant memories, though few with the national ramifications of that ’59 game. The last three Ole Miss-LSU games have ended with the home crowd storming the field The last two meetings have been especially memorable.
Two years ago at Oxford, Ole Miss overcame a 42-34 fourth quarter deficit to win 55-49 in a duel of fantastic quarterbacks Jayden Daniels and Jaxson Dart. As of today, both Daniels and Dart are starting NFL quarterbacks. Last year, at Baton Rouge, Garrett Nussmeier rallied No. 13 LSU to a 29-26 overtime victory over Dart and the No. 9 Rebels. My guess: Nussmeier, as well, will one day start at quarterback in the NFL.
My most memorable in-person Ole Miss-LSU game? There have been so many, but I’d have to go with the 1997 meeting when unranked Ole Miss stunned No. 8 LSU 36-21 behind a heroic performance from previously unsung quarterback Stewart Patridge. Remember?
If you were there at Tiger Stadium that sunny, breezy afternoon, you haven’t forgotten. A week earlier, LSU had knocked No. 1 and undefeated Florida, coached by Steve Spurrier. Ole Miss had lost two of its first five games by double digits. There was nothing to suggest heavily favored LSU wouldn’t wipe the field with Tommy Tuberville’s Rebels, still reeling from NCAA probation and with only 68 players on scholarship.
Patridge, who would win the Conerly Trophy that season, had transferred to Ole Miss from Mississippi Delta Junior College and had not become the Rebels’ starter until late in his junior season. But that October afternoon in Baton Rouge, Patridge was remarkable. Checking off about every other play against the constantly blitzing LSU defense, Patridge, both resourceful and accurate, threw for 346 yards and two touchdowns. He picked LSU apart is what he did. Time and time again, he hit key third down passes to extend drives and keep the Tigers’ offense off the field.
By game’s end, much of the LSU crowd had exited. In the southeast corner of the Tiger Stadium end zone, about 3,000 Ole Miss had-to-be-hoarse fans stayed and Hotty Toddied long, long after the final horn sounded.

As we boost supply, how can we ensure it reaches everyone?","Too many Californians are struggling: in a recent survey we conducted at UC Berkeley’s Possibility Lab, 71% of voters say it’s difficult to find housing within their price range, while nearly half struggle to find good local jobs (45%), low-cost healthy food (47%), or affordable eldercare (59%).
Despite the tremendous resources available, and California’s standing as the fourth largest economy in the world, our state has a scarcity problem. Whether we’re talking about housing, well-paying jobs, childcare or eldercare, it feels to many like there just isn’t enough to go around. 

Read the Brief: Californians’ Experiences Accessing Basic Resources
One potential solution generating considerable buzz is the Abundance Agenda, with the core belief that if we can just increase the overall supply of everything – housing, clean energy, education – then everyone is automatically going to be better off. And not just building more, but building faster by removing the bureaucratic barriers and red tape that slow projects down. It’s a “rising tide lifts all boats” approach.
Abundance cannot only be about producing more; it must be about producing better, together.
While this emphasis on speed and efficiency sounds appealing, our research suggests that implementation reveals a crucial blindspot. The real challenge isn’t whether to build more—it’s ensuring that the increased supply of essential goods and services actually improves life for the maximum number of Californians. To achieve these goals, we need a new model of people-centered policymaking.


Read the Report: People-Centered Abundance Framework
Through this research series, we’ll explore the critical yet missing component in this vision of abundance: the people who will make it possible.

Working with communities to design solutions that work for them, in the places they live 
Working with labor, including streamlining opportunities and creating incentives for essential job training
And working with the people in government who will help deliver goods and services that benefit us all.

While Californians urgently need a future with access to the essentials for a quality life, we cannot ignore the questions of who builds this future and who benefits from it. Sustainable abundance requires not only removing barriers to building, but actively creating pathways for communities to participate in, and benefit from, that growth.
We believe building fast can be coupled with building fair, and our research explores how to make this possible.
In this research series, we’ll describe data that explores the tradeoffs inherent in balancing ‘building fast’ with ‘building fair’ across the care economy, labor and workforce, and the built infrastructure. We’ll offer new research on how communities can provide input while keeping processes moving forward, and shifting influence away from special interests towards the social good. We’ll consider the types of partnerships, policies, and perspectives that can advance these goals. And, finally, we’ll offer a starting point for evidence-based and community-informed policy reforms that enable us to ‘build more’ in ways that allow all Californians to share in the state’s abundant resources.
The stakes are high. Housing costs continue to outpace wages across the state, and one in five Californians can’t afford to put food on their table. 
Without intentional action, new policies could simply reproduce existing inequalities at a larger scale. But done well, California’s push for reforms could become a model for how we can meet people’s basic needs while expanding opportunity for everyone. 
The path forward requires acknowledging that true abundance isn’t just about quantity; it’s about creating systems that work for all Californians: across rural and urban communities, across economic sectors, across private and public entities. Only then will the rising tide truly lift all boats.

Mike Dunleavy discusses his new proposed omnibus education legislation at a news conference on Jan. 31, 2025. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy on Monday vetoed Senate Bill 54, a bill that sought to extend and expand the duties of the State Board of Registration for Architects, Engineers and Land Surveyors, including licensing interior designers.
Sen. Matt Claman, D-Anchorage and the bill’s sponsor, said he learned of the veto Tuesday and said it could come up for a possible override vote in January, when lawmakers convene for the regular session.
As written, SB 54 would have allowed interior designers to register with the board, enabling their work on large, public-use projects to be submitted to permitting agencies without an engineering review. 
In his veto message, the governor said the bill does not define “interior design,” and said “there is no public safety rationale for creating a new title and bureaucracy. The expansion increases cost and confusion without a demonstrated benefit.”
Claman said the bill deliberately left the definition of “interior design” to the board as part of a legislative compromise.
The governor also offered two other reasons for his veto, saying that one section could eliminate the state’s ability to select contractors on price, and that another section could require residential wastewater work to be done by licensed professional engineers, increasing costs for housing.
Claman said the governor’s reasoning appears to be based on different legal interpretations than ones he relied upon when drafting the bill.
“Obviously, I was very disappointed,” he said of the governor’s veto. “I can’t say I was expecting it, but I just wasn’t sure where the governor was.”
The governor’s veto of SB 54 is his eighth veto of a policy bill so far this year. Two of those vetoes have been overridden. While the number of vetoes is low in absolute terms, it represents a record-high percentage of vetoed bills. 
Lawmakers passed 33 bills through both House and Senate this year, meaning the governor has vetoed almost a quarter of all passed bills. No other governor has come close to that veto rate.
One bill remains pending on the governor’s desk. That’s Senate Bill 113, which would boost vocational-technical education and student reading programs with proceeds from a revised state corporate income tax. 
The governor has previously expressed skepticism of the bill, and at a news conference in May, he implied he would veto it. That was before lawmakers overrode his veto of a separate bill that allocates funding from SB 113 to education projects. 
Dunleavy has until Oct. 1 to decide whether to veto it, sign it, or allow it to become law without signature.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents approved a proposal from Kansas State University to work with Cowley County Community College to offer an associate degree in milling science after opposition from community and technical colleges threatened to derail the initiative.
Kansas State administrators sought permission to make use of its extensive milling science infrastructure and faculty to develop their own 60 credit-hour degree in the subject. The idea of an online alternative to K-State’s 120-credit program — the only bachelor’s degree in milling science in the United States — was endorsed by Cargill, Seaboard Foods, Hill’s Pet Nutrition and several trade associations.
“The proposal reflects our land-grant mission,” said Jesse Perez Mendez, the provost at K-State. “The demand for skilled professionals in supervisory, operational and technical roles in milling, baking, feed and pet food is significant.”
However, Kansas’ two-year community and technical colleges raised objections to the original proposal by K-State to invade their academic domain by single-handedly launching an associate degree.
“The community and technical college’s mission is squarely in the area that K-State is trying to stray,” said Heather Morgan, executive director of the Kansas Association of Community Colleges. “This situation will impact the trust between the colleges and K-State in future potential partnerships.”
Samantha Christy-Dangermond, chair of the Kansas Postsecondary Technical Education Board, likewise challenged K-State’s proposal for its associate degree in milling. She pointed to Board of Regents policy discouraging state universities from offering associate degrees in academic or technical programs where a baccalaureate existed. K-State offers four bachelor’s degrees in grain science and industry, she said.
Subsequently, K-State put together a cooperative agreement with Cowley County Community College to jointly offer the associate degree. Under the arrangement, Cowley County students would be able to apply certificate credits toward the associate degree at K-State.
It was enough to convince the Board of Regents last week to endorse the academic program.
“I think the collaboration is very important,” said Alysia Johnston, a member of the Board of Regents. “It strengthens your program and certainly strengthens the ability of students to be able to have a seamless path, and also helps business and industry.”
The curriculum would accommodate industry professionals seeking to earn a degree online while maintaining their job and would serve traditional students aiming to complete a two-year technical degree before entering the food manufacturing or grain processing workforce.
A collection of agriculture companies and lobbying organizations offered support for K-State’s campaign to create the associate degree in Kansas.
“By offering this targeted training, current and future employees will be able to bring expertise to mills throughout Kansas, reflective of the state’s position as a grain production leader,” said Nicholas Rozzi, vice president of product development at Hill’s Pet Nutrition in Topeka.
Not every supervisory or management position at food and feed production facilities required the traditional four-year college degree, said Scott Eilert, a vice president at Cargill Protein and Salt.
He said an online associate degree would better fit the life circumstance of milling employees unable to devote themselves to a degree program that could take four years or more to finish.
Jane DeMarchi, president of the North American Millers’ Association, said the organization supported the existing four-year milling degree at K-State but was convinced the secondary credential would add to the employee pipeline for companies processing wheat, corn, oats or rye into flour.
“Our hope is that current working employees will be able to advance their careers by earning an AAS degree while working full-time,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mullinville-elevator-on-us54-copy-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-24 09:58:04.122682

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
California homeowners who fireproof their homes would get guaranteed insurance coverage under a ballot measure filed this week by Consumer Watchdog.
The consumer advocacy group filed the initiative in response to a competing measure that seeks to repeal Proposition 103, which Watchdog’s founder wrote in the late 1980s and now governs property insurance in the state. If the repeal effort filed by an independent insurance agent in August moves forward, Consumer Watchdog will charge ahead as well.

Jamie Court, Consumer Watchdog president: “If she goes, we go. If we get flooded with donations, we may go anyway.”

Any initiative for the 2026 ballot needs more than 500,000 signatures, which can be costly to collect.
Under the measure, insurers that refuse to sell policies to property owners who meet fire mitigation guidelines would be barred from the home and auto insurance market in California for five years — which could affect availability. It would also require insurers to tell homeowners why their policies aren’t getting renewed, and give them time to make improvements. 
Court said his group may push for the policyholder “bill of rights” anyway, depending on timing and funding.
More on insurance: Levi also reports on new rules California’s insurance chief Ricardo Lara is proposing for reviewing insurance rates. Some of the rules include imposing new timelines and guidelines for intervenors (a member of the public, including Consumer Watchdog, who can challenge an insurer’s rate request), and stricter requirements for intervenors to get compensated for their work.
Lara says his proposals aim to make the rate-review process more efficient. But Consumer Watchdog argues the rules are in retaliation against the group — making it harder for it and other consumer advocacy organizations to be compensated when they challenge rates. It could also result in premium rates rising at a faster pace.

Newsom helps cannabis industry

After more than two months since an excise tax on legal cannabis increased, Gov. Gavin Newsom handed the cannabis industry a win Monday, signing into law a measure to roll back that tax, writes CalMatters’ Nadia Lathan.
The excise tax is paid by marijuana companies and imposed by the state before sales taxes are applied. The new law suspends a 19% increase that was initially instituted in July, and temporarily reverts the excise tax to 15% until 2028. The move aims to help the beleaguered cannabis industry, which proponents say are operating under slim margins and slumping sales.

Assemblymember Matt Haney, a San Francisco Democrat and bill author, in a statement: “California’s cannabis economy can bring enormous benefits to our state, but only if our legal industry is given a fair chance to compete against the untaxed and unregulated illegal market.”

Nonprofits that receive grants through the tax, however, argued that the bill would threaten services for low-income children, substance abuse programs and more.

CA makes progress on homelessness, but faces funding cuts

Homelessness rates are decreasing in some California counties, but cuts in funding could soon undo this progress, say experts and advocates.
As CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall explains, of the 29 places in California that conducted a point-in-time count at the start of the year, more than half reported a decrease in their homelessness populations compared to 2024. 
Keeping in mind that point-in-time counts are imperfect, rough estimates of homelessness populations, Contra Costa and Sonoma counties reported a drop in their populations by a quarter; and San Diego and Los Angeles counties each saw a decrease of less than 10%.
But in a tough budget year, organizations are bracing for cuts to homelessness funding from the state and some local jurisdictions. President Donald Trump’s administration this month also imposed new criteria that block some organizations, including those in California, from accessing $75 million in federal homeless housing funds.
Organizations are already feeling the cuts: L.A. County’s Union Station Homeless Services denied more than 700 families who needed housing from December through July. Downtown Streets Team, which has helped unhoused people in California for more than two decades, also plans to close next month.

Minneapolis parents spent nearly $700 on back-to-school shopping this year, which is well above the national average. For many families, that number represents a real strain. 
And yet, even those sacrifices don’t guarantee that students return to well-equipped classrooms.
I recently shared a video on social media of an empty classroom waiting for a brand-new teacher. The image was stark: upside-down desks and chairs in a blank white room — nothing to suggest young children would soon be asked to learn, grow and thrive there. The video went viral. Thousands of parents, educators and even a few celebrities weighed in. 
The conversation brought into focus a hard truth: In Minneapolis, especially on the Northside, new teachers are disproportionately concentrated in schools already facing the steepest challenges, and those schools are also lacking critical resources.
Every August, I count myself lucky to join educators as they prepare classrooms for the year ahead. Together, we hang colorful posters, create cozy reading corners, and transform bare rooms into welcoming spaces. 
But I also see the toll. Teachers pour enormous time, energy and money into creating these environments, often from their own pockets. Most spend years curating libraries, scouring thrift shops, or asking friends and family to chip in.
So what happens when a school hosts multiple brand-new educators year after year? 
Who equips classrooms that start the year without an assigned teacher? 
Who provides resources at schools without PTAs that routinely give teachers hundreds of dollars to spend however they see fit?
Some argue this is the responsibility of parents, not schools or teachers. But that argument falls apart in practice. Families in under-resourced schools are already stretched thin. Expecting parents to fund classrooms out of pocket simply entrenches inequity. 
In wealthier neighborhoods, families may be able to provide that support, but tying the quality of a child’s education to their zip code or household income is the very definition of injustice.
And let’s be clear: This is not accidental. It is a pattern that has persisted for far too long. Year after year, families at schools made up of predominately Black, Indigenous, and other students of color send their children to classrooms with the newest educators in the district, the most staff vacancies, and the fewest resources. 
Veteran teachers remain clustered elsewhere. 
Ask most Minneapolis Public School teachers where they started their careers, and they’re likely to name a Northside school.
The consequences are predictable. Students who already face opportunity gaps are less likely to benefit from seasoned educators who know how to differentiate instruction. Meanwhile, wealthier, whiter neighborhoods begin each year with stability and continuity.
New teachers are not the problem. They bring energy, creativity and commitment. Every educator is new at some point. But they deserve the chance to grow alongside veteran colleagues, not to shoulder entire classrooms on their own. And no set of schools or students should serve as de facto training grounds for early-career educators.
Every child deserves access to the highest-quality education our district can offer, led by teachers who are supported to stay and thrive. School districts that listen to students and parents know this. 
We have no shortage of solutions to incentivize stability in high-turnover schools. Bonuses, loan forgiveness, housing stipends and robust mentorship programs could make Northside schools destinations for talented teachers rather than revolving doors.
Back-to-school should be a season of hope and possibility for every student. Until we tackle this inequity head-on, too many Northside families will face the same painful cycle: new year, new teachers, bare classrooms, same systemic injustice.

Experts worry liberal California will be blacklisted from federal homelessness dollars, effectively counteracting recent progress. 


California counties are reporting decreases in homelessness, suggesting the state is finally making progress in solving one of its most difficult and persistent problems.
But even as Gov. Gavin Newsom and local officials are celebrating, the money that made those wins possible is at risk of evaporating. 
President Donald Trump’s administration this month tried to block organizations that don’t support its social agenda from accessing federal homeless housing funds — causing experts in the field to worry that politically liberal California could find itself blacklisted from crucial dollars.
Cuts to state homelessness funding are also on the horizon, and some local jurisdictions are pulling back funds as they struggle with their own budget deficits. That has counties, nonprofits and industry experts worried California’s homeless counts will soon go right back up.
“I do think that we’re doing something right,” Sharon Rapport, director of California state policy for the Corporation for Supportive Housing, said of the recent decreases. “That all may come to a crashing end with a lot of concerns with what’s happening at the federal level, federal policy changing and funding cuts happening.”
Of the 29 places in California that reported an official homeless census this year, more than half saw a decrease compared to 2024, according to an analysis of point-in-time counts by the Hub for Urban Initiatives. That includes drops of about a quarter in Contra Costa and Sonoma counties, 20% in Santa Cruz County, 16% in Ventura County and 14% in Merced County. 
San Diego and Los Angeles counties each saw a decrease of less than 10%. For LA County, this marks the second year in a row that homelessness is down.
But funding worries loom like a black cloud over those promising results. As purse strings tighten, service providers will have to cut staff, programs and bed capacity, meaning they can help fewer homeless people. For years, California cities, counties and nonprofits have been pushing the Newsom administration to provide an ongoing source of homeless funding, so service providers can plan ahead without worrying each year about how much money they’ll get.
Some organizations already are feeling the squeeze. 
From December through July, Union Station Homeless Services in Los Angeles County turned away 700 families who needed housing, said CEO Katie Hill. 
“We just don’t have anything available for them,” Hill said.
The county cut housing vouchers as the city and county struggled with financial fallout from recent wildfires, falling property tax revenues and increasing legal payouts.
Other organizations are closing their doors for good. Downtown Streets Team, which helps unhoused residents in 16 California cities find housing while earning money cleaning up local streets, plans to close next month after two decades of service. 
“The financial and political environment we operate in has shifted dramatically in recent months,” CEO Julie Gardner said in an emailed statement. “During this time, (Downtown Streets Team) lost several significant contracts and grants, creating a multi-million-dollar loss in overall funding. When combined with other factors, including rapidly rising operational costs, these losses made it impossible to continue running the organization in a financially sustainable way.”
‘I just don’t think we’re going to see that funding’
Congress in 2023 appropriated $75 million for something called the Continuum of Care Builds grant, which was supposed to help support the construction of new homeless housing. Former President Joe Biden’s administration started the application process for those grants in 2024. When Trump took the helm in 2025, his administration re-started the process with new criteria, making applicants apply again.
Then, at the start of September, the Trump administration made everyone apply a third time — with a very different set of criteria seeming to disqualify organizations that support trans clients, use “harm reduction” strategies to prevent drug overdose deaths or operate in a “sanctuary city.”
Applicants had to attest that they don’t deny the “sex binary in humans or promote the notion that sex is a chosen or mutable characteristic.” They had to promise not to distribute drug paraphernalia or allow the use of drugs on their property. 
“I do think that we’re doing something right. That all may come to a crashing end.”Sharon Rapport, director, California state policy for the Corporation for Supportive Housing
Applicants also had to attest that they operate in a city, county or state that cooperates with federal immigration enforcement. Newsom has resisted Trump’s immigration crackdown at a state level, and recently signed a set of bills intended to further check ICE.
And applicants were required to operate in a city, county or state that prohibits public camping and enforces that rule. That one could be an easier lift: Arrests and citations for camping-related activities have soared in some California cities over the past year, after the U.S. Supreme Court gave cities more leeway to crack down, and Newsom encouraged cities to ban camping. But two recent statewide attempts to ban homeless camps from near schools and other areas fell flat.
The new funding rules were a major blow to Contra Costa County-based Hope Solutions, which was initially selected to receive $5.5 million to build 15 tiny homes for homeless 18-24-year-olds in Pittsburg. After staff spent at least 100 hours completing the project proposal, they learned this month that they’d no longer qualify because of the new criteria. The Pittsburg Police Department says it does not participate in immigration enforcement. In addition, the new program rules specify the money must go to buildings that serve elderly residents — an about-face that takes Hope Solutions’ youth project out of the running.
“It felt like a gut punch,” said CEO Deanne Pearn, “and really disheartening to know that we had spent so much time and asked so much of our county partners and others, and that that time could have been spent elsewhere.”

Hope Solutions is still moving forward with the project, which Pearn hopes the organization can fund with its own financial reserves. But that means the nonprofit won’t have that money for its next project.
The National Alliance to End Homelessness recently sued the Trump administration over the new grant conditions, claiming that all projects in California and three dozen other states would be ineligible for funds. Earlier this month, a federal judge sided with the Alliance, and temporarily barred the federal government from distributing those funds. 
Now, that $75 million is frozen as the case moves forward.
While the new conditions at issue in the lawsuit apply only to one specific federal homelessness grant, experts worry it’s an ominous sign for California. Service providers expect applications to open this fall for the main source of federal homelessness funding — the Continuum of Care Program — which funneled about $600 million to California counties in 2023. 
If that application poses similar requirements, California could be in trouble.
“Personally, I just don’t think we’re going to see that funding,” said Hill, of Union Station Homeless Services in Los Angeles County. 
In a separate lawsuit, San Francisco and Santa Clara Counties sued the Trump administration over contracts that prevented recipients of federal homeless funds from using the money to promote “gender ideology,” “elective abortions” and “illegal immigration.” The counties won an early victory last month, when a judge temporarily blocked the administration from imposing those conditions. 
Other federal cuts are looming, too. The Emergency Housing Vouchers program, which launched during the COVID-19 pandemic and now helps more than 15,000 Californians pay their rent, is expected to run out of money next year. 
That’s not even counting the cuts to housing vouchers and other federal housing and homelessness programs Trump proposed in May, which are still being negotiated in Congress. 
California turning a corner on homelessness
California appears to be decreasing its homeless population, according to the Hub for Urban Initiatives, a California organization that helps local communities shape their homelessness policy, apply for grants and survey their homeless populations.
The 29 California communities that counted and reported their homeless populations this year tallied a total of 131,209 people — a 4% decrease from what those same communities reported last year. That’s a significant step for a state where the homeless population has been stubbornly rising for years.
That data comes from the federally mandated homeless point-in-time count, where teams of volunteers count the unhoused people they see on the street on one night in January. The counts are imperfect, as volunteers can overlook people sleeping in out-of-the-way places, and different counties use different methods — while some places count every year, others count every other. Of the 44 “continuums of care” required to count in California (some small, rural communities combine multiple counties into one continuum of care), 14 didn’t count this year.
The federal housing department will release an official total for the state later this year.
Newsom trumpeted the initial decreases, taking credit for pouring money into homeless housing and other services. He’s not wrong. 
Contra Costa County, which saw the state’s biggest drop in homelessness this year, attributes its success largely to the recent boost in state funding, said Christy Saxton, director of Health, Housing and Homeless Services for Contra Costa County. Over the past two years, the county increased its homeless shelter and housing capacity by more than a third.
A big piece of that was the Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention program, which Newsom launched in the 2019-20 budget year to fill what until then had been a void of state homelessness funds. For the past few years, that program gave cities and counties $1 billion each year. 
Those funds support programs such as Contra Costa County’s Delta Landing temporary housing site in Pittsburg, which opened 172 units in 2021. Until then, that part of the county had about 20 beds for its unhoused residents, Saxton said.
But instead of making that state funding ongoing, Newsom’s administration opted to dole it out in one-time grants each year, leaving cities and counties continually guessing what next year’s budget will bring. 
This year, that state program will get no new funding (because of the glacial pace at which the state distributes these funds, cities and counties have yet to receive money from the last round). Next year, the amount is set to shrink to $500 million.
“We are significantly concerned about the cuts that are coming,” Saxton said, “because it has taken an influx of money in order to see those decreases, and we need that to continue on now more than ever.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/081524_Migrant-Encampment_AH_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 08:57:22.396010

Stanford Chatfield
Stanford Chatfield is an historical interpreter at Alcatraz for the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy. He was incarcerated 35 years.


At 69 years old, I wake up every morning excited to go to work as an historical interpreter at Alcatraz. I leave home each day with a huge smile on my face, knowing I’ll meet people from around the world and share the complex history of this island. 
It’s meaningful work that values my perspective — including the 35 years I spent behind bars in a state penitentiary.
Though I’ve made progress since my release last year from the Correctional Training Facility in Monterey County, I’ve fallen far behind others my age. My peers have built retirement savings and Social Security credits during their prime earning years, while I was working in prison making 28 cents an hour.
While I served time, I worked as a college enrollment clerk, coordinating and organizing course materials for incarcerated students and staff. I loved the work. The pay? Not so much. When I was released, I was broke and bewildered.
California’s reentry system, like its incarceration system, is broken. The state invests too little in inmates — paying them pennies for their work — and not enough in effective programs that help them reenter society. 
In one year the state spends a staggering $133,000 to incarcerate one person — more than twice the University of Southern California’s tuition. Though about 40,000 people come home from prison each year, nearly half end up back behind bars within three years. 
This endless cycle drains taxpayer resources without improving public safety.
While incarcerated, I was one of the top earners; many guys there were making just 8 cents an hour. They should be paid at least minimum wage and be given opportunities for advancement. 
When I got out, I could have easily fallen through the cracks. For the longest time I didn’t know what my purpose was, but I made a commitment to honesty and integrity in all my affairs.
I’m starting over with a decades-old criminal record. The odds weren’t in my favor — until Creating Restorative Opportunities and Programs, or CROP, accepted me into Ready 4 Life, a year-long fellowship. It offered me job training and dignity. I developed technical skills and a positive mindset. 
About 95% of CROP participants don’t reoffend. Yet CROP’s future is uncertain. Given the ups and downs of the state budget, programs like CROP don’t always get steady investment.
I chose to train in UX (user experience) design for developing websites and computer apps, because technology had passed me by during my incarcerated years. Just learning those digital foundations opened doors I never imagined, even for my Alcatraz job.

The program’s real value came from the connections I made, including some formerly incarcerated individuals who had succeeded and some business leaders. 
When CROP’s employment specialist found a job posting for an assistant tour guide at Alcatraz, I took a leap of faith. In my cover letter, I wrote: “I’m a formerly incarcerated individual, and I believe I can bring a unique and valuable perspective to this position.”
It worked. During my interview on a rainy day, they told me to explore the island while they decided. My phone rang an hour later. “Are you still here? We want you,” they said.
I knew my life had truly changed. What started as seasonal work became permanent. Now I interpret Alcatraz’s history and support myself on about $25 an hour, and my experience gives me credibility that can’t be taught.
Thanks to CROP and employers willing to see beyond my record, I’m doing meaningful work that values my whole story. That’s what the dignity of work should look like for everyone coming home.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/072623_San-Quentin_SN_CM_39.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 08:57:22.396010
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-24 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Hartford doula training targets gaps in care for Spanish speakers,Mariana Navarrete Villegas and Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/24/doula-training-hartford-spanish-hispanic-health-council/,The Hispanic Health Council's doula program is conducted entirely in Spanish and aims to address a maternal health gap in Hartford.,"On a Friday morning in early September, a group of women sit cross-legged facing small candles and flowers in a softly-lit birth training room in Hartford. Six of the women form a circle around a pregnant woman, who is just a month away from giving birth.
The group is there for a ceremony meant to transmit feelings of peace and safety to the mother-to-be. Zaza Robles, a 35-year-old Hartford resident who is originally from Peru, leads the meditation. She asks the other participants to take deep, slow breaths and repeat affirmations for the guest of honor.
Robles, who was an obstetrician in Peru for eight years, and the other five women forming the circle are doulas-in-training at the community doula program, run by the Hispanic Health Council, or HHC, and funded by the Connecticut Health Foundation and Hartford HealthCare. 
The training is conducted entirely in Spanish, and aims to address a major maternal health gap in a city where over half of residents who give birth are Hispanic, according to the latest report from the state Department of Public Health.

A doula’s work consists of educating, informing and guiding the person who is or will get pregnant. They do not provide medical services. As a doula, one can specialize in prenatal care, labor and postpartum care, or all three.
“The doulas coming out of this program can be the ones advocating for the Spanish-speaking pregnant women, connecting them with resources and in the hospital. Imagine waiting nine months to give birth and you end up being ignored, and not being told things because, ‘Oh, she won’t understand.’ Discrimination is evident at the moment of care,” Robles said.
During the ceremony, the doulas warned the future mother not to be surprised if her nipples darken, as this happens so the baby, born with blurred vision, can find them and feed himself. They also taught her what types of massages her partner can perform to ease the pain of contractions, and they practiced breathing exercises together to prepare for when it’s time to push during a natural birth.
The event marked the end of two months of theory classes, which covered topics ranging from pregnancy physiology, nutrition, breastfeeding, and racism in the health care system for women of color.
Next, the doulas will complete in-person practices at Hartford Hospital. After getting certified, the women will be able to start their own businesses and provide services to the Hispanic community.
Bianca Noroñas, director of the maternal and child health center at HHC, runs the training and teaches the theory classes. She said the program aims to train people from the community to fill the gaps in maternal health needs. 
“We’re creating this workforce of people from our community so they can pursue additional careers, if they’re already professionals, or begin pursuing one if they haven’t had any education. We’re also building a workforce that allows them to learn about and explore public health,” Noroñas said. She herself has worked as a doula — first in Puerto Rico, where she grew up, and then in Connecticut.

The women in the program represent different parts of Latin America. Robles, Ximena Chavez, Gloria Gavidia, and Angela Rivadeneyra are from Peru, while Yisenia Martinez is from Puerto Rico and Deicin Garcia is from Mexico. All of them are mothers themselves. Some have been in Connecticut for many years, others just migrated two years ago. They are united by the opportunity to accompany Hispanic women in Hartford to have a dignified birth.
In the United States, there are studies and research that explore and quantify the benefits of having a doula during pregnancy. One of the most recent, which analyzed data from women with Medicaid doula services between 2014 and 2023, showed that these women had a 47% lower risk of cesarean delivery, a 29% lower risk of premature birth and 46% attended postpartum checkups.
Over the course of these two months of classes, the doulas formed a clear sorority bond among themselves, along with Noroñas. Being mothers, there were days when they would bring their daughters or sons to class and take care of them together. While one sat the other’s child on her lap and whispered a song, another opened cookie wrappers for the child to eat. 
Several of the women applied to the doula program because they find that work necessary in Spanish for Hispanic women in Connecticut. Also, during their own pregnancies, there was no one to guide them through giving birth in a foreign country with a different health care system.
There aren’t many studies on pregnancy and childbirth experiences of non-English speaking women in the U.S. One of the few is the September 2018 Listening to Mothers in California survey, which found that of some 2,500 mothers interviewed, 10% of those who spoke Spanish as their first language reported experiencing unfair treatment because of their language.
“I know many pregnant women who were not treated well, they didn’t give them proper explanations, they left with many doubts, and unpleasant experiences,” Robles said.

When Robles moved to Connecticut in 2022, she had a daughter and was pregnant with her second child. She worried about the costs of giving birth, as she was unfamiliar with Medicaid, known as HUSKY in Connecticut. Now, in addition to participating in the community doula program, she works with the Comadrona program of the HHC, which provides support services to pregnant women, and three years ago helped her secure health insurance and find a place to give birth.
“I would have loved to have a doula, because I practically gave birth alone. My husband was there for the C-section, but had to go to work right after,” Robles recalls. “My sister-in-law was caring for my baby and had to take time off from work to stay with my little one.”
Noroñas said it has been quite complex to educate the Hispanic community in Hartford about what a doula is and how they support new mothers. Sometimes, doula work is confused with the emotional care that people in a traditional family — such as a grandmother, sister, or aunt — provide without pay. But when these women immigrate to the U.S., they are often single or with a partner and lose the family unit that usually supports them during pregnancy in their countries.
“Many mothers here are alone in the postpartum period, during labor and even during prenatal care,” Noroñas said. “A doula could be the support that the mother needs during such an important time.”
Gavidia, who is part of Noroñas’ program, gave birth with a doula in the U.S. Many of the doulas-in-training like her come from families where women were involved in reproductive health in their countries. Her grandmother was a midwife and clandestinely distributed condoms in Peru to mothers who no longer wanted to have more children.

When Gavidia learned she was pregnant, she started researching and decided to find a doula due to the lack of a support network she had. Now a nursing student, Gavidia saw the doula program as an opportunity to offer support to women and complement both her clinical and emotional expertise.
“I’m going to be a doula because I know that many women in my community aren’t properly informed. They aren’t told about the power of doulas and the control they can have during birth, in hospitals, and even during medical appointments,” Gavidia said. “I also want to include fathers so they can be more present throughout the entire process.”
The next cohort of the doula program at HHC is expected to begin in October. Anyone with a high school diploma and over the age of 18 can apply.

California’s insurance commissioner has sparred with Consumer Watchdog, which says his proposed rule is retaliatory.


California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara is proposing more new insurance rules that critics are calling “vindictive,” and which they say will only make it easier for insurers to raise rates.
Home insurance costs in California are certain to rise in the near future because of Lara’s recent changes to the state’s insurance rules. Those changes are meant to encourage insurance companies to keep writing new policies and discourage them from canceling policies, especially in areas of high wildfire risk. 
Last week, Lara proposed altering the insurance rate-review process in what he said is an effort to make it more efficient. But others say the changes Lara wants to make amount to retaliation against one of his biggest and toughest critics, Consumer Watchdog.
“This is Trumpian,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, the nonprofit organization that wrote the state’s Proposition 103 insurance law. Consumer Watchdog is California’s most prolific intervenor; an intervenor is a member of the public who can challenge an insurer’s rate request. 
The organization has repeatedly questioned Lara’s ties to the insurance industry, from which he has received and returned campaign contributions. Consumer Watchdog has sued the insurance department over several different issues, including its rule allowing the FAIR Plan — the fire insurance provider of last resort — to recoup some of its claims payouts from policyholders in the state. 
Lara’s proposed changes would do the following: 

Impose new timelines and guidelines for intervenors and administrative law judges.
Tighten requirements for what’s considered a “substantial contribution” for intervenors to get compensated for their work.
Limit administrative law judges’ authority in rate reviews.

Consumer Watchdog and other consumer advocacy organizations say those changes would make it harder for intervenors — who need to pay experts to challenge the rate requests — to be compensated. That could result in fewer intervenors, not more, as Lara’s proposal intends. They also say the changes could lead to unjustified premium increases more quickly.
Lara’s term expires next year and “he’s exacting his revenge,” Court told CalMatters, adding that his group is considering suing over the matter. 
Michael Soller, a spokesperson for the insurance department, would not respond to Court’s comments but said Consumer Watchdog “will have a chance to say what they have to say” during the public comment period on Lara’s proposal, which starts Oct. 3. A hearing on the proposal is scheduled for Nov. 20. 
An insurance industry representative, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, supports Lara’s proposal to fix the “broken intervenor process.”
“The only one of its kind in the nation, this process has contributed to the insurance crisis by delaying rate approvals, duplicating the (insurance department’s) work, and ultimately driving up costs for consumers,” said Denni Ritter, the association’s vice president for state government relations, in a statement.
Both Lara and the insurance industry have questioned Consumer Watchdog’s commitment to consumers over the years, and have accused the group of using the insurance law it wrote to enrich its leaders.
But Consumer Watchdog says it has saved Californians more than $6 billion in home and auto insurance premiums from 2002 to 2024. Under the intervenor system, the group says it has received $14.2 million in compensation over that period, or 25 cents for every $100 saved. Court said that compensation goes toward paying attorneys and actuaries — experts who try to hold their own against the powerful insurance industry.
California, whose housing costs are the highest in the nation, is about in the middle when it comes to average annual homeowners’ insurance rates, according to analyses by Realtor.com and comparison website Bankrate.com. Like many other states around the country, though, it is dealing with climate change-related risks that have raised concerns about an uninsurable future.
Robert Herrell is executive director of Consumer Federation of California, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group that mostly focuses on legislative work but which has also intervened in rate reviews. He said he doesn’t agree with Consumer Watchdog on everything, but that intervenors’ work in the state has been important in keeping insurance premiums from rising too much. 
“There’s no doubt in my mind that the work Consumer Watchdog has done has saved consumers money,” said Herrell, who was deputy insurance commissioner under former Commissioner Dave Jones.
Both groups sued Lara in July, alleging he denied them compensation for their participation in the department’s rulemaking last year. 
Herrell said stricter requirements for intervenors will only serve to discourage them from challenging rate requests and lead to higher insurance premiums, and that Lara’s proposal “feels punitive” against Consumer Watchdog.
“We (intervenors) may be collateral damage, but real people are going to get hurt,” he added.
Soller, the insurance department spokesperson, disagrees. He said the commissioner’s proposal actually seeks to increase transparency and the number of intervenors, and addresses a key problem: availability of insurance. 
Insurance companies that have pulled back on writing new policies in California have complained, among other things, that the department takes too long to approve their rate requests. 
“What consumers aren’t getting is availability and the coverage they need,” Soller said. 
Consumer Watchdog is pushing back on the accusation that it’s to blame for delays in rate approvals. “The time until rates were approved in cases with intervenors and without intervenors’ public participation is nearly identical,” the group said in a statement.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091924-Ricardo-Lara-FG-CM-09.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 08:57:22.396010

California colleges hope so,Mercy Sosa,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/09/california-propositions-higher-education-bond/,Lawmakers are considering putting a bond measure before voters in 2026 to fund billions of dollars in building repairs and student housing projects for California’s colleges and universities.,"In summary
Lawmakers are considering putting a bond measure before voters in 2026 to fund billions of dollars in building repairs and student housing projects for California’s colleges and universities.


Aging buildings, failing infrastructure, earthquake safety issues, and a severe lack of campus housing are straining California’s public higher education systems. As they face high-cost fixes, lawmakers have introduced a bond bill that ambitiously intends to fund both the modernization of academic facilities and the addition of affordable student housing throughout the state. 
The College Health and Safety Bond Act of 2026, AB 48, would start to address a growing $17 billion maintenance backlog within California’s university systems and the need for more affordable student housing in the state. The bill’s lead author, Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Democrat from San Diego, said it likely won’t include a dollar amount for the bond until it goes to the Senate next year to give the three public higher education systems in California time to report how much they need and a plan for spending it. If passed by the state Legislature, the bond would be placed on the November 2026 ballot for voters to decide. 
If an education bond measure sounds familiar, here is why: In the November 2024 general election, Californians passed Proposition 2, which authorized $8.5 million in bonds for public K-12 schools and $1.5 billion for community colleges. Although lawmakers originally included the University of California and Cal State systems in the measure, they were later excluded to cap the total bond amount at $10 billion.
System leaders at the UC and Cal State were disappointed that they were removed from Proposition 2, according to previous reporting by CalMatters. The last time Cal State and UC benefited from a bond measure was in 2006, when both systems shared $3.1 billion for facility repairs and upgrades. Those funds were exhausted by 2012. 
University buildings are in bad shape
A 2025 report by the Legislative Analyst’s Office shows that public higher education facilities are aging, campuses have growing maintenance needs, and their conditions are generally poor. 
The backlog of repairs needed for the system’s facilities, known as deferred maintenance, has led to such issues as extreme indoor heat, outdated roofs and electrical problems. Since 2015, the state has provided deferred maintenance funding of just $689 million for UC, $784 million for Cal State, and an estimated $904 million for community colleges, according to the report. 
However, CalMatters’ reporting found the UC and Cal State systems would need around $9 billion each to address their deferred maintenance needs. Community colleges have nearly $2.2 billion in maintenance needs in their current five-year plan, according to Chris Ferguson, the executive vice chancellor overseeing the finance and facilities division.
Some of the bond bill’s objectives are to prioritize safety issues and seismic deficiencies. Roughly 30% of UC and Cal State buildings and 20% of community college buildings were constructed before 1970.  
According to the Cal State system’s current five-year plan, priority projects include replacing Peterson Hall 1 at Cal State Long Beach, which currently houses health sciences and is on the priority list for not meeting California’s building codes for earthquake safety. The building would consolidate other programs and replace two faculty office buildings from the 1950s, according to Paul Gannoe, an assistant vice chancellor in Cal State’s business and finance division.
Cal State also plans to replace Sacramento State’s engineering building, Santa Clara Hall. The infrastructure of the building, built in the 1960s, has exceeded its useful life, according to Cal State’s previous five-year plan.

The UC system’s six-year capital plan lists seismic safety, student housing, and facility restoration as its top goals. UC Berkeley, which opened in 1868, reports its highest priority for new funding is to add an academic building to house mathematics, economics, and other departments, moving them out of seismically unfit spaces. The campus also has plans for three future student housing projects.
At UC Davis, a $68 million improvement plan for the 86-year-old Hickey Gymnasium Building is on the unfunded priority list. One faculty member there, Carolynn Patten, has had to halt her stroke research due to rats chewing on cables and the extreme indoor heat compromising her equipment, she previously told CalMatters.
Although community colleges already are receiving funding for facilities from Proposition 2, Assemblymember Alvarez said they are included in this new bill because their needs are still significant and they are important to the entire ecosystem of higher education.
“In order to maintain our competitiveness as a state, we need to make sure we’re always investing in education, and we need to have the right facilities to do so,” Alvarez said. “A very large percentage of our buildings and our universities and colleges are outdated, and technology has advanced, and so we make sure we have the right types of learning environments.”
Student housing needs are also on the rise
Despite California’s generous financial aid programs, Kevin Cook from the Public Policy Institute of California said that due to the high cost of living in the state, trying to house students is an increasingly expensive task.
The average housing cost for independent students ranges from $1,400 to $1,520 per month, according to the California Student Aid Commission’s 2023 Food and Housing Survey, which surveyed students who applied for financial aid for the 2022-23 academic year. The same survey found that 53% of student respondents experienced housing insecurity.
A separate 2020 study by the Center for the Transformation of Schools at UCLA found that about 1 in 5 community college students, 1 in 10 Cal State students, and 1 in 20 UC students experience homelessness. Although the Legislative Analyst’s Office warns of limitations on both of these surveys, it does point out the noteworthiness of the number of students experiencing housing insecurity and homelessness.
The location of a campus can greatly impact student housing costs. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reported that the average off-campus rent for two-bedroom apartments near UC Merced was $1,465 per month in 2024, while for UC Santa Cruz it was $4,297 per month.

For Cal State students, the average rent per month for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,807 near Cal State Bakersfield, while the average is $3,014 per month near San Francisco State.
Aditi Hariharan, president of the UC Student Association, said the bond bill aligns with the association’s priorities, though they have not yet taken an official vote on whether to support the bill.
“Students are constantly struggling to stay in university and be enrolled, find housing, and that’s a significant cost of living barrier,” Hariharan said.
Chris Chandler, vice president of the Student Senate for California Community Colleges, said his association supports the bill because they understand how important housing is for their student body. Chandler is studying business administration at Southwestern College in Chula Vista, where students struggle to find affordable housing. 
“You might hear students say, ‘Well, you know, I’m couch surfing with a friend’, or, ‘I’m about that van life’ and things like that,” Chandler said. “But you know, if we’re being really fair, those are homeless students, and they’re just looking for alternatives, to find a place where they can lay their head at night.” 
Southwestern College does not offer on-campus housing to its students. However, 14 out of 116 California Community Colleges do. The proposed bond funding would help community colleges continue to develop affordable housing for students. 
Facilities funding has evolved for universities
Traditionally, funding for university facilities has come from two sources: The state budget, for funding academic buildings such as classrooms, labs and faculty offices, and fees charged by the universities for self-supported facilities, such as housing, parking and campus dining.
In 2013 and 2014, in an effort to reduce state debt, then-Gov. Jerry Brown gave the UC and Cal State systems the authority to issue their own bonds. The university systems began selling revenue bonds to fund facility projects. 
For revenue-generating projects such as student housing, universities use the proceeds from the bond as well as fees and rent paid by students to repay the bond and interest, said Robert Eaton, an assistant vice chancellor in Cal State’s business and finance division.
Academic facilities, such as a science building, do not generate revenue and have to be repaid through the system’s central budget. While Cal State trustees have the ability to set aside funds to service debt, they haven’t done so since 2018 due to an inadequate budget, Eaton said.

About five years ago, as housing and construction costs were sharply increasing, the state decided to start putting money toward affordable student housing. In 2021, the state Legislature approved allocating $2 billion over three years to public colleges and universities for the construction and renovation of student housing through the Higher Education Student Housing Grant. Gov. Gavin Newsom then took back that funding in 2023 to help close a state budget deficit, with the state instead agreeing to pay the principal and interest on bonds the colleges and universities issued themselves. That saved projects already in the works, but the state’s community colleges and public university systems still have many more student housing plans in need of funding.
A statewide bond that would fund both academic facilities and affordable student housing would address both deficits troubling California’s public higher education systems. However, the inclusion of student housing in the bond bill is “a big departure from historic state practice, and it’s raising a new tension with how to deal with academic facilities and improving the condition of those facilities, while also addressing student and faculty housing needs,” said Jennifer Pacella of the Legislative Analyst’s Office.
Would a bond have a chance with California voters?
According to the Legislative Analyst’s Office report, voters approve most state bonds for higher education facilities. From 1986 to 2016, voters approved 10 out of 12 state bond measures that benefited higher education. The only higher education bond measure to fail in the past 30 years was in 2020, when voters rejected Proposition 13, a $15 billion bond measure for K-12 schools, community colleges and universities. 
The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association opposed that bond, and now opposes the new bill’s proposal. Susan Shelley, a spokesperson for the association, says that she looks at it from the perspective of the taxpayers who will be paying for the interest rate of the bond.
“Every couple of years, there’s a request for another bond to be added on top of that,” Shelley said. “We want to make sure that bonds are always funding something that will still be giving value to the people who are paying for it 30 years from now, and that it’s not just being used for current expenses or maintenance expenses or anything that won’t give value to the people who have to pay for it.”
Darien Shanske, professor of law at UC Davis, argues that the state subsidizing the cost of public education is a good investment. Although a state bond initiative would need public polling to determine its ability to pass, “there seems to be a fair amount of support for public higher education,” Shanske said. 
An August 2025 poll by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies shows that out of 6,474 registered California voters who responded, 58% believe state funding should be increased for the UC system.

En una mañana de viernes a principios de septiembre, un grupo de seis mujeres se sentaron frente a una velas pequeñas y flores en la sala de entrenamiento de parto ligeramente iluminada, en Hartford. Seis de las participantes forman un circulo alrededor de una mujer embarazada a casi un mes de parir. 
El grupo se reunió para una ceremonia destinada a transmitir paz y seguridad a la futura madre. Zaza Robles, una residente de Hartford de 35 años, originaria de Perú, guiaba la meditación en la que les pedía hacer respiraciones hondas y pausadas, y repetir afirmaciones para la invitada de honor.
Robles, quien por ocho años ejerció como obstetra en Perú, es parte de las seis doulas en entrenamiento del programa de doulas comunitarias del Consejo Hispano de Salud, o HHC, facilitado por la Fundación de Salud de Connecticut y Hartford HealthCare.
La capacitación se lleva a cabo completamente en español y tiene como objetivo abordar una importante brecha en la salud materna en una ciudad donde más de la mitad de los residentes que dan a luz son hispanos, según el último informe del Departamento de Salud Pública del estado.

El trabajo de doula consiste en educar, informar y guiar a la persona que esté gestando. No brindan servicios médicos. Como doula, una persona se puede especializar para acompañar el prenatal, asistir durante el parto y el post parto, o todo a la vez.
“Las doulas que salgan de este programa pueden ser quienes aboguen por las mujeres embarazadas que hablan español, con recursos y acompañandolas en el hospital. Te imaginas que te ignoren, te obvien, no te digan cosas porque ‘ah, ella no lo va a entender’. La discriminación se nota al momento de la atención”, sostiene Robles.
Durante la ceremonia espiritual, las doulas advirtieron a la embarazada participante que no se sorprendiera si sus pezones se oscurecen, ya que sucede para que el bebé, al nacer con la vista borrosa, pueda encontrarlos y alimentarse. Entre otras cosas, también le enseñaron qué tipo de masajes le puede hacer su acompañante o pareja, para aligerar el dolor de contracciones, y practicaron juntas las respiraciones ideales para pujar en caso de un parto natural. 
El evento fue el cierre de dos meses de capacitación teórica, en el que abordaron desde temas de fisiologia del embarazo, nutrición, lactancia, hasta racismo en el sistema de salud para mujeres de color.
En las siguientes semanas, las doulas deberán realizar prácticas en el Hospital de Hartford. Luego de certificarse, podrán crear sus propias empresas y proporcionar servicios a la comunidad hispana.
Bianca Noroñas, directora puertorriqueña del Centro de Salud Maternal y de Niños del HHC, dirige el entrenamiento de doulas. Explicó que el programa busca formar a personas de la misma comunidad para cubrir las necesidades no atendidas en salud materna.  
“Estamos creando este workforce de personas de nuestra comunidad para que tengan una profesión adicional, si es que ya eran profesionales, o comiencen a tener una profesión si no habían tenido un estudio. También para que conozcan y exploren lo que es la salud pública”, dijo Noroñas, quien fue también doula primero en Puerto Rico y ahora en Connecticut.

Las mujeres del programa son de diferentes partes de Latinoamérica. Robles, Ximena Chavez, Gloria Gavidia y Angela Rivadeneyra son de Perú, mientras que Yisenia Martinez es de Puerto Rico y la futura entrenadora de las próximas generaciones de doulas, Deicin García, de México. Todas son madres. Algunas llevan muchos años en Connecticut, otras recién migraron hace dos años. Las une la oportunidad de acompañar a mujeres hispanas en Hartford a tener un parto digno.
En Estados Unidos, hay estudios e investigaciones que exploran y cuantifican los beneficios de tener una doula durante el embarazo. Uno de los más recientes, que analizó datos de mujeres con servicios de doula en Medicaid entre el 2014 y 2023, demuestra que estas mujeres tuvieron un 47% de menos riesgo de cesárea, un 29% de menos riesgo de partos prematuros, y un 46% asistieron a chequeos médicos post-parto. 
A lo largo de estos dos meses de clases, las doulas crearon un evidente lazo de sororidad entre ellas, junto con Noroñas. Al ser madres, había días en que llevaban a sus hijas o hijos a las clases y les cuidaban entre todas. Mientras una sentaba al hijo de la otra en sus piernas y le susurraba una canción, la otra abría envolturas de unas galletas para que comiera. 
Varias de las mujeres aplicaron al programa porque vieron la importancia de ejercer el oficio de doulas en español para mujeres hispanas en Connecticut. También, porque durante sus propios embarazos no hubo nadie que las guiara a parir en un país ajeno al suyo con un sistema de salud diferente.
No existen muchos estudios sobre las experiencias durante el embarazo y parto de mujeres que no hablan inglés en EE.UU. Uno de los pocos es la encuesta Escuchando a las madres en California, de septiembre de 2018, que revela que de unas 2,500 madres entrevistadas, el 10% de las que hablaban español como primer idioma aseguraron haber experimentado un trato injusto a causa del idioma que dominaban. 
“Yo conozco a muchas mujeres embarazadas que no les atendieron bien, no les explicaron bien, salieron con muchas dudas, salieron con experiencias poco agradables”, recuerda Robles.

Robles se mudó a Connecticut en el 2022, embarazada y con una hija. Le preocupaban los costos de dar a luz, ya que le era desconocido el seguro de salud Medicaid, conocido como Husky en Connecticut. Ahora, aparte de estar en el programa de doulas comunitarias, trabaja con las Comadronas del HHC, que brindan apoyo y recursos para mujeres embarazadas y hace tres años le ayudaron a conseguir seguro médico y encontrar dónde parir.
“A mí me hubiera gustado mucho tener una doula, porque yo di a luz prácticamente sola, mi esposo entró a la cesárea, estuvo conmigo, pero se tuvo que ir a trabajar”, recuerda Robles. “Mi cuñada estaba a cargo de mi nena y tuvo que pedir permiso en su trabajo para quedarse con mi chiquita”.
Noroñas cuenta que ha sido un arduo trabajo educar a la comunidad hispana en Hartford sobre qué es una doula y cómo apoyar a las mamás. En ocasiones, el trabajo de las doulas se confunde con el de cuidados emocionales que las personas en una familia tradicional — como la abuela, la hermana o la tía — ejercen sin remuneraciones. Pero al emigrar a EE.UU, muchas veces las mujeres están solas o en pareja y pierden ese núcleo familiar que en sus países las apoya usualmente en el embarazo.
“Aquí muchas mamás están solas en el post parto, en el parto, están solas hasta en el prenatal”, dijo Noroñas. “La doula pudiera ser ese elemento que apoye a esa mamá en un momento tan importante”.
Gavidia, parte del programa de Noroñas, parió acompañada de una doula en EE.UU. Muchas de las futuras doulas como ella, vienen de familias en las cuales había mujeres involucradas en la salud reproductiva de sus países. Su abuela era partera y repartía clandestinamente condones en Perú a mamás que ya no querían tener más hijos.

Cuando Gavidia supo que estaba embarazada, empezó a informarse y decidió buscar una doula por la falta de red de apoyo en su nuevo país. Ahora, que estudia enfermería, vio la oportunidad del programa de doulas para acompañar a mujeres y complementar ambos conocimientos clínicos y emocionales.
“Voy a ser doula porque sé que a muchas mujeres de mi comunidad no se les informa debidamente, no les dicen del poder de las doulas y del control que ellas sí pueden tener en el parto, en los hospitales y hasta en las citas médicas”, dijo Gavidia. “También quiero incluir a los papás para que estén más presentes en todo el proceso”.
La próxima cohorte del programa de doulas en el HHC se espera que empiece en Octubre. Cualquier persona que haya cursado el bachillerato y sea mayor de 18 años puede aplicar. Las personas que estén interesadas en aplicar y ser seleccionadas, pueden enviar un correo electrónico a Noroñas a la dirección biancan@hispanichealthcouncil.org.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0905_SR_DoulaGraduation_102-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 10:58:25.078250
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-24 12:20:00+00:00,CT Mirror,US DOJ official questions retired FBI agent’s role in $1.4B Sandy Hook lawsuit,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/24/doj-inquiry-william-aldenberg-sandy-hook-families-alex-jones/,DOJ's 'weaponization working group' asked retired agent William Aldenberg whether he benefited financially from helping with the families' lawsuit against Alex Jones.,"A senior U.S. Justice Department official sent a letter to a lawyer for relatives of victims killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, asking pointed questions about a retired FBI agent’s involvement in a defamation lawsuit that led to a $1.4 billion judgment against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
Ed Martin Jr., who leads the Justice Department’s “weaponization working group,” asked in the letter whether retired agent William Aldenberg received any financial benefits from helping to organize the lawsuit, in which he was a plaintiff along with victims’ family members.
Aldenberg, like the parents and other relatives of the 20 children and six educators killed in the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, has been the subject of false conspiracy theories spread by Jones on his “Infowars” broadcasts.
Aldenberg was among the law enforcement officers who responded to the school and found the dead children. That then led to years of abuse from people who believed the shooting was a hoax, he has said. His share of the judgment totaled around $120 million.
Martin sends lawyer letter asking about retired agent
In a Sept. 15 letter to Christopher Mattei, a lawyer who represents Sandy Hook families, Martin suggested he was scrutinizing Aldenberg’s role in the lawsuit.
“As you may know, there are criminal laws protecting the citizens from actions by government employees who may be acting for personal benefit,” Martin wrote.
Mattei responded to the letter in a text message to The Associated Press.
“Thanks to the courage of the Sandy Hook families, Infowars will soon be finished,” he said, referring to the families’ efforts in court to liquidate Jones’ assets to help pay the judgment. “In his last gasps, Jones is once again harassing them, only now with the corrupt complicity of at least one DOJ official. It’s as disgusting as it is pathetic, and we will not stand for it.”
The Justice Department said it had no immediate comment Tuesday.
Martin, who has been examining President Donald Trump’s claims of anti-conservative bias inside the Justice Department, has sent letters to a host of targets in other, unrelated matters, seeking information or making appeals, but it’s unclear whether such requests have amounted to anything.
Jones posted a copy of the letter on his X account Tuesday, saying “Breaking! The DOJ’s Task Force On Government Weaponization Against The American People Has Launched An Investigation Into The Democrat Party / FBI Directing Illegal Law-fare Against Alex Jones And Infowars.”
Retired agent testified at the trial
Aldenberg joined the relatives of eight Sandy Hook victims in suing Jones, alleging defamation and infliction of emotional distress.
Aldenberg was one of the first witnesses to testify at the trial in 2022. He broke down on the witness stand as he described entering the two classrooms where children and educators were shot.
He also testified about how he and others in the community and law enforcement were targeted with threats and conspiracy theories, including one that claimed he was an actor who also pretended to be the father of a victim.
Messages were left at a phone listing and email addresses listed for Aldenberg in public records.
Relatives of the shooting victims testified that they were subjected to violent threats, in-person harassment and abusive comments on social media because of Jones.
Martin has been serving as head of the Justice Department’s “weaponization working group” since his nomination for top federal prosecutor in Washington was pulled amid bipartisan concerns about his modest legal experience and his advocacy for Jan. 6 rioters.
Attorney General Pam Bondi created the group to scrutinize matters in which conservatives have claimed they were unfairly targeted or treated.
Martin was also recently named a special prosecutor to help conduct the separate mortgage fraud investigations into Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James and U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff.
In his letter to Mattei, he asked for several pieces of information and requested that the lawyer respond by Sept. 29.
In the letter, Martin asks Mattei to keep the correspondence confidential because “I do not wish to litigate this in the media.” On Sept. 14, Jones posted a photo on his X account of him and Martin together, saying the two met in Washington, D.C.
Jones recently asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear his appeal of the $1.4 billion judgment. He also is appealing a $49 million judgment in similar lawsuit in Texas filed by two other parents of children killed in Newtown. He has cited free speech rights, but he has acknowledged that the shooting was “100% real.”
Jones claims Democrats have been targeting him for his speech.
He filed for bankruptcy in late 2022. The Sandy Hook plaintiffs are now trying to liquidate Infowars’ assets in state court proceedings in Texas.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25267016967294-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 10:58:25.078250

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The Washoe County Commission failed to address “serious threats” to public safety and wildfire evacuation when it approved development amendments adopted in 2023 by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, says a Petition for Judicial Review filed Tuesday by the Tahoe Sierra Clean Air Coalition. 
The amendments, approved by the Washoe County Commission by a 3 to 1 vote in August, adopt TRPA standards that allow greater density, higher buildings, and reduced parking in town centers and multifamily areas. 
Tahoe Sierra Clean Air Coalition is headed by former firefighter Doug Flaherty, who last year commissioned a simulation that indicates evacuating 13,151 vehicles from Incline Village, a popular tourist destination with numerous hotels and more than 1,000 vacation rentals, would take seven hours and 20 minutes, if all roads were accessible. 
Evacuating Tahoe could take twice as long as projected, simulations indicate

“These are not minor changes. They intensify development in areas already vulnerable to wildfire and traffic congestion,” Flaherty, an Incline Village resident, told the commission in August. He and others opposed to higher-density development say they’ve exhausted their administrative remedies and are asking the Second Judicial District to revoke the commission’s vote. 
Commissioners, Flaherty said in a news release, “turned their back on the life safety concerns of Washoe Tahoe residents. They ignored clear, compelling substantial evidence and new information that these amendments, if implemented, will further place Washoe Tahoe residents and visitors’ lives at risk during a fast-moving, no-notice wildfire event.”
The petition notes Washoe County’s “own calculation” estimates that evacuating the Incline Village/Crystal Bay area would take six hours, and cites the Nevada Current’s reporting, in which a county spokesperson said the estimate focused on evacuating residents “is now outdated and we don’t have an updated estimate because we do not have the funding for a study,”  
In an interview earlier this month, Washoe County Chairwoman Alexis Hill said the county received a $170,000 donation in February from an undisclosed source to conduct an evacuation study. 
The petition asserts the county has yet to issue requests for proposals for the study. Hill, however, says “the RFP is out, and we’re going to be choosing someone.” She said the county intends to work with the Desert Research Institute on the study. Time constraints placed on Washoe County by the TRPA prevented the county from holding off on adopting the amendments until the evacuation study was completed, Hill said. 
The commission, the petition notes, was advised that the evacuation study would not affect the amendments, “as the proposed changes did not require consideration of criteria relating to evacuations and emergency management.” 
“If something comes out of a study that we need to look at something new, I’m always open to new data,” Hill said. “I don’t want to operate in a vacuum, so I’m very open to seeing what the results are.”
Hill, who announced this month she’s running in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, is a member of the TRPA board, supports higher density, and says it will ultimately be best for everyone.
She disputes the allegations of critics who contend she failed to engage with residents opposed to the plan. 
“I’ve had numerous emails. I’ve certainly chatted with people on the phone,” she said. “I’ve heard folks’ concerns. I don’t always listen to the loudest voices in the room. I actually listen to our diverse community, and there are many workers who would love to stay and live and serve Incline Village and Crystal Bay. This will help ensure that we have a workforce in the community.”
The county commission, the petition says, “took guidance from its counsel” who asserted the TRPA amendments preempted local authority, and would go into effect even if rejected.  
“Counsel indicated that the Board did not really have a choice” but to approve the TRPA’s amendments, the petition says, and would consider the residents’ concerns “at some unspecified future time in some unspecified proceeding.” 
Hill agrees the commission had no choice. “If a developer went to TRPA, they would override the county. The TRPA is approved by a federal compact dictated by both states, so they have more authority than the county does.” 
Hill and Washoe County Chief Deputy District Attorney for the Civil Division Michael Large declined to comment on the legal action.
TRPA spokesman Jeff Cowen says local governments can incorporate the incentives for development “as-is or modify them to fit their local vision.” 
Proposed modifications are evaluated to determine if they create “the same level of cost savings” to developers as the amendments adopted by TRPA in 2023, such as greater height and density, a larger building footprint, and lower parking requirements.  
Cowen notes no applications have been received for development under the new standards, which require a commitment to “100 percent deed-restricted workforce housing.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1337303982-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-09-24 08:57:22.396010

Read this story in English.
Más de siete docenas de leyes de Connecticut, relativas a diversos temas, desde regulaciones sobre bicicletas eléctricas y cascos hasta la caza en domingo, entrarán en vigor total o parcialmente el 1 de octubre.
Las leyes de Connecticut son aprobadas por la Asamblea General durante la sesión legislativa de cada año (la de este año se extendió del 8 de enero al 4 de junio) o en una sesión especial. Suelen entrar en vigor el 1 de enero, el 1 de julio o el 1 de octubre.
A continuación, un vistazo a algunas de las leyes que se implementarán el próximo mes.
Reforma de las leyes de remolque
Una reforma de las leyes de remolque de Connecticut, con un siglo de antigüedad, incluye varias medidas para dificultar el remolque de vehículos desde propiedades privadas y facilitar a los conductores la recuperación de sus vehículos después de un remolque.
La ley estatal permite a las empresas de remolque iniciar el proceso de venta de un vehículo remolcado con un valor de $1,500 o menos después de 15 días, uno de los plazos más cortos del país. La nueva ley aún permite a las compañías de remolque iniciar el proceso de venta después de 15 días, pero ahora deberán tomar medidas adicionales para que el propietario tenga la oportunidad de reclamar el vehículo, y la venta real no podrá concretarse hasta 30 días después del remolque.
También exige que las compañías de remolque acepten tarjetas de crédito y no les permite remolcar vehículos inmediatamente, solo por tener un permiso de estacionamiento o registro vencido. Los vehículos no pueden ser remolcados de una propiedad privada sin previo aviso, a menos que obstruyan el tráfico o las bocas de incendio, o estén estacionados en un lugar accesible para personas con discapacidad.
El proyecto de ley se aprobó tras una investigación de CT Mirror y ProPublica que demostró cómo las leyes estatales de remolque han llegado a favorecer a las compañías de remolque en detrimento de los propietarios de vehículos.
Un grupo de trabajo del Departamento de Vehículos Motorizados de Connecticut se dispone a examinar partes de la ley estatal de remolque que van mucho más allá de su mandato original, lo que podría conducir a reformas más amplias.
Caza en domingo
A partir del 1 de octubre, Connecticut permitirá la caza los domingos, con algunas limitaciones.
La nueva ley permite la caza en domingo, pero la limita a propiedades privadas y prohíbe cualquier caza a menos de 40 yardas de una ruta de senderismo marcada con bandera azul o designada por el gobierno federal. El proyecto de ley también prohíbe la caza de aves migratorias los domingos.
Los cazadores lucharon sin éxito durante décadas para revocar la prohibición estatal de la caza en domingo, que han descrito como la última de las históricas “leyes azules” de Connecticut. En 2015, los legisladores derogaron parcialmente la prohibición para los cazadores con arco.
Cascos
Una nueva ley eleva la edad mínima para que los conductores y pasajeros de motocicletas usen casco de 18 a 21 años, con una multa mínima de $90 por infracciones.
Esta ley también exige que los menores de 18 años usen casco al conducir vehículos como bicicletas, patinetas y monopatines. Anteriormente, solo los menores de 16 años debían usar casco.
Bicicletas eléctricas
Otra nueva ley clasifica algunas bicicletas eléctricas, que anteriormente carecían de regulación en materia de licencias y registro, como ciclos o vehículos motorizados.
La ley clasifica las bicicletas eléctricas sin pedales y con baterías de más de 750 vatios como vehículos motorizados, que requieren licencia de conducir para operar, pero no están obligadas a estar registradas en el estado.
Las bicicletas eléctricas con baterías de más de 3,500 vatios se clasificarán como vehículos motorizados. Es esencialmente la misma clasificación que las motocicletas y requiere que los vehículos estén registrados y asegurados.
Además, dado que las bicicletas eléctricas se pueden modificar fácilmente para alcanzar velocidades superiores a 96 km/h, la nueva ley, generalmente exige que quienes modifiquen la velocidad de una bicicleta eléctrica, etiqueten el vehículo con la modificación correspondiente.
Esposas para niños
Los agentes de policía tendrán prohibido en gran medida esposar a menores de 14 años, excepto en casos en que sea necesario para la seguridad pública o cuando el menor utilice o amenace con usar fuerza física contra un agente.
La ley vigente establece que se deben retirar las restricciones, como las esposas, a un menor antes y durante una comparecencia ante el tribunal. Esta ley no se modificó.
Matrimonios entre primos hermanos
La ley de Connecticut prohibirá ahora que los primos hermanos se casen a sabiendas. Los hijos de primos hermanos tienen un mayor riesgo de padecer trastornos genéticos y defectos de nacimiento.
La ley vigente de Connecticut, que sigue vigente, prohíbe que una persona se case con su padre, madre, hijo, abuelo, nieto, hermano, hermano del padre, padrastro o hijastro.

(Photo by Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images)Now that Congress has reauthorized and expanded the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to cover all of Utah for people who developed serious illnesses from nuclear weapons testing, a St. George clinic is touring different cities in the state to inform the public about the program.
With new areas eligible under RECA and an increased compensation amount, Intermountain Health is inviting downwinders to attend public informational meetings in the Provo-Orem area and Salt Lake City — in addition to Idaho Falls — this week. Applications will be available on site.
Intermountain Health’s Downwinders Clinic, located in St. George Regional Hospital’s Cancer Center, has offered free programs for downwinders, including education, health care assistance and help with RECA payment applications  — even during the federal program’s 13-month hiatus, when Congress failed to reauthorize it. 
Utah health clinic to resume screening and helping downwinders apply for compensation

After Congress in July approved its massive spending bill, which included the reauthorization of RECA, patients in the expansion areas, who have recently been diagnosed with cancer, or who didn’t know about the program are eligible for compensation. 
However, those who have already been compensated by the program aren’t able to apply for additional funds. 
In the past RECA allowed for payments of $50,000 and only 10 counties in the state were covered by the program. But now, payments will be $100,000 for new applicants and all of Utah is considered an affected area. So, those who lived in the state for at least 12 months between 1951 and 1962 and contracted a certain type of cancer may be entitled for compensation. 
According to Intermountain Health, eligible cancers haven’t changed. They include leukemia — but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia — multiple myeloma, lymphomas (other than Hodgkin’s), and primary cancers of the pharynx, small intestine, salivary gland, brain, stomach, urinary bladder, colon, thyroid, pancreas, breast, esophagus, bile ducts, liver, gall bladder, lung, and ovarian.

Voters will choose between Greg Barnes and Dustin Beaty. There are no Democrats in the race, so the winner will serve as the new representative. A third candidate, Mike Elliott, qualified for the election but was taken off the certification of candidates last week. The Daily Mountain Eagle, a local Jasper newspaper, reported that Elliott did not comply with an Alabama Ethics Commission form.
The Alabama GOP sent a new certification of candidates, without Elliott, on Sept. 15 to the Secretary of State.

Messages seeking comment from Elliott and the Alabama Ethics Commission were left Monday. 
The seat was left vacant when former Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to represent Senate District 5 this summer in a special election. The district is solidly Republican. It has not had a Democratic representative since Rep. Tommy Sherer was defeated by Republican Bill Roberts in 2010, according to election results. 
Messages seeking comment from Barnes were left Monday and Tuesday.

The candidates

Beaty, 52, is a pharmacist and owns several businesses in Jasper. He said in a phone interview he wants to make Walker County a place where people want to stay for generations.
“We want to create an environment where our kids have jobs and they can stay in Walker County. Families can stay together, so grandparents can stay with their grandkids, because their grandkids can find jobs here in Walker County,” Beaty said. 
Beaty’s tasks to achieve that goal are increasing economic and workforce development, lowering taxes and securing funding for roads. 
Barnes, 67, said in a previous interview that he is prioritizing mental health, veterans support and parental rights in education. Barnes also ran for the seat in 2022 against Woods and received 11.4% of votes, according to election results.
“We desperately need consistent financial support for the mental health institutions in Alabama and to assist the mentally ill in our society,” Barnes said in July. “Placing them in prison or in jail doesn’t help them or society in the long term. This needs to be addressed before they become too mentally ill to be helped.”

Campaign fundraising

According to campaign finance records, Barnes funded his campaign entirely with $20,000 and has not reported any other contributions. He  spent $18,677 through Sept. 23. He said in a previous interview that he would fund his campaign on his own.
Beaty raised $131,614 as of Tuesday and spent $126,843, according to campaign finance records. About 22% of his funds have come from political action committees (PACs), the rest from individuals and businesses.
Before Elliott was removed from the ballot, he raised $51,450 and spent $49,527.58, according to campaign finance records. About 46% of Elliott’s funds came from PACs, the rest from individuals and businesses.

The University of Nevada Las Vegas ranked 95th out of 257 colleges for its free speech climate, while the University of Nevada Reno came in a few spots lower at 100th.
Both UNLV and UNR received an “F” grade, earning 59 out of 100. Nationally, the average overall score was 58.6.
Only 11 schools nationwide received a speech climate grade of “C” or higher.
The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression described a “mixed picture” at UNLV.
The university ranked in the top 50 when it came to students feeling comfortable expressing controversial ideas, “indicating that open discussion may occur at a higher rate than other schools,” but in the bottom 25 for self-censorship, meaning students may be more likely to stay silent during discussions with peers or professors for fear of backlash.
UNLV was docked two points for having one “speech controversy.”
In February 2024, an open lecture by visiting Israeli physics professor Asaf Peer on black holes was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protestors. Peer told the Nevada Current that campus police informed him they could not remove the protesters and instead ended the lecture and escorted him off campus. He disagreed with the handling of the event.
FIRE listed no speech controversies at UNR.
But UNR ranked in the bottom 25 for “openness,” described as students feeling like many topics are off limits in class or social settings.
The surveys also found that, among the UNLV and UNR students:

68% said shouting down a speaker to prevent them from speaking on campus is acceptable, at least in rare cases;
41% said they have self-censored on campus at least once or twice a month; and
32% said using violence to stop someone from speaking on campus is acceptable, at least in rare cases.

FIRE estimates that across the universities there are nearly three liberal students for one conservative student.
The two universities were the only two Nevada institutions included in the analysis by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which six years ago began surveying college students on their perceptions of free speech at their campuses. This year, approximately 68,500 students across the country were surveyed by the organization, which used the responses, as well as institution policies and public controversies, to assign free speech scores and grades.
Brookings Mountain West, in a fact sheet summarizing the FIRE report, noted that all 16 colleges and universities across the Mountain West region received ‘’F” grades for political tolerance.
Nevada overall ranked worse than Arizona and Colorado, which received “D+” and “D-” grades, respectively. Nevada had the same average score as Utah.
FIRE’s findings were released earlier this month, one day before the fatal shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university on Sept. 10.
Among the takeaways highlighted by the report: “The percentage of students saying it is acceptable to shout down a speaker, block entry to a campus speech, or use violence to stop a campus speech all increased since last year and are at record highs.”
In a statement released after Kirk’s shooting, UNLV Interim President Chris Heavey said college campuses have “long stood as special places in American society where people of different viewpoints can meet, question, and challenge one another without fear.”
He continued, “To see violence enter those spaces is to see the very foundation of higher learning threatened.”
Heavey noted that Kirk visited UNLV in October 2024 without incident.

The changes to Ordinance 1533 were postponed for a second reading and possible adoption to the Oct. 21 council meeting. The commission, which was established in July 2021, is responsible for police accountability.
Councilmembers Dana Watson and Mark Meadows requested the delay, and the motion passed unanimously, with the city attorney confirming there was no legal concern with deferring the vote.
Although the adoption was delayed, the council also considered whether to release a cross-reference document that details the proposed changes. Councilmember Erik Altmann, who voted no, mentioned that the Labor Council advised against publication, citing complicated legal implications. However, the council voted 4–1 in favor of releasing the document to the public and to the commission.

Following a report from East Lansing Info on September 9, the council met in a closed special session with labor attorney Gouri Sashital to review a legal opinion from labor counsel. Oversight Commissioner Chris Root requested that the council share a confidential document explaining how changes to the ordinance are mandated by the new police contract. Root noted the council could waive confidentiality with a majority vote.
These new changes were a result of a new contract between the city and the East Lansing Police Department patrol officers’ union, which also led the commission to hire outside attorneys due to concerns about transparency and accountability.
The contract introduces significant changes to the ordinance governing the commission, limiting its ability to review complaints before final decisions are made, withholding the names of officers in use-of-force and crisis-related reports, and prohibiting the commission or its members from commenting on pending complaints, internal investigations, personnel matters, or ongoing police operations.
Changes to the ordinance and its potential effects have been discussed at several previous meetings. Those opposing the proposed changes have argued that they represent an attack on the community, as they remove their ability to independently oversee the police, which could lead to unchecked abuses of power.
“In a democratic society, the powerful must be subject to scrutiny by the people, and there is no greater power than that of life and death, which the police hold over others,” Karen Hoene from the city’s Human Rights Commission said. “People will not be sure whether they will be treated fairly, as there will be no easily accessible, impartial authority with any real power to investigate abuses. At this critical time in our nation’s history, we’re at another page.”
Additionally, Root emphasized the positive importance of releasing the cross-referencing document, which clarifies the source of changes to the ordinance, adding that this was an action they had been expecting since August 12.
On the other hand, in contrast of several recent violent incidents downtown, Ali Haider, a downtown business owner, mentioned that East Lansing police “did an amazing job” in apprehending the attackers who had been harassing his business and employees during late-night hours.
“So, when somebody’s making an arrest, it’s not about the race. When somebody’s filing a complaint, it’s not about the race,” Haider said. “People are doing their job. If anyone is going to come to the downtown and they’re going to create a disturbance, cops are supposed to arrest them.”
In addition to concerns about downtown safety and the recent changes to the oversight commission, Councilmember Watson stated that it is essential that no one be subjected to more rigorous scrutiny based on their race or stereotypes, and that all residents must be treated equally under the police actions.
“The cops have to be held accountable to the community as well. And so, especially if people might be noticing or thinking that it’s driven by Black and brown people, then it’s important that we have a balance and we have someone else with eyes on it. Because I don’t deserve to just get looked at hard because of the color of my skin when I go out places, harder than my white counterparts,” Watson said.

Mike Kehoe speaks briefly at a Sept. 9 meeting of the Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force in the Missouri Special Olympics office building in Jefferson City (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Education and business leaders shaping Missouri’s public school funding formula are hoping to rework the way the state funds students with higher needs.
The Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force’s four working groups held their initial meetings Tuesday and last Wednesday, and there were some common themes in their discussions..
During Tuesday’s meetings of the student counts and funding target work groups, both leaned toward ideas to remove funding cliffs in the state’s funding of students with higher needs.
The funding target group is looking into a metric currently called the State Adequacy Target. The number is calculated by looking at the per-pupil expenses of the state’s high-performing districts and becomes the base for calculation of state aid.
This model has its benefits, with more stability over time than figures based on property value, said Don Thalhuber, policy director for the Senate Minority Caucus and drafter of the state’s current formula.
“This kind of convoluted structure was put in place to make sure that our formula did not spiral upward too quickly,” he said.
One of the major changes in 2005 was to move away from a formula that encouraged higher local tax rates to one based on spending. But drafters might have overcorrected, he said, since that target has remained largely stagnant since its inception, increasing just 17% compared to a 65% rise in inflation.
Kari Monsees, the state education department’s former finance chief, told the group that a target focused on high performers doesn’t work well for schools with “dramatically different” needs.
“Sometimes it is hard to make that translation, even if you try to do it with student weightings and things of that sort,” he said. “Trying to balance those scales is important.”
Student weightings are in the current formula as a multiplier that increases funding to districts with high-needs students. But there is a threshold, meaning that the state assumes a certain level of students qualify as low-income, special education or English language learners. Those with a higher portion of students in those groups receive the additional funding.
“I think the thresholds should just be eliminated,” said state Rep. Ed Lewis, a Moberly Republican appointed to the task force. “A student is a student… If we are going to have categories and they fall into that category, the school should get that funding.”
All three studies of the formula the task force is reviewing have recommended that the state remove the thresholds, including a 2023 study by University of Miami teaching chair Bruce Baker.
“The threshold approach theoretically overfunds districts with need shares lower than the thresholds, which makes little sense, when that funding could instead be targeted to those  districts with much greater needs. That is, for the same total cost, larger weights could be applied, but across the full range of need, on a lower base,” Baker wrote in the study.
Thalhuber made a similar point Tuesday, anticipating that the group will have to “wrestle with” funding at a stronger base level with weaker multipliers or having a weaker base with stronger weights for need-based funding.
Monsees kicked off the second meeting of the day explaining that reality to the student counts working group.
“If you wanted to raise the weighting factors significantly, and let’s say there’s a very limited amount of additional money that could support that, you’d have to come up with a lower funding target or a lower state adequacy target to make the math work,” he said.
The thresholds are a result of the adequacy target calculation, Monsees said.
“The idea is the high-performing districts that were established in the state adequacy target were already serving that percentage of students on average,” he said, adding that it is possible to remove the thresholds.
The groups are scheduled to meet an additional five times before presenting their recommendations to the broader task force.

,California,2025-09-24 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s insurance commissioner targets Consumer Watchdog fees,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/california-insurance-commissioner-consumer-watchdog/,"The nonprofit Consumer Watchdog collects ""intervenor fees"" for participating in premium setting in the Department of Insurance. It says it saves consumers millions of dollars more than it collects.","The horrific string of wildfires that has plagued California in recent years, taking dozens of lives and destroying many billions of dollars in property, also created a crisis in property insurance.
Some insurers have abandoned California altogether, some have refused to take more clients, many have sought premium increases and the state’s insurer-of-last-resort, the FAIR plan, has seen so much new business that its long-term solvency is in doubt. Meanwhile, fire victims often complain that insurers and their adjusters are low-balling settlement offers.
Obviously California’s property insurance market needs reform of some kind to improve its viability, but it’s an infinitely complex mélange of financial risks and rewards, truly understood by only a few experts.
Ricardo Lara, a former state legislator, happened to be California’s elected insurance commissioner when the crisis hit home, so by default he had to develop a response while simultaneously fielding complaints from victims and dealing with insurers’ demand for premium increases to cover mounting losses.
Lara has proposed a major overhaul in how insurers calculate their potential losses, seeking premium adjustments and a shift from using only past experience to projecting future losses, which is called “catastrophe modeling.” It is necessary, he said, to persuade insurers to keep writing policies in California and stave off a collapse of the market.
The proposal has heightened Lara’s feud with Consumer Watchdog which began even before his 2018 election.
The organization had sponsored the 1988 ballot measure that converted the insurance commissioner’s position from an appointed job to an elected post and laid down a new set of rules for regulating premiums.
Thereafter, Consumer Watchdog enjoyed close relationships with elected commissioners and was awarded many millions of dollars in “intervenor fees” for participating in premium-setting cases in the Department of Insurance. The nonprofit organization contends that its participation has saved consumers many more dollars than it has collected in fees.
From the onset of Lara’s bid for the office, Consumer Watchdog was critical of him, alleging he was too friendly with insurers. When Lara unveiled his overhaul of the premium setting process, adopting an approach insurers supported, the feud escalated.
Nevertheless, throughout Lara’s tenure, Consumer Watchdog has continued to receive large intervenor fees paid by insurers. However, that may not be true in the future.
Last week Lara proposed another procedural overhaul, this time changing how intervenor fees are calculated and awarded, saying “these reforms will, for the first time, protect consumers from hidden fees, establish clear guidelines for intervenor participation and strengthen oversight of the administrative hearing system to prevent unnecessary delays.”
Lara’s proposal includes redefining the “substantial contribution” standard for awarding intervenor fees, requiring more public reportage of intervenor activities and compensation, requiring officials who preside over rate cases to file regular reports on pending cases and requiring the Department of Insurance to post rate case documents online.
The proposal’s “substantial contribution” element is the one that could affect Consumer Watchdog’s finances.  Lara left no doubt it is aimed at the organization.
Lara described the current process, created by the first elected commissioner, John Garamendi, in the early 1990s as lacking transparency and “dominated by a small number of recurring participants.”
To punctuate that characterization, Lara released a list of 28 rate cases this year, 26 of which resulted in nearly $1.4 million in intervenor fees for Consumer Watchdog.
Consumer Watchdog, not surprisingly, opposes Lara’s new rules.
“If the goal of Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara’s new intervenor compensation regulations is to bring in new intervenors into the process, his regulations will do the opposite,” Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, said in a statement. “By making it harder for intervenors to be paid, he will discourage intervenors from participating.”
Thus the feud, already 6 years old, will continue, at least until term limits end Lara’s tenure and another commissioner is elected next year.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091924-Ricardo-Lara-FG-CM-15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 08:57:22.396010

The Department of Justice claims Inland Empire Health Plan committed fraud by using funds meant to expand the program for non-medical expenses. 


The Inland Empire Health Plan kept $320 million that it should have given back to the federal government, a federal lawsuit claims.
IEHP is responsible for providing Medi-Cal to 1.6 million people throughout the Inland Empire—35% of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties’ combined population.
The complaint claims that IEHP committed fraud by putting money for the medical care of new Medi-Cal patients towards non-medical expenses or the care of existing patients.
The suit also alleges that IEHP created bonus programs for regional health systems using the Medi-Cal expansion money, and used the federal money as a bargaining chip to negotiate better care rates for people with IEHP insurance. 
The agency ended up giving the federal government $30 million back. The complaint charges the final sum of falling $320 million short.
“Today’s lawsuit against IEHP shows our steadfast commitment to hold accountable insurers that brazenly compromise the Medicaid system,” said Acting United States Attorney Bill Essayli. “We will take every measure to restore integrity and accountability to the Medicaid system and ensure that patient care – not financial gain – is the primary focus of our health care system.”
The agency’s attorney, Winston Chan of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, wrote in an emailed statement that the benefits paid through the program were already approved by regulators.
“The allegations are a brazen attempt at revisionist history that is not only wrong as to the facts and law, but also particularly galling in light of the federal government’s wider attacks on state Medicaid funding,” he wrote.
The federal government gave IEHP funds to expand Medi-Cal from Jan. 1, 2014 to June 30, 2016, according to the suit. At least 85% of the funding was intended to pay for the initially high costs of providing healthcare to the newly insured. Any funding from the program not used for those medical costs would have to be paid back to the federal government, the suit says. The complaint claims that IEHP committed fraud by putting the money towards non-medical expenses or the care of people already covered by Medi-Cal. 
“Every MCE dollar that IEHP improperly spent on ineligible expenses—such as other patient populations, consultants, or lawyers—was effectively an extra dollar in IEHP’s pocket because IEHP did not have to spend money from its general budget,” the suit says.
The agency spent $50 million of the funds to attempt to create a health record system for the geographic area served by the IEHP, the suit said. Instead of paying the company, Huron Consulting Group, directly with the funds, IEHP administrators paid providers, who then paid Huron, the complaint said. 
The complaint cited an email from former IEHP’s Chief Executive Officer Bradley Gilbert:
“The funds have to flow through the two county hospitals from IEHP so I can get credit for them as medical costs or the dollars go back to the state. So we will have to set it up so that IEHP pays the hospitals and then the money is used for the data integration effort,” the email said.

The Alabama Securities Commission (ASC) has been receiving a large volume of phone calls regarding an alleged Ponzi scheme involving a prominent Georgia man, ASC Director Amanda Senn said Tuesday.
“We were inundated with phone calls about that scheme. We wanted to make sure the public knew that if we had investors that were harmed, we were monitoring and we would evolve or get engaged if necessary,” Senn said to commissioners during a regular meeting. .
She told the commission the ASC was working with Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen to ensure the money was returned.
“We’re in contact with authorities regularly, so we’re on top of that there and working with the Secretary of State for assistance we can provide there and vice versa,” Senn said.
Senn said in an interview Tuesday ASC is following the case for any updates that interest Alabama.
“We’re still continuing to monitor the information that comes out of the investigation and if there is an Alabama interest that is not protected or addressed by the Georgia investigation, we will certainly enter the fold,” she said.
Edwin Brant Frost IV was accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July of running a $140 million Ponzi scheme that made contributions to at least three Alabama Republicans.
Allen called for all politicians and political action committees (PACs) to return any contributions that were involved with the alleged scheme.
Then Rep. Andrew Sorrell, R-Muscle Shoals, who is now the Alabama State Auditor; Ben Harrison, R-Elkmont and Alabama State Board of Education Member Allen Long are among Republican officials who received contributions from Frost.
The SEC alleged Frost misappropriated over $5 million of investor funds for himself and his family and used $570,000 of the misappropriated funds for political donations. According to campaign financial records, Frost, his family members or his businesses contributed at least $132,000 to Alabama politicians and political action committees (PACs)
Sorrell and his PAC, Alabama Christian Citizens, received at least $71,000 in contributions from the Frost family. Sorrell’s PAC also made a loan of $29,000 to Frost’s company First Liberty Building and Loan.
Harrison received over $21,000 in donations from Brant Frost V in 2022 and State Board of Education member Allen Long received $40,000 from First National Investments, one of Frost’s companies, in December 2023.
Sorrell and Harrison have since  returned the donations to the court-appointed receiver.

And without a more permanent fix to funding the state’s self-insurance fund, the Department of Enterprise Services warns its gap could grow to more than $1.3 billion by mid-2027. By mid-2029, the deficit could be anywhere from $2 billion to $3.2 billion. 
The department is also asking the governor to propose adjusting the insurance fund’s ongoing funding to minimize this shortfall. This would mean hundreds of millions more dollars per year to offset the state’s payouts.
The request is among those state agencies have submitted in recent days to Gov. Bob Ferguson’s office as he prepares a budget proposal ahead of the 2026 legislative session. 
Premiums paid by state agencies finance the liability account, but those premiums haven’t kept pace with surging costs associated with legal claims against the state. In the 2023-25 biennium, the state paid nearly $800 million in settlements and court judgments. Another $110 million went toward legal fees. 
In the most recent fiscal year that ended June 30, the liability fund brought in just under $230 million, mostly from premiums, while spending $595 million, mostly for payouts and legal costs, according to state data.
This predicament has left the account financially underwater, according to the Department of Enterprise Services. 
The state previously poured more than $200 million into it in fiscal year 2022. But the problem has grown worse since then, and the account is now being allowed to operate in a temporary deficit up to about $1 billion with authorization from the budget office, Office of Financial Management spokesperson Hayden Mackley said.
The shortfall represents the extent to which the state is being held to account for decades of alleged misconduct, from wrongful terminations to deaths in prison and mishandled child welfare cases. For example, a Spokane County jury recently ordered the state to pay a woman $42 million for failing to protect her from years of childhood sexual abuse.
So far this year, Washington has paid out about $89 million in these cases, not including that recent $42 million verdict, according to the Department of Enterprise Services. 
The deluge of lawsuits over the past few years shows no signs of slowing down. Last June, an actuary estimated the state faced $2.5 billion in liability from pending claims, straining an already-reeling state budget.
This year, lawmakers skirted the issue of the state’s ballooning payouts as they dealt with a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall. 
By not spending to shore up the liability account, lawmakers punted the issue into next year’s legislative session, which begins in January. 
Legislators next year will pass a supplemental budget, making adjustments to the two-year spending plan approved earlier this year.
Setting the issue aside for this year, “gives us time to work with state agencies to solve this problem over a longer horizon,” said Mackley, with the Office of Financial Management. 
“Before the next legislative session, DES must work with its actuarial services provider, OFM, legislative staff, and other appropriate agencies to review the rates, funding structure, and other potential solutions to address this fund’s insolvency,” Ferguson’s budget director, K.D. Chapman-See, wrote in July to the acting director of the Department of Enterprise Services.
Mackley said the Office of Financial Management will review the budget request. 

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The issue has lawmakers’ attention.
Senate Republicans’ budget lead called the liability payouts “one of the fastest-growing line items in the state’s budget.”
“If there’s bad conduct at state agencies and we’re losing lawsuits because of it, we need to hold folks accountable and the Legislature needs to step in and do its rightful job in that,” Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, said during a panel hosted last week by the Association of Washington Business.
Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek, responded that she hopes to see “some good bipartisan legislation that addresses some of our tort liability.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/money-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-09-24 07:57:44.575138

(Getty Images)For decades, one of the most consistent findings in religion research has been that women tend to be more religious than men. This holds true across dozens of countries and on nearly every measure of religiosity, from how often someone prays to how important faith is in their lives.

Social scientists have struggled to pinpoint a universal cause for this pattern. Theories run the gamut – from the claim that it has something to do with women being more risk averse to the argument that religion offers women support for social responsibilities around birth, death and raising children.
In the past few years, however, survey data in the U.S. has started to tell a different story. Today, there is less empirical evidence that women are more religious than men – a debate I’ve tracked closely as a quantitative scholar of American religion. Looking at Generation Z, in particular, a number of results have raised some eyebrows, pointing toward other divides throughout the country.
Shrinking gap
In 2023, the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life found that 39% of Gen Z women say they do not have a religious affiliation, compared to 34% of men from the same generation. The past several waves of data from the Cooperative Election Study, a national survey, have found that men born after 1990 – a mix of younger millennials and Gen Z – are slightly more likely to attend religious services weekly than women of the same age.
When I give a lecture or presentation, often the first question I’m asked is about this surprising result.
I warn people to take it with a grain of salt. According to data from the 2022 General Social Survey, one of the most well-respected national polls, the opposite is true: among Americans ages 18-45, women are still more likely to attend a house of worship nearly every week. And the Pew Religious Landscape Study, which was released in February 2025, concludes, “While the gender gap in American religion appears to be narrowing, there are still no birth cohorts in which men are significantly more religious than women.”
All together, a growing body of survey evidence suggests that the overall religiosity of young American adults does not vary significantly by gender.
Anecdotal reports about scores of young men flocking to church or joining religious communities like Eastern Orthodoxy seem to grab headlines. However, the idea of a reversal in the gender gap is not supported by evidence – only that it is narrowing.
Drifting apart
If America’s gender gap around religion is changing, perhaps politics can help explain why.
A growing body of survey data suggests that overall, young men are moving further to the right on political matters, while young women are becoming increasingly progressive.
An NBC News poll in April 2025 found that among people ages 30-44, men were about 9 percentage points more likely to approve of Donald Trump’s job performance than women of the same age. Among those ages 18-29, the gap widened to a staggering 21 points.



				This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.			


A few months later, NBC polled nearly 3,000 young Americans about how they define success, asking them to select the top three factors from a list of 13. Overall, men between 18-29 rated “being married” and “having children” slightly higher than women their age. Among Gen Z men who voted for Trump, having children was the most important. Women who voted for Kamala Harris, meanwhile, ranked children near the bottom.
The largest religious traditions in America today are evangelical Protestant Christianity and the Catholic Church. Both groups’ teachings emphasize “traditional” gender roles, marriage and having children. For a growing wave of young progressive women, such teachings are at odds with their desire to make advances in the workplace and society. Some analysts argue that those tensions, as well as views on LGBTQ+ rights, are driving women away from institutional religion.
Opposite directions
As a result, Generation Z may be the most visible manifestation of the growing “God gap” in American politics.
In short, the religious compositions of the two major political parties have gone in opposite directions. In the 1990s, 67% of Republicans said they believed in God without a doubt, and 63% of Democrats said the same, according to my analysis of General Social Survey data. By 2022, certain belief in God had dropped to 39% among Democrats, while holding fairly steady among Republicans, at 63%. Twenty-eight percent of Democrats regularly attend a house of worship, compared to 42% of Republicans; in the 1970s, the gap was only 4 percentage points.
This all points to a broader, potentially more polarized future for the American public. Already, there is evidence that a growing number of people choose their house of worship based on political tribe, not just theological beliefs, making congregations less diverse. Women’s and men’s competing interests and preferences may make it harder to find a suitable partner. Common ground may be harder to find when there are fewer chances for interaction and conversation.
Ultimately, these trends suggest a future where polarization extends beyond politics and into the very fabric of American life – shaping where people worship, who they marry, and how communities form.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)After meeting for just over three cumulative hours this year, the interim courts committee came to a close Tuesday without making any recommendations on its assigned topic. 
The panel of lawmakers and outside appointees — which includes Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta Rush — previously heard two hours of testimony on medical debt. But Sen. Liz Brown, the committee’s chair, said they were still waiting on additional information from hospitals and couldn’t finalize suggestions ahead of the 2026 legislative session.
“I think some of us are still waiting,” Brown said. “The (Indiana) Hospital Association, for example, was asked to get us information on their charity care and their payment systems and how they interface or share that with patients. I have gotten a very small snippet; they’re still surveying their members.”
Consumer groups, debt collectors clash in medical debt hearing

Most of Tuesday’s meeting was spent analyzing how the state will move forward on its weighted caseload management system — in other words, ensuring that judicial duties are spread out evenly across the state’s hundreds of courts. A last-minute addition to House Enrolled Act 1144 eliminated courts and magistrate positions in four counties, reviving the discussion about long-term rebalancing. 
“We need an approach to assess when a reallocation of resources should occur in light of population shifts … where populations are moving towards more urban areas and away from rural areas,” said Grant County Circuit Court Judge Mark Spitzer. 
Spitzer is a committee member and also the president of the Indiana Judges Association. He discussed the considerations needed to support overutilized and underutilized county-level courts and methods of measuring demand across various case types. 
A report annually submitted to the Indiana Supreme Court, for example, found that the average Level 6 felony — the lowest level — took 98 minutes of a judge’s time from start to finish. Spitzer shared that judges, especially those in smaller counties, may also need time to manage offices, probation or community corrections.
“When I first became a judge, I sort of thought that I’d kind of sit in my ivory tower to make decisions. But the administrative tasks that you undergo … there’s a lot,” Spitzer said.
For example, an HVAC outage in his courthouse or a conversation with someone interested in opening a sober living home. 
“None of that’s case-related time, but it’s really important for us to do as judges,” Spitzer said.

With Governor Rick Snyder and then-State Superintendent Brian Whiston, we built a broad coalition of more than 300 leaders across business, labor, education, and economic development. Together, we helped students gain the skills needed to pursue successful careers while providing employers with the talent they needed to grow.
That comprehensive, statewide approach worked. But today, Michigan’s skills gap is once again widening, and the stakes are higher than ever.
Labor force participation stands at just 61.6%, below the national average of 62.3%. Thousands of our high school graduates leave each year for opportunities in other states. Without coordinated, long-term action, Michigan risks losing not only our future workforce but also the vitality and competitiveness of our economy.
This is why the recent Michigan House budget is so concerning. By eliminating funding for critical apprenticeship programs, the Going PRO Talent Fund, and $5.7 million in funding for Youth Solutions and its Jobs for Michigan’s Graduates (JMG) program, lawmakers are jeopardizing proven strategies that connect individuals to opportunity and employers to talent. What’s more concerning is that these are the exact programs lawmakers should be doubling down on because they prioritize training Michigan residents and investing in small businesses instead of chasing large out-of-state projects that rarely come to fruition.
Youth Solutions is a statewide nonprofit that impacts more than 14,000 young people in 98 communities each year through our three service lines: Jobs for Michigan’s Graduates (JMG), Youth Solutions Foundations, and Connecting Careers to the Core. JMG, our flagship program, directly serves 5,370 youth annually, equipping them with the tools, confidence, and skills they need to succeed after high school.
And these programs work. Over 16 years, JMG has consistently delivered outcomes well above the state average:

99% high school graduation rate
94% of youth engaged in postsecondary education, employment, or the military after high school
64% pursuing further education leading to degrees, certifications, or apprenticeships

In partner schools implementing our Foundations model since 2022, career awareness and planning have increased by double digits — up to 49% in some areas.
These results are not only strong, but they are also efficient. For every $1 Michigan invests in JMG, Youth Solutions leverages at least another $1 from federal, private, and local sources — doubling the impact of taxpayer dollars.
And the long-term return on investment is immeasurable: fewer young people relying on social services or unemployment benefits, fewer entering the corrections system, and more contributing to a stronger economy.
But behind every number is a story. Take Nolan Henson, for example. Nolan first connected with JMG as a freshman in high school, unsure of what direction his life would take. With the guidance of his JMG Specialist, Matt Campbell, Nolan discovered more than a program — he found a community. Through JMG, he built his résumé, explored career aspirations, and engaged in volunteer opportunities. Most importantly, he found a network of mentors and peers that continued to support him well beyond high school.
Nolan quickly grew from participant to leader. He helped launch Youth Solutions’ Youth Advisory Council, giving young people a voice in shaping the very services designed to support them. Inspired by the quote, “Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree 100 years ago,” Nolan came to see JMG as that tree — a foundation planted by mentors who believed in the power of youth. After high school, he pursued degrees in public and nonprofit administration and sociology, with a minor in leadership. Today, Nolan is Grants Manager at the Boys & Girls Club of Greater Flint, continuing his passion for youth development and community impact. He also serves on Youth Solutions’ board of directors, guiding the very organization that once guided him.
Eliminating funding for these programs means eliminating opportunities for youth like Nolan. It weakens the talent pipeline that employers rely on, and it undermines Michigan’s ability to compete for business investment and growth. As Michigan’s elected officials work to pass a bipartisan state budget ahead of the October 1st deadline, I hope they prioritize those programs that help train Michigan residents for good-paying careers, fund programs that help mainstreet over Wall Street, and pay special attention to our small businesses who are in desperate need of a skilled workforce to be able to compete in the global economy.
Michigan has a choice: we can divest from proven solutions and watch our talent gap widen, or we can recommit to smart, coordinated investments in career-focused education and workforce development. The answer should be clear and bipartisan: Let’s build a future where every Michigander is prepared for good-paying jobs, where small businesses have the skilled workforce they need to grow, compete, and succeed and where young people can stay and thrive in Michigan.

Angie Craig speaks at the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party booth at the Minnesota State Fair on Aug. 28, 2025. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Weaving through the crowded thoroughfare of the Minnesota State Fair, U.S. Rep. Angie Craig spotted her potential Republican opponent in the 2026 race for U.S. Senate, Royce White, who towered over the crowd in an “Alligator Alcatraz” hat and “Jesus is King” tee shirt. 
Craig darted over to White with staff, security and media in tow. She reached out for a handshake. White declined. 
“We’re done with the nice politics,” White said, launching into a rant about the security of voting machines.
“This isn’t who we are as Minnesotans,” Craig interrupted. 
But what if it is?
Craig, who has represented the south metro in the U.S. House since 2019, is balancing her party’s fight against President Donald Trump with a desire to find common ground with her Republican colleagues. She’s banking on the idea that Minnesotans want a senator who will be a counterforce to the political polarization that has defined Congress in recent decades. 
Her primary opponent is Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who is running to Craig’s left and promising to take a no-compromise approach to governing and especially opposing Trump.
Craig handed out Sweet Martha’s cookies at the Republicans’ State Fair booth, held town halls in Republican districts and touted her bipartisan work on agriculture, immigration and public safety at Farmfest; simultaneously, she ramped up her anti-Trump messaging and criticized the GOP’s giant tax bill that will increase health care costs and cut federal spending on food aid.

She explains her approach in a metaphor: one hand open, and the other closed in a fist. 
“We have to have a hand extended and start listening to the voters who’ve left the Democratic Party to better understand why they’ve left. And then we have to have a fist closed, fighting a trillion dollars in Medicaid cuts or fighting $186 billion in SNAP cuts,” Craig said. “We have to be able to do both at the same time.”
From the South to the House
Craig grew up in mobile homes in eastern Arkansas. Her mom and grandmother raised her, and at times the family relied on food assistance to get by, Craig said. 
She attended the University of Memphis, where she studied journalism and was the editor of the student newspaper. After graduation, she spent a few years reporting on schools and local government before transitioning to corporate communications. 
For whatever her bipartisan bona fides, Craig was on the front lines of the nation’s culture war decades ago, and with the highest stakes imaginable.

In 1997, Craig and her former partner were involved in a lawsuit over the custody of a child they planned to adopt. The child’s biological grandparents also wanted custody, and a Tennessee court would decide which couple would get the baby. The infant’s biological mother wanted to give the child to Craig and her partner, but the grandparents argued in court that Craig and her partner were unfit to be parents because of their “lesbian lifestyle.”
An appeals court ruled 2-1 that Craig and her partner should take custody of the child. (Craig and that partner split in 2006 and shared custody; Craig married her wife Cheryl in 2008, and they have four sons and three grandchildren.)
Craig moved to St. Paul in 2005 to take a job with St. Jude Medical, now Abbott Laboratories.
She ran for Congress for the first time in 2016, narrowly losing to Republican then-U.S. Rep. Jason Lewis. Craig beat Lewis in 2018, and grew her margin of victory over the years, winning her most recent re-election by 13 points. 
Minnesota’s 2nd Congressional District includes some Twin Cities suburbs — Woodbury, Eagan, Shakopee — and stretches down to Northfield and nearly Mankato. Her district’s demographics largely mirror the racial and educational breakdown of the state as the whole, and it contains urban, suburban and rural areas.
Her approach to legislating has been representative of the purple district she comes from — in 2023, she was among the top 20% of House members in the Lugar Index, a measure of bipartisanship among members of Congress, compiled by Georgetown University and The Lugar Center, a think tank founded by the old-school Indiana Republican Richard Lugar. 
Rep. Angie Craig speaks with supporters at the Minnesota State Fair on Aug. 28, 2025. (Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)
Her pitch to voters has three tenets: addressing the affordability crisis, improving public safety and reforming Washington. 
“Everybody’s sick of Washington. Like, I just got there, and I’m trying to change it, and have been since I walked through the door,” Craig said. 
She supports banning members of Congress from trading stocks, flying first class and becoming lobbyists when they leave Congress. She also wants to ban gerrymandering, establish an independent redistricting commission in every state and reduce the influence of corporate money in politics, she said.
Craig frequently co-sponsors bills with Republicans — this is the basis of the Lugar Index — and has broken with the majority of her caucus on immigration, border security and law enforcement. She was among the 95 House Democrats (out of 213) who voted for a recent resolution in honor of Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated on Sept. 10. 
Craig was one of 48 House Democrats, and the only Democratic member of Congress from Minnesota, to vote in favor of the Laken Riley Act, which requires the Department of Homeland Security to detain and deport immigrants arrested or charged with certain crimes. It was the first bill President Donald Trump signed into law during his second term. 
She was also among the first handful of Democrats in Congress to call on former President Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race.
JoAnn Pasternack, who has volunteered for every one of Craig’s campaigns, including her loss in 2016, said she appreciates the way Craig listens to her constituents, including the farmers around the state she represents as the Democratic ranking member on the House agriculture committee.
“You don’t get things done by being way to the left and fighting with everybody, including your own party,” Pasternack said. “You’ve got to listen, you’ve got to work with people. You’ve got to give and take, because compromise is a good thing.”
‘We are in a war when it comes to winning elections’
Craig was the lone Democrat among crypto executives and Republican lawmakers in Jackson Hole in August, where crypto boosters including Eric Trump gathered to discuss energy infrastructure and regulatory policy.
The House agriculture committee oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates digital commodities like cryptocurrencies along with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Craig appeared on a panel titled: “Seeking CLARITY: A Bipartisan Discussion on Market Structure.”
She “told the audience that inviting digital assets into the financial system should be apolitical,” the American Prospect reported. “Her presence on the cusp of an expensive campaign suggested otherwise.”
The biggest outside spender in Craig’s 2024 re-election campaign was a crypto-backed PAC called FairShake, which poured nearly $1 million into the race in support of Craig.
Craig has said publicly that “we can no longer wait to regulate digital assets,” and that she opposes the president’s involvement in crypto schemes.
Brookings Institution Fellow Tonantzin Carmona recently warned what may be coming: “When regulation is relaxed and industry gains political influence, risk-taking often escalates, and the public ends up paying the price.”

Craig’s opponent in the Democratic primary, Flanagan, has pledged not to accept donations from corporate political action committees, or PACs. 
Craig isn’t doing that. 
“I’m not going to tie one hand behind my back,” she said. “We are in a war when it comes to winning elections right now. We can’t stop them if we don’t win.”
Dave Wellstone, son of the late Sen. Paul Wellstone, has refurbished his father’s iconic green campaign bus and plans to use it to support Craig. He’s friends with Flanagan, he said — Flanagan cites the elder Wellstone as one of her political mentors and inspirations.
So why bring the bus out for Craig? 
“I watched her outperform the rest of the ticket in a district that was tough. I’ve watched how we’ve lost a lot of Democrats in this state — namely the Iron Range in outstate Minnesota — to the Republicans, and they should be ours,” Wellstone said. “I think she can win.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P1241668-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 07:57:44.575138

Blackledge says he prides himself on his skill and good patient care, and that critics have harassed him and his staff.","After years of being ridiculed for her prominent nose, Marisa Hankins decided to undergo plastic surgery. 
“My whole entire life, I was made fun of for it,” said the 44-year-old hairstylist from Biloxi.

But the relief she felt after the 2021 rhinoplasty was short-lived. Less than a year later, a stitch inside her body ruptured through the skin’s surface and the area below it caved in, leaving a dimple at the end of her nose. 
Her surgeon, Dr. Adair Blackledge of Blackledge Face Center in Jackson, offered to correct the issue – going as far as volunteering to drive three hours to Biloxi on a weekend to look at it. But Hankins said she decided she didn’t feel comfortable receiving further medical care from him.

Hankins was wary of some aspects of her surgery, she said — how rushed the procedure felt, the oral sedative medications she was given that did not kick in until after surgery was over, and the “excruciating pain” she felt taking out her stitches using the staple remover Blackledge sent home with her. She had already returned to Jackson twice for minor issues.
“It was a very valuable lesson in vanity,” said Hankins, who uses movie special effects makeup to cover the cavity.
“You go there to get something fixed that you don’t like about yourself,” she said. “And then, they make it worse.” 
Hankins is not the only patient who has voiced concerns about the care Blackledge gave. In interviews with Mississippi Today, six others said they experienced prominent scarring or sought medical attention for wounds or complications after surgeries performed by Blackledge. They recounted quick procedures, results that didn’t last and repeated revisions, or procedures to correct or improve past surgeries.

Mississippi Today spoke to other patients with similar concerns who declined to be named because they did not want people to know they had cosmetic surgeries or said they felt embarrassed. 
Blackledge, a well-known facial plastic surgeon who has practiced in the Jackson area for 22 years, told Mississippi Today for months that he could not locate a written transfer agreement he said he had with St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson. Such an agreement is a state requirement for surgeons who sedate their patients in their offices, and an agreement is widely considered a critical patient safety measure for office-based surgery.
The agreements lay out a plan for transportation and treatment of patients at a hospital in case of medical complications or emergencies.
Meredith Bailess, a spokesperson for St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson, said on Aug. 20 the hospital did not have a transfer agreement with Blackledge Face Center and was unable to locate an older agreement.
Blackledge provided a written transfer agreement with St. Dominic to Mississippi Today on Tuesday, signed that day, after Mississippi Today inquired about it for the third time in three months.
He has not faced any public disciplinary action by the Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure, the state agency that licenses and regulates physicians. 
Over the past year, Blackledge has faced an onslaught of patient complaints on social media. Some patients, including Hankins, said they believed they were uniquely unfortunate until they discovered online that others had similar experiences.
In emails responding to questions from Mississippi Today, Blackledge described the past year as a “social media barrage,” in which he, his family and his staff members have been attacked and threatened by patients.

“I believe that what set all this off was a person who considered herself a social media influencer who was initially positive and then turned negative and began the frenzy against me,” he said. 
Blackledge said he believes the treatment he provided to the patients interviewed for this article met the standard of care expected of a facial plastic surgeon, and emphasized that they represent only a small portion of his patient population.
“The past year has been an extremely frustrating one for me, and I really feel like I am being painted in a false light by patients who had apparently unreasonable expectations of the results that could be achieved,” he said.
Blackledge said his commitment to patient privacy has prevented him from responding publicly to accusations made about his practice, but he does his best to treat every patient the way he would want a physician to treat him or a family member.
“When you contacted our clinic, it was actually a relief to me that I would finally be able to tell a limited version of my side of this story,” he said to Mississippi Today.
Blackledge’s training and credentials
There are few requirements for doctors to practice facial plastic surgery in Mississippi. Across the U.S., licensed physicians are given the leeway to practice any specialty of their choosing.
Some opt to gain additional, elective credentialing to certify their training in a specialty field. About 90% of U.S. physicians opt to become board certified, which requires that doctors complete an accredited residency program, pass an examination and do continuing education throughout their careers to maintain their certification. 
Board certification is not required, but some experts argue it is an important measure to consider when choosing a plastic surgeon or assessing their qualifications.
Blackledge began his career with a residency at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in otolaryngology, a surgical subspecialty focused on the ears, nose and throat. Part of the program was devoted solely to facial plastic and reconstructive training, he said. 
Some otolaryngologists, or ENTs, go on to practice facial plastic surgery, which is itself a subspecialty of otolaryngology. But Blackledge said he chose not to pursue board certification in otolaryngology because he was advised to distance himself from the field when he was starting out as a facial plastic surgeon.

“I simply am not an otolaryngologist and do not think it would be fair to the field of otolaryngology or myself for me to be board certified in that field,” he said, citing the fact that he has not inserted ear tubes, performed a tonsillectomy, removed head and neck cancer or performed sinus surgery since his residency. 
Board certification improves patient safety by showing that a doctor has trained extensively in a field and demonstrated they are capable of performing certain procedures, said Dr. Ben McIntyre, a professor of plastic surgery at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and the director of its plastic surgery residency program. McIntyre is board certified in general surgery and plastic surgery.
“Physicians, we have a great duty to practice good medicine, safe medicine, and not harm patients by not doing things that we’re not approved or credentialed to do or have no training in,” McIntyre said. 
McIntyre, like all of the physicians interviewed for this story, spoke generally about plastic surgery, but did not comment on Blackledge’s practice. 
The Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure administrative code states that physicians performing office-based surgery “must be able to document satisfactory completion of surgical training such as Board certification or Board eligibility,” neither of which Blackledge holds. The board did not respond to questions about what other certifications are acceptable.
Blackledge said his residency and fellowship training clearly document extensive training in facial plastic surgery. He advertises himself as a fellowship-trained facial plastic surgeon.
Blackledge spent the year after his residency doing a fellowship in facial plastic surgery with Dr. E. Gaylon McCollough of Gulf Shores, Alabama. 
He said he took and passed the American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery examination in 2003 after his fellowship, but he did not gain the credential because applicants must first be certified in otolaryngology or plastic surgery. Both fields are recognized by the primary organization that certifies specialty boards in the U.S., while facial plastic surgery is not.
Physicians must also submit a record of at least two years’ clinical experience and 100 operative reports for peer review in order to become board certified in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery.
Blackledge said he also shadowed Dr. Frank Kamer of Beverly Hills, California, for two weeks in 2003. 
He returned to Jackson in 2003 to practice facial plastic surgery with Dr. George J. Smith of Faces PLLC. In the early years of his career, from about 2003 to 2009, the company’s website represented Blackledge as a board-certified facial plastic surgeon, according to web archives of the page.
Blackledge told Mississippi Today he was unaware the website represented him as such and had no part in its development. In 2009, his practice and Smith’s separated. Smith died in 2023. 
There are few regulations guiding what procedures a doctor can or cannot perform in their office or what credentials they must hold, said Dr. Heather Faulkner, a board certified general and plastic surgeon and associate professor at Emory University School of Medicine who chairs the American Society of Plastic Surgeons’ patient safety committee. 
Many hospitals and insurance companies require doctors to be board-certified to gain hospital privileges or register as providers. But neither is required for office-based, elective surgeries paid in cash, she said, which places the onus on patients to evaluate doctors’ training and certifications. 
“There’s a hard stop (in hospitals), but in a private office, there’s no hard stop there,” Faulkner said. “And there’s no law that says that you can’t practice a specialty that you’re not trained in.” 
Speedy surgeries, no general anesthesia
From his office on Lakeland Drive, Blackledge performed 719 surgeries in 2024, according to a post on his Instagram page. He told Mississippi Today that he has performed 12,000 facelifts and rhinoplasties – a pace of at least two such procedures per working day – in his 22-year career. 
Courtney Sampson, now 42, traveled from Colorado for a deep plane facelift focused on the lower cheek and neck with Blackledge in 2024. She was surprised by the time it took Blackledge to complete the procedure – about an hour and 15 minutes, according to medical records she shared with Mississippi Today.
The deep plane facelift, a procedure that has risen in popularity in recent years, repositions the layer of fat, muscle and fascia below the skin by releasing it from retaining ligaments. Doctors describe it as an aggressive technique that yields more natural-looking results than traditional skin lifts but carries risks due to proximity to facial nerves.

Patient records show Hankins’ rhinoplasty and a facelift, which were performed in one sitting, took 65 minutes total. Other patient records reviewed by Mississippi Today showed a neck lift completed in 40 minutes and facelift and brow lift in an hour and 20 minutes. Each procedure involved different techniques and parts of the face. 
It takes the average plastic surgeon a little over four hours to perform a facelift, said Dr. Alan Matarasso, a board-certified New York plastic surgeon and president of the Plastic Surgery Foundation, a research and education organization affiliated with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. 
Three other plastic surgeons interviewed for this story estimated that the average facelift takes about four to five hours. 
Blackledge said there is no way to compare the amount of time a facelift takes to another because each one involves different techniques and areas of the face. The patient’s weight and age, staff’s skill level, whether general anesthesia is used and whether a surgery is a revision are all factors that influence the amount of time a procedure takes. 
A procedure like Sampson’s, which was focused on the lower cheek and neck, can take less time than a full facelift, he said. 
Blackledge said he was taught that taking more than two hours for a facelift suggests a lack of technical skill and can lead to more complications. He said he believes he is well above the “average plastic surgeon,” both in terms of where he trained and the number of procedures he has performed, adding that ENTs who focus solely on facial plastic surgery may be more efficient than plastic surgeons who perform other procedures. 
“I do not believe that there should be a specific time it takes to perform a facelift,” he said. 
Blackledge performs major surgeries, including facelifts, without general anesthesia. He instructs some patients to remove their staples themselves. For patients who have traveled to Mississippi, he does post-operative visits at their hotel rooms. 
Some surgeons employ these practices, but they aren’t common, said McIntyre, the director of UMMC’s plastic surgery residency program.
Blackledge said he prefers not to completely sedate his patients so they can follow commands and move their mouths during surgery, which allows him to see tissue position and avoid important nerves. He said he administers local anesthetics where he plans to make incisions, and in a minority of cases – about 10% – he inserts an IV, primarily for fluids. 
The medical community is divided on the safety of this method. Some plastic surgeons say this method can be safe, while others caution against it for complex procedures, like facelifts. 
“Most surgeons are going to want to do (facelifts) in an operating room under general anesthesia,” McIntyre said. Operating on the face poses risks of nerve damage and bleeding, he said, and sudden patient movement could lead to injury of the mouth, nose or throat. 
Matarasso said general anesthesia is not always necessary for procedures like facelifts, but recommended monitoring by an anesthesiologist for patient safety and comfort. 
Blackledge said he believes general anesthesia increases the likelihood of risks, complications and dissatisfaction because a plastic surgeon can’t determine if he or she is getting close to nerves or if the surgery is causing asymmetry when a patient is unresponsive. He said it also has a greater risk of injury to the throat. 
Several patients told Mississippi Today they chose Blackledge’s practice specifically because he does not use general anesthesia. 
Blackledge uses a sleeping pill and a sedative, anti-anxiety medication – Ambien and Valium – to sedate most patients before surgery, a drug combination he said he has used his entire career. 
The regimen “provides pain control while allowing the patient to be conscious and responsive as well as relaxed in which could otherwise be a harrowing experience,” he said. 
McIntyre warned that combining sleeping pills with sedatives could dangerously depress the central nervous system. The combination can be difficult to control because the absorption of oral medications varies by patient, and the effects can peak after surgery – when patients are no longer being monitored – potentially making it difficult for them to breathe. 
Dr. Gianfranco Frojo is a board-certified Virginia plastic surgeon currently serving as one of the directors of The Aesthetic Foundation, the research arm of The Aesthetic Society, who has studied the use of oral sedation and local anesthesia for a limited facelift technique. 
He said he does not recommend using oral sedation for complex procedures, like deep plane facelifts, because there is a greater risk of damage to facial nerves. He said he doesn’t currently use the method in any facelift he performs.
He said he has never heard of sleeping pills being used for preoperative sedation and warned that patients could fall asleep, making it more difficult to protect the airway.
“I would be very alarmed if someone was prescribing Ambien for patients prior to procedures that they need to be awake for,” he said. 
Blackledge said he was trained using this regimen and monitors respirations and oxygen levels throughout surgeries, which is documented in medical records. He said he has never had an adverse event related to anesthesia administration.
Blackledge said the medications he administers, which have been shown to cause amnesia, may have led some patients to misremember parts of their surgeries. 
Four patients told Mississippi Today they did not recall changing out of their clothes and into a surgical gown for their surgeries.
It’s typical for patients to change into a surgical gown before complex procedures to minimize the chance of infection, McIntyre said.
Sampson, who received a facelift from Blackledge in 2024, arrived wearing a zip-up sweatshirt. She said she was conscious for most of the surgery but does not remember changing into a gown. 
After the surgery, the hood of her sweatshirt was covered in blood, she recalled. A photograph of Sampson taken 10 minutes after surgery shows her recovering in the sweatshirt. 
Blackledge said his nurse and surgical assistants change patients into surgical gowns after they have been sedated and help them back into their clothes after surgery. 
Frojo said patients typically change into gowns themselves before surgery begins. 
“When the patient is sedated, the surgery should be happening, and nothing else,” he said. 
‘You’ll be shocked’ 
Blackledge’s website casts him as an out-of-the-ordinary doctor who sets himself apart with a personal approach to patient care.
“You’ll be shocked when he responds to your texts, even after-hours,” reads the site. “You’ll be thankful when he visits your home or hotel to change your dressing after your facelift. Call him crazy, call him obsessive, call him the consummate Southern gentleman: Adair Blackledge will transform your expectations of facial aesthetics and patient care.”
Blackledge said he has operated a charity since 2008 providing free removal of tattoos from sex trafficking survivors and free removal of gang-related tattoos from formerly incarcerated men. 
He has over 20,000 followers on Facebook.
Blackledge said his availability to patients before and after surgery and his willingness to accommodate them financially sets him apart from other physicians. 
Kellie James, now 56, traveled from Sugar Land, Texas, for a lower face and neck lift with Blackledge in 2022. The quotes she received for surgery in the Houston area were more than double Blackledge’s. More importantly, she said, she was impressed with the before and after photographs posted on his social media.
She said she appreciated Blackledge’s bedside manner and availability after surgery. She returned to Blackledge for another procedure in 2023 and said she would recommend him to a friend. 
“He literally turned me back about 20 years, in my opinion,” she said. 
Patients also said they were drawn to Blackledge’s charming personality and ability to remember details about them, which made them trust and feel comfortable around him.
But some said they felt they had not asked enough questions or did not understand all the risks. 
Some said they expected to be more sedated than they were, remember crying out in pain, were surprised by the location of incisions or staples, or did not expect Blackledge to use staples, rather than sutures, in certain areas of their face. 
Blackledge said he spends a significant amount of time with patients in consultations, ensuring they are a reasonable candidate for the procedure and they understand the risks and where incisions will be made. He said he recommends surgery to less than two-thirds of the patients he consults with and marks on patients before surgery begins. 
Summer Price, now 47, traveled from Denver in 2023 for a facelift and brow lift with Blackledge after reading good reviews on social media. She said she was initially happy with the result, which made her look much younger, and she recommended Blackledge’s practice to several friends.

But she said she was concerned with the placement of her incisions and staples. 
They did not match the drawing Blackledge provided to her, which showed a few stitches hidden in her hairline and others placed behind her ears but concealed by hair. But the incision behind her ears draped about an inch below her hairline, and there were more staples than she expected.
“So many staples – staples upon staples upon staples,” she said. “There was no rhyme or reason.” 
A year and a half later, pearly white scars trailed along Price’s hairline, wrapped around her ears and extended behind them, with white scars dotting areas where staples were placed, photographs show. Her face initially appeared lifted but had mostly returned to its previous appearance after four months, she said.

Price said the placement of her scars was debilitating, and she has undergone several scar camouflage tattoo sessions. She stopped wearing her hair up, and didn’t go to the gym for a year and a half because of embarrassment. She doesn’t socialize as frequently as she used to and struggles with a crippling anxiety that she might make the wrong decision. 
“I can’t move on from it, because it’s a constant reminder,” she said. 
Blackledge said the pictures he has of Price’s scars show an “extremely reasonable result” and emphasized that she was initially satisfied and recommended his practice to friends.
He said that there is no way to avoid the potential of excessive scar formation in any surgical procedure and said he uses techniques during surgery and post-operatively, like creams, to avoid and address scarring. 
Frojo, the Virginia plastic surgeon who is one of the directors of The Aesthetic Foundation, said facelift scars are planned to be hidden and shouldn’t be identifiable by someone who doesn’t know they are there. Placing incisions at natural transitions in a person’s skin and proper tension can prevent noticeable scarring, he said. 
Most red or sensitive scarring matures within a year, said McIntyre. Abnormal scars, like keloids and hypertrophic scars, may take longer. 
Patients signed consent forms, which are typical for such surgeries, acknowledging they discussed the potential risks and complications with Blackledge, including scarring, infection and numbness, that no results were guaranteed and that in rare instances, a revisionary procedure might be required. 
“These consent forms constitute documentary proof of the consent process, because memories fade with time, especially when a patient has a result that is less than she was hoping for,” Blackledge said.
Exempt from scrutiny
Anna Ford, now 34, of Poplar Bluff, Missouri, was full of excitement the day of her surgery to slim her nose with Blackledge in 2020. Her nose had troubled her for years, and the procedure was financially out of reach for her in nearby St. Louis, where she said cosmetic plastic surgery is costly. 
Her nose was fuller than she had hoped after the procedure with Blackledge, but he offered to revise it at no charge. 
After returning to Mississippi in 2021 for a revision surgery, Ford’s nose became red and swollen in winter months and she said she occasionally caught whiffs of a “foul odor.” She said she felt chronically fatigued and depressed.

Nearly three years after the procedure, her nose darkened and became inflamed for weeks before an abscess in her nose burst, leaving an indentation that remains at the tip of her nose today. She said she then realized that the smell had been coming from inside her nose. 
“It smelled like death,” she said. 
Ford’s revision occurred six days after Hankins’, the rhinoplasty patient who now uses special effects makeup to cover the cavity at the end of her nose. Both women experienced sutures bursting through their skin and have a similar indentation at the tip of the nose.  
A slew of doctors’ appointments revealed that Ford had a chronic infection inside her nose. This spring, she underwent surgery to remove the infection after multiple rounds of antibiotics failed to clear it. When it persisted, an infectious disease specialist recommended inserting a long-term intravenous line to deliver antibiotics over a period of weeks. 
Three days after it was inserted, she said she felt her energy return. “I was like, ‘Is this what normal people feel like?’” she said. “I was so sick for so long and thought it was depression the whole time. But it was an infection.”

Ford said she has had no feeling in her nose since the 2021 surgery. 
Blackledge said Ford removed her bandages sooner than she was instructed to, which resulted in a defect in her skin. He said he could not speak to the subsequent issues Ford has faced, but noted that every surgical procedure carries the risk of infection.
“The fact that an infection occurred post-operatively is not proof of inappropriate care,” he said.
He said Ford sent an intimidating message threatening “karma” to one of his nurses, an example of the “mob mentality” of unhappy patients he has faced. Ford said she sent the message because she is angry and thinks he and his staff are responsible for the infection.
Other patients who spoke to Mississippi Today said they experienced various side effects after surgery, including noticeable scarring, a cheek implant bursting through the skin, a loss of feeling in the neck that has lasted five years, scars that badly itch, and wounds that opened and required further medical attention. 
Every surgery carries the risk of complications, or health problems that arise after a procedure. A recent review of 59 scientific articles studying rates of complications in facelifts indicated that unfavorable scarring is the most common and occurs in about 5% of cases. 
About 3% of rhinoplasties result in complications, including abscesses, infection and adverse esthetic outcomes, and 15% of patients have revisions, according to a recent paper studying complication rates in rhinoplasties.
Blackledge said he believes his complication rate is far below the national average. 
“Given the recognized complication rate in various facial plastic procedures, and the number of procedures I perform each year, I understand there will be patients who are not happy with their result,” Blackledge said. “But that is true for every doctor, regardless of the field.”
He said many problems, like redness and numbness, are not unusual and can be corrected with additional treatments or heal with time. He said he discusses the possibility of undesired scars with each patient and has no recollection of receiving a complaint about an implant bursting through the skin. 
Implants and stitches bursting through the skin occur very rarely, but do happen, McIntyre said. 
Blackledge said he has never been sued in 22 years of medical practice. Mississippi Today searched state and federal court records and could not locate any suits filed against Blackledge pertaining to patient care. 
There is little comprehensive research that clearly demonstrates how frequently cosmetic facial plastic surgery patients are dissatisfied or make complaints after their procedures. One recent article studying a sample of 2,000 patient reviews on social media showed about 8% of reviews were negative, with most citing dissatisfaction with the outcome.
Research shows that high volumes of patient complaints can predict higher rates of medical complications and legal suits, said Dr. Scott Hultman, director of the department of plastic and reconstructive surgery at WakeMed Health and Hospitals in Raleigh, North Carolina. Hultman has conducted research on unsolicited patient complaints made about surgeons to hospitals. 
Hospitals can use complaint data to intervene and modify surgeons’ behavior, he said. But there are few avenues for patients to make formal complaints in office-based surgery settings, where private practice surgeons are generally exempt from such oversight. 
“That’s one of the loopholes in medicine,” he said. “…They often will escape scrutiny for a while until enough patients complain or there’s a malpractice case.” 
Blackledge said there are several avenues for patients to make complaints, including lawsuits and to government agencies. 
‘You’re just wanting them to fix it and fix it’ 
Vicky Pitts, now 55, underwent a neck lift with Blackledge in 2020. Weeks after the procedure, the Laurel resident said she noticed her face drop. 
“Everything went sour,” said Pitts, who said it appeared her surgery resulted in no change in her appearance. She reached out to Blackledge about her concerns, beginning a string of revisions and touch-up surgeries that occurred for more than two years.

One study estimates that early relapses after facelift surgery occur in about 2% of cases.
Blackledge said his facelifts are conservative and he explains to patients he can always revise them – at no charge – if they are not pleased. He said because adverse outcomes can happen, he makes himself as available as possible to his patients. 
He said he also pays for patients’ flights and accommodations for revisions. 
“I have done this for over ten years and believe patients appreciate it,” Blackledge said.

Pitts said she was grateful that Blackledge provided the revisions free of charge, because she couldn’t afford to go to another surgeon after paying for the original procedure.
But some of her revisions came with their own problems, she said. On several occasions, her stitches popped out, leaving incisions gaping open. Once, she went to urgent care to have a wound sutured again. 
It was difficult for Pitts to explain why she kept returning, even when she kept experiencing difficulties and wasn’t seeing the results she wanted. She said she felt vulnerable. 
“You’re just wanting them to fix it and fix it,” she said.
Social media brushfire
Scores of alleged patients of Blackledge have shared stories and photographs of their surgery experiences in a members-only Facebook group created in 2023. 
The concerned patients began reaching a wider audience early this year after sharing images on a public Instagram page that now has over 12,000 followers. Price, an administrator of the page, said she received dozens of messages from former patients. 
“It was like a brushfire,” she said. “I couldn’t even keep up.”
Blackledge said he faced no issues regarding his practice until the social media attacks from the past year. 
“I didn’t suddenly forget how to do what I was trained to do, and the process and protocols for patient care that I have been using successfully for over 20 years and 12,000 procedures didn’t suddenly become ineffective,” he said. 
He said he located social media posts and pictures from people who have never been his patients and that many made inaccurate and disparaging comments. 
Some patients said the Facebook group helped them feel less alone.
“I was glad that he didn’t just single me out, because that’s how I felt for the longest,” said Jill Hamilton, now 47, from Nashville, who said she endured discomfort in her face for over a year after Blackledge inserted cheek implants during a 2023 facelift revision surgery with Blackledge – her third revision with him. One implant burst through her skin in 2024, she said. 
Blackledge said he was never contacted by Hamilton about the implant bursting through her skin. 
On social media, patients encouraged one another to make formal complaints about their care with Blackledge to the Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure.
State medical boards are often one of the only places to lodge complaints against office-based surgeons who are not board-certified, Hultman said, because there is no hospital or credentialing board to which complaints can be reported. It can also be a longer, more cumbersome process.
Price said she was interviewed earlier this year by the board after she submitted a complaint. But five other patients told Mississippi Today their complaints were dismissed by the board or they did not receive a response. 
In an email, board attorney Paul Barnes declined to say whether the board is investigating any of the complaints, citing its policy not to comment on pending investigations. Complaints are not public record while a disciplinary investigation is pending and remain confidential if no action is taken. 
Sampson, who traveled to Mississippi for a facelift last year, said she saw little change in her appearance and has “horrible scars” from her procedure. Her experience has caused her to lose trust in the medical system, which she believes has done too little to protect her and other patients.
She said it feels that rather than being taken seriously for their claims, she and other patients have been deemed vindictive for sharing their stories. 
“That is not the case at all,” she said. “I just don’t want this to continue happening.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/22163220/Blackledge-Face-Center-FeatImage-06.jpg,,,2025-09-24 07:57:44.575138

Claudia Kehoe is the only officer listed in organization filings at the Missouri Ethics Commission for Her Health, Her Future PAC, created Sept. 9.
The campaign’s goal is to pass the measure placed on the ballot by lawmakers, which would repeal the amendment passed in November that restored abortion rights. The legislative proposal will appear on a 2026 statewide ballot as Amendment 3, the same name held by the previous abortion rights amendment. 
“The Her Health, Her Future PAC was launched with one clear and unwavering mission,” said Mike Hafner, who was an advisor to Kehoe’s gubernatorial campaign and who is now a campaign advisor for the PAC. “To defend the dignity of human life and ensure Missourians have the knowledge and necessary tools to stand boldly for the unborn.”
In November 2024, Missourians voted by a slim margin to legalize abortion up to the point of fetal viability. The new proposed amendment seeks to repeal the constitutional right to an abortion but allow exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation. 
A spokesperson for the governor’s office referred all comments to the PAC.
The governor and his wife have long opposed abortion. But Claudia Kehoe’s involvement in the campaign is notable nonetheless.
“I don’t recall in my over 40 years as pro-life lobbyist a first lady taking such a prominent role for any ballot measures – let alone a pro-life one,” said Sam Lee, who helped campaign against the 2024 abortion rights amendment.
Claudia Kehoe has the financial knowledge for her new role. She earned a bachelor’s degree in finance and a master’s degree in business administration. She went on to work in banking in the St. Louis area. 
Members of the anti-abortion movement hope that access to the governor’s bully pulpit will help propel early fundraising success. 
“I know that with (Claudia Kehoe’s) fervor, her energy, her strength, her contacts, that things are going to be a lot different than they were the last time,” said Kathy Forck, with 40 Days for Life. 
Last year, the campaign in support of the abortion rights amendment, called Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, raised more than $31.5 million, raking in large donations from organizations including the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, as well as from liberal groups including the Sixteen Thirty Fund, the Fairness Project and Open Source Action Fund, all based out of Washington D.C. 
Fundraising efforts among the anti-abortion movement last year were split among a handful of campaigns totaling less than $4 million in donations. A bulk of the fundraising was done in the final months before the election.
“Our opposition has proven to be very well-funded and very well-organized,” Hafner said. “This year our PAC is going to be very focused on early fundraising and organizing to make sure that spending disparity doesn’t exist at that level again.” 
Opponents of the abortion ban formed a campaign committee in May. Called Stop The Ban, it has taken over the website used by Missourians for Constitutional Freedom and has the same treasurer, Mike Pridmore. No one involved with the campaign offered a comment on Kehoe’s role in the opposing campaign.
Hafner said the Kehoes intend to involve every anti-abortion group in the state that’s interested in collaborating. 
“Our work this cycle is laser-focused on informing, engaging and mobilizing Missourians early,” Hafner said, “to take action on one of the most consequential issues we will ever face in Missouri.”

(Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent.)Frustration runs deep for Missouri parents like Libby Eversgerd. Her youngest child has been  using a scholarship to attend a small, private school after he “began to resist attending school due  to mounting pressure and lack of accommodations for his learning differences.”
It’s not easy to find solutions to complex education problems, but once parents find a solution, losing it is a  nightmare. 
The Missouri National Education Association (MNEA) lawsuit challenging school choice options could devastate thousands of low-income and special needs families across the state. If the union succeeds, children who rely on scholarships for tuition, learning therapies, or specialized instruction will face the very real possibility of losing access to the educational  lifelines that have helped them thrive. 
This summer, the MNEA chose courtroom power plays over student needs by targeting a $51  million state investment helping economically disadvantaged and special needs children access high-quality education outside their traditional public schools. By suing to block these funds, the union directly threatens over 7,000 new scholarships slated for this school year, nearly tripling  the reach of the program and finally ending years-long waits for children who need help now. 
If funding is blocked, families face painful choices: pay tuition out of pocket, drastically cut household spending, or send children (often with complex learning or physical challenges) back into environments that have failed them before. For working parents, school choice is the  difference between a child in second grade finally reading confidently or a student losing hard won academic progress. The union’s lawsuit ignores those stakes. Maintaining institutional control, in their view, is more important than the needs of Missouri families. 
School choice programs prioritize Missouri’s most vulnerable kids. Families use scholarships not just for private school tuition, but for tutoring, transportation, adaptive technology, and therapies. Blocking those options means denying access to tailored learning environments, sometimes after years of waiting for an opportunity that finally arrived this fall. 
More than a legal battle about taxpayer funding, the union’s lawsuit is a direct attack on  educational freedom for Missouri’s most vulnerable children and the parents who fight daily for  a better life. While union lawyers claim they’re defending constitutional principles, the impact falls squarely on the backs of families: children with reading disabilities or physical needs, single  mothers scraping together resources, and parents desperate for one more shot at helping their  kids succeed outside the standard system.
Recent national data paints a troubling picture for students, especially those already facing challenges. According to the latest release from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), students are struggling at unprecedented levels. The 2024 “Nation’s Report Card”  shows that average scores have declined since 2019 for twelfth graders in mathematics and reading, and for eighth graders in science (these scores were already trending downward even before the COVID shutdowns). 
Among high school seniors, the percentage scoring below the basic achievement level in both math and reading has reached the highest point since the assessments began, with nearly half of twelfth graders performing below basic in math and one in three below basic in reading. 
These results are sobering, as even federal officials admit, with the largest drops hitting lower performing students hardest and widening the gap between the lowest- and highest-achieving  students. Participation in hands-on science learning has also decreased, and absenteeism rates among twelfth graders are up sharply, with nearly a third missing three or more days of school in  the previous month. 
Against this bleak backdrop, school choice programs are more critical than ever for families  failed by the standard system. Fewer than one in four twelfth graders are performing at a  proficient level in math, and rates of college readiness in both reading and math have dropped  since 2019. For the poorest and most vulnerable (those with disabilities, those qualifying for free  lunch), school choice may be the only path to academic growth and confidence. 
Though the union claims to act in students’ interests, its actions tell the real story. 
The union’s  lawsuit would devastate families, removing hope and resources from those who need them most. To block these lifelines now would not just cut off opportunity, but actively worsen the crisis revealed in the Nation’s Report Card. Missouri’s policymakers and courts should heed its dire warnings and do everything in their power to support, not sabotage, direct investments in students most at risk of being left behind. As Missourians, we must unite to secure our kids’ future and shield them from the actions of those who would jeopardize it.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/child-care2-1536x1024-1-1024x6831750463620-1.jpg,,,2025-09-24 06:57:07.782085

(StockPlanets/Getty Images)New Jersey school districts should move to limit students’ ability to use cellphones and other devices with internet access during instruction and other parts of the school day to limit classroom distractions, the state Department of Education says in a new report.
The recommendations — which include exceptions for emergencies, students’ individual education plans, and health monitoring, among some others — are likely to bolster a legislative push to limit student access to electronics that already boasts broad bipartisan support despite a monthslong stall.
“I think they are great recommendations, and the first thing I would say is it’s about time,” said Assemblyman Cody Miller (D-Gloucester), a prime sponsor of a bill that would require school districts to adopt some form of policy limiting students’ in-school phone access.
The guidance lays out three example policies. One would require school districts to hold students’ devices for the duration of the school day, a second would leave phones in students’ possession as long as they are unpowered and out of sight until the school day ends, and a third would be some version of the two that allows students to use their devices outside of classroom instruction.
It presents three options for schools to store student devices. Districts could use magnetically locked pouches, school lockers, or in-classroom storage to hold cellphones and other electronics.










Other states are moving at the speed of lightning, and personally, I feel we’re behind on this.


– Assemblyman Cody Miller (D-Gloucester)


Legislators and school officials have increasingly viewed internet-enabled electronics like smartphones and smartwatches as a source of distraction in the classroom and a conduit for cyberbullying.
“I talk to teachers all the time, educators all the time, and of course I’m a parent myself,” said Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-Morris). “It’s the No. 1 distraction.”
School phone bans are not new. More than two dozen states, including neighboring New York, have enacted full or partial bans on cellphones in classrooms, and some New Jersey school districts have created their own prohibitions.
Jersey City’s school district — the third largest in the state by enrollment during the 2024-2025 school year — last week approved a ban that will bar students from using their cellphones in class beginning Oct. 1.
Legislative efforts to ban cellphones in schools have seen less success despite broad bipartisan support in both legislative chambers and support from Gov. Phil Murphy, who endorsed efforts to create phone-free schools in his annual state of the state address. Murphy, a Democrat, leaves office in January after two terms.
Lawmakers earlier this year and in late 2024 unanimously advanced bills that would require school districts to draft their own phone bans that, at a minimum, were at least as strict as those called for by state guidance.
“It’s not necessarily a one-size-fits-all, nor should it be, even if we just talked about different grades and different needs, but the overall message is we need to address this,” said Dunn, a GOP co-sponsor of the bipartisan measure who has introduced her own phone ban bill.
Both bills would permit varying levels of restriction for different grade levels, and the state’s guidance recommends elementary school students be subject to the strictest rules, which would relax for middle schoolers and again for high school students.
Miller, who credited fellow sponsors Assemblywoman Rosy Bagolie (D-Essex) and Sen. Paul Moriarty (D-Gloucester) for the bipartisan legislation, said he hopes the legislation advances swiftly.
“This is a priority for all of us. I know that it is. Other states are moving at the speed of lightning, and personally, I feel we’re behind on this,” he said. “We need to get this done and moved because we’re going to be moving into another school year.”
The Senate unanimously approved Miller’s bill in January, but it will need another vote to approve an amended version that came out of an Assembly committee in March.
The bill has yet to come to a floor vote in the lower chamber, and it’s not likely to see one there until after this year’s November elections. All 80 Assembly seats and the governorship are on the ballot.
The bill may see some opposition despite the broad support it enjoys among lawmakers. Students and some parents have raised concerns over how a phone ban might affect parents’ ability to reach students during an emergency.
Sponsors said new technologies mean parents’ ability to directly contact their children at school matters less.
“Districts now have the ability to communicate through text systems, through email systems where they’re able to communicate with the families during school hours if, God forbid,  something were to happen,” Miller said.

(Getty Images)Assembly Republicans proposed a package of bills they say would help increase affordable housing throughout Wisconsin on Tuesday. Rep. Rob Brooks (R-Saukville) said he hopes to build on the success of bills passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Tony Evers in 2023. Those measures created and expanded state loan programs and were supported with over $500 million in state funds.  
At a news conference in the state Capitol Tuesday morning, Brooks said GOP lawmakers anticipate cooperation from the governor’s office once again. The authors have worked with Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) on many of the bills, he said, and have put the bills on a fast track with hearings to take place soon. 
“We hope to get out more affordable housing throughout the state, and when I refer to affordable housing, I want to be clear, we’re not talking about subsidized housing. We’re talking about affordable housing,” Brooks said. “What I’m talking about is the housing stock that was built just a generation or two ago. We’re talking about small ranch homes, some of those homes built without garages or alleyways or detached garages.” 
Seven bills were drafted as of Tuesday, but Brooks said there could be up to 10 in the final package. “It’s kind of a fluid process right now,” he said. 
According to the National Association of Realtors, in 2024 the average age of a first-time homebuyer in the U.S. reached an all-time high of 38, said Tom Larson, president and CEO of the Wisconsin Realtors Association. He said that the average price of a home in Wisconsin is $340,000, and that over the last 15 years, Wisconsin has built fewer housing units per capita than the national average. 
“Housing prices continue to rise faster than wages, and the longer it takes somebody to purchase a home, the longer it takes for them to build wealth, the longer it takes for them to establish roots in our community, which has a direct impact on our labor force and our economy,” Larson said. “Wisconsin’s [housing] affordability is worse than any of our surrounding neighbors. It’s worse than Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan and Iowa.”
He said the Wisconsin real estate industry is “cautiously optimistic that the passage of these bills will help address Wisconsin’s affordability crisis.” 
New WHEDA programs 
One bipartisan bill, coauthored by Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek) and Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) would create a Workforce Home Loan Program through the WHEDA. The bill has two Democratic coauthors as well: Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) and Rep. Amaad Rivera-Wagner (D-Green Bay).
Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown), who is also an author on the home loan legislation, said the bill is intended to help Wisconsinites who want to become homeowners. 
“Instead of putting down roots, people have been stuck in renting situations and are unable to build equity or stability, so, how do we do that to help them get into that first step of home ownership?” Knodl asked rhetorically. 
The program would allow first-time home buyers access to second mortgage loans of up to $60,000 at 0% interest. The loans could be used to help with down payments and closing costs. Knodl said the repayment terms would be flexible and tailored to household income, and there would be the option to defer payments for low-income families.
He said that the program would sustain itself through the repayments borrowers make.
“Home ownership is about more than buying a house. It’s about building stronger communities, investing in schools and growing local economies,” Knodl said.
Another bill proposed by Rep. Dave Murphy (D-Greenville) would require the agency to establish a grant program to support developers who want to convert multifamily housing to condominiums. 
WHEDA would be required to direct $10 million from the Main Street Housing Rehabilitation revolving loan fund to the grant program, which would cover up to $50,000 in reasonable attorney fees, state and local permitting fees, and any other costs associated with the conversion. 
Changes to help speed up, support development
A handful of the Republicans’ proposals would change laws to support more development and  standardize the process for a variety of housing developments.
Rep. David Armstrong (R-Rice Lake) has proposed creating residential tax increment districts, or TIDs. A TID is a financial tool  municipalities can use to designate certain areas for economic development and use the district’s property tax growth to help pay for improvements to the area. 
Armstrong said the TIDs are one of the biggest tools that municipalities have to do something about housing, and his bill would help address the biggest barrier to building more workforce housing — the cost of subdivision infrastructure, including sidewalks, curb and gutter, water, sewer and utilities. 
His bill would establish a “pay-as-you-go” TID, applying a portion of the tax increment from new homes  to offset the cost of subdivision development.
“In my area, a starter home is $400,000,” Armstrong said. “That’s not a starter home. That’s not what my workforce can afford.”
Armstrong also has a second bill that would require communities to align  comprehensive plans and the zoning ordinances. He said it would provide clarity and predictability for municipalities, builders and developers. 
Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) has authored a bill to provide a statewide framework for local regulations of “accessory dwelling units” — secondary housing units located on the same property as a primary residence. 
“Currently, Wisconsin lacks a unified approach, resulting in a confusing, patchwork of regulation that varies across local governments,” Goeben said. She said her bill “addresses that confusion” and gives property owners a pathway to add accessory units. “This legislation strikes a balance, ensuring individual property owners can efficiently add housing while maintaining reasonable community standards,” she said. 
According to the bill draft, local regulations would be allowed to limit the size and height of an accessory unit , require that a unit satisfy current setback and lot coverage requirements, and prohibit units built  after the effective date of the bill from being turned into short-term rentals.
Rep. Rob Kreibich (R-New Richmond) is proposing a bill that would set out a process for local governments and developers seeking to build a subdivision, including providing an opportunity for developers to meet informally with local representatives before submitting plans. He said the bill is meant to place local governments and developers on the same page “from the beginning of the process all the way through to the end of the process.” 
“Over the next five years, we’re gonna probably need about 140,000 housing units in the state of Wisconsin. At the current pace, we’re not going to even get close,” Kriebich said. “Delays and miscommunication oftentimes leads to delays or no subdivisions whatsoever, so this will clean up that process and again allow some tweaks in statutes to fast track new home construction in the state of Wisconsin.”
Delay new building codes
Rep. William Penterman (R-Hustisford) is seeking to delay the deadline for the implementation of new codes for commercial and multi-family residential buildings. The code changes are the first major updates to the codes in over a decade, and are being implemented following a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that struck down lawmakers’ ability to indefinitely block administrative rules.
“Unfortunately, there was a recent Supreme Court ruling that will mandate that the new building code need to go into effect, and while we’re not here to prevent that, we need to have clarity as to when exactly that’s going to happen,” Penterman said. 
Currently, the Department of Safety and Professional Services has said that all commercial building plans submitted to DSPS for approval must meet the standards set in the upgraded code starting on Oct. 1, though the new code technically went into effect on Sept. 1.
Penterman has proposed a bill that would delay that requirement until April 2026. 
“This gives businesses, commercial buildings, residential housing and municipalities more time to review these plans, make sure everything’s all set to go,” Penterman said.

Columnist Rod Miller took an informal poll of friends across the political spectrum and heard a chorus of ""no.""
The post Would the Bill of Rights be ratified today? appeared first on WyoFile .","Our Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to our Constitution, is our most popular and familiar part of that cherished document. Asked to quote a passage from the Constitution, most folks would reply “right to bear arms” or “freedom of speech” or “due process.” Those rights and more are enshrined in the Bill of Rights.

Opinion

But, if presented to the nation in 2025, would the Bill of Rights have enough support to be ratified?
That’s the question I asked my circle of friends and frenemies in an informal telephone poll the other day. I sat on my sunny porch with Good Dog Henry, drinking PBR and taking the pulse of a passel of folks in both the public and private sectors vis-à-vis that question. I think my universe of friends pretty much covers the waterfront and most hues in the political spectrum, and none of them would try to blow smoke up my fundament. The answers I got didn’t surprise me.
The Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 and represented James Madison’s compromise with the Anti-Federalists (mostly in the southern states) who demanded a statement of individual rights as a condition of ratifying the new Constitution. Madison’s compromise saved the whole shebang, and we live under its wisdom today.
The Bill of Rights was patterned after the Magna Carta, which King John of England was forced to sign, which limited the “Divine Right of Kings” to have unchecked power over the people. Even though our Constitution instituted a republican form of government, Thomas Jefferson and the Anti-Federalists didn’t fully trust our new government to protect individual rights against federal power.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
So they demanded and got our Bill of Rights. God bless ‘em!
Good Dog Henry and I sat in the sunshine, scratching our noggins and wondering if that same level of statesmanship and citizenship could prevail today. That prompted my impromptu telephone poll to ask folks I respect to weigh in on the matter. What if the Bill of Rights didn’t exist? Would it pass into law today, given the current atmosphere in the United States?
Consider this: in 1791, the population of the United States was 3.9 million, while today our population is nearly a hundred times that. In 2025, there are around 350 million U.S. citizens living in an advanced techno-society and all connected by the internet. Things have changed since Madison’s time.
A constitutional amendment still requires a 2/3 vote in both houses of Congress, and if that succeeds, ratification by 3/4 of the states. In 1791, there were 13 states. Today, there are 50. The sheer numbers argue that the Bill of Rights would have a tougher time getting ratified today than it did back when our elected officials all wore wigs.
Add to that the demonstrable polarization in America today, and the equally demonstrable unwillingness to grant rights to folks we don’t like or agree with, and you have the atmosphere in which my poll was conducted.
Respondents to my porch poll pointed out that red states wouldn’t ratify the First Amendment (free speech and all that hippie stuff) and blue states wouldn’t ratify the Second Amendment (guns). The other eight amendments would be tussled over and pulled apart by the partisan and ideological divides that make it nearly impossible to get anything done in this country, let alone ratifying a Bill of Rights.
I’ll submit that, given recent pronouncements made by the Wyoming congressional delegation, the Bill of Rights as Madison wrote it, probably wouldn’t pass out of Congress to be presented to the people. One respondent to my poll pointed out that “Congress couldn’t even pass gas today.”
As I said, the answers I got didn’t surprise me. Only one person answered “yes.” There was one “maybe” and one “only by an act of God.” There were 30 or so firm “no way Joses.”
Before you make a snarky comment on this column, or discount my results, try it yourself. Call up a bunch of folks in your own circle, and ask them the same question. If your results differ from mine, then we have something to discuss. If not, then we are left with a bleak view of individual rights in today’s America.
But perhaps the more important question is, “Would you, as a citizen, support passage of the Bill of Rights today, knowing that it would grant the same rights to folks you may consider political enemies as you yourself enjoy?”
If not, why not?

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)By Lucas Garfinkel
Two summers ago, the skies over New Jersey turned a surreal shade of orange. Schools canceled recess, parents debated whether it was safe to let kids play outside, and doctors treated a surge of patients struggling to breathe. The culprit was wildfire smoke drifting from hundreds of miles away.
Not long after, while on my pediatrics rotation at Cooper University Hospital, I met a 10-year-old with asthma whose parents brought him in for a follow-up. His lungs had healed, but emotionally, he was stuck. He refused to play outside, convinced the air would still make him sick. His parents worried less about his lung function tests and more about the fact that their once-active son no longer felt safe riding his bike. The smoke had cleared, but the fear lingered.
From personal to professional
As a medical student planning to pursue psychiatry, I see how climate anxiety shapes the way young people think, cope, and dream. I’ve felt it myself, the sense that the fate of the planet rests on our shoulders, too daunting to fully process and too urgent to ignore. For some, this worry becomes paralyzing. For others, it fuels activism, sometimes at the cost of burnout.
Anxiety itself isn’t the problem. It’s our brain’s way of signaling that something matters. The danger comes when the immensity of the crisis convinces us there’s nothing we can do, and we face it alone. 
The rise of climate anxiety
Climate anxiety isn’t a formal diagnosis, but it is real and growing. A global survey of young people ages 16 to 25 found that 84% are at least moderately worried about climate change, and nearly half say it negatively affects their daily lives. A UNICEF report estimates that 1 billion children will be at “extremely high risk” from climate change. Children and young adults are already particularly vulnerable to the effects of chronic stress. As a result, climate anxiety may affect their risk of developing depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.
In New Jersey, where flooding, hurricanes, and air quality alerts are increasingly common, kids don’t need to imagine what climate change might do — they’ve already lived through it. Unlike past generations, today’s youth are asked to wrestle with existential questions long before they’re developmentally ready. Adolescence is supposed to be about identity and possibility. Instead, many are left wondering if those futures will even exist. Social media magnifies it: Every scroll brings another dire headline or viral video of devastation.    
The power of talking about it
The most important step we can take is simple: Talk about climate anxiety openly. Parents, teachers, and clinicians should not dismiss kids’ fears as naive. These worries are rational responses to a changing world. Naming them, validating them, and creating safe spaces to discuss them can transform dread into determination.
Neuroscience backs this up. As Adam Met writes in Amplify, when people gather in groups, our brains literally sync up: We become more open to new ideas, more capable of empathy, and crucially, more willing to act. Sociologists call this collective effervescence. It’s the spark that turns isolation into solidarity and anxiety into action.
There are also practical ways families can help young people channel their worry productively. Parents can direct their children’s energy toward advocacy groups and research organizations that they can support together. They can learn concrete steps to minimize their household’s environmental impact, encourage lifestyle changes like reducing energy use, and spend time in nature, planting trees or flowers to restore both agency and connection.
No, talking about climate change won’t suddenly stop the floods in Manville or the smoke drifting into Newark. Critics might argue that naming the problem risks frightening kids further. But avoidance feeds anxiety. Honest conversation, grounded in both reality and hope, helps young people feel less alone. 
Where we go from here
If we want the next generation to face the climate crisis with resilience rather than despair, we need to weave mental health into the fabric of our response. Schools should equip teachers to talk about climate stress. Pediatricians should screen for climate-related worries the way they already screen for bullying or depression. Parents should listen without judgment when their children voice fears about the future.
Here, New Jersey is leading the nation. It is the only state with mandatory K-12 climate education, thanks to First Lady Tammy Murphy’s initiative. Normalizing climate discussions in classrooms helps kids feel empowered rather than paralyzed by the challenges they inherit. Most importantly, we must frame climate action as a shared responsibility. No child should feel like the weight of the world rests solely on their shoulders. By fostering open conversations and collective responses, we can turn climate anxiety from a source of paralysis into a catalyst for connection and change.

(Michael Isaac Stein/Verite News)Utility companies just got their grades back from a leading environmental group’s annual report card on whether they generate clean energy and provide affordable power. In Louisiana, the results might paint a rosier picture than reality reflects.
The Sierra Club’s “Dirty Truth Report” evaluates utilities’ plans to deliver cheap, clean energy to customers and gives them a grade based on their investment in renewable energy and commitment to retire fossil fuel-generated electricity by 2035.
Cleco and Entergy are among the 75 utilities featured in the Sierra Club evaluation, which gave the entire industry an F – its lowest grade since it began issuing report cards in 2021.
Holly Bender, the Sierra Club’s chief program officer, said in a news release it was “alarming” to see utilities move backward in their transitions to clean energy transition. 
But in contrast to the national trend, New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. earned a C average. It comes after a B last year and an F in 2023. Cleco, headquartered in Pineville, received a B grade for 2025 after four straight years of Ds.
The Sierra Club’s review included grades for utility affiliates. 
Entergy New Orleans improved from a B to an A with more investment in renewable energy, who Entergy Louisiana, which fell from a B to a C, lost points for its “over-reliance on gas” and “fewer investments in renewable energy,” according to the report. 
The Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group, thinks utilities should emphasize more renewable energy generation, with a focus on community solar projects in particular.
Alaina DiLaura, the alliance’s policy coordinator, said the ratings also don’t truly capture utilities’ ongoing reliance on fossil fuels. 
For example, Cleco’s filings with the Louisiana Public Service Commission show plans to transition a coal-burning power plant to natural gas, an aspect of continued fossil fuel use she said the Sierra Club report doesn’t fully consider. 
The Sierra Club’s analysis should have been more critical of utilities’ plans to expand their reliance on natural gas, she said. 
For example, Cleco has said it will retire all but one of its coal-powered power plants and invest in carbon capture and sequestration. While proponents tout CCS projects as environmentally friendly, critics question that claim and note they encourage more fossil fuel use. The technology can also consume a lot of electricity.  
Despite originally planning to retire its coal-powered Rodemacher Unit 2 power plant in Rapides Parish, Cleco submitted plans Sept. 5 to the Louisiana Public Service Commission to keep it running using natural gas, DiLaura said. 
Cleco is also looking to use natural gas at its largest power plant, Madison 3, alongside the petroleum coke (a crude oil refining byproduct) it currently runs on. The utility has informed state regulators it will add “700 megawatts of new gas generation,” DiLaura said citing its latest filings. 
Entergy Louisiana will add 2,200 megawatts of generation capacity – a 20% increase of its statewide output – once it builds three natural gas-powered plants to run the massive Meta data center under construction in Richland Parish. 
Entergy New Orleans’ grade improvement is also misleading, DiLaura said, because its latest plans involve expanding its use of natural gas, which means the utility won’t meet its 2035 goal of net zero carbon emissions.
Entergy New Orleans spokesman Beau Tidwell said that even though it intends to use more natural gas, the company will “remain committed to transparent disclosure about our progress and any challenges we might encounter.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/DSC_4557-2048x1367-1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-24 06:57:07.782085

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)LINCOLN — A Kansas pipeline company is about to activate its $1.5 billion pipeline to transport carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in Nebraska and Iowa to a sequestration site in Wyoming and, along with it, launch a first-of-its-kind program to share some proceeds with rural communities along the pipeline route.
On Tuesday, officials with Tallgrass Energy said they would soon be shipping CO2 from the first of 11 ethanol plants connected to its pipeline — a converted, former natural gas pipeline — for a 392-mile trip across Nebraska, Colorado, Iowa and Wyoming.
In conjunction with the launch, Tallgrass announced it is making an initial donation of $500,000 to a fund managed by the Nebraska Community Foundation that could financially help more than 230 communities and community organizations on the route.
The company projects that more than $7 million will be distributed over 10 years through the “Trailblazer Community Investment Fund,” with the money targeted for local early childhood centers, elder care facilities and food pantries. That is on top of lease payments to landowners and spending more than $450,000 on disaster response training sessions and equipment purchases for the mostly rural, volunteer fire and rescue departments along the pipeline route.


Summit pipeline changes
A much larger CO2 pipeline proposal, the 2,500-mile Summit, recently announced plans to provide more incentives for landowners who provide rights of way and new aid to local communities along the route, DTN/Progressive Farmer reported.
That pipeline, first proposed three years ago, would connect to 57 ethanol plants across North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa and Nebraska. But the Summit project has faced fierce landowner opposition in some areas, along with lawsuits and regulatory barriers.
Kleeb, of Bold Nebraska, said the offer by Summit is different than what was negotiated with Tallgrass. Summit, she said, just laid out an offer, and did not work out the new incentives with local officials.
The new offers from Summit were described by Summit CEO Joe Griffin as “a promise to operate safely, openly and in a way that brings meaningful benefits to the people and places that make this project possible,” DTN reported.

The investment fund was negotiated with the environmental group, Bold Nebraska, which was a leading opponent of construction of the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline across the state. The agreement has been hailed as a new blueprint for acceptance of large infrastructure projects that impact rural areas.
“It’s important to us to strategically invest back into the communities who have supported the project’s development,” said Kyle Quackenbush, segment president at Tallgrass.
“We hope that these investments serve to provide a safety net to our neighbors throughout their lifetimes – from early childhood to eldercare – so that these communities can continue to grow and thrive,” he said.
A year ago, Tallgrass announced its agreement with Bold Nebraska to share some of the proceeds in exchange for its cooperation.
Such pipelines in other states have generated opposition, as well as lawsuits and protests. In this case, though, extensive new rights of way weren’t necessary, and many landowners along the pipeline route grow corn, a crop expected to benefit from expanding the markets for corn-based ethanol by making the fuel more environmentally friendly.
Jane Kleeb, the founder of Bold Nebraska, said rural communities “deserve to benefit from the projects that impact them – whether that’s sharing in profits, investing in social services or simply having a seat at the project’s decision-making table.”
The Tallgrass carbon dioxide pipeline will connect 10 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Council Bluffs, Iowa, with a deep, underground storage area in eastern Wyoming. It uses about 392 miles of a former natural gas pipeline, the Trailblazer, that has been converted and about a like number of miles of connector pipelines to ethanol plants.

Kleeb said the agreement serves as a model for rural as well as urban communities impacted by such projects. She added that Tallgrass and Bold recently gave a presentation to officials with the NAACP.
The new pipeline, formerly the Trailblazer pipeline, is the first of its kind to begin operation as part of a push by the Biden Administration to reduce carbon emissions and make ethanol production more “green.” Making the biofuel less carbon-intensive could make it more attractive for states seeking environmental benefits, officials have said, and the pipeline will give Nebraska-produced ethanol an advantage in its use as sustainable aviation fuel, a new market for the biofuel.
“It’s going to put Nebraska ethanol into a league of its own,” said Steven Davidson, a Tallgrass spokesman.
Jeff Yost, president and CEO of Nebraska Community Foundation, said the new fund will target some of the biggest challenges facing rural communities — quality early childhood education, senior care and food insecurity — providing small grants to sustain jobs and services.
He said the foundation has already identified more than 230 organizations in the 31 impacted counties as eligible for a portion of the funds. To share in a portion of the funds, Yost said that qualified organizations will be invited to submit applications and verify that they are doing the work they profess to do.
Yost added that sometimes companies do this kind of fund sharing “for public relations purposes.”
“(But) I see these guys doing it for the right reasons,” he said.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)About a month into the Idaho “DOGE” committee opening its public comment portal, more than 450 comments were submitted with recommendations on improving government efficiency. 
Many of the submissions center around education, health care, and the committee and legislators. 
Members of the interim committee — named for the federal Department of Government Efficiency — are sifting through submissions to the DOGE portal on the Idaho Legislature’s website. The next meeting is scheduled for 2 p.m. Sept. 29 at the Idaho Capitol in Boise.

Committee co-chairman Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, told the Idaho Capital Sun he plans to focus on ideas for restructuring or consolidating agencies. However, the nearly 500 comments are going to be delegated among the committee’s eight members for deeper dives and for responses to those who didn’t submit anonymously. The names of those who submitted were redacted in the records provided to the Sun through a public records request. 
The committee is focused on reducing and reorganizing state government; it met for the first time in July, despite a bill that sought to create the committee stalling in the Legislature, the Sun reported. 
 What do the DOGE commenters think of the committee? 

The Sun reviewed the 462 comments submitted to the DOGE portal between July 25 and Aug. 25.
The comments ranged in topics from asking to eliminate mosquito abatement districts, complaining about local government entities and decisions, to suggesting all the lawmakers resign. 
More than 50 submissions suggested the committee dissolve itself. 
“Disband Idaho DOGE — this state already runs at razor-thin funding for essential services,” one submitter wrote. “It’s a performative political stunt.” 
Another submitter wrote, “Just don’t do this. Nothing is getting more efficient and naming a governing body after a meme is just insane,” referring to the popular mid-2000s meme featuring a photo of a Shiba Inu side-eying the camera. 
Ehlers said he plans to address comments like these, many of which he believes stem from a misunderstanding about how the committee works. 
“Anytime you’re making change, people are going to get worried or concerned, and I think that’s behind some of those comments,” he said. “That’s fine, people can have their opinions about us and the work that we’re doing.”  
As state legislators, Ehlers said, their salaries are fixed and the committee members are not being paid more to meet out of the usual three-month legislative session. He said the staff who are working with the committee are also not being paid extra to do their work. 
“It’s not like we’re really spending additional taxpayer dollars holding this committee,” he said. 
Other commenters expressed support for the idea of improving government efficiency, but asked the committee to do so with a more fine-toothed comb than its federal predecessor, formerly led by billionaire Elon Musk, which oversaw mass layoffs and cuts in a short period of time.

“I urge you to consider re-evaluating the Doge system with genuine community input, transparent communication, and a plan grounded in practical outcomes for citizens,” one submission said. “Otherwise, it risks becoming just another example of government inefficiency.” 
Some expressed gratitude for the effort and the ability to provide input. 
“Thank you so much for asking for regular Idahoan’s input. There are many issues before the legislature that I feel have wasted time and energy that could have been better spent,” one submission said. 
Ehlers said the amount of public participation is “a good sign.” 
“We’re getting comments from all of the political spectrum, which I think is great,” he said. “It’s great to have Idahoans involved in this and interested in what we’re doing.” 
 Medicaid, health care were some primary topics of interest  

Medicaid was mentioned in more than 20 comments. One person suggested ending the entirety of Idaho Medicaid, although some aspects of the program are federally required. 
“Idaho needs to repeal all Medicaid programs,” the submission said. “Socialized medicine will not make us healthier.  Socialized health care will soon be our biggest spending program.
Idaho Legislature’s DOGE panel looks to reorganize, reduce state government 

People who want Medicaid should move to another state.” 
There are more than 350,000 Idahoans enrolled across all Medicaid programs, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation fact sheet, which is a little over 17% of the state’s population. 
Some of the comments called for the elimination of Medicaid benefits for able-bodied adults, but asked to protect the program for elderly and disabled participants. During the committee’s last meeting, committee members suggested exploring a repeal of Medicaid expansion — a program approved by Idaho voters in 2018 to provide health care coverage for adults who fell in the gap between earning too much for traditional Medicaid but not enough for tax credits to make private insurance through the state marketplace affordable, the Sun reported. Multiple bills have been proposed to repeal it since Medicaid expansion went into effect in 2020, but none advanced out of the Legislature. 
Many of the comments expressed concern that programs for elderly and disabled Idahoans would be restricted or eliminated. 
Some expressed concerns about the effects of the congressional “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which reduced federal Medicaid spending by around $1 trillion over the next decade. 
“Medicaid cut backs will potentially cause a domino effect in the Assisted Living community for many seniors and those with mental illness, who actively use the medicaid benefit to maintain housing and care in Assisted Living,” one person wrote. “With cut backs in this department, less Medicaid recipients will be retained in Assisted Living as we won’t be able to meet their needs with staffing as wage costs as well as cost of living to provide the needed items to provide adequate care to our residents. Please take this into consideration as it will drastically affect several in the community.”
Ehlers said the committee would likely meet with subject-matter experts around health care and Medicaid, and he couldn’t “promise certain ones will be cut or protected.” 
“We will give it a fair effort to examine these,” he said. 
 Several commenters highlight education and school choice tax credit 

Nearly 50 submissions called for the repeal of the school choice tax credit, a $50 million program passed during the 2025 legislative session to allow parents to use tax credits to reimburse education costs, inducing private school tuition. The credit isn’t available yet. 
“Give that $50 million set aside for vouchers to Idaho’s public schools instead so they can have the teachers, staff, supplies, and facilities to educate ALL of Idaho’s children,” one person wrote. 
A couple asked that the program be suspended or restricted. It currently is available to any family with priority going to families within 300% of the federal poverty guidelines in the first year, and priority given to families who previously received in the ongoing years. 
One commenter suggested the program be tailored to target low-income and underserved public school districts, include performance metrics for the schools that accept the funds, and that the unused dollars from the program go back to public schools. 
Ehlers said that while the committee is open to reevaluating existing laws, the members were unlikely to recommend eliminating the tax credit at this time. 
“I don’t see that being in our scope, just because it was just barely passed this session and hasn’t really been fully implemented yet,” he said. “I think we need to let that law go into effect and see the results.” 
Other comments called for more funding for public schools and libraries.

Three submissions, including one from Sen. Brian Lenney, R-Nampa, called for the repeal of Idaho Launch, an $80 million grant program for graduating high school seniors to go toward employment training or higher education in “in-demand” fields.
“This one-size-fits-all scheme smothers the diversity of thought and opportunity that fuels real growth,” Lenney wrote.
 Other comments suggested more careful legislating, mass removals elected officials, agency consolidation and more

The wide-ranging comments included several calls for the removal of elected officials, such as Attorney General Raúl Labrador, Gov. Brad Little, and Idaho’s entire congressional delegation. 
A number of commenters asked the Legislature to weigh potential legal concerns more carefully, in reference to laws passed in recent years that have ended up being tied up in court. 
One person wrote, “Refrain from focusing on fringe issues and refrain from passing unconstitutional laws.” 
Another said, “If another state is getting actively sued for their legislation, don’t pass the exact same law.” 
Some suggested merging some agencies, such as Idaho Fish and Game and the State Department of Parks and Recreation. Others suggested better coordination among agencies that perform similar duties, such as the Idaho Department of Water Resources and the Department of Environmental Quality. 
A number of commenters recommended the state Legislature only meet every other year for a session and create a two-year budget, instead meeting every year. 
Six commenters asked the state to stop contracting with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ISP announced the partnership in June, and said it would seek to spend up to $300,000 transporting individuals to ICE detention facilities from Idaho jails, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
A number of suggestions fell outside the purview of the Idaho Legislature, such as complaints about city governments or federal officials. 
Ehlers said the committee members intend to respond to commenters who provided contact information and explain what sorts of changes the Legislature can and cannot do. He also emphasized that the interim committee may only present proposed legislation, which would need to advance through standing committees during the legislative session, which starts in January.
“Sometimes, I think that gets forgotten, both by people wanting us to cut things right away and also people worried about just cutting too quickly,” Ehlers said. “It still has to go through the standard legislative process, whatever our recommendations are.”

The Democratic National Committee launched a five-figure digital ad campaign Wednesday focused on the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech, in a campaign targeting Virginia’s 1st and 2nd Congressional districts where incumbents Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, and Jen Kiggans, D-Virginia Beach, have been perceived as vulnerable by Democrats.  
The ad begins by reminding voters President Donald Trump signed an executive order when elected to his second term to “stop all government censorship.” It then references how Trump’s administration has pressured media companies to crack down on broadcasters critical of the administration. 
The ads follow the fatal shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, which spurred weeks of heated debate in the commonwealth and across the country about what is and is not considered acceptable free speech. Virginia’s top schools superintendent said educators who think Kirk’s killing was acceptable should be investigated and “disqualified from teaching or working with children again.”
Va.’s chief schools superintendent advises leaders to investigate teachers for Kirk comments

Chesterfield County school board member Dorothy Heffron announced her plan to resign over her inflammatory comments following Kirk’s shooting, which she has since deleted. 
Nationally, talk show host Jimmy Kimmel was briefly suspended for a joke he’d made alluding to Trump’s flippant attitude in a press event following Kirk’s death.  
The new ads are geared towards voters in the 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts who may be ready for a change in representation, organizers said, and tie incumbents Wittman and Kiggans to Trump amid the free speech debacle. Last year, Kiggans campaigned with Trump in Chesapeake while Wittman campaigned with then-Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump in Chesterfield. 
Kiggans’ district has long-oscillated between partisan control while Wittman’s reliably red district has seen shades of blue in recent years. While the DNC ad is focused on areas that could be critical in next year’s congressional midterm elections, the matter of free speech is timely, party officials said.
“Donald Trump’s administration has amassed a chilling record of restricting speech, extorting private companies, and dropping the full weight of the government censorship hammer on Americans simply exercising their First Amendment rights,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement. “This is no exaggeration, and it’s splintering the coalition that got Trump elected. That’s why today, the DNC announced a new digital ad campaign in VA-01 and VA-02 targeting conservative and independent voters.” 
A series of Democratic candidates have already lined up to challenge both candidates next year after a Democratic primary. Wittman’s challengers include former Richmond Times-Dispatch meteorologist Sean Sublette and current Henrico Commonwealths’ Attorney Shannon Taylor.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee remains among the nation’s top four states for highest number of anticipated electric vehicle manufacturing jobs despite slowing industry investments, disappearing tax incentives and federal policy uncertainty, according to a new report on electric transportation in the Southeast.
The state held onto its title as runner-up for the most anticipated EV manufacturing jobs in the southeast region, with 16,262 anticipated jobs compared to top-ranking Georgia’s 26,428. 
Tennessee’s place in the rankings is largely due to 5,800 jobs promised by Ford Motor Company and SK On’s BlueOval City and BlueOval SK, an electric vehicle and battery manufacturing plant in rural West Tennessee. In return for the $5.6 billion project, Tennessee offered a $900 million incentive package. While battery production at the new plant is moving forward, mass production of Ford’s next-generation electric pickup truck is now delayed until 2028 due to the company’s shift in focus to smaller, more affordable electric models.

Lengthening timelines and industry pressure to create more affordable vehicles are themes highlighted in the Sept. 10 report, which is the sixth-annual study of transportation electrification in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Atlas Public Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based data analysis firm, prepared the report for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a renewable energy advocacy nonprofit.
The rapid injection of EV manufacturing investments coincided with tax incentives passed under former President Joe Biden’s administration, which likely sped up investments that companies already planned to make, Atlas Public Policy founder Nick Nigro said in a webcast following the report’s release.
But tax incentives of up to $7,500 for EV consumers will now sunset on Sept. 30 as part of the Trump administration’s budget reconciliation bill — named the One Big, Beautiful Bill — passed by Congress this summer, adding to market uncertainty.
The report shows continued momentum from southeastern states, where companies have announced an all-time total of $78.8 billion in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing investments as of June 30. That momentum has slowed considerably, according to the report, with new investments in the southeast region over the last 12 months totaling $4.8 billion, less than a third of the previous year’s $15.2 billion.
The “huge jumps in manufacturing investments” over the last few years when companies began building more domestic-based supply chains were not sustainable, Nigro said.
“There was no doubt there was going to be a natural slowdown … because that’s the normal course of business,” he said. “The question we need to keep in mind as we look ahead is how many of these potential cancellations that are happening now and into the future are because of federal policy, or just because of the normal cycle of business?”
Nigro said it’s too soon to tell.
In the meantime, Tennessee continues to make progress in building out public electric vehicle charging infrastructure, though it still lags behind the charger-per-person rates of the nation and other southeastern states.
Tennessee, like other states, has also seen companies pause or retract investments and planned jobs. 
Piedmont Lithium announced in August 2024 that it scrapped plans for an $800 million investment for a lithium hydroxide processing facility in Southeastern Tennessee that would have created around 147 jobs. This is the sole Tennessee cancellation mentioned in the report, which includes data through June.
General Motors announced in September that it would temporarily lay off 700 workers at its Spring Hill assembly plant due to a temporary production slowdown for the Cadillac Lyriq, along with reduced production for its Vistiq EV. Tenneco, an auto parts manufacturer that supplies the GM plant, reported that it would lay off 82 workers in its own Spring Hill facility.
Volkswagen similarly announced that it would furlough around 160 employees and pause production of its electric SUV to align “production volume to market demand,” the Chattanooga Times Free Press reported earlier this month.
What will happen when tax credits sunset? Time will tell.
Nigro said about 80% of EV manufacturing facilities the report tracked in the southeast are already operating in some capacity or undergoing construction. The key question, he said, is whether demand will support full production at these facilities.
Stan Cross, electric transportation policy director with the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said it’s too early to tell how the market will react to the end of EV consumer tax credits. 
“What we do know is that when we look at adoption of electric vehicles, sticker price remains a top barrier for consumers and fleet operators, even though owning an EV is much cheaper over time,” Cross said. 
Nigro estimates that less than half of the electric vehicles sold in the last year qualified for the tax credit — which gives incentives for the purchase of vehicles with responsibly sourced components and North American assembly —  indicating consumers are willing to pay for electric vehicles without the incentive. 
Industry orgs: Budget bill’s electric vehicle tax credit rollback could hamper Tennessee momentum

Energy market analysis firm Benchmark reported in July that about half of the EVs sold in the United States were eligible for the new clean vehicle tax credit in 2025.
But the “Transportation Electrification in the Southeast” report also notes that most of the southeast’s highest-selling models were eligible for the full or partial tax credit in 2025.
“It’s going to make it tougher for some vehicles to be sold,” Nigro said, adding that companies may embrace more aggressive pricing or find other ways to squeeze costs out of production.
A manufacturing tax credit remains in place for batteries, though with tighter restrictions on foreign material sources.
“The Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure Law, and even the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) signaled to the market that if EVs are going to be purchased by Americans, ideally they’re built with as much domestic content as possible,” Nigro said.
Cross surmised that the sunsetting tax credits may provide a temporary boost to EV sales.
“We’re seeing a real run on EVs right now, as consumers see those tax credits dwindling, and I won’t be surprised if we see record-shattering third quarter sales here in the U.S. as a result,” he said.
Market share grows
Tennessee’s EV sales market share — the percentage of new vehicles purchased that are EVs — came in at 5.4%, a 35% annual growth from last year, according to the report. 
This puts Tennessee in the middle of the pack, ranking fourth among the six southeastern states examined by the report. Tennessee’s market share ranks 31st in the nation. 
The southeast region logged more than 912,000 cumulative EV sales during the study period, amounting to a market share of above 8%. Tennessee was responsible for 60,434 of those sales.

Charging infrastructure makes progress
Tennessee is ranked fourth in the region for number of electric vehicle chargers per person.
The state saw the lowest rate of growth in publicly accessible rapid EV chargers at 24% — a marked change from holding the highest growth rate of 60% last year.
Tennessee has 830 fast-charging ports and 1,897 slower charging ports, according to the report.
The state’s Fast Charge TN program supported EV charger installation at 35 now-operational charging sites along a 400-mile loop connecting Nashville, Knoxville, Cookeville and Chattanooga.

The program is funded through the Volkswagen Diesel Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust, electricity revenue from the Tennessee Valley Authority and cost share from grant recipients.
The state’s program is meant to be complemented by the federally funded  National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI). That program was frozen by Trump’s administration in February, but the U.S. Transportation Secretary recently released interim guidance that may allow the program to move forward after states reapply for funding.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The North-Central Idaho Democratic Coalition sponsored the Forum With Our Members of Congress on Aug. 23 in Lewiston. The event was designed to provide an opportunity for U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and James Risch, along with U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, to hear and respond to local constituents’ concerns in an environment with rules for civility and respect.
Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, the three representatives declined to appear. Nor did they send any prepared statements to be read to the attendees. The organizers had anticipated this and the event took place regardless, with a recording that will be sent to the members of Congress.
Over 75 people attended. Three chairs stood at the front of the auditorium, each with a large photograph of one of the absent legislators. 
Kathy Dawes, one of the organizers of the event, and Mark Havens from Interlink, a nonprofit providing services to the elderly, served as co-moderators. 
The forum was planned and conducted in accordance with guidelines from Braver Angels, a nonpartisan volunteer organization that embraces respect, honesty and responsible citizenship. They encourage this by teaching respectful communication skills through free workshops, one of which was conducted in the morning before the forum. The driving force that fuels their mission is “bringing Americans together to bridge the partisan divide and strengthen our democratic republic.”
 Issues raised by nonprofit groups

Representatives from several nonprofit groups in the region gave short presentations about their work and the challenges they face. Each ended with some specific questions for the members of Congress.
They spoke about a wide range of topics that surely would’ve been of interest to our representatives. These included the need for bipartisan solutions to climate change,  protecting the budget for scientific agencies, reforming the process for clean energy permitting, supporting funding for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Housing First initiative, the importance of investing in senior citizen services, concerns about cuts to federal funding for education and students with disabilities, the need to reduce the rancor in politics, and more.
 Questions from the audience

During the second hour of the forum, audience members spoke to the photos on the dais in lieu of being able to speak to their absent members of congress. They asked tough questions about topics including concerns about the Smithsonian, protecting our First Amendment rights, the negative impact of tariffs on markets for Idaho agricultural products and family farmers, the chaos caused by ICE raids when crops need to be picked, investigation into conditions at immigration detention centers, stopping President Donald Trump from sending troops into American cities, increased housing costs, the conflict in Ukraine, the need for humanitarian aid for Palestinians, and the importance of adequate funding for national parks.

The tone of the questions was as varied as the people who asked them. Many questions were carefully phrased and delivered in even tones. Other questions reflected the individuals’ frustration and even desperation, with several people literally begging the representatives to take action on issues like rent increases.
Others questions were very pointed. One questioner raised issues with multiple Trump administration actions, saying, “You’re turning a blind eye to these actions, normalizing them. What has to happen for you to stand up to this administration and stop these undemocratic actions?” Another asked, “Are you three merely cowardly Republicans afraid of Trump’s retribution, or are you supporting his lunatic and fascist takeover of our country?”
 Great turnout — except for the missing three

Despite not having the senators and congressman present, the mood in the room during the event was positive. People were attentive to the presentations and often applauded the questions.
The recording of the event is now being edited and will be sent to Sens. Crapo and Risch and Rep. Fulcher, with requests for their responses. A short video of Q&A highlights is already posted.
After the event, Dawes summed up the experience: “We were all very disappointed that our members of Congress did not attend, and that they did not even provide a statement that we requested to be able to read at the event. To not even acknowledge their constituents’ request for a statement is very difficult for me to understand. If they watch the video we send them, they will see the respectful demeanor of the crowd and the wide variety of sincere questions and comments made that really deserve a thoughtful response.”
Perhaps the only disrespectful aspect of the event was the behavior of our elected representatives.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch) As volunteers around the country prepared last week for Save a Life Day, an annual naloxone giveaway event, Kanawha County saw a stark reminder of the need for the opioid overdose reversal drug. 
Within 24 hours, 35 people in Charleston overdosed on what police believed to have been fentanyl laced with xylazine, a powerful tranquilizer.
In each overdose, naloxone was reportedly used to revive the person. No deaths were reported.
For Joe Solomon, a Charleston City councilman and a co-founder of Save A Life Day, it was also a reminder that more could be done for drug users in the city. 
“I wish every day were ‘Save a Life Day,” Solomon said. “The only way to do that is if we had an accessible, needs-based harm reduction program that would make every day Save A Life Day. Because you can meet hundreds of people every day where they are with what they need, and get your arms around them — naloxone, test strips, drug testing, and if they want more services like counseling and primary care and infectious disease treatment, that too.”
During this year’s Save a Life Day on Thursday, volunteers from every state — and even one from the nation of Colombia — will distribute the opioid overdose antidote drug at more than 900 sites.
Solomon and fellow co-founder Sarah Stone, both of the overdose prevention organization SOAR, helped start Save a Life Day in Kanawha and Putnam counties in 2020, as the number of fatal overdoses rose during the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, the event was held in 32 states, including every state east of the Mississippi.

More than 30,000 doses of the opioid overdose antidote were distributed by volunteers in West Virginia during the 2024 event. 
Solomon said the milestone of being in every state is undercut by the city’s passage of legislation in 2021 that restricted harm reduction programs that may have had a bigger impact on helping people struggling with drug addiction.
“I’m torn, right? Because, it’s like you send out this real signal of hope from this place of hurt. That feels like something to be really proud about,” Solomon said. “And we’re still a place that criminalized harm reduction. And so much of our story hasn’t, I think, found the level of atonement.”
Stone said she didn’t expect the event to cause miracles, just a slow move toward lessening the stigma that has been associated with naloxone. 
“I think [going from] two counties to over 900 sites in five years is pretty good,” she said. 
Stone and Solomon are also the coordinators of Kanawha County’s Save A Life Day distribution.
West Virginia has long had the highest drug overdose rates in the country, but the state has celebrated some victories recently.
In July, West Virginia marked the largest reduction in fatal overdoses across the nation over a 12 month period. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia saw two months of declines in the annual rate of fatal overdoses, representing a 41% decrease compared to deaths reported in both preceding 12 month periods.
Stone said events like Save a Life Day have the potential to make big changes by encouraging people to talk to one another. Even in the midst of an overdose spike, Charleston is more prepared to handle the crisis today than it was five years ago, she said. People will always use drugs, she said. 
“But not talking about it, or being in denial about that or the layers and layers of shame are weird,” she said. “I like to think we’re encouraging people to have conversations about what the reality of their life and their family and their communities are so they can make it better. 
“Access to naloxone is the baseline, and we still have lots of places that don’t have access,” she said. “We’re learning a lot. We always learn a lot each year talking to people in other places about what works for them and what they do.”
The state of West Virginia is contributing 16,712 naloxone kits for Save a Life Day, which is 2,084 more kits than it did in 2024, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services told West Virginia Watch in an email. Each kit contains two doses of the drug. 
Caroline Wilson, who coordinates the national event, said the most exciting aspect of the event is the unity of volunteers from all the states coming together. 
“We’re trying to help each other. We’re trying to bring the numbers down. Yes, they’ve been dropping, but [it’s] still too many,” Wilson said. “And so it’s just amazing to see how many people are really passionate about this and want to work together and solve the overdose crisis.”

This year, the Matthew Perry Foundation and Healing Appalachia partnered to sponsor Save a Life Day, Wilson said. The “Friends” star died in October 2023 of a ketamine overdose. 
CareSource is providing funding to supply at least one newspaper-style distribution box for each state, she said. The boxes can be filled and refilled with naloxone so that people can have access to the drug as needed.
This year’s event will also add an advocacy component. Volunteers can get post cards to send to their local officials with messages encouraging them to use their opioid settlement funds to support harm reduction programs. 
While naloxone has been available over the counter since 2023, Wilson said Save a Life Day still has an important role. It allows volunteers to meet people they normally wouldn’t encounter. Many people have stories about the people who in their lives who have struggled with drug use or died of an overdose. The event also helps to decrease stigma, she said.
“It’s really cool to me, how they come up and they feel comfortable [telling their stories] just because of what we’re out there doing. They haven’t really met people like us before that they can just openly say these things too.”

The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to reinstate its ban on issuing U.S. passports that reflect the chosen sex markers of transgender and nonbinary individuals.
A federal appeals court earlier this month upheld a temporary injunction against the Trump administration ban, which began with an executive order issued on the president’s first day in office. President Donald Trump’s order declared that the U.S. recognizes only two sexes, male and female, and it directed the State Department to issue passports that “reflect the holder’s sex.”
Trump order barring passport gender marker changes leaves transgender Tennesseans without IDs

In practice, the policy froze the ability of transgender individuals to obtain a passport that reflected their lived gender. 
In Tennessee, where state officials in 2023 denied trans people the right to make gender changes on driver’s licenses, Trump’s executive order jeopardized the only available form of government-issued ID available that accurately reflects the gender of transgender and nonbinary Tennesseans.
Molly Quinn, executive director for OUT Memphis, said she worries months of uncertain litigation over the ban have created confusion or discouraged people from pursuing a passport.  
Currently, transgender and nonbinary individuals have the right to apply for a new or updated passport that reflects their gender identity.
The ACLU of Tennessee and OUT Memphis, an LGBTQ advocacy organization, are holding virtual clinics intended to reach residents across the state through the passport application process, including offering guidance on applying on an expedited basis, Quinn said. 
“We’ll keep doing them until our legal partners tell us to pause,” she said.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and CatchLight/Report for America)In late August 2020, Ashlee Guidry and her staff kept a wary eye on guidance from local officials as Hurricane Laura passed over Cuba en route to southwestern Louisiana. Guidry was responsible for the safety of dozens of people living at Stonebridge Place, an assisted living and memory care facility in Sulphur.
For days, Laura was just a tropical storm, wet and disorganized. But the Gulf of Mexico was warm — much warmer than average. Local officials worried the temperatures could supercharge the storm as it spun toward the Louisiana coast. So, just as Laura approached the open Gulf, two days before it would make landfall 30 miles south of Stonebridge, Guidry made the call to evacuate.
“We had to make the call as the weather started to change,” she said. “I don’t think anybody anticipated it to be as strong as it was.”
Residents were sent to a partner facility about four hours north of Stonebridge. Those with the most serious medical conditions were taken by ambulance. Others packed into vans. They avoided the highways, taking backroads for most of the drive. In the time it took to settle into the other facility, Laura rapidly strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane. It eventually became one of the strongest hurricanes to make landfall in the U.S. in the last century. It also tied for the fastest rate of intensification, with wind speeds intensifying by 65 mph in just 24 hours.
A hotter Gulf and wetter climate create more opportunity for hurricanes to intensify much faster with less notice to call for evacuations, as also seen in more recent storms like Hurricanes Ida and Helene. It’s still hard to predict how much or how fast a storm will strengthen, despite recent advances in forecasting.

Representatives of southern Louisiana communities have pressed the state to overhaul its infrastructure by turning highway shoulders into temporary travel lanes to make it easier for residents to leave as the window for evacuation shortens. But the state’s underfunded Department of Transportation and Development has balked at the multibillion-dollar price tag.
The process of evacuating can be dangerous, especially for people living in medical facilities, elderly people, or those dealing with chronic health issues. That’s why planning and timing are critical, said Guidry and other medical professionals. Gridlocks, bottlenecks, and vehicle breakdowns can result in injury, even death. In 2005, nearly 100 people died in the evacuation of Houston ahead of Hurricane Rita, which also rapidly intensified, largely due to a fatal combination of gridlock and extreme heat.
In 2022, the Louisiana Legislature created a task force with representatives from southeastern and southwestern Louisiana to study the state’s contraflow plan after lengthy evacuation times ahead of Hurricane Ida the year before. When the state enacts contraflow, all travel lanes on main evacuation routes lead out of southeastern Louisiana, allowing more people to leave in a short time frame. It was once the state’s go-to strategy for last-minute mass evacuations, though it isn’t always possible to implement. To launch the state’s current contraflow plan, several triggers must be met at least 72 hours before a storm’s landfall.
“If you go back the last three years, the storms have been pretty serious. Quickly intensifying, shifting direction, and lasting longer,” said Louisiana Rep. Matt Willard, D-New Orleans, who authored the resolution. “So we really do need to take our contraflow processes and evacuation processes seriously and start looking at what they look like over the next decade.”
As hurricanes intensify faster, the state’s existing contraflow plan has grown less and less feasible. Contraflow is also labor-intensive and can make it harder to stage resources to respond in the aftermath of a storm, so state officials have moved away from the evacuation strategy.

The task force delivered several recommendations, from shortening the time needed to initiate contraflow to repairing evacuation routes closed due to safety. The task force also introduced a strategy used in Texas and Florida: widening existing highways so the shoulders can be used as additional travel lanes to relieve congestion. The strategy is known as “evaculanes” or “emergency shoulder use.”
The state Department of Transportation and Development declined to pursue any of the recommendations. Instead, state agency spokesman Rodney Mallett said officials have focused on encouraging residents not to rely on strategies like contraflow, which is meant to be used rarely as a last resort.
Contraflow requires immense coordination among state and local agencies as well as Mississippi officials. The state has implemented contraflow twice: to evacuate 1.2 million residents ahead of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and then for a mass evacuation of 2 million residents ahead of Hurricane Gustav in 2008. It was also partially implemented for evacuations ahead of Hurricane Ivan in 2004.
Although contraflow requires less lead time in other states, Louisiana officials say a shorter time frame isn’t possible.
The current 72-hour plan includes 22 hours for transportation staff to prepare the roads and change thousands of signals to switch directions. For Katrina, the state completed preparations for contraflow within six hours, allowing officials to open all lanes for 25 hours before the weather deteriorated.

An alternative evacuation strategy
Louisiana isn’t the only state hesitant to rely on contraflow. Florida, the only state hit by more hurricanes than Louisiana and Texas, has never implemented its contraflow plan. Instead, in 2016, it developed a strategy called emergency shoulder use. Rather than reverse traffic, the state adds a temporary travel lane by using the existing shoulder on its evacuation routes.
“We were looking for something that was more efficient for us to do that took less resources,” said Rudy Powell, the Florida Department of Transportation’s chief engineer of operations. When they looked at the data, Powell said, using the shoulders gave the state a similar level of relief as contraflow, with a fraction of the resources, such as fewer law enforcement staff.

Contraflow is also less safe to operate at night, while emergency shoulders can run continuously without blocking out-of-state resources from entering areas ahead of the storm, such as groceries and other supplies. Depending on which highways need more capacity, Powell said, the emergency use of shoulders takes two to four hours to implement.
“This is our go-to strategy for hurricane evacuation traffic,” Powell said. “The times we implemented it, it’s made a big difference in volume and speed. The whole idea is to keep traffic flowing.”
Traffic may still creep along slowly, but it will be moving, he said.
Willard said the Louisiana Contraflow Task Force proposed the use of shoulders to the state as another way to help people evacuate faster.
“You can stymie the congestion and prevent people from sitting in hours of traffic, especially people who wait until the last minute,” Willard said.
But the Louisiana transportation department said the strategy would be too expensive to even consider implementing in the state.
Unlike Florida, Louisiana hasn’t historically constructed shoulders wide enough to be safely used as temporary travel lanes. The standard for highway and bridge construction in Florida has long required the state to build shoulders at least 10 feet wide. Shoulders must be at least 8 feet wide to accommodate traffic. They also have to be structurally secure. Louisiana roads and bridges are narrower, such as the shoulders on the Interstate 10 bridge over the Bonnet Carré Spillway.
The Interstate 10 Bonnet Carré Spillway Bridge, as seen on Sept. 15, 2025, from a SouthWings flight. Widening such bridges to better accommodate traffic during hurricane evacuations would cost up to $28 million per mile, according to Louisiana’s transportation department. (Photo by Christiana Botic//Verite News and CatchLight/Report for America)
In 2024, the transportation department estimated that reconstructing the shoulders along I-10, I-59, and I-55 and their bridges would cost at least $1 billion, not including other structures that would need to be rebuilt to accommodate the new shoulder width. The majority of that money would go toward widening the bridges, which would cost up to $28 million per mile.
Shawn Wilson led the Department of Transportation under Gov. John Bel Edwards from 2016 until Wilson resigned in early 2023 for an unsuccessful run for governor. He said the agency had begun taking steps toward rehabilitating the state’s inconsistent shoulder construction before he left, even incorporating wider shoulders on new bridges along I-12. While the changes would be costly, Wilson said he believes they could be done incrementally, within other road projects, so the state could eventually use the shoulders as evacuation lanes.
“Looking to do all of that at one time is just not financially feasible or recommended,” Wilson said. “It does take time, and the best way to approach it is to have consistent, steady investment in infrastructure.”
But any road improvements, Wilson said, are weighed against the cheaper cost to simply maintain state highways as they are. Louisiana ranks among the lowest in transportation spending, and the state’s spending on highways has fallen since 2007. A decades-old fuel tax is the only consistent source of revenue, but it hasn’t been enough to even maintain the state’s aging infrastructure. And Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana President Steven Procopio said the lack of funding has led to a $19 billion backlog in road projects. In 2023, the state and federal fuel tax combined raised $600 million in annual revenue for the agency. Special capital projects typically rely on state surplus dollars, Procopio said.
He noted the state’s 20-cent-per-gallon fuel tax has been the same since 1990 and much of the revenue goes toward paying off old debt, not new projects.
“Inflation is just eating up the spending power of these dollars,” he said.
As construction costs continue to rise, Willard said, now is the time to start looking at ways to start widening highways. He knows it would be costly, but he feels the state could prioritize westbound traffic by starting with the bridge over the Bonnet Carré Spillway as part of a larger construction plan.

“The longer we wait to do stuff like this, the more expensive it becomes,” he said.
Willard said the state legislature could also dedicate surplus funds to work toward additional evacuation lanes, but lawmakers haven’t taken up the issue.

When to leave
Debra Campbell said it took her 14 hours to make the 200-mile drive to Lake Charles when she evacuated New Orleans the day before Hurricane Katrina made landfall. It was the same day then-Mayor Ray Nagin finally called for a mandatory evacuation of the city. (Nagin later admitted he could have issued the order earlier.)
“It was hectic,” Campbell said. “It took so many hours for our people to get to safety. But we got out.”
Campbell made it through the slow-moving traffic unscathed, but, for others, she said the evacuation itself was plagued with stressors like running out of gas or threats of violence from other frustrated motorists.
While more than 1 million people made it out of southeastern Louisiana, tens of thousands remained behind. Many weren’t able to leave. Some didn’t have a car, while many others couldn’t afford the gas needed to evacuate or a multiday hotel stay while waiting to return.
Campbell chaired the state’s Contraflow Task Force and leads A Community Voice-Louisiana, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of low- to moderate-income families in the state. For years, Campbell has advocated for state and local officials to find more ways to get people out of New Orleans and the surrounding parishes, especially people who can’t afford the cost of evacuation.
“The people don’t have the resources to evacuate as it is, so they’re not going to make a move until the very last minute,” she said.
One University of Florida study found that insecure access to transportation can play a key role when making evacuation decisions, including whether residents can receive medical services. Low-income, car-less and senior residents face an increased health risk throughout a hurricane as a result.
In lieu of infrastructure changes, state transportation officials want residents to leave as early as possible.

“We suggest people listen to their local officials, don’t wait until the last minute to evacuate, get a game plan and go north,” Mallett said. He added that the bottleneck ahead of Hurricane Ida was largely constrained to I-10, while evacuation routes north faced less congestion. While evacuees from Baton Rouge took 15 hours to reach Houston, the trip to Dallas took eight hours.
“That’s bad math right there,” Mallett said in a video asking residents to prepare for hurricane season; the agency also suggests finding friends in northern Louisiana.
Leaving early and avoiding popular routes out of New Orleans can reduce the time it takes to evacuate. People who are especially vulnerable to health issues while on the road should prepare their medications, monitor their blood pressure, stay hydrated and ensure they’re able to stay cool while traveling.
The stress of traveling can exacerbate health conditions, on top of the anxiety that weighs many Louisianians down during hurricane season, said DePaul Community Health Centers pharmacy director Raymond Strong.
“For all diseases, whether it’s asthma, hypertension, cancer, or HIV, stress makes it worse,” he said. Planning ahead, he said, can help manage the amount of stress patients feel.
Campbell and others advocating for the state to start planning for more rapidly intensifying storms agree that leaving early is important for safety. But Campbell isn’t convinced it’s realistic, especially for working-class residents.
“People’s finances don’t always allow them to leave early. They have to be pushed to move,” she said, adding that without a mandatory evacuation order, businesses stay open and some people try to stay and work as long as possible. “That’s why we need [the state] to open up all the lanes.”
Although the state isn’t looking to make big changes to its evacuation plans, Campbell said, there has been progress with New Orleans officials. Public buses provided to evacuate residents from the city to shelters could soon be more easily accessible. The city is also considering another task force recommendation: installing a siren system to help alert residents during tornadoes and other hazards.
Campbell said she hopes city and state officials continue to think of more ways to help people leave before major hurricanes hit.
“We have to offer them as much as we can,” she said. “The task force needed to meet with the people who could make a difference, but now we need to see it implemented.”

Kentucky Lantern reporter Liam Niemeyer was honored this week for his reporting on dam safety in Kentucky.
The Association of State Dam Safety Officials at its national conference in Cleveland on Monday awarded Niemeyer its Media Outreach award for his “deep dive” look at the “funding and enforcement challenges that are resulting in dozens of high-hazard potential dams in poor or unsatisfactory conditions.” The organization called it “a case study on dam safety reporting at the state level.” 
Dozens of dams in Kentucky are in poor shape or worse. They won’t be cheap to fix.

Niemeyer’s reporting highlighted the deteriorating condition of dozens of hazardous dams across Kentucky, a growing infrastructure challenge that could potentially cost billions of dollars to fix. His reporting also detailed the challenges with finding and holding accountable dam owners responsible for the worsening infrastructure.
Kentucky Lantern editor Jamie Lucke said, “Liam used the Kentucky Open Records Act to locate dams — 71 of them across Kentucky — that are in poor condition and also in places where leaks or failures would harm people or property. Liam also interviewed government officials, including two mayors on opposite ends of the state, to better convey the challenges of putting together funding and plans to make needed repairs. It’s gratifying that our public service journalism is being recognized by experts in dam safety.”
The Association of State Dam Safety Officials, headquartered in Lexington, represents a range of professionals focused on dam safety including state and federal regulators, engineers, dam owners and operators and more. The organization established the Media Outreach award for journalists in 2017 to recognize reporting that enhances “the public understanding of the impact dams have on society” among other notable contributions on dam safety. 
The organization this week also recognized with a Media Outreach award the work of two Bloomberg reporters who highlighted the impacts of climate change on dam infrastructure across the country. According to the association, previous recipients of the Media Outreach award include The State newspaper in South Carolina and the Associated Press.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3-1024x791.jpg,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357

Its former rep in Congress writes that Nashville provides a cautionary tale against splitting the state's largest city into multiple districts. (Getty Images)The ugly specter of mid-term gerrymandering may be rearing its head in Kentucky, and the potential disruption to our state’s federal representation is impossible to overstate. 
It started in Texas when President Donald Trump urged lawmakers there to redraw their congressional district boundaries in order to create more Republican seats and help protect the GOP’s slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Predictably, Texas Republicans, supported by Trump acolyte Gov. Greg Abbott, complied. In response, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has initiated a process designed to do the same thing in his state, which could balance any Republican gains in Texas. 
Historically, redistricting is done every 10 years following the decennial census. This makes sense because House seats are allocated based on population, which can change significantly over 10 years. 
It is highly unusual for states to redraw district lines between censuses unless they are ordered to do so by the courts. In fact, since 1970, only Texas (twice) and Georgia have redistricted for partisan advantage. But now a redistricting battle is underway, and every state with one-party control and seats held by the minority party is under pressure to enter the fray. Kentucky is in that category. 
My former seat, Kentucky’s 3rd Congressional District, the one now occupied by Morgan McGarvey, is one of the most “logical” districts anywhere. It currently includes all but roughly 20,000 people who live in Louisville Metro, and none outside the city lines. There is no confusion as to what member of Congress represents the interests of the Louisville community, including, for example, the University of Louisville. The mayor and the U.S. representative for the 3rd District have essentially the same constituencies, making coordination of multi-governmental efforts very effective and efficient. 
Now there is discussion among some Republicans in Frankfort about splitting the Louisville community into three different congressional districts, presumably making it almost impossible, in the current environment, for a Democrat to be elected. This strategy was discussed briefly after the 2020 census, but the five Republican members of the Kentucky House delegation, along with Sen. Mitch McConnell, convinced Republicans in the General Assembly that it was a bad idea.
Under the concept under discussion back then, for example, a portion of Louisville would have become part of a district that extended south to the Tennessee border. Understandably, the Republican members of the federal delegation were happy with their “safe” districts and didn’t want a bunch of Louisville Democratic voters in their jurisdictions.
I don’t believe McConnell ever made any public comments about the idea, but I’m sure he understood the political risk of doing something so damaging to his hometown, and also the University of Louisville, to which he has always been fiercely loyal. 
Now the idea apparently has resurfaced, as some Republican members of the Kentucky legislature somehow think they haven’t done enough to disenfranchise many Kentuckians, especially Louisvillians. 
Wiser heads must prevail. Tennessee offers a vivid lesson as to the damage such a move would do. Legislators there split Nashville into three districts during their decennial process. Now the state’s capital has three people representing it in the U.S. House, and this is one case in which more is not better. 
The math is simple. Each congressional district across the country includes roughly 750,000 people. If you divide a district by three, that means in Nashville, 250,000 people are placed in a new district with 500,000 other Tennesseans, most of whom have little in common with them. If you are their representative, whose interests will have your priority? Clearly it is the 500,000, who will most likely have given you your victory margin. 
Right now, Nashville has a Democratic mayor. He must work with three Republican representatives on any federal initiative. I recently spoke with a political scientist at Vanderbilt University who outlined the problems with such a setup. Vanderbilt, for example, has had to reorient its government relations efforts to deal with multiple Washington offices rather than one. I won’t go into all the problems caused in Nashville by this strategy, but suffice to say, Nashville has not benefitted from the redistricting, and neither has anyone else in Tennessee, except Republican candidates.
Missouri is about to do the same thing to Kansas City, breaking up its largest city and economic engine for strictly partisan electoral advantage, and in that case, essentially disenfranchising a large Black population from federal representation. 
Hopefully, this idea will be nipped in the bud. No one should want the University of Louisville to have three representatives, none of whom would consider that institution a priority if they also represented Western Kentucky University or Morehead. It’s true that Louisville’s critical airport has only one representative, but how much interest would someone have in that critical facility if they also represented Bowling Green or Owensboro? Similar examples are numerous. 
Louisville has never had a Black representative in Congress, but Black voters have a decisive impact on who represents them in Congress. That would not be the case if the district is sliced apart. It is a certainty that such a plan would be challenged in court on racial discrimination grounds.
Most Americans don’t like gerrymandering, which serves nothing but partisan electoral ambitions. They believe, as I do, that voters should choose their politicians; politicians should not choose their voters. I am less and less optimistic that today’s Kentucky Republican officials will consider the public interest, but hope springs eternal.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1094078594-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357

Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin testifying against the U.S. Army during the Army-McCarthy hearings in Washington, D.C., June 9, 1954. McCarthy stands before a map which charts Communist activity in the United States. (Photo by Getty Images)This commentary was originally published by the Wisconsin Examiner.
Driven by “a lineup of disgraceful racial bigots and American fascists,” a divisive political crusade by conservatives in the United States was “like a gigantic, tumultuous hurricane” that “dominated the thoughts and actions of the American people, disrupting their emotions, distorting their judgment ….” Those are the words of Michigan Republican Charles E. Potter, a member of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, who, in his 1965 book “Days of Shame,” repudiated the excesses of the McCarthy era.
I read Potter’s 60-year-old mea culpa in David Maraniss’s powerful personal history, “A Good American Family: The Red Scare and My Father,” (Simon & Schuster 2019), which traces the Maraniss family’s harrowing journey to Madison, Wisconsin. The anti-McCarthy Capital Times newspaper saved Maraniss’s dad, Elliott, giving him a job after he was blacklisted and then followed from town to town by federal agents investigating his political activities over “five years, five cities, four kids, eight homes, two papers that fired him, three papers that folded,” as Maraniss writes.
I binge-read the book amid a storm of news as the administration of President Donald Trump ramped up attacks on leftwing activists, Democrats, progressive nonprofits and the media, blaming them for the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, and vowing to attack what White House adviser Stephen Miller called a “vast domestic terror movement,” using the full force of the federal government to “identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks.”

I reached out to Maraniss Thursday in Madison, where the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and author grew up and still spends summers. ABC had just indefinitely suspended late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel for criticizing the MAGA movement’s weaponization of the Kirk shooting. And Trump and his FCC chairman were threatening to yank broadcasting licenses from media outlets that criticize the president.
I wanted to ask Maraniss about the parallels he sees between the time he describes so vividly in his book and the current moment.
“There are several obvious haunting similarities,” he told me on the phone, “the demonization of others, the calling of all opponents Marxist or communists or enemies of the state, the gross manipulation of truth, the use of fear to stifle dissent and pressure to silence the media or get the press to go along.”
“Back then,” he added, “most of the press did go along with McCarthy for a long time.”
The Capital Times stood out as an early critic of Wisconsin’s bombastic Red-hunting senator, Joseph McCarthy. Syndicated columnist Drew Pearson was another prominent anti-McCarthy voice, along with Murrey Marder of the Washington Post and Edward R. Murrow — all mentioned in Maraniss’s book. “But you could cite many more that were going along with McCarthyism.”
The main difference Maraniss sees between the McCarthy era and today is that “McCarthy was only a senator, and now we’re dealing with the president, with full control of the levers of power which McCarthy did not have, ranging from the Justice Department to the military.”
McCarthy took aim at major U.S. institutions — from government agencies to  universities to Hollywood to mainline Protestant churches — but he overstepped when began attacking the U.S. Army, infuriating then-President Dwight Eisenhower.
Another glaring difference between then and now, Maraniss added, “is that McCarthy did not have the full support of his own party, the Republican Party.” Today, “almost any Republican who opposed Trump is now no longer in office or in the party.”
It took a long time, however, for mainstream media and mainstream Republicans to turn against McCarthyism and for the public to swing from the distorted thinking former HUAC member Potter finally repudiated to the consensus that leftwing political ideology did not, in fact, pose an existential threat to U.S. national security.
Among the many echoes of Red Scare fever resonating through national politics today is the central issue of race. One of the most gripping scenes in Maraniss’s book is future Detroit Mayor Coleman Young’s testimony before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee in the Federal Building in Detroit. Young, a World War II veteran, confronts the southern racists on the committee as they question his loyalty, repeatedly correcting their slurring pronunciation of the world “Negro.” Despite the committee’s high-handedness and multiple attempts to silence him, Young has the last word.
“I fought in the last war and I would unhesitatingly take up arms against anybody that attacks this country,” he says. “In the same manner, I am now in the process of fighting against what I consider to be attacks and discrimination against my people. I am fighting against un-American activities such as lynchings and denial of the vote. I am dedicated to that fight and I don’t think I must apologize or explain it to anybody, my position on that.”
Reading about Young and the other brave souls who stood up to McCarthyism, including the elder Maraniss’s lawyer, George Crockett, who was jailed for contempt and returned to continue fighting, is inspiring and thrilling.
In contrast, Maraniss traces the sordid history of U.S. Rep. John Stephens Wood, a Democrat from Georgia and chairman of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan (though he claimed he only went to one meeting). He lays out the evidence that Wood attended the lynching of Leo Frank, a Jewish industrialist who was accused of killing of a young, female factory worker in Georgia. Wood was the “wheelman” for Judge Newt Morris, his mentor, helping to collect the body from the lynchers and drive it to the morgue.
White racists, as Potter later acknowledged, played a prominent role in the McCarthy era purges of “un-American” activists. These were the people who sat in judgment of civil rights leaders, Black unionists and activists for racial equality. Maraniss’s father, an antifascist who joined the Communist Party when he was in college at the University of Michigan, led an all-Black battalion in World War II, and dedicated his life to his idealistic view of America, was the target of people who had little respect for equal rights or the Constitution.
Who are the real patriots, Maraniss asks — a question that resonates today.
“Race is at the center of American life, then and now,” Maraniss said on the phone. “And what we’re facing this time is really an attempt to erase the civil rights movement.”
“The chairman of the House un American Activities Committee that went after my father was a Georgia racist who was elected in white-only primaries and opposed every civil rights measure, and he was the one defining what’s an American,” he said. “And you have a similar thing going on now where Charlie Kirk is celebrated on NFL stadium screens and people are being fired left and right, for criticizing someone who disparaged Martin Luther King.”
It’s important not to be cowed by the deliberate use of language as a weapon to promote misunderstanding, he said, “as they have with DEI. I mean, what is on its face wrong with diversity, equity and inclusion, you know? Think about it. I mean, the same thing with being antifascist. I mean, people should embrace those ideas and not run away from them.”
Of his parents, Maraniss writes: “They never betrayed America and loved it no less than the officials who rendered judgment on them in Room 740 of the Federal Building in Detroit. They were dissenters who believed the nation had not lived up to its founding ideals in terms of race and equality, largely because of the reactionary attitudes of self-righteous attackers on the American right.”
The book ends happily. The Maraniss family arrived in Wisconsin in time to watch the Milwaukee Braves play their way to a pennant and eventually beat the Yankees in the World Series. “McCarthy was dead. The Supreme Court had essentially overturned the Smith Act, ruling it was unconstitutional to bring charges against American citizens solely because of their political advocacy. … The world was opening anew.”
But there is, of course, no real end to the struggle. In an epilogue, Maraniss writes about Cap Times reporter John Patrick Hunter, who, long after the Red Scare was safely over,  typed up sections of the preamble to the Declaration of Independence, combined it with a petition listing six of the 10 amendments to the Bill of Rights, along with the Fifteenth Amendment granting Black men the right to vote, then roamed a local park in Madison trying to collect signatures. “He gave the people the nation’s foundational truth and it did not go well,” Maraniss writes. “Of the 112 people he asked to sign the petition. Only one did. Twenty accused him of being a communist.”
“It is an endless struggle,” Maraniss said on the phone. “That’s what life is. And you know, it tends to go in cycles of reaction and counter reaction. This is a very, very difficult one of those cycles. But I’ve been an optimist my whole life. It’s being challenged like never before in my life. My father endured it and came out an optimist anyway, somehow. So to honor my father, I maintain my optimism.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) Three Stafford County voters are asking a judge to remove Democratic House of Delegates nominee Stacey Carroll from the ballot, arguing she doesn’t actually live in the district where she registered to vote and is running for office. 
The petition, filed in Stafford County Circuit Court, contends Carroll lives at a longtime home in House District 23 while claiming a different address in neighboring House District 64 to qualify for the race.
In the complaint brought under a Virginia statute that allows voters to object to another person’s registration, petitioners Stephen Edward Schwartz, Judith Anne Parker and Juliet McGee Schweiter allege Carroll changed her voter registration on Feb. 5, 2025, to an address on Pinkerton Court in District 64 but “continues to reside” on Bismark Drive in District 23. The latter, which includes parts of Stafford and Prince William counties, is currently represented by Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William. 
The filing lists the Bismark Drive house as a property Carroll has owned and occupied since 2018. It asks the court to hear the case on an expedited basis, cancel Carroll’s District 64 registration and direct state officials to decertify her candidacy and remove her from the ballot.
The petition says the Pinkerton Court property “is owned by Jared Harmon and Crystal Harmon,” and that the Harmons still live there. 
The voters say their challenge rests on months of observation and documentary indicators they argue show Carroll never moved. 
“Carroll is physically present at 71 Bismark Drive on a consistent basis,” the petition alleges, adding that her “primary vehicle, a white 2017 Cadillac Escalade, is consistently parked” at the Bismark Drive address “for significant periods of the day and overnight.”

The filing also asserts she “continues to receive mail” at Bismark Drive, “pays the electricity bill” there, and that her certified public accountant license lists Bismark as her residence. Conversely, “Motor vehicles belonging to Carroll and her immediate family have not been observed” at the Pinkerton Court address, and the Harmons’ vehicles are regularly there, the petition says.
Under Virginia law, voters must be residents of the precinct where they vote, a concept that “requires both domicile and place of abode,” according to Article II, Section 1 of the state Constitution quoted in the suit. 
State statute similarly defines domicile as a person’s primary home requiring presence and an intent to remain, and the petition cites case law that “there must be both act and intention in order to acquire new legal residence.” The burden to show the change is on the registrant, the filing says, quoting the Supreme Court of Virginia’s Kegley v. Johnson decision in 1966.
Because the constitution also requires would-be delegates to be residents of the district they seek to represent, the petitioners argue, Carroll “is not qualified to be a delegate from House of Delegates District 64” if she is not lawfully registered there. 
The filing says notice of the petition was provided to Carroll and the state Democratic Party on Aug. 29.
Carroll, a military veteran who is challenging Del. Paul Milde, R-Stafford, pushed back forcefully on the lawsuit, calling it an attack not just on her but on military families more broadly. 
“The accusations about where I live are false and insulting to every veteran and military family who knows what it means to move in service to our country,” she said in an email. She added that she is “a proud resident of House District 64” and remains “committed to serving this community.” 
Carroll argued that questioning her residency was an affront to those who relocate for service, saying, “To suggest that military families don’t belong in the communities they serve dishonors that sacrifice.”
The lawsuit names as respondents Stafford County General Registrar Anna Hash, the Virginia State Board of Elections, the Department of Elections, and Carroll. The venue is proper, the petition says, because all three petitioners are Stafford County voters and Carroll “is on the registration records in Stafford County.”
Residency disputes surface periodically in Virginia, particularly after redistricting. 
In 2023, several Chesterfield County residents challenged Democratic Sen. Ghazala Hashmi’s eligibility, arguing she hadn’t met residency requirements in the newly drawn 15th Senate District. A Chesterfield judge dismissed the challenge after a hearing, and reporting at the time detailed the petitioners’ surveillance-style claims about vehicle movements and time spent at a prior family home — paralleling some of the allegations seen in the Carroll petition. 
Earlier, in 2011, voters used the same Virginia Code § 24.2-431 process to challenge the registration of House candidate David Ramadan in Loudoun County’s newly created 87th District. The court opinion and contemporaneous reporting show petitioners argued Ramadan lacked proper domicile in the district.
The legal standards the Stafford petition leans on are longstanding. In Kegley v. Johnson, the Virginia Supreme Court emphasized that a voter changing residence must pair a physical move with intent to remain, and the registrant bears the burden to prove both.
The petition here quotes that principle and also cites the State Board of Elections’ regulatory definition of “domicile” as “a person’s primary home, the place where a person dwells and which [s]he considers to be the center of h[er] domestic, social, and civil life.”
In the Stafford case, the petitioners list a dozen factual assertions they say support their claim that Bismark Drive remains Carroll’s true home — ranging from overnight parking patterns and household trash production to utility payments and mail delivery — and assert “no activity has been observed” at Bismark Drive “that is consistent with a change in residency, such as a moving truck, packing, or other similar activities.” 
At the Pinkerton address, they allege, “no activity has been observed … that is consistent with a change in residency.”
The filing also argues the petitioners have a “constitutional and statutory right to be represented in the House of Delegates by a resident” of their district and that Carroll’s alleged misregistration infringes that right. 
While each case turns on its facts, Virginia’s press and courts have noted these fights often hinge on documentary breadcrumbs and ordinary-life details that show where a candidate actually lives. 
The Mercury has previously examined how residency and redistricting rules can scramble political maps and candidacies after lines are redrawn, noting that the state’s requirement that legislators reside in the districts they represent has added “intrigue” to election cycles.
The Stafford petition does not specify a hearing date but asks for expedited consideration under the election code. If the court agrees with the petitioners, it could cancel Carroll’s registration at the Pinkerton address and order her decertified as a candidate in District 64. 
If the court finds Carroll established domicile in District 64 and abandoned the Bismark Drive domicile, the case would be dismissed — similar to how the Hashmi challenge ended in 2023.
Residency objections during election cycles are typically handled promptly given looming timelines.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Lake-minded New Hampshire legislators are gearing up to tackle water quality once again this session, after some measures aimed at preventing and treating cyanobacteria blooms were voted down or softened last session.
“We’ve got a really enormous problem headed at us, especially with climate change and warming waters,” said sponsor Sen. David Watters. “… I’m worried it will create this toxic stew in our lakes and along the shore.”
Watters said he had two main objectives in mind for the bill: Formalizing a strategy to address cyanobacteria blooms and other emerging water quality threats, then settling on a way to fund those efforts.
Blooms are population explosions of single-celled, toxin-producing organisms called cyanobacteria. Sometimes, they appear as surface scum or swirling green clouds, but they may also sink to the bottom of a lake or appear less dense, making them invisible to the casual observer. 
Cyanobacteria thrive in nutrient-flooded water, often the result of septic and fertilizer runoff, and in warm temperatures. Warming associated with climate change is causing them to appear more often, and though they typically occur in summer, in some New Hampshire lakes, cyanobacteria blooms are occurring year-round.
Though officials have previously downplayed the risks associated with cyanobacteria, the organisms can indeed be dangerous. The toxins cyanobacteria release can cause health concerns for people and pets who come into contact with blooms, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Reactions to cyanobacteria range from rashes and headaches to nausea, cough, and neurological symptoms, depending on exposure level and the type of bacterial toxin emitted by the bloom.  
“There is a health issue here, a potential health issue that I think we need to really address,” said bill co-sponsor Rep. Rosemarie Rung, citing research linking cyanobacteria toxin exposure to the neurodegenerative disease ALS.
For these reasons, and to safeguard the economic role New Hampshire’s lakes play in the state’s tourism economy, Rung and Watters said finding a policy path toward addressing cyanobacteria was a priority.
Previous legislative efforts regarding cyanobacteria have sought to limit them at the source by reducing the influx of nutrient-rich chemical fertilizers into New Hampshire’s water supply. Legislators showed bipartisan support for a bill restricting some fertilizers and creating guidelines prohibiting fertilizer application near storm drains when they overturned then-Gov. Chris Sununu’s veto of the measure in October 2024. (However, the House later softened penalties for prohibited fertilizer application during the 2025 session.)
Once a cyanobacteria bloom emerges in a body of water, the cost required to treat it begins to climb. 
“Addressing cyanobacteria is incredibly expensive,” Rung said.
Aluminum is often used to rid lakes of the blooms, a feat it accomplishes by binding to the bacteria-nourishing element phosphorus and sinking, removing the nutrient from the water column. But on top of the fact that the treatments can endanger lakes’ broader ecosystems and aren’t considered permanent solutions by biologists, they can also carry price tags in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The Legislature established a cyanobacteria fund several years ago to combat the blooms, Rung said, and through it disbursed about $3 million in state and American Rescue Plan Act funding for treatment of lakes around the state. But all that action depleted the fund, Rung said.
“That money’s gone,” she said. 
Watters said the high cost of treating cyanobacteria was worth it in the context of New Hampshire lakes’ function as economic engines and their cultural importance. Watters is worried the blooms will worsen, sickening people and pets and affecting fisheries and property values, he said.
Another possible funding route that Rung introduced last session, which would feed the cyanobacteria fund through sales of a “Love NH Lakes” license plate, was retained in the transportation committee.  
According to a draft version of Watters’ planned bill, the proposal would amend statute to permit the formation of village districts around the goal of addressing water quality concerns, including cyanobacteria blooms. 
Village districts allow regions across multiple municipalities or a smaller portion of a single municipality to operate as an organized body. In the context of cyanobacteria, Rung and Watters hope this would help districts coordinate efforts to control the blooms. With voter approval, the districts could also raise funds for remediation, they said.
This idea has already been raised in the Legislature in prior years by lawmakers of both parties without success. A bill sponsored by former Rep. Dan Wolf in 2024 was the first attempt at such an amendment, narrowly failing in the House, Rung recalled. Last session, Rung introduced a similar bill again — but it was controversial among conservative legislators who considered it another avenue toward “adding a new tax,” she said.
Rung disagrees with this assessment, saying the modification would principally allow lakefront property owners to organize themselves across municipality lines. A vote would be required to raise taxes within the districts, she said. 
Watters said he expected some lawmakers to categorically resist the possibility of raising taxes for any reason, including to fight cyanobacteria. But, he said, lakefront property owners may feel differently, especially if their property values and lifestyles could be affected by cyanobacteria blooms.
“The people who are part of these water districts on the lakes — they know we have to do something,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cyanobacteriabills-1024x752.jpg,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357

(Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)News of Pennsylvania’s budget impasse reads like sports coverage with mention of wins, losses, pitches and next moves. 
But for sexual assault survivors and the organizations that support them, the state budget isn’t a game. 
It’s a lifeline.
We each serve as the president of an agency’s board of directors, either for our local rape crisis center or their statewide coalition. A large portion of the services we provide are funded by the state; because of the impasse, our agencies are working without payment. 
But we can’t hold out much longer.
Rape crisis centers in Pa. say flat funding threatens survivor support

Across the Commonwealth, rape crisis centers annually support 27,000 people impacted by sexual violence – one-third of whom are children – with services including 24/7 crisis hotlines and forensic rape exam accompaniment, victim advocacy, and counseling. We meet victims in the darkest moments of their lives, and work with them towards healing. 
Our crucial services continue through the budget impasse because sexual assault does not pause for politics. 
Yet this puts our agencies in an unsustainable situation. How are we supposed to do our jobs without payment? 
Each day, the impasse continues causes more harm. Many centers have already had to slash benefits, furlough staff and max out lines of credit; some are considering temporarily closing if this goes on much longer.
What does that mean for our communities when rape crisis centers aren’t there to respond?  Phone calls at 3:00 a.m. from a survivor with PTSD are sent to voicemail. Victims in the ER are handed a business card instead of having an advocate at their side during a rape exam. Child survivors are put on long wait lists for therapy. 










Each day the impasse continues causes more harm. Many centers have already had to slash benefits, furlough staff and max out lines of credit; some are considering temporarily closing if this goes on much longer.


In short: victims don’t get the support they need, trauma goes untreated, and people suffer. 
We hope that this is a reminder to everyone in the commonwealth that the state budget isn’t about politics. It’s about people’s lives. 
Pennsylvania’s rape crisis centers have never stopped doing their job. Now we need our state leaders to stop playing games and do theirs.

At least nearly a dozen LifeWise Academy Ohio programs have taken public school students on field trips to the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter in Kentucky, which claims humans lived alongside dinosaurs and the Earth is only 6,000 years old.
LifeWise Academy is a controversial Hilliard-based religious instruction program for public school students on “religious release time,” that operates in 34 states and plans to enroll nearly 100,000 students this school year, according to its website.
It will also be in almost half of Ohio’s public school districts this school year.
LifeWise Academy programs in Adams County, Holgate Schools (Henry County), Continental Schools (Putnam County), Antwerp Schools (Paulding County), Wayne Trace Schools (Paulding County), Paulding Schools (Paulding County), Central Local (Defiance County), Van Wert (Van Wert County), and Tinora (part of Northeastern Schools in Defiance County) have all taken field trips to the Ark Encounter this year, in 2024 or 2023, according to Facebook posts from those LifeWise programs.

Pandora-Gilboa’s LifeWise Academy Program (Putnam County) has visited the Creation Museum every year from 2021-2025 and Upper Arlington’s LifeWise Program (Franklin County) visited the museum in 2023, according to Facebook posts from those LifeWise programs. 
The Creation Museum promotes young Earth creationism, the belief that God created the universe and everything in it in six 24-hour days 6,000 years ago. 
This comes from a literal interpretation of Genesis 1 where God created the universe. 
The museum in Petersburg, Kentucky depicts humans and dinosaurs living together and characterizes the Earth as approximately 6,000 years old. 
“LifeWise teaches Bible lessons, plain and simple,” Christine Czernejewski, a spokesperson for LifeWise, said in an email. “As such, kids are taught what Genesis 1 actually says — that God created all things and that He created them over the course of 6 different days.”
Scientists have determined Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old. 
“The science (at the Creation Museum), it’s just appalling,” said Daniel Phelps, a retired geologist based in Kentucky. 
“They depict dinosaurs and humans as living together. They have many, multiple attacks on the standard view of science, especially things like theology and biology and paleontology. … They misinterpret a lot of the human fossil record, and the Art Park especially has a display that disputes climate science.”
LifeWise Academy is a non-denominational Christian program that teaches the Bible to public school students during the school day at a special release time.
“We tend to teach the Bible kind of as it teaches,” said LifeWise Founder and CEO Joel Penton. “We do talk through the six days of creation as outlined in Genesis 1. However, developing a systematic theology of young Earth versus old Earth, we leave that to local churches.”

In January, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a law passed by Republican lawmakers that mandates public school districts create a policy allowing students release time for religious instruction.
It concerns Phelps that LifeWise programs are taking students to the museum and the ark. 
“I would like to call this educational malpractice,” Phelps said. “It simply is not science, and the students are being misled. They’re basically learning to distrust science and follow an extremely fringe version of Christianity.”
A 2019 Gallup poll showed that 40% of U.S. adults believe in creationism, the belief that God created humans in their present form within roughly the past 10,000 years.   
“Most Christians don’t accept the fundamentalist version of creationism,” Phelps said. “… It’s also going to hurt kids that want to have a future studying science and are going to learn all these things that just simply are not true.”
The Creation Museum and the Ark Encounter are both operated by Answers in Genesis, a fundamentalist Christian apologetics organization that promotes young Earth creationism. 
The Creation Museum opened in 2007 and the Ark Encounter, 510-foot wooden ship intended as a replica of the biblical Noah’s Ark, opened in 2016. 
LifeWise said all field trips require parental permission. 
“LifeWise programs have taken field trips to museums, local parks, sporting events and area churches,” Czernejewski said.

(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Community Change) Earlier this year, some conservative states began to embrace child tax credits that put cash directly into the hands of families raising children.
Long favored by liberals, child tax credits can help ease the financial burdens of parenthood and have been shown to slash childhood poverty rates.
But despite initial optimism from sponsors and child welfare advocates, Republican proposals in Indiana and Ohio did not advance this year. Had either measure passed, it would have been the first refundable child tax credit approved in a conservative state.
“The result has been more talk than action,” said Aidan Davis, state policy director at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which has tracked the issue.
Despite the Indiana and Ohio rejections, Georgia did approve a new $250 annual tax credit this year, and Utah expanded eligibility for the state’s existing child tax credit program. But both of those are nonrefundable credits, meaning they do not aid the lowest-income families, who earn too little to owe income taxes.
Refundable tax credits provide money directly to families: While parents must still file tax returns, refundable credits give parents funds even if they earn too little to owe income tax.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

“When child tax credits are refundable, they boost the incomes of families with children and can provide a little financial breathing room — which goes a long way in creating a healthy environment for kids to grow up,” Davis told Stateline.
Still, Davis said movement in states such as Utah and Georgia does mark important progress, especially if lawmakers are willing to reassess the details of the programs, namely whether to make the credit refundable.
“It’s a step forward in those states, but there are much more effective ways to design those policies to best support children and families,” she said.
Georgia’s child tax credit was a priority of Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, now a Republican candidate for governor, as part of a wider effort on child care affordability. Jones framed the child tax credit and an expanded child care tax credit as means of boosting the workforce and reducing costs for families.
In Utah, lawmakers expanded the state’s child tax credit as part of a wider tax cut package. Republican state Rep. Mark Strong argued expanding the program would help families and societies.
“We’d also love to encourage young families to have children,” he said, according to the Deseret News.
Setbacks
Early this year, Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed a refundable tax credit worth up to $1,000 per child up to age 6, to be paid for by an increase in tobacco taxes. When introducing the idea, DeWine said the concept was bipartisan, “not a liberal or a conservative proposal.”
But the state House stripped the proposal from the budget. In June, advocates pushed a conference committee to reinstate the measure, but there was little appetite in the GOP-dominated chambers.
“Other than the governor, at least among the legislature, I haven’t heard anybody who was interested in bringing the idea back,” Republican state House Speaker Matt Huffman said, according to The Statehouse News Bureau.
‘Why not us?’ Nannies, housekeepers win labor protections in some states.

House leaders previously said they were skeptical of any proposed tax increases this session — including the governor’s plan to pay for the child tax credit through higher cigarette taxes.
In June, Huffman said he was more focused on delivering low taxes to Ohioans across the board and questioned the impact a $1,000 tax credit would have on families.
“I don’t think it’s a tremendous tax break to many Ohioans,” he said.
Lawmakers sent their final budget to the governor without the tax credit — but did include tax cuts for wealthy Ohioans and hundreds of millions of dollars for a new Cleveland Browns stadium. DeWine signed the budget bill July 1.
In Indiana, a plan to give a $500 refundable tax credit to families with an infant sailed through the state Senate.
The measure’s Republican sponsor, state Sen. Greg Walker, told Stateline in March he hoped the bill might prove a first step in creating a broader child tax credit program.
“I think it’s — pardon the pun — a baby step to introduce a credit for a newborn,” he said. “I don’t think anyone disputes … all the costs associated with bringing a new baby into the world.”
The bill received unanimous approval from a Senate committee and passed through the upper chamber without any opposing votes. But the measure did not advance beyond a state House committee.
In a recent statement to Stateline, Walker said he would not reintroduce the proposal next year because 2026 is not a budget cycle year for the legislature.
“There is little traction for changing tax law to reduce state receipts without a corresponding reduction in allocations,” his statement said.
Growing interest
State interest in creating or expanding child tax credits boomed after the pandemic-era expansion of the federal child tax credit delivered cash directly to millions.


12 states and the District of Columbia have refundable child tax credits.


That move quickly lifted millions of children out of poverty, according to research from Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy.
But the expanded tax credit expired in 2021 — leading to a doubling in the nation’s childhood poverty rate in 2022.
Before the pandemic, only New York and California had refundable child tax credits. Since then, 10 more liberal-leaning states and the District of Columbia have implemented such policies, according to the Center on Poverty and Social Policy.
Researchers there found state programs can reduce childhood poverty and boost household incomes if the tax credits are fully refundable, provide at least $1,000 per child and are available to families with children across all ages and wide income ranges.
As child poverty doubles, states launch or expand their own tax credits

In Colorado and Minnesota — states with robust programs — child tax credits can help fill some of the void left by the end of the temporary federal expansion, said Ryan Vinh, a research analyst at the center.
Still, states don’t possess the same level of resources that the federal government has at its disposal to move the needle on childhood poverty, Vinh noted. And those resources will be further stretched with looming federal funding cuts to food assistance, Medicaid and other programs that were a part of July’s major tax and spending law.
Some state child tax credit programs are not permanent and are dependent on available funding, he said. For example, Washington, D.C., nixed funding of its $420 child tax credit this year because of budgetary concerns. And Georgia lawmakers are discussing complete elimination of the state income tax, further eroding the benefit of the new tax credit, he said.
“As states are increasingly facing these different budget shortfalls as a result of this new federal bill, they’re going to be forced to make tough decisions,” Vinh said.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-09-24 09:00:00+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"Two years after the closure of Leominster’s maternity unit, a region is struggling",Hallie Claflin,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/health-care/two-years-after-the-closure-of-leominsters-maternity-unit-a-region-is-struggling/,It's been two years since Clinton Hospital's maternity unit closed. The fallout of the closure paints a complicated picture in a state without maternity care deserts. But experts and advocates say recent losses and impending cuts to Medicaid make maternal health care access in Massachusetts something that stands to get worse.,"SOME EMERGENCY RESPONDERS go years, decades, or even their entire careers without ever having to deliver a baby in an ambulance. For John Cuddahy, it took just a few months.  
The Leominster-based firefighter EMT completed his academy training in April, and this summer responded to a call in Leominster of a woman in active labor.  
“She was in the middle of her contractions, so we loaded her up as quick as we could and started driving out to Worcester,” Cuddahy said.  
But 10 minutes into the 20-mile drive to UMass Memorial Medical Center, the baby was delivered.  
In those critical minutes, they could have gotten the expecting mother to UMass Memorial Health Alliance-Clinton Hospital in Leominster, but its maternity unit closed two years ago, ruling that option out. 
Luckily there were no serious complications, and both patients were healthy when they finally arrived at the hospital. Cuddahy delivered the baby along with a paramedic of nearly 30 years. It was a first for both responders, but likely not their last.  
“I think it’s something to expect a lot more now that there is no maternity [unit] in Leominster. We almost had another one two shifts ago,” Cuddahy said. “It would save a lot of in-the-field deliveries if they still had it there.”

Reports of women giving birth in cars, ambulances, emergency departments, or reaching a maternity unit just in time to deliver are a far cry from what is expected in a state that consistently ranks first in the country for its health care system. 
But in North-Central Massachusetts, pregnant women and families are living a reality that data, statistics, and health care rankings don’t always show. 
Two years after the maternity unit at Clinton Hospital closed, the region is struggling. The fallout of the closure paints a complicated picture in a state that technically, according to the nonprofit advocacy and maternal health research group March of Dimes, doesn’t have maternity care deserts. But experts and advocates say recent losses and impending cuts to Medicaid will make it harder to access maternal health care in Massachusetts.
Since 2014, 11 hospitals in Massachusetts have closed or filed to close their maternity unit services, according to Health Policy Commission data. Two birth centers in Beverly and Holyoke have also closed, leaving Massachusetts with just one free-standing birth center.  
The loss of maternity units and obstetric care is a trend seen nationwide. But while most states have at least one, if not multiple maternity care deserts – counties without hospitals or birth centers offering obstetric care, and no obstetric providers – Massachusetts has none, according to March of Dimes. 
“The rate of closure is very similar for us as it is in other states,” said Chloe Schwartz, Massachusetts director of maternal and infant health initiatives for March of Dimes. “The only difference being, we started with more to begin with, so we don’t have any official deserts yet.” 
Each county in Massachusetts has been deemed “full access” by March of Dimes, meaning it has two or more hospitals or birth centers offering obstetric care, and 60 or more obstetric clinicians per 10,000 births.  
“We have a standardized definition, but the folks living and working on the ground will tell you a very different story about the reality of access,” Schwartz said. “Changing access is just as difficult as having little to no access. It’s whiplash.”  
Schwartz warned that the Bay State is in a precarious position when it comes to maternity care, pointing to recent service closures and reports of UMass Memorial Health’s financial stress. 
Community Healthlink, an affiliate of UMass Memorial, recently closed two primary care programs – one in Leominster in September 2024 and another in Worcester in March – and will soon close an adult behavioral health program in Fitchburg. The system has halted hiring for all nonclinical and non-patient-facing roles and faced an $86 million operating loss in the first half of fiscal year 2025, the Boston Globe reported. 
As health care providers face an impending decrease in Medicaid payments because of the sweeping tax bill passed by Republicans, more closures could be on the horizon.  
“It’s an ever-changing landscape, and there’s so many ways in which these hospitals and health systems have to pivot, and unfortunately, maternity care is one of those areas that’s always going to be the hardest to keep open,” Schwartz said.  
More of the region’s births are now taking place at UMass Memorial’s main campus in Worcester. The facility has increased the number of labor and delivery staff “to meet the modest increase in patient volume,” said Shelly Hazlett, the hospital’s director of media and public relations, in a statement.

But maternity deserts are only designated at the county level, which doesn’t do enough to illustrate accessibility in cities and smaller areas, according to Hao Yu, associate professor of health care policy in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.  
“When we talk about health care access, that’s really a local issue,” Yu said.  
In Massachusetts, the ratio of OB-GYNs per 10,000 births decreased in rural counties from nearly 162 in 2010 to 87 in 2021, while the ratio increased in urban counties in that same timeframe, according to a 2024 March of Dimes report. 
Obstetric services are often not financially advantageous for hospitals due to low reimbursement rates from Medicaid, which pays for about a third of all births in Massachusetts.  
As federal cuts to Medicaid roll out after the midterm elections, Massachusetts could see even more maternity unit closures, according to Yu. Community hospitals serving low-income areas will be most at risk. “If federal support for Medicaid is going to be decreased substantially, then state governments will have difficulty maintaining their current reimbursement rate,” he said.  
OB-GYNs have one of the highest malpractice insurance premiums across all medical specialties due to a high risk of lawsuits. And, maintaining operations amid a workforce shortage is costly due to round-the-clock staffing requirements in maternity units, including OB-GYNs, nurse midwives, anesthesiologists, and other supporting staff.  
“The cost of maintaining OB units is high. On the other hand, the reimbursement from the payers for this type of service is low,” Yu said. “Putting these two together, you can imagine it’s really making OB units the easy target if hospitals want to downsize.”  
While 11 closures may not seem like a significant amount, Yu noted it represents about five percent of all obstetric unit closures that have occurred in the US in the last decade. Meanwhile, Massachusetts accounts for just two percent of the US population.  
Maternity patients in 29 municipalities increased their distance traveled by at least 5 miles between 2011 and 2021, and 14 of those communities increased their distance traveled by at least 10 miles, according to the Department of Public Health’s 2023 review of maternal health services. Only two towns – Newburyport and West Newbury – out of 351 municipalities – have residents whose average travel distance to birthing facilities decreased in the past decade. 
While they may not live in a “desert,” expecting mothers and families are driving further and further to receive care, and each closure brings more ambulance, roadside, and emergency room deliveries, meaning a delay in treatment for some of the most common complications like premature delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, and neonatal hyperthermia. “Those types of births will surely be associated with adverse outcomes, both for babies and for mothers,” Yu said.
The decision to close the Leominster maternity unit in September 2023 took local leaders like Mayor Dean Mazzarella by surprise. Mazzarella, who fought alongside other leaders, residents, and health care workers to keep the unit open, said the city was notified of these problems years too late.  
“This stuff doesn’t happen overnight, so the Department of Public Health needs to do better monitoring,” Mazzarella said in an interview. “When [the UMass] Health Alliance started seeing a problem with this, they should have reported it to the Department of Public Health. We should have had these meetings then.”  
UMass Memorial officials noted that workforce shortages and declining births at Clinton contributed to the decision to shut down the maternity unit. These issues “had a significant impact on our unit’s ability to provide the best possible labor and delivery care to our patients,” Hazlett said. 
The maternity unit closure came five years after the hospital closed its 11-bed pediatric unit in 2018.  
Mazzarella, who has served as mayor since 1994 when Leominster Hospital and Burbank Hospital merged to form Health Alliance, said the Leominster campus was meant to be a strong regional hospital offering a comprehensive set of services. (UMass Memorial purchased Health Alliance in 1998 and merged the hospital with Clinton in 2017.) Now, he sees that slipping away. 
“It’s like this big network that had been established for so long is now being pulled apart in fragments,” he said. “Whether it’s a desert or not, it was certainly filling a gap at the time.”

Maternity patients have been absorbed by surrounding centers, including Henry Heywood Hospital, Emerson Hospital, or UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, which are approximately 15, 23, and 25 miles away from Clinton Hospital by car. Distance is a barrier to many pregnant patients, Mazzarella said, who used to be just a bus ride away from their obstetric care unit.  
Leominster Fire Chief Robert Sideleau called it a “tremendous loss.” His team of firefighter EMTs and paramedics have delivered an increasing number of babies in ambulances. At Clinton Hospital, emergency room secretary Shelly Roy says women have given birth in the ER because they couldn’t make it to UMass Memorial in Worchester. 
Their roadside and ambulance deliveries have been free from serious complications so far, according to Sideleau, but it’s not a matter of “if” but “when.” He worries about emergency staff having to decide between transporting high-risk patients to Leominster’s emergency room to deliver without an OB-GYN or taking a chance to transport them to UMass Memorial in Worcester.  
“That’s what makes us nervous,” Sideleau said. “If there’s a prolapsed cord or breach birth, and we were able to bring them to Leominster and right up to an OB-GYN doctor, it could make the difference between life and death.” 
The loss of the labor and delivery unit has been complicated by the closure of another community hospital – Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer – in 2024. The region’s emergency medical services have since been stretched thin.  
Traveling longer distances to surrounding hospitals means staff and ambulances are away from their stations for longer periods of time. Waiting to unload patients at crowded emergency departments only adds to the delay. Leominster’s fire department often responds to mutual aid requests from Ayer, which also means less time spent in their area. 
“If there’s another ambulance call, and we don’t have an ambulance available, then we have to call mutual aid, and it just starts the whole round robin,” Sideleau said. “The less resources up here, the busier we get.”

Amy Gagnon, a former labor and delivery nurse at Clinton Hospital who now works at Henry Heywood Hospital, said she couldn’t sleep for weeks after the closure. She worries for the future of maternal health access in the region. “If anything happens to Heywood, this whole area will be a desert,” she said.  
For months after the closure, Gagnon said Leominster patients came to deliver at Heywood but hadn’t received prenatal care there. Medical staff knew very little about their pregnancy history and due dates. Without access to their prenatal records, providers can’t anticipate complications or be ready for necessary inductions based on preexisting conditions.  
“It was hard in the beginning, because we weren’t prepared staff wise,” she said. “We only have three nurses.”  
At the time of the closure, DPH determined that the unit was an essential service “necessary for preserving access and health status within the hospital’s service area.” Beyond that recognition, the state has little authority over hospitals and service closures.  
“This feels inherently broken … When I was born in 1988, my mom had four choices between the city of Leominster and the city of Fitchburg to give birth in, and now we have zero.” State Rep. Natalie Higgins
“If the Department of Health determines that a service is essential to the health and safety of a community, why in the world do we agree to exist in a system that lets it close down?” Rep. Natalie Higgins, who represents Leominster, said in an interview.  
After the closure, Higgins authored legislation that would prevent hospitals from closing a service for three years after DPH deems it “essential.” The bill – which failed but was reintroduced in January and has yet to make its way through the legislature – did not specify if the state would help keep a service open if the hospital cites financial reasons for the proposed closure. Higgins called it a “big ask.”  
Lawmakers have also introduced a bill that instructs the attorney general to seek an injunction to keep essential services open during a required one-year notice period. It would require hospitals seeking a service closure to notify any affected cities or towns and prohibit them from applying for a new license or expanding for three years after a service or facility is closed. The current legislation has yet to pass but is scheduled for a hearing at the end of the month. 
The maternity unit was one of four essential service closures in and around Leominster in the last eight years. Higgins is worried her community will stop showing up to the closure hearings. “It’s feeling pretty futile.”  
“This feels inherently broken,” she said. “When I was born in 1988, my mom had four choices between the city of Leominster and the city of Fitchburg to give birth in, and now we have zero.” 
Emerging research has shown that birth centers and midwifery care are safe, lower-cost, and desired options for labor and delivery. They also have the potential to absorb patients that have otherwise lost access to a maternity unit or prefer not to give birth in a hospital.   
Seven Sisters Midwifery in Northampton is currently the only free-standing birth center in Massachusetts. Ginny Miller, the center’s owner, said patients drive from all over the state, as well as from bordering states, for care. They currently have a waiting list for pregnancy care and delivery until May 2026.  
New Hampshire, a state with one fifth the population of Massachusetts, is home to three independent birthing centers.  
By share of total deliveries occurring in birth centers, Massachusetts ranks 35th out of the 44 states where birth centers are available. The Health Policy Commission asserts that about 25 percent of births in Massachusetts hospitals are low-risk deliveries that could qualify for birth center care. 
But one challenge that comes with the establishment of community birth centers is that they must be within reasonable distance of a hospital with a labor and delivery unit in the event of major complications. That could rule out cities like Leominster and Fitchburg if potential centers determine that the nearest maternity hospital is too far away. 
Emily Anesta, co-founder of the Bay State Birth Coalition, called birth centers “a necessity.” Massachusetts has one of the highest rates of severe maternal morbidity – unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that can result in short- or long-term health consequences – ranking 45th in the country according to the Commonwealth Fund. A 2023 DPH report showed that the prevalence of severe maternal morbidity nearly doubled in Massachusetts from 2011 to 2020.  
“Hospital care is not what everyone needs. Midwifery care is not just something people like. … It really is lifesaving,” Anesta said. “To have that access denied for most people currently in Massachusetts is not actually giving people access to the care that they need.” 
Low insurance reimbursement rates and a lack of licensing have prevented birth centers from operating in Massachusetts, making it an uncommon, expensive option for pregnant patients. Nurse midwives are not reimbursed at the same rate as physicians and OB-GYNs, meaning hospitals and other health care centers aren’t incentivized to build or expand their midwife programs. 
In August 2024, Gov. Maura Healey signed a maternal health bill mainly providing a pathway to licensure for certified professional midwives that advocates had long called for. The legislation also requires MassHealth to cover midwifery and doula services for up to 12 months postpartum. The licensing changes have yet to be fully implemented. 
“Until that’s in place, and until private insurers also cover that care, most families wouldn’t be able to afford to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $5,000 out of pocket for their maternity care,” Anesta said. “If they went to a hospital, they would be paying less out of pocket or nothing out of pocket, depending on what type of insurance plan they have. It becomes more of a luxury option that’s inaccessible to most.” 
A state like Massachusetts, still ranked first in the country for women’s health and reproductive care, ought to be doing better, Anesta said. 
“People deserve access to options,” she added. “They deserve care that’s in their communities that feels safe and comfortable to them.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/leominster-hospital-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-24 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,New billing policy by insurers sows confusion among CT physicians,Katy Golvala and Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/24/cigna-aetna-insurance-billing-policy/,"Physicians say the change could lead to lost revenue and increased administrative burden for providers, though confusion about it persists.","Physicians in Connecticut and around the country are sounding the alarm about a new policy by insurers they say could lead to lost revenue and increased administrative burden for providers, but confusion persists about how the policy will  be enacted.
On July 1, Cigna announced an update to its reimbursement policy. Beginning Oct. 1, the announcement said, the insurer would review claims for office visits billed at the highest reimbursement rates — “Level 4” and “Level 5.” Cigna would then reduce the rate in cases where the claims suggested the visits didn’t actually meet the appropriate level of complexity, without consulting the physician in advance.
If providers disagreed with the reduction in reimbursement, they could submit medical records substantiating the higher billing code and Cigna would adjust the reimbursement back up.
“This change is designed to reduce overbilling, promote accurate documentation, and align with the American Medical Association coding guidelines,” Justine Sessions, a spokesperson with Cigna, said in emailed comments. “Importantly, this policy change does not lead to more denials or delay care for customers in any way.”
A similar policy by Aetna went into effect in Connecticut in March 2025, Phillip Blando, a spokesperson with the company confirmed. Blando said Aetna’s billing criteria “are based on CMS and American Medical Association guidelines.”
“Evaluating the appropriateness of levels 4 and 5 codes helps us ensure providers are billing for their services consistent with national guidelines,” Blando said in emailed comments.
Reaction from physicians to the July announcement was swift. 

Dr. Peter Hahn, a cardiac electrophysiologist, works on his computer at Advanced Vein Associates in Uncasville on Sept. 15, 2025. Hahn is concerned that a new reimbursement policy announced by Aetna and Cigna will result in lost revenue and increased administrative burden for his private practice.

“My understanding, and the understanding of everyone who’s been rallying the cry about this is, the new policy just says they’re going to downcode everybody and it’s up to us to go back and fight and prove we’re not doing it inappropriately,” said Peter Hahn, a cardiologist in Uncasville. “Only then, after we file the appeal, can we get paid for the services rendered.” 
The concern from providers even caught the attention of U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who wrote a letter to Cigna calling for the policy’s reversal.
“If allowed, this new policy will significantly increase administrative burdens and costs for physicians while jeopardizing patient care. I urge you to reverse this decision and instead work closely with physicians to address any billing concerns,” Blumenthal wrote in the Sept. 11 letter.
But two days before Blumenthal sent his letter, Cigna had issued a clarification on Sept. 9 stating that the change was actually narrower in scope than the worst-case scenario Hahn and others had assumed was true.
Cigna said it will only review claims by roughly 1% of doctors in its network who “records indicate as having a consistent pattern of coding at a higher [level] for routine visits compared to their peers,” including those who, for example, bill diagnoses such as “earache” or “sore throat” as Level 4 or 5 visits. 
Cigna’s initial announcement did not contain details about the scope of the new policy, like how many providers would be impacted and what share of visits would be downcoded.
Hahn said that lack of detail caused panic and confusion, particularly among small, independent providers, like himself. Hahn estimates he already spends “probably a full day a week” devoted to “fighting with insurance companies,” and worries the policy would only exacerbate that burden. 
Cigna has already sent notifications to any provider that will be impacted by the new policy, Sessions, the company’s spokesperson, confirmed. Sessions did not respond to a question about  how many doctors in Connecticut would be impacted.
Blando, the spokesperson for Aetna, declined to respond to questions regarding details about the scope of the policy similar to the details provided by Cigna.
Hahn said that as of Sept. 19, he had not received direct communication from Cigna that his claims would get reviewed under the new policy. 
David Eagle, an oncologist based in New York, said that while the September announcement provided clarification, he still finds the policy problematic. Eagle agreed that insurers are perfectly within their rights to audit physician billing practices. But, he said, there’s a right way to do it, and this isn’t it.
Cigna is making reimbursement decisions based on claims filed, which don’t contain all the information necessary to appropriately assess the complexity of a visit, Eagle said. Instead, the company should be using medical records.
“You’re just using the wrong information set. And then it’s the problem of the physician to fight back, claim by claim, visit by visit, to get paid appropriately,” Eagle said.
Eagle said insurers have a responsibility to ensure their auditing policies are designed correctly because denials cause more work for physicians and delays in care for patients.
When faced with prior authorization requests from insurers, “everybody has to scramble on the medical side after the fact to explain and justify treatment for cancer patients, so it causes delays in treatments. And so much extra work,” Eagle said.
Mark Camel, a retired neurosurgeon and co-founder of the Greenwich-based Orthopaedic and Neurosurgery Specialists, said it’s also important that, when determining which physicians to include in the policy, Cigna compares providers to peers in the same speciality. An oncologist who sees a complex patient base and is more likely to have Level 4 or 5 visits shouldn’t be compared to an orthopedic surgeon, whose patients include people who come in with knee pain, Camel said.
Camel said the policy is “okay as long as each physician is compared within their specialty because of the variation of types of visits.” 
A representative from the Connecticut State Medical Society provided comment regarding Cigna’s initial policy but could not be reached for follow-up comment regarding the insurer’s updated policy. 
In a statement, the Connecticut Hospital Association also called for the reversal of the policies.
“We have concerns that these new policies will create uncertainty for providers and patients and add significant administrative burden and cost. They should be rescinded. Clear, transparent policies are essential to supporting fair reimbursement and ensuring patients’ continued access to care,” Nicole Rall, a CHA spokesperson, stated in emailed comments.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DOWNCODING-0916024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-24 05:56:52.621357

Republican leaders made it clear the first deadline of Sept. 30 to adopt a bipartisan map would not be met.
During the four-hour meeting of the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting, Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, defended the proposal introduced by House Democrats, with fellow legislators on the Ohio Senate side bringing forward its companion bill.
The proposals from Democrats, introduced Sept. 9, lay out eight Republican-leaning congressional districts and seven Democratic-leaning districts in a map they say is aligned with voter trends for the last 10 years.
Isaacsohn said the map meets the constitutional rules to keep districts compact and communities of interest together as much as possible, adding that it “forces competitive races, and it forces communities not to be taken for granted.”
He said he’s open to counter-proposals from the Republicans on the map, as long as the redistricting process leads to a constitutional map that gives Ohio the representation it deserves.
“When we have gerrymandering that unduly favors one party or another, it leads to policies that hurt most people, that are out of touch with where Ohioans are and what they need,” Isaacsohn said.
Committee co-chair Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Twp., claimed the constitutional rule that a map can’t unduly favor one political party is in the “third silo” of the process, only coming into play if there is no bipartisan agreement.
Currently, Ohio’s congressional map has 10 Republican members of Congress and five Democrats. That map was passed without bipartisan support in March 2022, bringing the process back this year to activate maps for the next election cycle.
The Republican caucus hasn’t proposed a map yet. Timken said the legislative caucus is working on a proposal.
“Republicans will be following the constitution, and when we propose our map, I’m sure we will make it public,” Timken said.
But Timken doesn’t agree with the 55%-45% breakdown that Democrats and their map supporters used as a baseline for a “fair” map.
“I question their logic as to why it has to be 55-45, when clearly the voters of Ohio have strongly supported Republicans over the last decade, and so, in my opinion, I do not believe the 55-45 is accurate,” she told reporters after the meeting.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Congressional maps often use the most recent presidential election as a guide, along with the last decade’s voting trends. In 2024, President Donald Trump won Ohio with 55% of the vote.
State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, echoed Isaacsohn’s call for productive collaboration in creating “districts that mirror the political reality of our state,” saying he would be willing to change the political breakdown if it meant the fair representation was maintained.
“If (the maps) are 9-6 and they’re constitutionally fair, I know our caucus will consider those maps,” DeMora said.
The Columbus Democrat said he’s held “more than 20 meetings” in his office with constituents talking about redistricting.
Ohioans who spoke at the meeting supported the Democratic proposal, emphasizing the need for representation that is responsive to voters, something they feel more competitive districts and a transparent redistricting process can do.
“(We have) politicians who don’t answer the phone because they don’t need to,” said the Rev. Dr. Aileen Maddox, a Dayton resident. “Their seats are safe, not because we put them there, but because the lines were drawn to keep them there.”
Maddox told the committee fair districts would bring voices to policymaking that understand the issues that Dayton residents deal with, including people of color, immigrants and all other residents.
“We could elect leaders who come from our neighborhoods, who understand the pain of losing a child too soon, who know what it means to work two jobs and still struggle to afford a prescription, and the daily lives of the people who suffer from the multiplicity of the above,” Maddox said.
As supporters of the Democratic proposal spoke on the merits of the map, they also pointed the finger at Republicans for a lack of movement in proposing a map or holding hearings before Monday.
Sen. Willis Blackshear, Jr., D-Dayton, thanked Ohioans who attended the meeting, calling their attendance “a real testament to democracy.”
“We were only given two business days notice that this opportunity to testify would arise, so it makes it even more special to see so many folks here rising to the occasion,” Blackshear said.
The senator pushed for the committee to work hard to hit the deadline of Sept. 30 for legislative action and “respect the urgency that is required.”
“If voters didn’t want September action, there’d be no process,” Blackshear told the committee. “If voters and our fellows legislators hadn’t intended us to take real, meaningful bipartisan action in September, they wouldn’t have created a detailed process for us to do just that.”
Republican co-chair Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, expressed doubts as to the discussion around the Sept. 30 deadline noted in state law as a final deadline for legislators.
“September 30th is in there, and yet, the constitution provides for a process if we don’t meet that,” Bird said. “And obviously we’re not, because we have ‘if needed’ sessions that have been determined to not be needed.”
Both Bird and Timken said the constitutional deadlines go through November, and they don’t feel rushed to make a decision before the end of the process.
“We can continue the process of gathering input from Ohioans, we can continue the process of negotiating with Democrats and we can pass a bipartisan map at any time in the next couple of months,” Bird said.
If the legislature doesn’t come to the 66% agreement in both chambers on a map by Sept. 30, the process moves to the Republican-majority led Ohio Redistricting Commission, who then have until Oct. 30 to come to a bipartisan decision.
If they don’t have the votes to do so, the Ohio General Assembly has another crack at it, with a deadline of Nov. 30.
The legislature would no longer have to have a bipartisan agreement at that time, only needing a simple majority to pass a map that would last for four years.
That simple majority agreement must come alongside a map that has certain other requirements.
The Republican committee chairs placed some of the blame on Democrats, who they said were resolute in their goal of a map with eight Republicans and seven Democrats.
“If an eight to seven map is the only one acceptable, then how are we going to get that done by September 30th,” Bird said. “It makes it very unlikely and it pushes the envelope to a potential November vote.”
The eight GOP members of the joint committee all questioned the Democratic map, with some accusing map-drawers and the legislators who are standing behind the map of pushing the map to deliberately give Democrats more seats.
“It seems to me it’s only gerrymandering if the Republicans win,” said state Rep. Brian Stewart.
Whether or not a map is adopted in September or in November, Blackshear said the renewed redistricting process should be treated as a model for the rest of the country in shirking political differences, and bringing together an effort that represents the people of Ohio.
“We can’t use (political power) as a bail-out to do what’s right for the people of Ohio, because the people of Ohio deserve fair representation,” Blackshear said.
No other hearings have been scheduled, but Timken said one more will be coming up.
She and Bird said it would occur next week, to give more of the public the chance to give input.

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th. 
In America, diapers have long been treated as a luxury good rather than a necessity.
Half of families with young kids struggle to afford all the diapers they need. A quarter of families miss work as a result, often because they don’t have enough diapers to send with their children to child care.
It’s a largely invisible issue with enormous consequences for the health of parents and children. Studies have found that diaper need is a greater contributor to postpartum depression than food insecurity and housing instability. And when parents don’t have enough diapers, they make do with sanitary pads, rags or other materials. Some report having to leave their children in soiled diapers for extended periods, raising the risk for urinary tract infections and diaper rash.
So Amy Kadens, who has worked in the diaper space for nearly 15 years, wondered: What if diapers were free for the parents who need them most? For decades, the United States has not had a good answer. So she came up with her own.
Diaper banks started popping up across the nation in 2011, collecting donations and dispersing diapers to families through a complex network of local partnerships. They are one of the few lifelines for parents.
Kadens, who co-founded a nonprofit that provides diapers called Share our Spare in 2011, knew that diaper banks often operate with limited staff and resources, and operationally can only address a small percentage of a massive need. Without more government support, they can only get at a slice of the problem.
Federal assistance programs that help low-income families, such as food stamps and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), have never allowed families to use those funds to purchase diapers.
“Diaper banks are doing heroic work with very little. I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel,” Kadens said. But, “I wanted to continue to sink my teeth into this.”
So Kadens started to work on a solution that could give people the funds to get whatever diapers they needed, without the warehouses to store donations or the teams to get those donations out.
That solution was Diaper Dollars, a $40 e-card that users get in their email every month. The virtual card comes with a barcode they can scan at checkout at most major retailers, including Walmart, CVS and Walgreens, that will cover the cost of diapers. So far, users in Illinois and Ohio can access the program.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The idea, Kadens said, was to make it as simple as possible, while also giving parents the ability to choose what brands they preferred.
“Families have brand loyalty,” Kadens said. “I wanted to keep dignity and choice at the forefront of everything we did.”
The Diaper Dollars team went through months of market research to refine the tech to work well for participants. They didn’t want coupons because there was too much fraud in the system, and gift cards meant users could be limited on where to shop.
Instead, they landed on a system that allowed them to build out a catalog of diapers at 6,200 retail locations in the country. The bar code on the digital card recognizes the diapers when it’s scanned and deducts the price from the total purchase. That catalog of diapers is monitored daily and updated in case brands come out with new box sizes or products. It also works for online purchases.
The system does have some limitations. It’s not valid in Amazon or Target, two retailers that don’t yet accept that form of payment. And it also likely only covers a portion of the need: The average family spends about $100 on diapers a month, but families earning a median income can only afford to cover about $65, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. It’s also more expensive — parents are paying retail prices plus sales tax (23 states charge sales tax on diapers, including Illinois). By contrast, products at diaper banks are donated or sold to the banks from the manufacturer at deeply discounted rates.
To find participants, Diaper Dollars partners with organizations such as WIC clinics and local hospitals to refer people to the program, which is funded from a mix of philanthropy and financial support from those same partners. Partners establish the eligibility criteria, how long participants can be a part of the program, and whether the stipend will be higher for those with multiple babies.
A pilot program launched in 2023 with 100 people, then in 2024 the Illinois Department of Human Services dedicated $1 million to run its own pilot at a larger scale. Nearly 8,000 people have been served so far, with 10,000 projected by 2026.
Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton told The 19th that she had been looking for solutions that could support people in the postpartum period, when maternal mortality is high, particularly for Black women. Diaper need, specifically, is linked to maternal mental health and considered a potential risk factor for moderate to high maternal depressive symptoms.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2023, the maternal mortality rate for Black women was 50.3 deaths per 100,000 live births. For White women it was 14.5 deaths.
So when Illinois launched a birth equity initiative to address the needs of postpartum parents, from a home visiting program to better diaper access, it chose to partner with Diaper Dollars.
“Giving someone a card where they can go to the store of their choice, decide what’s best, that is what’s part of dignity,” Stratton said. “Every woman deserves to bring life into this world safely and with dignity.”
Brendan Kitt, Diaper Dollars’ program director, said the program was able to offer an operational solution to a problem the state wanted to address but didn’t have a mechanism for. The system works similarly to a universal basic income, where people in need are given a cash stipend, but it’s more targeted.
“Both for funders and supporters, it’s always a question when you talk to people about where the money goes,” he said. “The fact that we can limit the transactions to the specific needs that we’re trying to serve, I think, is one of the biggest things that legitimized our operation over just giving basic cash assistance.”
Parents who benefited from Diaper Dollars told the organization in testimonials that they’ve had to turn to using underwear or old T-shirts when they didn’t have the money for diapers, often making decisions between paying for rent or diapers.
After going through the program, parents reported that the funds gave them the wiggle room to buy their children other essentials or to make them better meals.
About 90 percent of those who went through the program reported being able to better afford essentials like food, rent and other bills. Some 95 percent felt less stressed about not having enough diapers.
Joanne Samuel Goldblum, the CEO of the National Diaper Bank Network, which has more than 240 partners nationwide, said a model like Diaper Dollars can address unmet needs, particularly in rural areas where it’s harder for diaper banks to distribute products.
“The need is really so big, and it’s not going to be addressed through just one sort of answer or one type of program,” Samuel Goldblum said. “It’s really important to have ways to reach people in all sorts of different communities.”
The Diaper Dollars program has raised about $2 million so far — 45 percent from the state of Illinois, 35 percent from philanthropic donors and 20 percent from grants from community partners. It is now also running in Ohio and expected to expand to Washington soon.
Kadens’ dream is to take the program to every state. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned and some red states instituted abortion bans, conservative lawmakers have been looking for ways to support postpartum parents.
In Tennessee, for example, where abortion was banned in 2022, the state rolled out a new policy in 2024 that allowed families enrolled in Tennessee’s Medicaid program to receive up to 100 free diapers a month for the first two years of life.
Samuel Goldblum said the National Diaper Bank Network has seen more bipartisan support for addressing diaper needs this year “than we’ve ever seen before.”

(Getty Images)I have been so impressed with the good work of Alabama attorney Bryan Stevenson, especially his work going into prisons to help people who have been falsely accused and his work with young teenagers. He is a kind and compassionate soul, and in fact I just received a thank-you note from the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, Alabama, thanking me for my small donation to their work.
Here in Kansas, the Wichita-based Progeny is a wonderful nonprofit organization that helps young adults in the foster care system and who have been in the juvenile justice system. According to their website, it is a “youth/adult partnership focused on reimagining the juvenile justice system and reinvestment into community based alternatives.”
Progeny is a program of Destination Innovation, which helps underserved communities. I happened upon Progeny one day and watched a video of legislative testimony from Desmond Bryan White, who had served time in the juvenile justice system and was testifying about how fines and fees had affected his life, even his now adult life. I couldn’t believe that youths were charged fines and fees that saddled them with debt and despair. It seemed horrific.
Another group that works to help advocate for youths is Kansas Appleseed. They contribute statewide but are based in Lawrence. They help youths in the foster care system.
Too many young people in the foster system are abused and mistreated. They hardly have a chance at gaining a normal and nurturing childhood. Too many times, this results in being caught up in the juvenile justice system. It’s sad to me. It should be sad to everyone.
I grew up attending a private school, where I was loved and nurtured. The parents were highly involved in the process of learning for their children and we grew up knowing and feeling love and compassion. Many of my friends grew up to be attorneys, doctors, nurses and other important professions.
Youths growing up in poverty have the cards stacked against them. Too often in life, one’s ZIP code determines his or her success. At Progeny, youths are trying to reach out to other youths to help them overcome barriers to success and productivity. Those at Progeny are special and, I believe, the children of a God who loves them.
We need other alternatives and solutions for young people, rather than incarceration or punitive measures that leave everyone worse off. I guess incarceration can be the answer on occasion, but many times other forms of rehabilitation should occur instead. Pastors, rabbis and other faith leaders can get involved and have contributed to the juvenile justice issue in the past.
Should we be locking up young adults when helping them heal from past trauma can also be beneficial? I believe that there are many who care for Kansas youths. It’s time for all of us to reach out and show compassion to the children and teens struggling so much today. These are special people who need a little help and a little hope.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)The Great Ohio Gerrymandering Farce has lifted its curtain once again at the Ohio Statehouse odditorium of human wonders in scenic downtown Columbus.
Ohio politicians are once again pretending to be responsible stewards of the public interest and the Ohio Constitution, as though we all have amnesia and can’t remember what happened with Ohio gerrymandering in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.
Instead of abiding by the will of Ohio voters and ending gerrymandering, Ohio Republican politicians executed a blatant run-out-the-clock strategy defying court rulings and imposing unconstitutionally gerrymandered maps regardless.
Ohio gerrymandering: A brief and awful history of the very recent past

Ohio Republican candidates have received an average of 56% support in the last 10 years of statewide elections, but after refusing to draw fair and constitutional maps Ohio Republican politicians control 66% of the state’s U.S. Congressional seats, 67% of the Ohio House, and 79% of the Ohio Senate.
To cap it off in 2024, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose shamelessly abused his position as chief elections officer on a citizens amendment proposing to kick politicians out of the redistricting process.
LaRose and Republicans on the Ohio Ballot Board wrote ballot language for the amendment — an amendment LaRose publicly opposed — claiming that the citizen-led anti-gerrymandering amendment would actually require gerrymandering.
That was a politician abusing the public trust to put his thumb on the scale of an amendment petitioned by more than 535,000 Ohio citizens.
As dirty as politics is, sticking your finger in the eye of more than 535,000 voters on a deeply serious and foundational question about elections and the Ohio Constitution is about as low as it gets.
Confused Ohio voters shot down the amendment and left Ohio politicians in charge of drawing political districts for themselves and their fellow politicians.
Anti-gerrymandering groups warn that Ohio’s ballot language is misleading voters

Ohio Republican Party Chair Alex Triantifilou has since openly admitted that the strategy to confuse Ohio voters helped defeat the amendment: “Confusion means we don’t know, so we did our job,” Triantafilou is quoted as saying.
Ohioans should remember that our state’s current U.S. House districts are unconstitutionally gerrymandered already, as they stand now.
They were drawn by Republicans in 2022 without bipartisan support to give Republicans 10 safe U.S. House seats out of 15.
A bipartisan majority on the Ohio Supreme Court in 2022 rejected the Republican-drawn U.S. Congressional district map as unconstitutionally gerrymandered two separate times.
That was the last time a court ruled on the U.S. House map that Ohio voters have been forced to use since.
In a state that Trump won with 55% of the vote in 2024, and Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno won with 50% of the vote in 2024, Republicans control 66% of Ohio’s U.S. House districts.
Now Moreno is calling for them to increase that to 80%, or 12-3.
Other Republicans are calling for 13-2, which would be 87% Republican.
That would be cheating to steal 31% representation — stealing honest elections and representation from nearly 3.5 million Ohio residents.

Under the amendment to the Ohio Constitution passed by voters in 2018, politician were left in charge of the process for Congressional district mapmaking.
In 2024, politicians did their best to confuse voters, and Ohio voters once again decided to leave politicians in charge.
So now, under the same old process they abused last time, Ohio politicians will conduct another gerrymandering farce.
First the Statehouse lawmakers get a crack at drawing a map and must pass one with three-fifths of both chambers of the supermajority Republican legislature, including at least half of Democrats.
If lawmakers fail to do that by Sept. 30, the process is kicked over to the Ohio Redistricting Commission, which Republican politicians control 5-2: the governor, auditor, secretary of state, and four lawmakers, one from each party in the Ohio House and Ohio Senate.
If the Ohio Redistricting Commission fails to reach a bipartisan agreement on a map by Oct. 31, the process gets kicked back over to lawmakers, who then have until Nov. 30 to pass a map with a simple majority.
Remember, Republicans control gerrymandered supermajorities in both the Ohio House and the Ohio Senate.
Will politicians keep Ohio gerrymandered 10-5? Will they gerrymander more, to 11-4, or to 12-3, or to 13-2?
Who knows?
The only thing I can guarantee you is that Ohio voters will not get fair, competitive maps.
Ohio politicians will continue to make sure their fellow politicians can not be held accountable to Ohio voters in November elections.
In 2026, Ohio voters will see a November election where out of 15 Ohio U.S. House races, maybe two will be competitive, if that.
And the vast majority of the politicians will just waltz back into office, campaign pockets stuffed with special interest money, never having to worry about Ohio voters at all.

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Hundreds of new state laws took effect on Wednesday, including measures that add protections from scams and fees for ticketbuyers, increase taxes on cigarettes, and allow health care providers who prescribe abortion pills to remove their names from the medication’s label, among other things. 
Unless otherwise stipulated, all non-emergency laws passed during the last legislative session took effect, as Wednesday marks 90 days since adjournment on June 25. 
Several new laws have impacts on Mainers’ everyday lives, such as changes to the tax code, labor laws and health care funding. Others are more symbolic. Maine now officially has a state amphibian (the Spring Peeper), state reptile (the wood turtle) and state dog (the Seppala Siberian Sleddog). 
Here are several ways state law has changed (the full list can be found here): 
Consumer protections 
A new law aims to protect ticket buyers from scams and fees. 
It requires ticket resellers to disclose fees up front, bans the use of fake websites and bots that circumvent online ticket limits, and prohibits resellers from adding more than 10% to the original ticket price.
This law started out as a proposal to allow the resale of tickets but was amended after strong opposition from local groups, such as the State Theatre and Portland Symphony Orchestra, which argued that it would benefit large resale platforms. 
Notably, ticket exchange and resale company StubHub supported the initial proposal, arguing it would help correct what it sees as a monopoly held by Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation Entertainment — companies that the U.S. Department of Justice sued last year for that reason. 
Another similar new law prohibits those renting short-term lodging or selling an entertainment event ticket from advertising or offering a price that doesn’t include all mandatory fees or charges, aside from taxes or fees imposed by a government, shipping charges and charges for ancillary services, such as insurance on a product purchase. 
Tax changes
Among the laws that take effect on Wednesday is the state budget addition, which raised taxes on streaming services, cannabis, pensions and cigarettes. 
Maine’s cigarette excise tax is increasing the most: from $2 a pack to $3.50 a pack.
Lawmakers also made a few tweaks to the Historic Property Rehabilitation Tax Credit, which encourages private sector investment in the rehabilitation and re-use of historic buildings. 
The amount allocated wasn’t changed, but lawmakers extended the timeframe for accessing the credits and therefore increased the cap over that longer period. The idea is that this will remove the incentive for developers to delay or space out projects across multiple tax years and, in turn, help build more affordable housing quicker. Additionally, lawmakers increased this tax credit in rural areas as a means to incentivize the revival of Maine’s rural downtowns. 
And, after a 2022 change left out the Mi’kmaq Nation from reform, a new law now ensures equal tax treatment among all of the Wabanaki Nations. 
Housing
In addition to those tax changes that incentivize housing development, other laws will help Mainers afford, and be able to remain in, housing. 
Maine lawmakers remove red tape to enable more affordable housing construction

Some of those changes were again made through the state budget, including increasing the real estate transfer tax on properties that sell for more than a million dollars and allocating that revenue to a dedicated fund for affordable housing.
Other new laws make comprehensive zoning changes to make it easier to build more units on the same lot, add restrictions for owners of manufactured housing communities to try to prevent excessive rent and fee increases, and help Maine workers afford housing and remain connected to employment by making targeted rental assistance available.
Protections for residents of mobile home parks also continued to be a focus of the Legislature. 
In 2024, lawmakers passed a law that requires mobile home park owners to notify residents of their intent to sell and give them at least 60 days to make an offer. This year, a new law now gives a group of mobile home owners or a mobile home owners’ association the right of first refusal to purchase a mobile home park if the owner intends to sell. 
There are also several new laws that aim to help the unhoused. 
Municipalities can no longer ban homeless shelters. Some revenue from the real estate transfer tax will now be redirected to help sustain emergency homeless shelters. The state also allocated ongoing funds for rental assistance for homeless students. 
Health care 
Health care providers can now request their name be removed from labels on abortion medication. This type of law has emerged as a legislative trend across the country as abortion opponents are ramping up efforts to stop telehealth abortion. 
State funding for family planning services has increased. These include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. Such funding is not used for abortions.
The state budget and separate legislation together provide $6 million in one-time funding to providers of these services. 
Lisa Margulies, vice president of Public Affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, said this funding is even more important in light of President Donald Trump’s cuts to sexual and reproductive health care.  
In July, U.S. Congress passed Trump’s spending bill that defunded Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning by prohibiting the health care providers from receiving reimbursement payments for non-abortion services provided to patients insured by Medicaid. Maine Family Planning sued over it, but a federal judge sustained the defunding in August. 
“Politicians in Washington aren’t stopping their attacks,” Margulies said in a statement. “They are singularly focused on shutting down any provider that legally offers abortion as a component of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care. Their actions have put access to care for everyone — especially our country’s most vulnerable — at risk.” 
Another new law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish licensing standards for urgent care facilities, which previously lacked such oversight for safety, transparency and quality of care.
Judiciary 
People under 18 years old are now prohibited from marrying. The state used to have exceptions. The minimum age was raised to 17, with parental consent required, in 2023. Before that, in 2020, the minimum was set at 16, again with parental consent required. 
Adults are now prohibited from doxing minors under state law, which also allows families to seek court action for targeted children. While the impetus for this legislation came from a doxing incident in 2023, the issue gained wider attention this year after the Maine House of Representatives censured Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) for posting about a transgender student athlete on social media. 
Lawmakers made only minimal changes to Maine’s indigent defense structure this year. 
Labor
Workers now have some new protections, such as a requirement of minimum pay for reporting to work.
Farmworkers have the right to state minimum wage like most other employees in Maine, after years of failed attempts. 
Lawmakers also tweaked the laws governing paid family and medical leave — creating enforcement mechanisms and penalties and clarifying definitions — but rejected any significant changes since the program hasn’t fully been implemented yet.  
Maine paid family and medical leave benefits are slated to become available in May 2026 and will allow eligible public and private sector workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for reasons such as illness, to care for a loved one or the birth of a new child.
Lawmakers also expanded the state’s child tax credit through the state budget. The Dependent Exemption Tax Credit was doubled per children under six years old. 
Environment and energy
While many bills environmental advocates pushed for this year remain unresolved, some changes started Wednesday.  
State law now outlines a goal for Maine to transition to 100% clean electricity by 2040, enshrining an earlier aim Gov. Janet Mills announced in 2023. 
How key climate, environmental bills fared in Augusta this past session

Maine has led the country in establishing protections against per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS. One new law essentially codified what the state already does on a daily basis with its PFAS Response Program, including on-farm testing, crafting mitigation recommendations and providing financial support. On the other hand, Maine expanded the scope of vehicles and equipment exempt from notification requirements for the state’s first-in-the-nation PFAS reporting law.
Another law that took effect permits the transition of the current Governor’s Energy Office into a cabinet-level Department of Energy Resources. The elevation is seen by the governor and lawmakers as a way to set up a more integrated, comprehensive and consistent approach to managing Maine’s energy system. 
The state also enshrined the authority of the Public Utilities Commission to develop time-of-use rates, which aim to shift customers’ usage to periods of lower demand, for standard offer service. 
A look ahead 
On top of those bills that have now become law, the fate of 61 bills that the Maine Legislature passed this year will not be ultimately decided until next year. That’s because the governor opted to postpone her decisions on that legislation until lawmakers reconvene in January. 
Among these bills are proposals to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine, restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns, add Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history to Maine’s learning results, and establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following a spill in Brunswick last summer. 
The 61 bills being held are in addition to the nearly 400 that the Legislature opted to carry over into next year. While some of those bills had yet to make it out of committee, others received initial chamber votes but not enough to determine the final outcome. 
That legislation includes all of the measures that were left on the appropriations and study tables, which had largely passed the full Legislature but needed to still be funded or staffed.

More states are considering regulations for artificial intelligence and other automated systems. (Leon Neal/Getty Images)You’ve seen the headlines: college students are outsourcing their education to AI tools.
The early anecdotes, research and surveys raise valid concerns, but this narrative is too quick to paint a picture of a technology undermining academic integrity, eroding critical thinking or even replacing the role of educators or universities altogether.
I lead the University of Nebraska at Omaha as its chancellor, and I see a different story. It wasn’t long ago that calculators raised questions about academic rigor in math classrooms. Some of us are old enough to remember how “CliffsNotes” was a dirty word in writing courses.
The emergence of the internet and Wikipedia once stirred fears about plagiarism. If you go far back enough, even Socrates had his concerns about the written word, saying “This invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory.” Sound familiar?
History shows us the only constant in education is new technology will emerge that forces us to confront how we teach, work and learn. History also shows us that every disruptive technology provides an opportunity to evolve education and improve lives.
Our challenge and our responsibility is to guide students to use these technologies responsibly, ethically and productively while positioning them to navigate technological revolutions successfully.
It’s why UNO in the last year alone has launched an AI Learning Lab, partnered with Open AI on a ChatGPT enterprise solution for our campus and established one of the nation’s first undergraduate degrees in artificial intelligence.
It’s also why we are inviting the community to learn about the practical ways they can use generative AI at our OMA x AI event in October. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that as an institution, we don’t view AI as a threat, but as a tool that can deepen learning, expand opportunity and strengthen workforce readiness.
First, AI can help students succeed in their academic journey. Adaptive learning platforms powered by AI can provide personalized tutoring, helping identify when a student is struggling and offering targeted resources to get them back on track. For first-generation students, working parents or learners from any number of social or economic backgrounds, AI can be a powerful equalizer, offering support that makes higher education more achievable.
Second, AI is already reshaping the workforce our students will enter. From healthcare and logistics to business and the arts, employers are seeking graduates who are comfortable using AI-enabled tools to maximize their human creativity. If universities shy away from this, we risk sending students into the job market unprepared.
Third, we must prepare students with skills and experiences that AI cannot easily replicate. Critical thinking, ethical reasoning, leadership, empathy and the ability to work collaboratively are all competencies that remain uniquely human, and they will only grow in value as AI becomes more prevalent.
This means connecting students to experiential learning opportunities like internships, service learning and community-based research, in which human judgment and creativity are essential. It also means evolving how we teach so students can pair technical skills with AI-resistant strengths. This could look like a business major learning both data analytics and communication skills so they can lead teams and close deals or a fine arts student exploring digital design alongside creative expression that AI cannot imitate. By blending innovation with timeless human skills, we give students a competitive edge that endures beyond the latest technological shift.
Finally, AI opens doors for deeper community engagement and impact. As the leader of Nebraska’s public urban metropolitan university, it is my responsibility to ensure we are partnering with local industries, schools and civic leaders to ensure Omaha and Nebraska remain competitive. My counterparts at universities across the country share that responsibility. By embracing AI in teaching, learning, research and service, we can help tackle challenges in medicine, nutrition, community safety, business, teaching and so much more.
None of this means abandoning our responsibility to teach integrity, critical thinking and ethics. Students need to learn how to use AI, but also how to question it, validate it and apply it thoughtfully. That is the true work of higher education: not to avoid new technologies but to prepare students to navigate them wisely.
AI should not replace the human element of education. It should amplify it. By embracing this moment with optimism and responsibility, we can ensure that AI helps us do what we have always done best: empower students, strengthen communities and transform lives.

Slavery is nothing less than America’s original sin, which all Americans have collectively inherited and whose lessons we’re responsible for learning.  It was slavery that triggered America’s internecine civil war whose scars remain today to remind us of our nation’s deeply racist wounds.
Yet even as Trump wants to distract us from “how bad slavery was,” he’d evidently prefer we focus on how great the Confederacy was, at least that’s what’s suggested by his executive order to restore a statue commemorating the Confederacy and honoring those who fought to preserve slavery. Ironically, it’s Trump’s “focus” on his authoritarian ambitions and racist convictions that distracts him from the point of both recorded history and America’s Constitutional purpose.
Indeed, during the course of his political life, Trump has tried to undermine America’s Constitutional purpose: “to create a more perfect union.”  Thus, in 2011 he lied that President Barack “Hussein” Obama was not an American citizen; in 2024 he lied that Kamala Harris was ineligible to run for president; and in 2025, he issued an executive order denying birthright citizenship for the babies of non-citizen parents, in defiance of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.  
At every turn, Trump has tried to sabotage minority representation and inclusion.
Indeed, Trump’s anti-immigrant executive orders, policies, and rhetoric have also been aimed at people of color, like his first presidential campaign in 2015 when he coupled his slogan to “Make America Great Again” with his pledge to “build a great, great wall on our southern border.”  He claimed migrants from Mexico, were “bringing drugs.  They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” He added Haitians to his 2024 racist campaign when he falsely accused them of eating the pets of Ohioans.  And let’s not forget his first term ban on Muslim immigration, his complaint of migrants from “African shithole countries,” and his preference for immigrants from “nice,” predominantly white countries, “like Denmark [or] Switzerland.” 
Further, Trump falsely claimed he won the popular vote in 2016, “if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.  And he claimed during his 2024 Presidential campaign that President Biden’s border policy was a “conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America” by allowing immigrants to cross the border illegally and to register to vote.
Presently, the President’s attack on minorities includes ICE agents acting like racist brown shirts, arresting and deporting undocumented migrants without due process.  His overall strategy amounts to a campaign of vilification, disenfranchisement, and marginalization of people of color.  Simply, he believes a racially pluralist democracy spells the end of white majority rule and Republican election victories.
In fact, in 2020 Trump clearly admitted that if more Americans vote, Republicans will lose elections.  When Democrats wanted election reforms, like mail-in-voting, same day registration, and early voting to safely accommodate voters during the Covid pandemic, Trump objected: “The things they had in there were crazy.  They had things, levels of voting that if you’d ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”  
Though the American democratic experiment depended upon welcoming and absorbing cultures from around the world to peacefully co-exist in a unified nation, Trump intends to preserve a white electoral majority by disenfranchising minority voters and dividing the electorate.  It explains his lie that “We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting,” and his ingenuous argument that “You will never have an honest election if you have mail-in…. it’s time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It’s the only way they can get elected.” Meanwhile, he never mentioned that he encouraged mail-in voting prior to his 2024 election, which he won.
But it’s not fraud Trump is worried about—it’s growing minority influence. He doesn’t believe that voting machines and mail in ballots are untrustworthy; he just wants to suppress the votes of those likely to oppose him.  He doesn’t believe the vote has been rigged against him; he just uses that false claim to distract his followers from his calculated campaign to rig the next election. He’s not concerned about inequality when he attacks and undermines DEI initiatives—what he fears is racial and democratic equality. So, when Trump claims he will make America Great Again, it means he will make it white again.
Trump’s whitewashing of The Smithsonian exhibit is another part of the president’s racist campaign to repress the voice of minorities and erase their history, amounting to nothing less than an act of American cultural genocide.  If the President doesn’t want to hear “how horrible our country is,” maybe he should not compound America’s original sin.

That was the scene that greeted about a dozen members of the Legislative Black Caucus as they walked through heavy brush, weeds and thorny undergrowth to inspect graves of boys who died in what the old House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children in southern Prince George’s County.
The neglect of the boys’ graves is made more stark by the fact that it sits next to the pristine, manicured lawn of the Cheltenham Veterans Cemetery.
“I drive past this place every day, the pristine detail that’s taken in grave sites such as this,” state Sen. Michael Jackson (D-Prince George’s, Charles and Calvert) said of the veterans cemetery, before reflecting on the forgotten an overgrown graves of the boys.
“There is no reason to disrespect anyone,” said Jackson, whose district includes the graves. “We have a lot of work to do, folks.”

The folks he was addressing were the caucus members, who are already working on legislation to not only clean up the burial site “to bring dignity and care” to the boys’ lives, but also create a commission to investigate their deaths.
A small pot of money may help with the restoration of the site near the Cheltenham Youth Detention Center, which is managed by the state Department of Juvenile Services. The department applied this summer for a $31,000 grant to the African American Heritage Preservation Program to work on restoring the wooded area.
If the grant is approved later this year, the state may invest more money for “restoration and repair of the cemetery” in next fiscal year’s capital budget, according to a statement Tuesday evening from the Gov. Wes Moore’s office.
“Our history is our power and everyone shares responsibility in preserving and uplifting the countless stories of our state that have often gone unrecognized and unheralded,” said David Turner, the governor’s communications director. “We look forward to working with the General Assembly, our state agencies, local leaders, and community advocates on this project.”
‘Scandolous’
Work on a restoration project began with former Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi, who stepped down in June.
Marc Schindler, former assistant secretary and chief of staff with the department, who walked the woods with legislators on Tuesday, first visited the site last year. He later returned to look for any headstones with department staff, a volunteer genealogist and some youth from the nearby Cheltenham detention center.
Schindler said research revealed that the House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children was opened around 1870, about 20 years after the House of Refuge was opened for juvenile offenders. But that facility, on the site of what is the current Charles Hickey School, was reserved for white children.
Schindler said the conditions at the House of Refuge for white children focused “on education and treatment.” He called the treatment of Black children at the House of Reformation “scandalous.”
He said there could be more headstones because some records are missing and death certificates were not issued in most parts of the state until 1898.

“It’s hard to find the words to describe how sad and outrageous it is,” said Schindler, who led caucus members through the site. “But we just don’t know how many more here.”
Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) said the injustices of the past can still be seen today, in the treatment of youth who are automatically charged as adults for a number of crimes under Maryland law. It’s why he plans to reintroduce a bill that seeks to raise the age at which a youth would be tried as an adult, from 14 to age 16.
Smith’s bill also proposed for those 16 and younger charged with offenses such as first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving machine guns would be eligible to go to juvenile court.
“Even our predecessors in the General Assembly understood that youth should not be in adult prisons, except they just segregated them,” Smith said. “We are still going to restore and maintain this facility and this site, but what are the next steps?”
Del. Gary Simmons (D-Anne Arundel), who visited the site Tuesday, said he’s working on legislation to assess how the state can fund efforts to to identify and restore burial sites and cemeteries across the staet. Part of that would be through the state’s Office of Cemetery Oversight, which is under the Department of Labor.
“We have a tremendous amount of neglected cemeteries here in the state of Maryland,” he said. “We have all kind of different methods that we generate funds for the state. This is about community pride. We’ll get it done.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Jared Littmann’s early lead in the Democratic primary for Annapolis mayor held, and even widened slightly, in an overwhelming win over longtime City Council Alderwoman Rhonda Pindell Charles, according to official results released Tuesday.
The final tallies showed Littmann, a local businessman, with 2,594 votes to 1,271 for Pindell Charles, who was seeking to become the city’s first elected Black mayor. That was similar to election night results from Sept. 16, but it took election officials another week to tally more than 1,700 mail-in and drop box ballots, more than 40% of the total cast in the race.
Littmann thanked family, volunteers, donors and voters for the win in a social media post after the final results were announced. The win has been a long time coming — he announced his candidacy in January 2024, and Pindell Charles joined the race last September.
Pindell Charles, a 12-year council veteran who has served as acting mayor on occasion, also thanked her volunteers and supporters in a Facebook post, and congratulated Littman on his win.
“Thanks to everyone who participated in the Primary Election. It is important to let your voice be heard with your vote,” her statement said. “Congratulations to Mr. Littmann. The voters have spoken. And I respect the will of the voters as well as the process.”

Littmann now faces Republican Bob O’Shea in the Nov. 4 general election to succeed current Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who is term-limited after serving two terms. O’Shea was unopposed in the Republican primary.
The city also had Democratic primary contests in four of the city’s eight wards, including the Ward 3 seat that opened after Pindell Charles decided to make a run for mayor. In that race, Keanuú Smith-Brown got 340 votes to 77 for Deborah “Debbie” Odum. Smith-Brown will face unaffiliated candidate Mike Dye in the general election.
The closest race was in Ward 4, another open seat after Alderwoman Sheila M. Finlayson declined to run for reelection. Janice Elaine Allsup-Johnson edged Coren Makell by just four votes, 144 for Allsup-Johnson to 140 for Makell.
Despite the narrow margin, Makell on Tuesday congratulated Allsup-Johnson and all the other Democratic primary winners and pledged to “supporting you all in the general election.” Allsup-Johnson could run unopposed, as no Republican or unaffiliated voter had filed to run in that ward.
In the most-crowded race, incumbent Ward 1 Alderman Harry Huntley cruised to the nomination over four challengers, with 481 of the 942 votes cast. Other Democrats in the race were Katie McDermott who got 293 votes, Ron Gunzburger with 137, Genevieve Torri with 19 and Ben Bramsen with 12. Huntley faces Thomas Kriek, an unaffiliated candidate, in November.
In the only other contested primary, Diesha Contee got 185 votes to Craig Cussimanio’s 124 to win the Democratic nomination. Contee will face Republican George Gallagher in the race to succeed Alderman DaJuan Gay, who is not running for reelection.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jared-Littman-at-Seasalt-Annapolis-9-16-2025-1024x524.jpg,,,2025-09-23 23:56:51.778328

Photo credit: Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon with the Atlanta Civic Circle Lawyers for Spanish-language journalist Mario Guevara and his family are asking a federal court to stop U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting him while he is in their custody.
Guevara’s lawyers, who include those from the American Civil Liberties Union, asked the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Georgia on Monday for his release and to halt any potential deportation after federal officials suddenly resurrected an older immigration case Friday. His lawyers also requested an emergency hearing and his release on Friday.
Guevara, a Salvadoran native who has lived in the United States since 2004, according to court documents, has been held in immigration detention since June 14, when he was arrested while livestreaming an anti-ICE protest in Atlanta. His misdemeanor charges were ultimately dropped but not before he was transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.
His arrest and continued detainment has alarmed free speech advocates and attracted national attention. 
The ACLU and Guevara’s family, including his children Katherine and Oscar Guevara, are calling for his immediate release, saying that his detention is illegal and a violation of his First Amendment rights.
“No one should have to face this fear of punishment for their free speech in this country. Still, we are holding on to hope that the government will do the right thing and release him at once. His place is with his family and his community, not behind bars or facing deportation,” Katherine Guevara said.

But a point of contention in the case is Guevara’s immigration history. In a statement, ICE Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the “facts of this case have not changed. Mario Guevara is in the country illegally.” McLaughlin said Guevara was granted voluntary departure in 2012 but refused to leave and was subsequently given a “final order of removal from an immigration judge in 2012.”
Scarlet Kim, ACLU’s senior staff attorney, disagreed, calling ICE’s statement “incorrect.” According to Kim, while Guevara was granted voluntary departure in 2012, he appealed the decision. His case was then administratively closed, legally authorizing him to remain in the U.S. for the last 13 years.
“He never received a final order of removal,” Kim said in a statement.
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.
Kim said the Board of Immigration Appeals reopened the removal proceedings and reinstated the voluntary departure order Friday, giving Guevara 60 days to leave the country voluntarily. The ACLU argued in a court filing Monday that because he is in detention, ICE could undermine the voluntary departure order and deport him at any moment.
“This decision renders the Court’s intervention all the more urgent. Notwithstanding that Mr. Guevara was granted voluntary departure—which gives him 60 days to voluntarily leave the United States—the Government has offered no assurances that it will not put him on a plane back to El Salvador at any moment,” Guevara’s lawyers wrote in the filing.
First Amendment experts speaking at a press conference Tuesday said that the government’s actions against Guevara are part of a broader trend of suppressing free speech and intimidating journalists. Clare Norins, a law professor and director of the First Amendment Clinic at the University of Georgia, also representing Guevara, said that he is the only known journalist currently detained in the U.S. for his reporting. 
“Even though all the criminal charges against him were dropped, the government claimed that Mr. Guevara’s filming and reporting on police activity occurring in public made him a danger to the community. In other words, they continued to detain him for exercising his First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and of the press,” Norins said.
ICE has previously disputed claims that Guevara’s detainment was connected to his reporting.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1906-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 22:57:09.262854

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)More than 25,000 Alaskans who buy health insurance through the federal marketplace will face massive and possibly unaffordable cost increases if federal subsidies expire at the end of the year.
“I do think it’s important to recognize that we should be seeing thousands of people likely lose coverage from this,” said Jared Kosin, president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital and Healthcare Association.
In a panel discussion last month, local experts in Juneau laid out the stark reality for Alaska, which has the highest health care costs in the nation. 
Speaking to a room at Juneau’s convention center, they said if federal subsidies end, the cost of health insurance would rise so much that many Alaskans will go uninsured, discouraging them from getting checkups that could prevent serious illnesses. Hospitals would see a larger number of emergencies from uninsured people, straining them. It might even lead to an exodus from the state, as people seek alternative options and cheaper places to live. 
“I worry about that,” said Kim Champney, executive director of the Alaska Association on Developmental Disabilities. “Because I think people will decide to leave Alaska because we have the most expensive health care in the country.” 
Anton Rieselbach, with the Juneau Economic Development Council provided an analysis of cost estimates for Juneau. In Alaska’s capital city alone, 1,389 people receive health care via insurance plans bought through the federal marketplace. Right now, those Juneauites pay an average of $124 per month. If those subsidies expire, that will rise to $1,008 per month, an increase of more than 700%.
The council, a nonpartisan organization devoted to economic growth in the capital city, is worried about what will happen if the subsidies expire.   
“We want people to be working and spending money, generating economic activity,” Rieselbach said, “but this just places another huge burden on people’s ability to spend their money in other arenas besides health insurance.”
A problem years in the making
The upcoming problem stems from federal subsidies enacted by Congress in 2021 and extended through the end of 2025. Those subsidies, known as “enhanced premium tax credits,” were applied on top of subsidies included in the original Affordable Care Act, which established the federal insurance marketplace.
Now, almost anyone who buys an individual health care plan through the marketplace gets some kind of subsidy.
Generally, that includes people whose employers don’t provide health insurance, self-employed people, and people who retired early and aren’t yet eligible for Medicare, which insures people with disabilities and people 65 or older. 
Subsidies helped expand the number of people on federal marketplace plans from 11.4 million in 2020 to 24.3 million this year, allowing millions of Americans to get regular health care.
They also came at a high cost to the federal treasury: Extending them for another 10 years would cost $335 billion. 
But if subsidies end, Alaska would be exceptionally hard-hit. The state has the highest health-care costs in the nation, which means unsubsidized insurance rates are high. 
Of the 28,736 Alaskans who have health insurance policies through the federal marketplace, 25,170 receive the enhanced subsidies, according to figures published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
If the enhanced subsidies expire, the poorest Alaskans will still see their plans subsidized. Middle-class Alaskans would be hard hit.
According to estimates published in March by the Alaska Division of Insurance, a single 50-year-old who earns $58,650 per year would see their monthly health insurance cost rise from $282 per month to $407 per month for a “silver” plan. If they have a “bronze” plan, their costs wouldn’t change.
But Alaskans who earn more than 400% of the federal poverty line — $78,000 per year for an individual — would see their costs skyrocket. 











In 2023, 2024 and 2025, the average cost of a health insurance marketplace plan in Alaska rose by more than 16% each year. In 2023 alone, the cost went up by an average of 18.4%.



That same 50-year-old would go from paying $534 per month for a silver plan to $1,415 per month. Under a bronze plan, their cost would go from $9 per month to $890 per month.
Lori Wing-Heier, the director of the Division of Insurance at the time of those estimates, called the increase “pretty horrific” for affected Alaskans. 
“It’s an insane amount,” said Rep. Genevieve Mina, D-Anchorage, talking about the increase.
This spring, Mina sponsored and the Alaska Legislature passed House Joint Resolution 9, a bipartisan letter asking Congress to extend the subsidies.
Across the state this year, the average monthly premium for Alaskans of all ages and all plans was $971.43, but the average subsidy was $866.28, the Division of Insurance said in March. 
Kosin, of the hospital and healthcare association, said his group thinks it’s “really important” to extend the enhanced subsidies. 
Insurance is based on the concept of sharing risks and costs. The more people in an insurance pool, the better it works. Subsidies encourage healthy people to be a part of the health insurance pool, he said. If people drop off, the cost of caring for any individual person is spread among fewer members, and rates go up.
An extension relies on congressional action
For the moment, Alaskans only have estimates of what will happen if the subsidies expire. Open enrollment on the federal insurance marketplace starts Nov. 1. There’s a “window shopping” period at the end of October that will give a sneak preview.
People must sign up by Dec. 15 to get insurance coverage that starts with the new year. Miss that deadline, and Jan. 15 is the deadline to get coverage that starts Feb. 1.
Kosin said he’s heard the argument that Alaskans could afford health care before the enhanced subsidies came into effect, and so there won’t be many people who drop their coverage.
That fails to take into account the way health insurance costs have gone up since 2020, he said.
In 2023, 2024 and 2025, the average cost of a health insurance marketplace plan in Alaska rose by more than 16% each year. In 2023 alone, the cost went up by an average of 18.4%.
“If there truly is a doubling or tripling of premiums, especially at once, I think I would have to guess it would be a higher percentage than a fifth of the population that would consider themselves priced out of the market,” he said.
U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski knows plenty of those people.
“If you are a 60-year-old couple (earning about) $82,000 in Alaska, you would be looking at a premium increase … without enhancements, of $44,556. My husband and I are over 60. Now, granted, we’re not on the exchange, but I have a lot of friends are in that category, and I don’t know very many of them that could swallow an additional $44,000 a year to pay for their insurance if they’re on the exchange,” she said in a Sept. 17 phone call.
Murkowski is among the members of the U.S. Senate who have been trying for months, without success so far, to find enough votes to extend the subsidies.
Impending government shutdown
The issue has now gotten entangled with the impending government shutdown. Senate Democrats have demanded — among other things — a permanent extension of the health care subsidies, without changes, in exchange for their votes on keeping the federal government open.
Sen. Dan Sullivan also supports an extension of the subsidies, but “there’s no way I would ever vote for that,” he said of the Democratic plan.
“I do think there’s bipartisan support to get this done. We’ve just got to power through these different issues,” he said by phone.
He identified three hurdles for the subsidies. 
“It’s how long you extend them; are there pay-fors (budget cuts to compensate for the cost of the extension) … but the most important and complicated — and we just did a deep dive on this, and I do think there’s bipartisan support on this, is reforms,” Sullivan said.
“We are looking at ways to reform the system to make it work for the people who need it and are using it honestly, but have a disincentive against those who have been abusing it,” he said.
“We’re getting there. It’s complicated. I think the reform piece is going to be the most complicated, but I’m hopeful, and I’m putting a lot of effort into it,” Sullivan said.
Murkowski is more interested in a straight extension without changes. She introduced a standalone two-year measure and voted against both Republican and Democratic proposals to keep the government open, saying one of her conditions was an extension of the subsidy.
Speaking by phone this month, Mina noted that an extension has the support of groups as far afield as the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce.
“I think if you’re directly on the insurance marketplace, you should be concerned. But also, if you care about economic diversification and startups, you should also be concerned,” she said.
If the marketplace doesn’t work, she noted, it would increase the costs of health care for everyone in the state because hospitals are required to treat people regardless of their ability to pay. If people can’t pay, that means their costs get shifted to people who can, increasing the health insurance rates of everyone, not just those on the marketplace.
“What I fear is that we’re regressing to the state that we were in (a decade ago) when we had all of these news articles about people paying like, $800, $1,000 a month for their health insurance, and we were able to stabilize that and find solutions to help people,” Mina said. “We’re just going backwards in that regard.”

According to the study’s authors, South Dakota women are imprisoned at a rate of 338 per 100,000. That’s a higher rate than Montana or Idaho, in the second and third spots in the ranking of female incarceration rates. All three states have higher rates than El Salvador, the country with the highest incarceration rate.
The nationwide incarceration rate for women in the U.S. is 112 per 100,000. 
The report is titled “States of Women’s Incarceration: The Global Context 2025.” The Prison Policy Initiative built its rankings by looking at women incarcerated in prisons, jails and tribal jails.
The press release on the report notes that well over half the women imprisoned in South Dakota are held on drug charges or crimes. It also notes that the state voted in 2022 to build a new women’s prison in Rapid City to manage the overcrowded South Dakota Women’s Prison in Pierre. The new women’s prison is under construction at a cost of $87 million.
Female incarceration rates have declined in most states, the report says, but South Dakota’s rate has increased. According to a state data brief cited in the nonprofit’s report, the number of women incarcerated for violent crimes in the state increased 33% between 2013 and 2023. The number of female drug offenders grew by 66% in the same time period.
South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden pledged last week to create a rehabilitation and recidivism task force to study high rates of incarceration and repeat offenses.

(Congressional photo)Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany launched his campaign for governor Tuesday afternoon — becoming the third, and highest profile, candidate in the 2026 Republican primary. 
The 2026 race for governor in Wisconsin will be the first open election in over 15 years as Gov. Tony Evers decided to retire at the end of his second term. Two other Republicans are already in the race: Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien. 
“In 2026, Wisconsin will have a choice between opportunity, security, and freedom or following the path of failure seen in Minnesota and Illinois,” Tiffany said in a statement after officially launching his campaign on a conservative talk radio show hosted by Dan O’Donnell. “I will not allow our state to be dragged down that woke and broke road.”
Tiffany, who lives in Minocqua, had been teasing a run for governor for months and is expected to have an official launch event in Wausau on Wednesday evening.
The 67-year-old said in a statement that he would seek to “freeze property taxes, protect our farmland from Communist China, and fight every day for families, for farmers, and for the hardworking people who make this state great.”
In contrast to the short list of Republicans running so far, the Democratic primary field has become increasingly crowded in recent weeks. Official candidates include Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys, state Rep. Francesca Hong and beer vendor Ryan Strnad. Others considering a run include Attorney General Josh Kaul, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes and Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes, who recently announced she would be stepping down from her position in the Evers administration. 
Tiffany was elected to represent Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District, a massive area that encompasses the northern part of the state, in the House of Representatives in a special election in 2020. He took over from current U.S. Transportation Secretary and former Republican Rep. Sean Duffy, who had resigned to care for his family.
Before going to Washington, D.C., Tiffany was in the state Legislature, first in the Wisconsin State Assembly for about three years, followed by nearly eight years in the state Senate. During his tenure, he served on the state’s Joint Finance Committee, which is responsible for writing the state budget. Before that, Tiffany was the Town Supervisor of Little Rice and managed petroleum distribution for Zenker Oil Company.
Tiffany said that he could stay in Congress for much longer if he wanted to, but that he thinks he can do more as governor and is in the race to “uphold conservative principles.”
“It really is time for new leadership and I believe I have the vision to be able to lead the state of Wisconsin and make us one of the great states of America once again,” Tiffany said. 
In Congress, Tiffany is a member of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus and has been a consistent ally to President Donald Trump.Tiffany also supported attempts to overturn former President Joe Biden’s win in the 2020 presidential election. So far this year, Tiffany has supported Trump’s tariffs and crack down on immigration, including targeting the H-1B visa program. 
“I support them,” Tiffany said of Trump’s tariffs in his interview with O’Donnell. “At the end of the day if the tariff regime is handled properly, we are going to bring manufacturing back to the United States of America.” 
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Devin Remiker criticized Tiffany in a statement, calling him “Tariff Lover Tom” and saying he “has been jacking up prices on Wisconsin families with his blind support for a trade war that is making everything from beer to beef to school supplies way more expensive — working Wisconsin families can’t afford Tariff Lover Tom being in charge.”
Tiffany said that he would also seek to uphold Wisconsin’s 20-week abortion ban. He has supported federal legislation in the past that would ban abortion at six weeks. 
“I do support that law, and I will uphold it as governor of the state of Wisconsin,” Tiffany said. “I think back to the debate that we had 10 years ago, and you had people on both sides. You had some that were, like, we want unlimited abortions. We had others that said there should be no abortions allowed in the state of Wisconsin, and ultimately, the people of the state said we really want to see something in the middle.”
Tiffany also said he would work to reduce taxes in Wisconsin, including freezing income taxes.  He didn’t commit to a flat income tax or eliminating the income tax as some Republicans have proposed.
“I also believe we can reduce income taxes. Can we take it down to zero? I don’t know the answer to that,” Tiffany said.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)STUTTGART — Arkansas agriculture industry leaders warned again Tuesday of a need for aid to mitigate a crisis that has reached a breaking point for family farmers.
“If something is not done very quickly and substantially, I’m afraid people are going to go ahead and make decisions that they can’t change back,” Kirk Vansandt, the chief agriculture lending officer for Farmers and Merchants Bank, told a legislative panel in Stuttgart.
Tuesday’s hearing before the House Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources subcommittee was the latest in a string of high-profile public meetings where members of the state’s agriculture community have exhorted Arkansas’ congressional delegation and President Donald Trump to come to the aid of commodity crop farmers, who are facing one of their worst periods in decades as a result of skyrocketing production costs and stagnant demand.
Without aid, many in the industry believe 25-40% of farmers will decide to bow out after this season, Vansandt told the panel. Arkansas led Southern states in the number of Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies in 2024, according to a presentation shown to the subcommittee — and it’s already far surpassed its 2024 Chapter 12 totals in 2025.
“Personally, I think it’s one out of three people if nothing happens. It’s that dire,” Vansandt said.
Vansandt said his impression after a recent trip to the nation’s capital was that aid will come — but he worries it might not be soon enough.
A provision of the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act that passed earlier this year provided some assistance for farmers, but that aid isn’t set to hit bank accounts until fall of next year. Those addressing the subcommittee almost universally said that wouldn’t be soon enough to avert mass closures of farms.
“We’re in such a dire strait with our export markets,” Vansandt said. “It’s going to take a bridge to get us all from right now to the fall of ’26.”
The industry representatives stressed that it wouldn’t only be farmers who suffered if farms began to close en masse — so would the small rural communities they support, many of which have already lost large numbers of their populations in recent years. The businesses that support farms, like agricultural aviators, farm banks and parts stores, would also take a hit, they said.
Rep. Stephen Meeks, R-Greenbriar, asked what, if anything, the industry spokespersons wanted to see the state do to help.
“My concern is, if it’s just a money issue, for every dollar that we give y’all to help you weather the storm, that’s $1 we’re taking from another Arkansas family … that’s also struggling to put food on the table,” Meeks said. “We can’t print money like the federal government.”

Ross Wood, the retail operations manager for Stratton Seed, said help with taxes on capital expenditures or fuel would help.
“Taxes on parts and maintenance — that kills us,” Wood said. “Any help would help.”
Numerous people said they didn’t want handouts, but that they had become necessary in the face of a market that was not profitable. Vansandt put it bluntly: “That’s just not the world we’re living in right now.”
“Subsidies are going to be the only thing that can make up the difference,” he said.
The toll is not just financial. One farmer who was asked to speak, Sydney Robinett, said the stress of managing the downturn is the kind that doesn’t go away at the end of the work day.
“It gets in bed with you,” he said. “Sometimes it’s better to be awake than it is to sleep at night, because when I’m awake, I can think of what’s going on today. The bad dreams happen at night. The bad dreams are going out of business. The bad dreams are the uncertainty.”
Subcommittee Co-Chair Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio, became emotional as she concluded the meeting. Noting her own job as a farmer, she said her heart broke for those struggling in the current commodity market.
“I’ve been saying for several weeks: February next year is way too late for us to forecast what this is going to do for our state,” Vaught said. “[By] November, we will have farms that have already made the decision to shut down, and they will never be able to go back into production again.”

(Screenshot courtesy of Arkansas Legislature live feed)Arkansas legislative leaders pressed state corrections officials Tuesday to acknowledge that a May prison escape resulted from systemic failures rather than solely the actions of two employees.
Division of Correction Director Dexter Payne said the escape of a convicted murderer and rapist wouldn’t have happened had the two workers — a kitchen supervisor and a tower guard — done their jobs and followed policy. Those employees were fired shortly after Grant Hardin’s escape and recapture on June 2.
“Those two employees were the main characters,” Payne told Rep. Howard Beaty Jr., a Crossett Republican and co-chair of the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Charitable, Penal and Correctional Institutions subcommittee.
Four other employees at the North Central Unit near Calico Rock have been suspended and one demoted since the escape, according to documents presented to the committee.
The documents included an extensive Arkansas State Police report detailing how Hardin, 56, escaped and breakdowns in communications and policy lapses. The 900-plus pages of the report include summaries of interviews with prison employees and supervisors and others involved in the 10-day search for the escapee.
Legislators focused on the policy lapses, including confusion over whether kitchen staff had been directed not to let any inmates out onto a kitchen loading dock without supervision. A standing written order that allowed kitchen workers assigned to cleaning duties to work on the dock — where Hardin had been — without supervision was superseded by a verbal directive just weeks before the escape, the state police report determined. But not all kitchen supervisors remembered hearing that specific command, the report noted.
There also was some confusion about who was responsible for alerting state police and other law enforcement agencies to the escape, which delayed notifications and quick action, according to the report.
“We definitely have some policy issues we have to work through,” Payne later told Sen. Ben Gilmore, a Crossett Republican who is the ALC’s co-chair.

Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace agreed that her department and prison administrators must address several policy issues raised by the state police report as well as the Division of Correction’s own internal incident review.
Republican Sen. Matt McKee of Pearcy, the subcommittee co-chair, said, “It sounds like everyone was confused out there that day. And that comes down to the leadership of the warden … So this isn’t just about two employees. This is a failure systemically because we didn’t have the training, we didn’t have the policies worked out.”
Payne, asked if he’d decided to discipline Warden Thomas Hurst, replied that he was still reviewing the matter.
Tuesday marked the third meeting since June at which the subcommittee heard testimony about Hardin’s escape and how prison staff and corrections leaders handled it and its aftermath.
The Division of Correction internal report noted that Hardin should have been classified as a high-security inmate rather than medium because of his dual convictions. His custody classification score had not been reviewed since October 2019, but even then his score should have made him ineligible for incarceration at the North Central Unit, the report said.
Rep. Jason Nazarenko, R-Cotter, asked Wallace what the Corrections Department was doing to fix the classification system to prevent inmates from being misclassified.
Although the classification system is automated, staff employees review them, Wallace noted. Department and correction division personnel policies, however, prevented the departmental supervisor from disciplining unit-level classification personnel who don’t follow her guidance, according to the internal report. The report recommends additional training for unit classification staff and more frequent review. 
Wallace said that her department is reviewing other policy changes that would “hopefully stem future problems.”
Department Chief Legal Counsel Tawnie Hughes told the panel she didn’t know how Hardin’s misclassification happened. When she tested the automated system, she said, she always got the number of points that should have sent to Hardin to a maximum security prison. He has been at the Varner Unit since his recapture.
“What we need is another set of human eyes … We’re working on a training system that will help,” she said.

(Getty Images)Pennsylvania is looking to join the multi-state lawsuit against the federal government over demands to share Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients’ data, potentially protecting $461 million in benefits for two million people across the state.
A hearing on adding Pennsylvania to the litigation is set for next week after the states filed a motion late Monday to add the commonwealth, according to court documents.
Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment late Tuesday.
U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney issued a temporary restraining order last week blocking the federal Department of Agriculture (USDA) from collecting data on SNAP recipients and preventing the withholding of any funding until at least Oct. 9 in the 21 states and Washington, D.C., already part of the case, court documents show.
That would extend to Pennsylvania, too, if Chesney agrees to add the commonwealth.

USDA also has indicated it will withhold SNAP funding from Kansas because Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly hasn’t complied with the federal data-sharing directive. Kelly’s office told The Kansas Reflector they’ll appeal that decision, but didn’t say whether her state would be joining the lawsuit. Meanwhile, the state’s Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach is suing Kelly and her Department of Human Services secretary over the issue.
Citing data security concerns, Pennsylvania’s Department of Human Services (DHS) had been holding off on passing food stamp recipient information to the USDA. Hoa Pham, the state’s deputy secretary of Income Maintenance for DHS, told the federal agency as much at the July 30 deadline to set up data-sharing with the federal government.
A few weeks later, the Trump administration threatened to yank nearly half a billion dollars in SNAP support annually (nearly 11 percent of the total, equivalent to the state’s error rate) if the commonwealth didn’t comply by Sept. 19, according to WESA.

Instead, Pennsylvania officials submitted documents to USDA essentially declining to participate, claiming doing so risked violating federal law in light of the Sept. 18 order in the case the commonwealth now seeks to join, court documents show.
The controversy over SNAP beneficiary data has unfolded amid the onset of new qualification requirements that could eliminate benefits for 144,000 Pennsylvanians as well as looming cuts that could cost the state between $125 million and $800 million. Meanwhile, Medicaid has dealt with comparable turbulence over information seeking about recipients and changes to qualification standards.
USDA has said SNAP recipient information will help stem fraudulent use of program benefits. As part of that mitigation effort, the agency says law enforcement will have access to the database – and that’s provoked concerns that it will be used for other purposes as with Medicaid data handed over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The information sought includes names, addresses, social security numbers, occupation and education information, plus citizenship, immigration and marital status, according to USDA documents.

Wirth previewed his plans for the upcoming Oct. 1, 2025 special session to address impacts from federal policy on Medicaid, food assistance and vaccines. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico state Democratic leadership plans to bring forward at least four bills for the Oct.1 special legislative session — including one intended to insulate the state from federal changes to vaccination policies.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the session earlier this month and said it would be geared primarily at addressing impacts from the Congressional Republican spending bill signed into law by Trump this summer. The session start date coincides with a possible shutdown of the federal government. State Republicans have since pushed to expand the agenda to include topics such as interstate medical compacts, but have faced resistance from Senate Democrats.
However, Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) told Source NM in a call Tuesday that one of the bills that leadership intends to bring will allow the New Mexico Department of Health to “set their own standards.”
That move comes as U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. upends federal health policies.

“The federal standards are being thrown all over the place,” Wirth said. “As we go into COVID season and flu season, we’ve got to make sure vaccines are available based on the recommendations of our health folks, not tied to the federal standards.”
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s Deputy Communications Director Jodi McGinnis Porter confirmed to Source NM in an email that vaccines will be on the agenda for the special session.
“We can confirm that it will be on the call,” she wrote. “But we don’t have the exact language yet.”
Additional bills, Wirth said, will include ones replacing a federal tax credit poised to end at the end of the calendar year; making changes to the state’s rural health care fund; and a general budget bill including money for state agencies and public media stations.
In his first interview with Source NM since  Sept. 11 bomb threats to his home and office, Wirth said no additional security measures will be in place for the upcoming session, noting the Roundhouse bans weapons and requires people to enter through metal detectors.
“I certainly feel safer here, and I know the public does as well,” Wirth said. “Having said that, though, this is a challenging time and we’re certainly gonna be vigilant. ”
Wirth also held firm in his opposition to adding medical compacts to the Oct. 1 session.
“I do support the medical compacts — I think that’s priority number one, and we’re going to get that done in January and work hard between now and then to make it happen,” Wirth said. “But it’s just not ready to go at this point in the special session.”
The exact timing for Oct. 1 special session  is variable, but he hopes to gavel out “in a couple of days.”
A closer look at the proposals
For the targeted tax credit, lawmakers would appropriate about $177 million in order to try to prevent rising health insurance costs from a tax credit under the Affordable Care Act, Wirth said, which is also being debated at the federal level.
“We can try and hold New Mexicans harmless, and what I mean by that is keep them in the same place they would be if this tax credit weren’t being rolled back,” Wirth said.
The second bill would make some changes to the state’s Rural Healthcare Delivery Fund, established in 2023, and paying out $80 million between 2024 and 2026 for new services in counties with a population fewer than 100,000.
Wirth said the changes would allow for the fund to support current health care programs and allow for greater participation by removing the population limit.
“There’s lots of rural pockets and larger counties, and we want to make sure that those funds can be used for that rural health care,” he said.
Finally, the budget bill will include at least a $20 million appropriation to the New Mexico Health Care Authority for technology upgrades and to address the new federal requirements.
A variety of other appropriations remain that lack solid figures, Wirth said, including funds to address changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); additional behavioral health work in the courts; and funding for public television and radio stations after the federal cuts.
“What you’re going to see in this special session is us stepping up to make sure that the basic support net stays in place, especially when it comes to food and healthcare,” Wirth said.
The special session is only ”step one” and more priorities will be addressed in the regular January session, he said, such as juvenile justice and the medical compact questions.
“We’re going to be back in January for step two, and I think we’re going to be dealing with this in sessions for the next number of years to come,” he said.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)As buses hummed and beeped around Rhode Island’s central bus hub in Providence Tuesday evening, dozens wearing black and holding candles gathered to mourn an impending loss. 
The crowd was not mourning a person, but the state’s bus network. Sweeping cuts to its service set to take effect Saturday will radically transform the state’s public transit offerings, advocates say.
“Dearly beloveds, we are gathered here today to say RIP to RIPTA as we know it,” Liza Burkin, board president of the Providence Streets Coalition, told over three dozen people assembled at Kennedy Plaza. 
Starting Sept. 27, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) will reduce service by cutting some buses, reducing schedule spans, decreasing frequency, and getting rid of segments on 46 of its 67 lines — primarily impacting weekend and off-peak hours. 
RIPTA board approves less drastic service cuts. But plan is no victory for bus riders.

Three routes will be eliminated on Saturdays, while another three will no longer run on Sundays or holidays. Four additional routes are being cut from weekends altogether, including the 68 line that links Newport’s North End with the city’s beaches — a service that is fare-free through the end of October.
“This is the Ocean State, and we’re cutting off access to the ocean for our working class on their days off,” Burkin said. “Shame.”
Even the agency’s top-performing route will not be spared. The R-Line — the state’s only rapid bus line which connects Cranston, Providence and Pawtucket — will now run buses every 20 minutes on weekends instead of every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes at night.
The upcoming service changes resulted from an earlier, more extensive plan that had 58 routes facing cuts or reductions to try and stave off a $10 million budget deficit for the agency. That included the complete elimination of 11 routes and zones where riders book trips in advance. 
The agency’s board was scheduled to approve those deeper cuts Aug. 7, but postponed the decision after Gov. Dan McKee sent a last-minute letter asking the board to draft a less severe plan.
The result was a “budget framework” announced by McKee ahead of the RIPTA board of directors’ Aug. 28 meeting, where he offered $3 million in federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality funds the agency would later have to pay back.
McKee’s office stands by this latest service adjustment, saying that reductions were based on demand data and post-pandemic ridership patterns.
“The governor’s agreement with RIPTA leadership puts the authority on a strong financial footing as we invest in projects like the new multimodal transit center to boost ridership and strengthen the agency — all while protecting taxpayers,” spokesperson Andrea Palagi said in an emailed statement.

While less drastic, advocates argue the upcoming changes will only harm RIPTA and the state in the long run. And if service gets worse, advocates will place blame squarely on McKee.
“Gov. McKee wants us to be grateful for the short-term and insufficient Band-Aids given to RIPTA because it could have been worse than his original proposal as though he is not the person responsible for putting us in this position in the first place,” Bove said.
The deficit was originally $32.6 million when McKee unveiled his recommended fiscal 2026 budget in January — a budget Bove called “callous and cruel.”
Lawmakers eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue from an additional 2-cent increase on the state’s gas tax and by upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account, much to the dismay of McKee.
“How did the governor respond to that you might ask?” Bove posed to the crowd. “By throwing a temper tantrum and refusing to sign the budget like a middle-schooler not getting their way on the student council.”
That drew a laugh from McKee’s 2026 Democratic primary challenger, former CVS executive Helena Bounano Foulkes, who stood among the crowd. 
“This is his budget and budgets are choices — they represent our values,” Foulkes told Rhode Island Current after the rally. 
But for now, riders must contend with reduced service, though advocates remain hopeful the cuts can be reversed when lawmakers reconvene in January.
“So many of you have fought alongside us for so long and we have a lot more left in the tank,” Burkin said.

Rhoden was speaking in support of a proposed new men's prison in northeast Sioux Falls. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — After 144 years, South Dakota lawmakers decided Tuesday it’s time for “the Hill” to retire.
The required two-thirds of each legislative chamber voted to endorse a 1,500-bed, $650 million replacement for the state penitentiary building that opened its doors when South Dakota was still Dakota Territory. The new prison will be the most expensive capital project ever funded by the state’s taxpayers.
The prison will be built in northeast Sioux Falls, on an undeveloped patch of industrial land near the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society. The location is about 3 miles northeast of the penitentiary, nicknamed “the Hill” for its perch overlooking the Big Sioux River.

The votes came during a one-day special session at the Capitol called by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden after a prison construction task force he created via executive order had recommended  a new prison with that size, price tag and location. The Senate approved the prison plan legislation 24-11, and the House approved it 51-18, with one House member, Rep. Jeff Bathke, R-Mitchell, excused while on a military deployment.
A previous men’s prison proposal with a higher price and a controversial location in rural Lincoln County, was presented in February during the regular legislative session and failed to earn the two-thirds support mandated for spending bills by the state constitution. 
Tuesday’s vote answers the most pressing and expensive question posed during a four-year saga on the future South Dakota’s prison facilities. In 2021, then-Gov. Kristi Noem commissioned a study of the Department of Corrections properties that concluded the state needed a new women’s prison — which is now under construction in Rapid City at a cost of $87 million — and that the oldest parts of the penitentiary had too many inmates and was unsafe for them and the staff. 
The state plans to pay for the new prison with cash. In 2022, lawmakers voted to begin putting millions in excess revenues, which ballooned thanks in part to federal cash infusions during the COVID-19 pandemic, into an incarceration construction fund that has since grown with further deposits and interest earnings. The next year, they approved the construction of the women’s prison.
The bill passed Tuesday transfers $78.7 million from the state’s budget reserves to the prison construction fund and authorizes the Department of Corrections to spend up to $650 million to build it. Most of the money is already in the fund, but about $42 million of the required funding is expected to come from future interest earnings.
Between 2024 and Tuesday’s vote, the state put $52 million into a plan to build a 1,500-bed men’s prison — at a price of $825 million, in that case — in southern Lincoln County. Lawmakers rejected that prison pitch in February, an act that spurred the creation of Rhoden’s Project Prison Reset task force. Last week, Rhoden’s office said much of that investment was recaptured by reusing designs on the $650 million version that did earn approval, but $21 million of the money spent on the Lincoln County site is unrecoverable.
The state shaved $175 million off the cost of the Sioux Falls prison plan by shrinking common areas within the facility and designing 300 of the beds as a barracks. Rhoden said the new plan does not reduce rehabilitation and vocational programming space. 
Questions on how to pay for the ongoing operations of the new prison will greet lawmakers when they return in January for their regular session. 
Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko, who tendered an Oct. 20 resignation in a letter to Rhoden earlier this month in the face of criticism, told lawmakers earlier this year that it could cost the state up to $20 million more a year to run the new prison.

Ian Calderon joins a crowd of Democrats jockeying in a wide-open race for governor. The former assemblymember left the Legislature in 2020 to focus on his family.


Former state lawmaker Ian Calderon is joining the crowded 2026 race for California governor, he announced Tuesday. 
The Whittier Democrat is framing his candidacy as one from a “new generation of leadership.” He was 27 when he became the first millennial to be elected to the state Assembly in 2012. 
But he was no newcomer even then — Calderon comes from a line of politicians from southeast Los Angeles County. His father, Charles Calderon, started the dynasty when he was elected to the Assembly in 1982. Two of his uncles also served in the Legislature — and federal prison for corruption. 
Ian Calderon left the Assembly, where he was majority leader, in 2020 to focus on his young family and his stepmother Lisa Calderon now holds his seat. But he’s been biding his time for a return.
In a campaign video that heavily features his wife and children, he said since leaving office he’s been “living in the real world, watching everyday life get harder for families like mine.” He highlighted the high costs of gas, child care and housing, taking particular aim at investment firms buying up properties. 
“The people running our government? They’re trying to use yesterday’s ideas to solve today’s problems and it isn’t working,” he said. 
He joins a crowd of Democrats jockeying in a wide-open race for the governorship, including: state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former Controller Betty Yee, former state Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, former Rep. Katie Porter, former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. 
Republicans Chad Bianco, the sheriff of Riverside County, and commentator Steve Hilton also are running.

But because House and Senate Republicans disagree about a separate budget issue, Medicaid rate cuts are set to hit providers Oct. 1. (Photo by Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)Chances increased Tuesday that many North Carolina health care providers will see cuts in the Medicaid insurance payments they receive for their services.  
Patients and health care advocates have warned that reduced payments will mean sick people won’t receive medical help and some health care workers will lose their jobs. 
Rep. Sarah Crawford (D-Wake) said the looming cuts are terrifying families of people with disabilities. She runs TLC, a nonprofit that offers programs for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
“I have been sick to my stomach, and that is not an understatement, as we get closer and closer to October 1,” Crawford said.  “Providers will not be able to sustain these cuts. They’ll have to do it cutting services, laying off workers, and making the most difficult call to moms, dads, sisters, and brothers and tell them, ‘Sorry, we can no longer provide services to your loved one.'”
The state House and the state Senate passed dueling health care funding bills this week. Without an agreement, neither bill can become law.
NC’s Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Dev Sangvai
The state Department of Health and Services warned last month that if it did not receive an increase in Medicaid funding, it would cut payment rates to a broad range of health care providers beginning Oct. 1. 
The agency said Tuesday that without the additional money, it is prepared to reduce payments.
DHHS Secretary Dev Sangvai said in an emailed statement that the legislature must act to approve the funds.
“Just like any household budget, we must make decisions based on the resources we know are available, not those we hope to receive,” his statement said.  “And under North Carolina law, the state is required to maintain a balanced budget, meaning we cannot spend money knowing we will run out well before the end of the fiscal year. Without legislative action, health care providers will see reduced payments and North Carolinians will see reduced access to care. It is time to stop delaying and do what is right for the people of North Carolina.”
The rate cuts will devastate patients and workers, said Rep. Grant Campbell (R-Cabarrus).
“There are health care providers all over the state that are already planning on layoffs, and some are deciding whether to continue seeing Medicaid patients at all,” he said.
The Senate passed its bill Monday. Senate leader Phil Berger said his chamber is done voting for the week. 
The House passed its bill unanimously on Tuesday. 
Both the House and Senate bills would increase funds going to cover increased Medicaid costs. The legislature approved $600 million in a stop-gap budget bill it passed in July, which DHHS said is not enough. Both the House and Senate bills increase that amount to $690 million, with more for Medicaid administration. 
The big sticking point is that the Senate included the final installment for a children’s hospital and money for rural hospitals in its bill while the House did not. 
House Republicans wanted a “clean bill” without the hospital money. The House Republican caucus is questioning the need to build a children’s hospital when the state already has them, and wants to take back the money that’s already been approved, House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Lenior) told reporters.  
Duke Health and UNC Health have announced they will jointly run the hospital planned for Apex.

“Our members are asking questions of why is the state sending this money to two entities that already have a ton of it for a project the state may not necessarily need,” he said. “That’s part of our debate right now over the budget.”
The legislature has not passed a comprehensive budget that includes big items such as teacher and state employee raises. The budget year started July 1.
In a statement, Gov. Josh Stein lamented the lack of an agreement between the chambers. 
“With no agreement in sight to fully fund our Medicaid program, the General Assembly is closing off access to health care at a time when we need more,”  Stein’s  statement said. “Failure to act will lose us critical federal funding and take more than a billion dollars total out of our state’s health care system, needlessly hurting people’s health, health care providers, and our economy.”
Hall told reporters that DHHS does not have to cut rates next week. The legislature has already provided enough money to fund Medicaid into next year, he said.
Hall said Stein, a Democrat, is threatening Medicaid cuts for political reasons.
“It’s creating a fake crisis,” Hall said. “He certainly doesn’t have to do it.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4763-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 19:58:24.451102

Ned Lamont walks with New London Mayor Michael Passero, right, and state Rep. Anthony Nolan, D-New London, toward a press conference to celebrate the resumtion of work on the Revolution Wind project. (Photo by John Moritz/ CT Mirror)Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont took a victory lap in New London on Tuesday after a federal judge ordered work to resume on the Revolution Wind project, and he hinted that ongoing talks with the Trump administration could ease the path forward for both wind and fossil fuel projects in the region.
“We have a lot of catching up to do,” Lamont told reporters from a vantage point overlooking the staging area at the State Pier, which was jam-packed with sections of turbines ready to be loaded onto ships and taken out to sea for installation.
That installation work, which was shut down for nearly a month on the orders of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, is slated to restart as soon as Wednesday, Lamont said.
“When these wind turbines are spinning in less than a year, it’s going to bring down the price of electricity, because it brings down peak pricing during the winter months, which is the most expensive time,” Lamont said. “This is a big deal for business, so it’s good.”
Lamont was joined in New London by his counterpart in Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, along with a throng of union workers and state and local officials to celebrate Monday’s decision by U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth, which lifted the stop-work order.
While the Trump administration may still appeal that decision, Lamberth did not stay his order — thus allowing work to resume immediately on the $6 billion project.
In a statement on Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said that Lamberth’s ruling “will not be the final say on the matter.”
“President Trump was elected with a resounding mandate to end Joe Biden’s war on American energy and restore our country’s energy dominance — which includes prioritizing the most effective and reliable tools to power our country,” Kelly said.
Rather than gloating on their initial victory, however, both Lamont and McKee offered a conciliatory note to President Donald J. Trump, saying they were engaged in conversations with administration officials about a broader energy strategy for the New England region.
“We’re working very closely with the Trump administration,” Lamont said. “We’re doing everything it can, not just right here [in New London] but what we can do to add on additional energy across our region. That’s all the above, from my point of view.”
Lamont has repeatedly touted his relationships with two Trump administration figures in particular: Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. He met with both officials during a visit to Washington, D.C., in February during which he expressed an interest in working with the federal government to secure permits for an expansion of natural gas infrastructure and state-of-the-art nuclear reactors.
The governor also noted that a purported deal between officials in New York and the federal government, which would allow the construction of new gas pipelines, was widely seen as necessary to spare another wind project — Empire Wind — from cancellation by the Trump administration.
But in his efforts to negotiate a similar deal to save Revolution Wind, Lamont said his overtures were repeatedly met with silence. “Show me the ransom note,” was how he characterized those talks to reporters last week, before the judge granted an injunction, allowing work to resume.
And while Lamont suggested some progress was made in talks held over the weekend, he confirmed on Tuesday that federal officials have not made any explicit request for Connecticut to approve natural gas pipelines in order to get them to lift their opposition to Revolution Wind.
Lamont’s willingness to strike a deal with the Trump administration involving an expansion of natural gas pipelines also risks alienating environmental advocates, who see gas as a costly and polluting source of power generation.
“I don’t think more natural gas is an ‘all of the above’ strategy,” said Charles Rothenberger, a climate and energy attorney for Save the Sound. “We’re full up on natural gas. You know, it’s by far the majority of what’s powering our electricity grid in the region. Here in Connecticut, we use an awful lot of it for home heating, and that creates a conflict. That’s a conflict, particularly with winter reliability, that offshore wind… is ideally designed to meet.”
Still, Rothenberger said he did not see much downside to officials like Lamont retaining “cordial” relationships with the Trump administration.
In addition to the soon-to-be-installed components of the Revolution Wind development that were stacked up on the State Pier Tuesday, equipment for the developers’ next project — the even larger Sunrise Wind, which will send power to New York — were being staged in preparation for offshore construction.
Asked whether he feared retaliation from the Trump administration targeting that project, Rhode Island’s McKee said the states would act similarly to protect workers and sources of clean energy.
“Those battles could come our way, but we’re prepared to fight them,” McKee said.

(Photo by Jodi Hilton/Getty Images)Democratic U.S. Reps. Gabe Amo and Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island pressed the House Committee on Appropriations Tuesday to reject a provision in one of its fiscal year 2026 budget proposals that would rename the new Workforce Pell Grants to “Trump Grants.”
Workforce Pell Grants are a new category of Pell Grant, the federal government’s need-based financial aid program for college undergraduates. After years of bipartisan efforts to institute the grants for short-term training that prepares students for specific, high skill industries, the Workforce Pell grants were signed into law via President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) in July. 
A provision in the house appropriations bill introduced on Sept. 11 — one that covers the upcoming fiscal year’s budgets for the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education — would see the new grants renamed before they go into effect on July 1, 2026. 
The provision would not affect traditional Pell Grants, and the U.S. Senate’s equivalent of the House Appropriations bill lacks the “Trump Grants” provision. 
In a letter to Appropriations leadership, Amo and Magaziner argued the new nickname would erase the legacy of the late U.S. Sen. Claiborne Pell, a Rhode Island Democrat and the namesake of the broader federal Pell Grant program which is often credited with scaffolding modern financial aid.  
“Preserving Senator Pell’s name on the program is not just about honoring the past, it is about protecting a future where every student, regardless of background, has the chance to dream big and achieve more,” the congressmen wrote. “To attempt to erase Senator Pell’s name from a program that has uplifted generations and replace it with a President whose record on education is defined by cuts and dismantlement is a profound insult to that legacy.”
Pell Grants began in 1972 when Pell led the charge to reform the Higher Education Act of 1965 and create Basic Educational Opportunity Grants, which were renamed in Pell’s honor in 1980. Pell Grants don’t require repayment and have a limited eligibility window. 
The new workforce grants carry the same conditions as other Pell offerings, and students cannot receive regular and workforce grants at the same time. The workforce grants — whose genesis goes back to 2014 with similar proposals in the JOBS Act by former Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu — are designed to subsidize students enrolled in accredited career-oriented programs that last between eight and 15 weeks. The OBBB defines eligible programs as ones offering instruction in “high-skill, high-wage” jobs or “in-demand industry sectors or occupations.”
Amo and Magaziner also took aim at the president’s venture into higher education, Trump University, which was open from 2005 to 2011 and was not an accredited university.
“It was not a university, it was not accredited, and it ultimately resulted in a $25 million settlement to resolve fraud claims brought by thousands of students who were misled by President Trump,” Amo and Magaziner wrote, adding that Trump’s higher ed effort “raise[s] questions about the appropriateness of associating the Trump name with a federal grant program designed to help working-class Americans achieve their higher education dreams.” 
“These grants should remain rooted in the legacy of Senator Pell, whose name symbolizes opportunity, integrity and the belief that education is the cornerstone of a strong democracy,” Amo and Magaziner wrote.

(Image via NPS)During the past two years, nonresident tourists visiting Montana spent an estimated $5.28 billion in the Treasure State annually, a roughly 9% decrease from the previous two years but one of the highest estimates on record.
That’s according to a new report by the Institute for Tourism and Recreation Research (ITRR) at the University of Montana, which examined nonresident spending during 2023 and 2024. Compared to the last two-year study, covering 2022 and 2023, average annual nonresident spending at gas stations, local restaurants, hotels and other tourism-oriented businesses decreased by roughly $540 million.
The latest data release tracks with an earlier report this year that showed Montana welcomed an all-time record number of tourists in 2024 — by a million — but saw a roughly 10% decrease in how much money those tourists spent in state.
Among the state’s five designated tourism regions, Glacier Country, comprising the western portion of Montana, saw a two-year average of $1.8 billion in annual nonresident spending, accounting for a third of all traveler expenditures, holding its position at the top. Yellowstone Country, which includes Bozeman, Big Sky, and Red Lodge was next with $1.3 billion in average annual spending.
The institute has collected nonresident spending data since 2009, giving researchers a long dataset to observe trends in spending habits. 
“It’s a consistent method we’ve been using for a very long time,” Kara Grau, the report’s author, said. “I feel good about the history of this data.”
The data is collected through in-person interviews with travelers, as well as data from secondary sources. Grau notes that while there is high confidence in the state-wide estimates, the modeling estimates for the region and county-level data is drawing from increasingly smaller pools of data, so there is more variation year-to-year. 
In the 2022-2023 report, Glacier Country and Yellowstone Country accounted for 33.6% and 23.4% of the state’s nonresident spending respectively. In the latest report, those proportions held steady, with 33% and 25% respectively, while the southwest region ticked up from 15% to 17%. 
Among counties, Gallatin County saw the highest annual average of $887.3 million in spending, while Flathead County was close behind with $850.3 million, down 8% and 15% respectively.
“They seem to just jockey for first and second position each year,” Grau said. “They’re relatively close in spending. They both have the big national parks right in their vicinity. I think the visitation to those parks is a big contributor to which county jumps into the first or second place spot.”
In 2022, Yellowstone National Park’s northern entrance and the Livingston area saw catastrophic floods which closed portions of the road for months, leading to a drastic drop in visitation that year. Grau said some of the increased visitation to Gallatin County and the Yellowstone Country region in the latest report can be attributed to Yellowstone being reopened for the full season. 
Twenty-seven Montana counties drew at least $20 million in out-of-state tourism-related spending.

  Gas, guides and gambling 

Gas and diesel was the top spending category statewide as well as in four travel regions in Montana — Glacier and Yellowstone’s travel regions saw spending in restaurants and bars take the number-one spot.  The two categories combined for 40% of traveler spending, followed by lodging at 22%.
Retail sales, a $413 million category for visitors in 2023 and 2024, showed a decrease in the latest report, as did some categories that capture snapshots of discretionary or high-budget expenditures. 
According to ITRR, roughly 5% of out-of-state visitors hire outfitters and guides, which accounted for $412 million in visitor expenditures, while tourists spending money in casinos accounted for $27 million, both declines from the previous year.
 


“I do think in 2024 we saw a little less spending on the more flexible kinds of spending that travelers do, in terms of ‘I’ll spend more on groceries and less on going out to eat.’” Grau said, also highlighting the declines in retail and guiding services. 
One spending category that bucked the trend was money spent on Made in Montana products, a separate category from regular retail expenses for products carrying a Department of Commerce designation as locally sourced. The ITRR questionnaire didn’t ask about locally-sourced products in its first few iterations, but as the state has emphasized products made or grown in the state it has emerged as a profitable economic sector that keeps growing. 
Visitors spent an average of $184 million on Made in Montana products in 2023 and 2024, up more than $20 million from the previous years.

Electricity demand in western states is projected to increase 20% during the next decade — double what has been expected, Gov. Greg Gianforte said Monday.
“It’s clear we’ve got to meet this challenge head on to secure affordable, reliable energy for Montana families and businesses,” Gianforte said.
At their initial meeting Monday, the governor asked members of his newly formed energy task force to “dig deep, be creative, cast a wide net.” He asked the group to explore groundbreaking technologies for the state, including nuclear.
Gianforte created the Energy Advisory Council in a Sept. 10 executive order to provide him with short- and long-term recommendations to increase the supply of affordable and reliable energy.
In general, Gianforte said he was tasking the group with providing “actionable” recommendations to “unleash American made energy.”
He said Montana has an “historic opportunity” to make progress with President Donald Trump back in the White House.
The task force, a group of 20 industry representatives, energy experts, large consumers, and legislators, asked how much more energy generation Montana needs, how much transmission capacity is available, and how to turn the page on “negative press” about data centers.
Montana Department of Environmental Quality Director Sonja Nowakowski, chairperson of the task force, said generation has changed in Montana in recent years.
It has more energy capacity but less generation, with the closures of two coal fired plants at Colstrip and opening of “more variable resources,” such as wind, according to her presentation.
Data in the presentation said since 2019, wind capacity has increased 162% and wind generation has increased 93.6%.
But Nowakowski said demand is up even as generation is down — “We need to do something about that.”
And she said not much has changed with transmission in recent years.
Nowakowski said the group had significant expertise, it would have hard conversations during the next year, and she encouraged members to continually think about pushing the Treasure State forward.
“How can we make Montana first? I’m competitive. I want Montana to be first,” Nowakowski said.
She also said she wanted U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and others at the national level “to know Montana is ready and open for business.”
In response to a question from state Sen. Chris Pope, a Bozeman Democrat, about whether reducing demand was part of the discussion, Nowakowski said “everything is on the table,” including energy efficiency.
“The cheapest electron is the one we save,” Nowakowski said.
Just one person appeared to have offered public comment, a written remark a task force member read aloud.
The person said they thought the makeup of task force members leaned toward those who favored fossil fuels and asked the group to consider including representation from the Montana Environmental Information Center.
Nowakowski, however, said the group’s charge in making recommendations included “fuel neutrality,” and she said the governor also had promoted an “all of the above” strategy for energy.
She outlined three topics task force subgroups would focus on — energy generation; growing demand; and transmission and markets.
The themes all three subgroups would consider are consumer perspectives, governance, regional markets, and best practices and innovation.
Gianforte said Montana already is a leader when it comes to energy resources and generation, and it’s ready to do more for producers and consumers, and for affordability and security.
“With our abundant resources and outstanding potential, Montana can and should play a key role in unleashing American energy,” Gianforte said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1248907535-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 19:58:24.451102

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Tax Department estimates the state’s income tax collections will take a sizable hit as a result of federal tax legislation, though the impact will be smaller than in many other states.
Matt Peyerl, associate director of tax administration for the department, told lawmakers on Tuesday to expect an estimated $129 million reduction in individual and corporate tax income collections during the 2025-27 budget cycle due to the 10-year budget reconciliation law.
That equates to approximately 9% of the state’s individual and business income taxes and 2.5% of the state’s total tax and fee revenues collected in the 2023-25 biennium. 
The reduction in income tax collection is expected to decrease to $93 million in the 2027-29 biennium, according to the tax department’s estimates, before falling off to $26 million in the 2029-31 biennium when many of the changes expire. 
“A lot of the individual changes fall off after four years,” Peyerl said. 
That leaves a lot of uncertainty when trying to project farther than four years out because Congress could choose to extend the changes. Even estimates for the next few years are dependent on a lot of variables. 
“For now they’re the best I have,” Peyerl told members of the Legislature’s interim Tax Reform and Relief Advisory Committee. 
He said there will be some clarity on the impact to state revenues in summer 2026 once the majority of this year’s tax returns are filed. 
Peyerl noted the impact on North Dakota is anticipated to be less than more populous states with higher tax rates and a lower percentage of the population falling into a “zero bracket,” where they pay no income tax. In North Dakota, residents don’t pay state income tax if they make less than $48,475 for single filers, or $80,975 for married couples.  
Some states will see impacts from the federal legislation in the hundreds of millions or nearly $1 billion, Peyerl said.
For North Dakota, the largest impacts to individual income tax will come from the exemption for overtime pay, the increased standard deduction that applies to all filers, an additional $6,000 tax deduction for some senior citizens, and the deduction for auto loan interest payments up to $10,000. 
Business tax revenues will be reduced by restoring corporations’ pre-2023 ability to expense bonus depreciation, as well as research and development costs. 
While these changes were made at the federal level, and not by the North Dakota Legislature, it will nonetheless affect the state’s tax collections.
“North Dakota is entirely coupled, for better or for worse,” Peyerl said, with the federal government’s system.
That means North Dakota conforms to the federal Internal Revenue Code, including any changes made by the U.S. Congress, unless the state’s lawmakers pass a law stating otherwise. 
“Most of the states are in similar positions where to one extent or another they’re tied to the federal system,” Peyerl said. “Some are more completely tied. Some are tied in between.”
Not all federal tax legislation affects North Dakota’s tax collections. Changes to tax credits, for example, don’t have an effect on how much revenue North Dakota receives.

(Photo by Katrina Liebich/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The U.S. Government does not have a good grasp on the federally-funded research needs for advancing U.S. national interests in the Arctic. That became clear to me when the U.S. Arctic Research Commission (USARC) recently published a new report that was intended to articulate those needs. In seeking alignment with the America First Agenda of the Trump Administration, USARC chose the wrong concept for our national interests. Perhaps inadvertently, USARC reduced our national interests to nothing more than our national safety and security interests. That is clear when one considers the terminology used throughout the report. Every priority area that USARC selected for Arctic research ends with the word “security” (e.g., military security). The Congressional committees of jurisdiction should resolutely reject the USARC findings in the months ahead. Otherwise, the U.S. Government will run the risk of prioritizing a set of research needs that do not fully advance the national interests of the Arctic, Alaskans and the American people.
Missing interests
One of the problems is that the USARC report frames the needs for Arctic research along a single dimensional plane. There is no doubt that national safety and national security are two of the national interests at play in the Arctic affairs of the United States. However, they are not the only national interests. There is also  national survival, as well as national identity. It is therefore remarkable that the USARC report not only overlooks the need for Arctic research on the preservation of the cultures, languages, history, and values of the Alaskans, especially Alaska Native peoples. It overlooks the need for Arctic research on the ability of the environment to meet the basic needs that ensure the enduring physical survival of Arctic communities.
Missing sectors
Another of the problems is that the USARC report frames the needs for Arctic research around only three of the five sectors of security. It is clear that there are economic issues, military issues, and societal issues that have become securitized in the Arctic affairs of the United States. However, they are not the only securitized issues. There are political issues that have become securitized, like immigration. That is evident in the framing of unlawful migration as an “invasion” by the Trump Administration. There are also environmental issues that some Americans argue should be securitized. Examples include climate change, environmental degradation, and cross-border pollution. That is evident in the framing of climate change as an “existential threat” by the Biden Administration. It is therefore remarkable that the USARC report did not explicitly address what, if any, needs there are for research on political and environmental security. That includes the need for research on Ukrainian refugees residing in the State of Alaska. Or the need for research on the environmental threats to certain Alaska Native villages that are now forced to relocate. The former is a particularly glaring omission given that U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) is on-the-record calling for the Trump Administration to do more to protect Ukrainian refugees.
National plan
The Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC), in cooperation with USARC, is in the process of developing a new multi-year national plan for Arctic research. That document will provide the guidelines that various federal agencies will use to determine where to invest their portion of federal funds to area studies, engineering, science, and technology research related to the Arctic. In order to advance U.S. national interests in Arctic affairs, the National Plan for Arctic Research (2027-2031) should avoid making the same mistakes as the USARC report. That will require doing a couple of things differently. First, it will need to account for each and every critical security issue that has an impact on U.S. national interests in the Arctic. That includes politically uncomfortable ones (e.g., environmental security issues). Second, it will need to articulate a set of priority areas that advance U.S. national interests – not simply U.S. national security interests. Otherwise, there will be major gaps in federally-funded research that will undermine U.S. national interests in the Arctic and beyond.
Alaska nexus
A large number of Arctic research institutions are based in the State of Alaska. This becomes immediately clear when one considers the member institutions of the soon to be shuttered Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS). They include the Alaska Ocean Observing System, Kawerak, Inc., Sitka Sound Science Center, University of Alaska Anchorage, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and University of Alaska Southeast. These member institutions have been conducting Arctic research that not only improves our general understanding of Alaska and its communities. They have been producing research that has a tangible impact on the everyday lives of the people of Alaska. 
If the U.S. government decides to deprioritize federal funding of research on the stewardship of the Alaskan environment or community health for Alaskans, it could not only have a significant impact on livelihoods of Arctic researchers across the State of Alaska. That decision could have a significant impact on the lives of hundreds of thousands of Alaskan residents. That is why Alaskans should be questioning the Congressional delegation of Alaska and where they stand on oversight actions and the needs for Arctic research in the months ahead. Otherwise, they could miss the policy window that is now open to advance the interests of Alaska through Arctic research.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/32597688296_22a9433c96_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 19:58:24.451102

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)The U.S. Department of Agriculture has canceled a report that hunger-fighting organizations say was “essential” data to see the results of federal and local policies aimed at ending hunger. 
USDA, in a news release about the decision said the reports were “redundant, costly, politicized” and did “nothing more than fear monger.”
Paige Chickering, vice chair of the Iowa Hunger Coalition, said agencies like hers, along with researchers and even politicians, used the now-canceled report to analyze the impact of certain policies on food insecurity. Chickering said the announced cancellation of the report coincides with the “largest cut” to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
“That can’t just be coincidence,” Chickering said. “That seems very intentional, because it is very likely that the cuts will make it harder for Americans, and Iowans, to access their grocery benefits, and we will very likely see that in the data about food security – except now we won’t, because it’s no longer being collected.”

The Republican-led budget reconciliation law,  enacted July 4 and known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” included significant cuts to the SNAP program. 
According to an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the law cut $187 billion, or about 20%, of federal funding to SNAP through 2034.  CBO said the law “takes away food assistance” via its changes to the Thrifty Food Plan, requirements for some states to provide matching funds, expanded work requirements and changes to eligibility based on immigration status. The CBO report estimates 4 million people that rely on SNAP will see their food assistance terminated, or reduced substantially. 
The Iowa Hunger Coalition estimates the changes to the program from the new law will result in a loss of nearly $50 million in funding to SNAP in Iowa in 2026. By 2034, the loss of funding per fiscal year will be more than $200 million, according to the coalition. 
“Millions of American children are facing food insecurity, and willfully neglecting that fact, and preventing the federal government from collecting and reporting the data that tells us how many kids are impacted is frankly unacceptable,” said Chickering, who is also the Iowa state manager for the Save the Children Action Network.
What is the Household Food Security Report?
The USDA and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Center for Health Statistics partnered in the 1990s to create a supplement to the Current Population Survey, known as the CPS Food Security Supplement. 
This supplement, which has been issued annually since 1995, gathers data for a national measure of food security. Data from the report is used to generate Household Food Security Reports.
According to the news release from USDA announcing the termination of the project, the study was initiated under the Clinton administration as a “means to support the increase of SNAP eligibility and benefit allotments.” 
USDA called the survey “redundant” in the release and said it “failed to present anything more than subjective, liberal fodder.” 
The food security survey is one of several elements used by Feeding America, a national organization of food banks, pantries and meal programs, for its reports on hunger in America. The latest report shows 47 million people in the nation face food insecurity, and that 1 in 5 children is food insecure. 
Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, Feeding America’s CEO, said in a statement that the loss of the survey “will create gaps.” Babineaux-Fontenot said while the survey was never a “a perfect resource,” it has revealed trends and highlighted the experiences of children and households experiencing food insecurity.
“They helped us to see that food insecurity touches every county in every state and that the deepest challenges are often in rural counties,” Babineaux-Fontenot said. 
She said the report also showed when certain issues like the “staggering inflation” of 2022 left people “reeling” or when policies, like the investments into nutrient-dense local foods in late 2020, had positive outcomes on food security rates and health outcomes. 
“While neither the USDA report nor any single report that is created will be perfect, these efforts help ensure the information we collect and act on is as accurate and useful as possible,” Babineaux-Fontenot said. 
“As USDA’s report sunsets, there is a risk of losing consistent national benchmarks that have helped guide solutions. Feeding America is committed to working alongside partners to ensure we continue building on that foundation.” 
USDA said in its release that “trends in the prevalence of food insecurity have remained virtually unchanged” despite increases to SNAP spending from 2019-2023. 
Chickering said that claim is “not true” and cited Feeding America’s Map the Meal Gap study which shows food insecurity rates nationally have increased more than 3% in the last two years. 
“They’ve not remained the same; they are actually on the rise,” Chickering said. “And then we also see strong anecdotal evidence of this as well when we talk about what food banks and food pantries are experiencing … they’re experiencing higher and higher demand.” 
USDA’s own survey results from September 2024, reflecting 2023 data from the survey, also show a sharp increase in food insecurity rates from 2021 to 2023.

Share Our Strength, another organization that uses the food security data with its No Kid Hungry campaign, said Americans should be “deeply concerned” about the elimination of the survey.
Anne Filipic, the organization’s CEO, said in a statement the data has been used to “illuminate how policy decisions impact how children and families across America experience hunger.” 
“By helping policymakers and advocates understand the impact policy decisions and the economy have on hunger trends, this research helps ensure we’re wisely investing taxpayer dollars efficiently and effectively on programs that work to end hunger,” Filipic said in a statement.
Chickering said the announcement from USDA insinuates the report is “costing American taxpayers a ton of money” which she said is misleading since the survey is a supplement to the existing Current Population Survey. 
“We get a ton of data out of this report that’s foundational to the study of food insecurity in our country at a very low cost to the government,” Chickering said.

Josh Shapiro.","Constellation Energy's Limerick Generating Station, branded as the Limerick Clean Energy Center, in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)The organization that manages the electric grid for all or part of 13 states, including Maryland, has moved too slowly in response to skyrocketing energy demand and consumers are paying for it, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Monday.
Speaking at a conference of energy industry leaders and regulators in Philadelphia, Shapiro said PJM Interconnection must make changes, including giving states a bigger role in its governance, or the commonwealth could leave the consortium.
“We need to be thinking about consumers and their costs, something that PJM, I think, doesn’t really spend a whole lot of time focused on,” Shapiro told reporters Monday after delivering opening remarks at the event.
He said governors from each PJM state share concerns about the Valley Forge-based organization’s backlog of new energy projects awaiting approval while peak energy consumption is expected to increase by 20% in the next decade, according to PJM’s forecast. Much of that demand will come from data centers that house the computing power for artificial intelligence.
“We need to move more quickly on these energy-producing projects. We’ve got to hold down costs. If PJM cannot do that, then Pennsylvania will look to go it alone,” Shapiro said.

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who spoke via video, said overhauling the state’s power policy was among his first calls for action after taking office in 2022. Youngkin, a Republican, said his administration predicted demand would grow faster than PJM’s forecast.
“Indeed, instead of unlocking investment and fast tracking critical projects, PJM has instead been responsible for bottlenecks and delays that crush jobs, drive up utility bills and leave families and businesses hurting,” he said. “This is a crisis of not having enough power, and it is a crisis in confidence.”
Youngkin said Virginia lawmakers are working on legislation that would allow the state to reassess whether its utilities should remain part of PJM.
“This doesn’t mean that we are walking away, but it does mean that collectively, we recognize we need to represent and protect our ratepayers, and that means sending a clear, unified signal that PJM must modernize,” he said.
PJM was founded in Philadelphia nearly a century ago when three electricity utilities connected their independent grids to share resources and improve reliability. With more than 1,000 stakeholder members, it now ensures the flow of power to utilities in all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois and the New York border to North Carolina.
It is overseen by a board of governors through a consensus-based issue resolution process in which member organizations and stakeholders have weighted votes on issues that will go before the board. These include state consumer advocate organizations, like Pennsylvania’s Public Utilities Commission, but the states themselves have no direct input.
The board’s decisions are ultimately subject to approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
While PJM’s stakeholder process and meetings are open to the public with agendas and minutes posted on its website, members of the public are required to register for an account to watch meetings virtually. And while the outcome of votes is public, critics have compared it to a black box, because how stakeholders vote on questions is secret.
Lawmakers in several states have proposed laws requiring PJM members to report their votes to state regulators. They include a bill introduced by Pennsylvania state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia), which passed in the House in July and awaits action in the Senate.
“Utility companies operating in our regional power grid that determine the electric bills, environmental and public health of 65 million people should never be allowed to vote in secret,” Rabb said. “Such decisions must be publicly disclosed. End of story.”

PJM CEO Manu Asthana, who is set to step down at the end of this year, said he’s proud of the reliability that PJM has provided through a series of unusual events during his tenure, including record peak demands, a pandemic, geomagnetic storms and the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which threatened a major transmission line.
Asthana said criticism of PJM’s interconnection queue, in which 63,000 megawatts of power projects await review for permission to connect to the grid, is not warranted.
“There’s a lot of mythology and a lot of things that are said about our interconnection queue,” he said, noting that number is down from 200,000 megawatts when the organization implemented reforms in 2023. PJM also notes that it has cleared tens of thousands of megawatts worth of projects that have failed to come online for reasons outside of its control, including site acquisition, permitting and supply chain problems.
PJM has also worked proactively with members to prioritize important projects, such as restarting Constellation Energy’s former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, and redeveloping Homer City, one of the nation’s largest coal power plants, into the nation’s largest natural gas-burning power stations. Both projects will power data centers.
Experts who spoke during panels at the conference agreed with Shapiro, Youngkin and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who also spoke via video, that PJM is not serving consumers well.
“You’ve got 67 million people who are very concerned, and again, consumers are called voters, and that makes the politicians concerned,” said former FERC Chairman Mark Christie. Christie and former FERC Commissioner Allison Clements were recommended by a bipartisan panel of PJM-state governors to fill vacancies on the board, but neither was ultimately nominated.
“PJM should be reimagined in the governance sense,” Christie said, adding that he wouldn’t interfere with the technical aspects of operating the grid. “The policymaking things that PJM does in their political policy, if it’s going to be a regional government for the grid, people who are elected will have a much bigger role in that.”
Vincent Duane, a former senior vice president and general counsel at PJM, said changes need to go deeper than simply giving elected officials a bigger role.

“​​I’m going to be blunt and unpopular when I say that PJM has become ungovernable,” Duane said “Adding seats to an already crowded banquet table with 1,000 parliamentarians with vastly different interests, I think, is going to ultimately leave states feeling disappointed with the outcomes.”
What’s missing is more purposeful and deliberate decision making from a strong executive branch in the organization that is accountable to state utility regulators, he said.
Duane later added that as general counsel, PJM board members often asked him to whom they had a fiduciary responsibility. He said he had trouble answering the question. To say the responsibility was to the marketplace or membership was unsatisfactory.
“Until we can get a good answer to that question, it’s premature to start talking about process and voting structures,” Duane said.
Maryland State Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) said the question of fiduciary duty is an important one for the success of policies that elected officials create.
“The vast majority of the stakeholders know who their fiduciary duty is to, and it is to their shareholders,” Charkoudian said, adding that for ratepayers that amounts to a wealth transfer to the market participants who are writing the rules.
“You could go example after example after example, where that is the case,” she said. “And that is why it’s untenable to continue at this moment with this governance structure.”

The board discussed its options on the two president openings during a closed executive session Tuesday when it met on the Minot State University campus. 
Simone, previously CEO and dean at Dakota College at Bottineau, was appointed as interim president in May. She took over for longtime Lake Region President Doug Darling, who retired June 30.
Board Chair Kevin Black said the difference in the two openings was that Simone had already gone through a rigorous vetting process when she was a finalist for the Dickinson State University president’s post. That position went to Scott Molander. Simone has also held other top leadership positions at other campuses.
Black encouraged Leingang to apply for the Bismarck State presidency. The position opened when Doug Jensen left abruptly in January.

The board also is wrestling with updating its policies on when a search is required for leadership posts. It chose to not conduct a search before naming Brent Sanford as the University System’s commissioner Tuesday. It also did not conduct a search for the Lake Region presidency. 
The board without discussion advanced a first reading of a policy change that removes a requirement for the board to conduct a presidential search. A committee will work on refining the policy before it comes back to the board for further consideration. 
Lisa Montplaisir, faculty representative to the board, said the search policies and practices have been a hot topic with faculty this year. 
“Our hope is that we have the opportunity to provide input,” Montplaisir, who teaches at North Dakota State University, said after the meeting. 
University of North Dakota President Andy Armacost said in an interview that a national search is the norm at the college for positions such as vice president and dean. 
UND is searching for a dean of its law school and its College of Business and Public Administration. 
“There might be times when we go away from that (national search) standard,” Armacost said.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday joined a private prison company in its legal fight with Leavenworth city officials, accusing the city of “aggressive and unlawful” interference with immigration enforcement.
The DOJ filed a statement of interest in the case in U.S. District Court, signed by the assistant U.S. attorney general’s office.
“The United States has a strong interest in countering state and local efforts to harass federal contractors, in the proper application of the Constitution and its Supremacy Clause, and in the foundational principles that protect the Federal Government from unconstitutional state and local interference,” the filing said.
A statement of interest authorizes the U.S. attorney general to become a non-party in a suit pending in any court in the country, the filing said.
CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth have been fighting in court for months over the city’s requirement that CoreCivic go through its development process to receive a special use permit before reopening its prison facility at 100 Highway Terrace.
Nashville-based CoreCivic announced in March that it would reopen the prison facility, which closed in 2021, to house Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees.
CoreCivic and the city have a hearing scheduled Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Topeka as part of an appeal of a Kansas court’s decision barring CoreCivic from housing ICE detainees while the case about the development permit is being heard.
CoreCivic has alleged in multiple filings that Leavenworth officials are violating the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution and interfering with the operations of the federal government. That clause sets federal laws as supreme over state laws.
The U.S. government’s statement Tuesday pushed that argument forward, saying that it is “especially true” in relationship to immigration. 
“Defendants have violated the Supremacy Clause by attempting to stymie the Federal Government’s immigration-related operations at 100 Highway Terrace,” the federal filing said, citing multiple cases to support its arguments that federal contractors are free from state control.
“This well-settled principle has been consistently applied to invalidate state and local laws that impose requirements on federal contractors,” the filing said. 
The city’s efforts to prevent CoreCivic from housing immigration detainees at its prison, recently renamed the Midwest Regional Reception Center, is an attempt to regulate the federal government’s efforts to house detainees at that facility and violates the supremacy clause, the filing said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CoreCivic-MRRC-sign-1024x661.jpg,,,2025-09-23 18:58:27.544124

(Austin Anthony for the Kentucky Lantern)Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman and GOP attorneys general from 25 other states are supporting a Trump administration move to rescind a finding that underpins the federal government’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change. 
The attorneys general submitted the letter, led by Coleman and West Virginia Attorney General John “JB” McCuskey, Monday to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The letter supports the Trump EPA’s proposal to reverse the agency’s previous finding that greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide threaten “both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.” 
The 2009 “endangerment” finding established under the Obama administration has served as the legal basis for a number of federal regulations seeking to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including a 2024 Biden administration rule that restricted tailpipe emissions from vehicles. The finding followed a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision that found the agency could regulate greenhouse gases as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act. 
Coleman in a statement provided through a press release Tuesday highlighting the 88-page letter said the “unlawful” EPA finding “has been the justification for assaults on Kentucky.” 
“Along with AGs across the country, we’re partnering with President Trump to preserve affordable and reliable energy in Kentucky and to stop the madness that has hiked prices and killed jobs,” Coleman said. 
The press release from Coleman’s office also stated the EPA finding has underpinned “some of the worst policies of the last decades,” citing the Clean Power Plan that curbs carbon emissions from existing power plants and federal electric vehicle “mandates.”
The letter questions the near unanimous scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, are driving the warming of the Earth’s climate. 
“[C]limate science didn’t support the Endangerment Finding in 2009, and the science has only gotten worse for EPA’s original finding since then,” the attorneys general wrote in the letter’s introduction. 
The letter claims increasing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere would “have only a trivial effect on global temperature,” citing physicists Steven Koonin, Richard Lindzin and William Happer who have questioned climate science and the threat of climate change. 
Vic Maddox, counsel on special litigation for Kentucky’s attorney general, cited Lindzin and Happer in testimony to state lawmakers that carbon dioxide’s role in climate change was disputed.
The letter is co-signed by attorneys general from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations body, in a 2021 report stated humans’ role in climate change was “unequivocal” and connected climate change to an increasing frequency of heatwaves, droughts, heavy rainfall events, stronger hurricanes and other extreme weather. 
A number of environmental and health advocacy groups are urging the EPA to keep the endangerment finding. The American Lung Association and other health organizations wrote that people’s health would suffer if “life-saving pollution controls are left on the manufacturing floor and the overwhelming scientific consensus — and the law — on climate change is ignored.” 
Byron Gary, an attorney for the environmental legal group Kentucky Resources Council, told the Lantern he had not reviewed the letter from the attorneys general. But he said a reversal of the endangerment finding by the EPA would lead to relying further on “aging fossil infrastructure” that would increase energy costs, reduce energy reliability and exacerbate climate change. 
Gary pointed to an article published this month in the British weekly scientific journal Nature that found the health impacts of smoke from increased wildfires driven by climate change could lead to tens of thousands of increased deaths. 
“These are real effects on people’s lives. They are going to be killing people if this is repealed,” Gary said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fancyfarm_032-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 18:58:27.544124

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority on Tuesday announced it has decided to move a controversial new turnpike route about two miles to the west.
The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority’s top priority when setting the new Norman-area turnpike route was minimizing the impact on people’s homes, said Joe Echelle, executive director.
“It was especially important to us that the new alignment avoid populated subdivisions, section line roads and dense development,” he said.
Engineers also looked closely at  environmental considerations such as floodplains, municipal use plans and existing utilities, he said.
Officials have been looking for a new corridor after the original route, dubbed the South Extension Turnpike, had to be revised when the U.S. Bureau of Land Reclamation determined the corridor proposed in 2022 was not compatible with the designated federal uses on Lake Thunderbird land in Norman.
The new route will eventually connect interstates 35 and 40, which supporters say will alleviate traffic congestion on I-35.
The new alignment starts at Indian Hills Road and runs south between 48th Street and 60th Avenue through Norman. It continues south past Oklahoma Highway 9. In the Noble area, the alignment will cross U.S. Highway 77 followed by the Canadian River before connecting with Interstate 35 north of Purcell.
Construction is anticipated to begin in 2027, with the northern portion of the South Extension Turnpike opening in 2032. The southern portion, from Oklahoma Highway 9 to Interstate 35, is expected to open in 2034. 
The new alignment is expected to impact about 75 homes, the same number as the original plan, said Trenton January, Oklahoma Turnpike Authority chief engineer.  
“Once we get closer to the 60% design phase, we will be able to be more accurate with homeowners and property owners about exactly what properties will be needed to develop the corridor,” January said.
The number of homes needed is subject to change, said Ladan Nelson, program manager.
“The Turnpike Authority is committed to negotiating all the way to the courthouse, even after it goes to condemnation, we continue to try to negotiate a settlement,” Echelle said.
Echelle said he didn’t think any schools or businesses would be impacted.
The cost of the route will be over $1 billion, which is about the same as the original, Nelson said.
Shortly after the new route was unveiled, several area lawmakers criticized it.
Democratic state lawmakers Mary Boren, Jared Deck, Annie Menz and Jacob Rosecrants issued a joint statement.
“Today’s announcement by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority casts a renewed cloud of uncertainty and fear over yet another 25,000 acres of homes, farms and ranches in Cleveland and McClain counties,” the Norman legislators said. “Once again, thousands of Oklahomans are being forced to live under the looming threat of displacement, and without a clear, evidence-based justification.”
The four Democrats called it a “flawed and corrupt process.”
Sen. Lisa Standridge, R-Norman, said she would work on legislation to bring more accountability and transparency to the Turnpike Authority.
“Turnpike expansion that is approved in the past and not moved upon until decades later is not acceptable,” she said, referring to prior legislative approval of the proposed turnpike. 
The new turnpike is part of a 15-year pike improvement and expansion plan, dubbed ACCESS, which originally carried a price tag of $5 billion. The new cost is $8.2 billion due to inflation, officials said.

(Getty Images)As New Mexico lawmakers prepare to convene next week in part to address the federal spending bill’s impact on Medicaid, legislative analysts say the state’s costs for the program have nearly doubled in nine years, even as enrollment has dropped. In addition, clients report ongoing issues with doctor availability.
Legislative Finance Committee analysts presented their report to lawmakers during an interim committee meeting on Tuesday in Hobbs. Overall, the report says, the state’s Health Care Authority since 2016 has nearly doubled total spending on Medicaid — to $11 billion — despite serving 31,000 fewer New Mexicans.
The report also includes the results of a secret shopper survey from August, which backs up anecdotal concerns regarding long wait lists and difficulty securing appointments. Analysts called 256 primary care physicians and 259 doctors to seek behavioral health care appointments under Medicaid, and found it took an average of six phone calls to secure an appointment. Nearly one in five doctors listed on directories from insurance companies could no longer be found or were “inappropriate for the specialty.”  Another 17% of providers either did not return calls or could not be reached.
Financial analyst Allegra Hernandez noted that Medicaid represents the state’s most vulnerable populations: low-income people, pregnant women, children and people with behavioral health issues.
“The systems are not improving for users in the way that we would expect and hope with these investments,” Hernandez said. “Moreover, spending has increased significantly, and these payoffs are not yet demonstrated to have shown up.”
Finally, analysts said the state still is not tracking, in real time, what services patients are using.
In a rebuttal, Health Care Authority Chief Medical Officer Alanna Dancis told lawmakers that some of the measures in the report are “a little bit misleading,” saying that the analysis in the report does not align with any other accountability measures requested by the federal government or lawmakers.
“We just would like to work together to kind of pick how we’re evaluated from the front end so that we have our best chance of being successful,” Dancis said.
Dancis said the agency has added nearly 2,000 new providers, including 469 new behavioral health workers and 189 new licensed therapists, based on new state laws passed by lawmakers, and that rising costs of the program in recent years were anticipated.
“We’re right where we expect to be after so much growth,” Dancis said.
As such, Dancis disputed the survey conclusions that the program has inadequate providers.   While “we can all agree that six calls is too many calls to make to try to schedule an appointment,” she said, better provider directories might address the issue.
New Mexico has the highest per-capita enrollment in Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people, amounting to about 38% of the state, according to the state’s latest data. The New Mexico Health Care Authority estimates that more than 80,000 New Mexicans could lose coverage due to the new work requirements and reregistering every six months beginning in December of 2026.
While the Health Care Authority is expected to ask lawmakers for additional administrative funding in anticipation of federal cuts, Charles Sallee, director of the Legislative Finance Committee, urged caution later in the day during a presentation on the federal impacts.
The HCA will ask for more funding to administer new work requirements and evaluate eligibility for assistance programs every six months, Sallee said. But he noted, per an LFC analysis, that state employees’ caseloads for food stamps, Medicaid and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families are down 21% since before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lawmakers should be prudent during the special session, he said, in light of how much non-recurring spending lawmakers have already allocated for the upcoming 30-day session and with fears about a looming federal government shutdown.
“I worry about spending that down before you get into the regular session, to be perfectly honest with you, because I think we’re facing headwinds economically,” he said. “And I worry about what that what the next couple of months are going to entail, just from our broader-based economic prosperity.”
Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Albuquerque) spoke of her own challenges in securing appointments with doctors and specialists in the state and asked if the state has any data for how doctors may be leaving practices or the state altogether.
Harry Rommel, a fiscal analyst, said the LFC is working to track physician migration, but said the New Mexico Department of Health still hasn’t granted the committee access to a database tracking payments to doctors, but when that happens the state can find out if physicians are moving to private practices, or leaving the New Mexico altogether.
“That’s a missing link to figure out what’s really happening out there,” Trujillo said.

No matter where they landed in the rankings, many of Iowa’s universities touted student enrollment and retention rates as true signs of strength.
More than 1,700 U.S. colleges and universities are included in the 2026 U.S. News Best Colleges rankings, according to a U.S. News & World article announcing the rankings. Universities’ placement within the different ranking categories were determined by anywhere from 13 to 17 factors, the media company stated online, including different graduation and retention rates, peer assessments, faculty numbers and pay and more.

State universities
The University of Iowa lost its spot in the top 100 national universities for the first time since its launch at rank 57 on the list in 2004, falling from number 98 to 102 out of 436 and tying with seven other universities.
Its rankings for specific programs, including writing, undergraduate nursing and insurance, are all in the top 10 for this year, according to a news release from the UI, and is tied at 49th place for top public schools.
Of that top 50, the release stated the UI is one of only five universities to admit more than 80% of its applicants. UI President Barbara Wilson said in the release the university’s achievement of nearly 91% retention while still “admitting broadly” is a sign its mission is being fulfilled.
“The University of Iowa offers a world-class education while remaining accessible to every college-ready student,” Wilson said. “We are proud of the recognition, but even more proud of the real results we deliver for students and for the state of Iowa.”
Iowa State University climbed four spots in its national university ranking, going from 121st to a tie for 117th place. The Ames university placed 57th among top public schools, but its undergraduate engineering programs tied for 50th and biological and agricultural areas reached the number-one slot.
While not ranked in the same categories as the UI and ISU, the University of Northern Iowa has taken second place among top public regional universities in the Midwest, a continuing trend according to a news release from the Cedar Falls university.
UNI moved up one spot to 10th in the overall category for Midwest regional universities, according to the release, and was named the fourth-best college for veterans.
“These rankings annually reaffirm the many reasons why students across the Midwest are choosing UNI,” said UNI Director of University Relations Pete Moris in the release. “Whether it’s the high quality of our academic programs or the exceptional value we provide families, UNI continues to be recognized as one of the top public institutions in the Midwest.”
Private universities
Dordt University in Sioux Center is the only Iowa university to outrank UNI in the list of best Midwest regional universities, moving up one slot to fifth this year, according to a news release from the college. The institution also earned a #5 ranking in the best value category, and was ranked second for best undergraduate teaching.
Greg Van Dyke, Dordt University vice president for admissions, said in the release the rankings affirm the university’s growth and efforts to prepare students for careers and “lives of impact.”
“Being recognized by a respected organization like U.S. News & World Report is encouraging, but our focus remains clear: we exist to equip students to work for Christ-centered renewal in every area of life,” said Dordt President Erik Hoekstra in the release. “Rankings like these are affirming, but ultimately, we’re here for Christ and to help our students plug into His Kingdom purpose.”
Drake University in Des Moines ranks the highest out of Iowa’s private institutions included in the national universities category at #183, followed by Clarke University in Dubuque and St. Ambrose University in Davenport, both tied for 352nd place. Briar Cliff University in Sioux City ranks 384th.
Of the Iowa universities included in the national liberal arts colleges list, Grinnell College comes out on top — moving up six slots to 13th place in the ranking. The university, located in Grinnell, also came in third for undergraduate teaching, another six-spot climb, as well as earning 8th place for best value schools and 13th for most innovative schools.
Also ranked in the national liberal arts college category are Luther College in Decorah at 111th, Cornell College in Mount Vernon at 121st, Coe College at 126th, Central College in Pella at 131st and Wartburg College in Waverly at 156th place.
According to a news release from Grinnell College, these rankings come from the college’s “strong graduation rates for Pell-eligible students, as well as outperforming U.S. News’ predictive model for graduation rates.”
“These recognitions underscore Grinnell’s enduring commitment to academic excellence and college access,” said Grinnell College President Anne Harris in the release. “Our progress in areas like innovation, teaching, and social mobility reflects the strength of a Grinnell education—one that combines vibrant intellectual experience with campus community support, preparing our students to thrive and deepening our investment in every student’s success.”

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Projected tax collections in Washington continue to fall steeply, with declines totaling more than $500 million since the governor signed off on billions of dollars in tax increases earlier this year to help balance the budget.
Estimates shared with officials Tuesday show receipts for the current two-year state budget tumbling $412 million further from what was forecast three months ago. Incorporating the previous forecast from June, this puts the total slide over half-a-billion dollars. 
The troubling report from Dave Reich, the state’s chief economist, to the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council sets the stage for another legislative session marred by tough budget decisions, with the potential for further cuts to state services and higher taxes.
Sen. June Robinson, the lead budget writer in the Senate, said it’s “all bad news” that will make figuring out a supplemental budget plan next year “that much harder.”
With months until the next legislative session begins in January, it’s still early, but Robinson said lawmakers “may look at tax levers” again.
“We did take significant steps in that direction, those haven’t all played out, so I’m not sure there will be a big appetite to do a lot in the revenue space,” said Robinson, D-Everett, in an interview. “We really scoured all the agencies earlier this year for any savings and reductions that were tenable, so it just means we have to go deeper.”
Rep. Ed Orcutt, R-Kalama, said the forecast is a “huge concern” and means the new budget passed earlier this year is already underwater. He called for budget writers and the governor to come into the next legislative session with ideas for further spending cuts to make ends meet.
“Increasing taxes has not resolved the deficit problem, so maybe it’s time we look at the other side of the equation,” Orcutt said.
Gov. Bob Ferguson called the new projections “disappointing but not surprising.”
“As I write my first budget, I will be focused on delivering a balanced budget that maintains core services to the people of our state,” he said in a statement.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)The University of New Orleans should adopt LSU branding and become LSU New Orleans when it transfers to the LSU system, interim LSU President Matt Lee told the Board of Regents Tuesday. 
Lee said the change is necessary to make the transfer successful. UNO was known as LSU New Orleans from its founding in 1958, when it was considered a branch of the Baton Rouge main campus, until its change to the University of New Orleans in 1974. 
“I think for this to really work, it’s going to have to be LSU New Orleans because you’re marrying two well known brands,” Lee said, referring to LSU and the city of New Orleans. 
UNO was previously part of the LSU System until it was moved into the University of Louisiana System 14 years ago, with proponents of the move saying it was necessary for the New Orleans school to get out of the shadow of the much larger Baton Rouge campus.
State lawmakers earlier this year approved transferring the university back to the LSU System in response to UNO’s long-running enrollment decline, which has caused a fiscal crisis for the school. UNO is the only public research university in New Orleans and is considered vital for the region. 
A committee to oversee the transition will hold its first meeting early next month, LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard said. 
UNO’s enrollment decline spans two decades. The school had a student body of around 17,000 before Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with an immediate drop to around 6,000 after the storm. 
For several years before President Kathy Johnson took over the university in 2023, university administrators did not align spending with falling enrollment. The school faced a $30 million budget shortfall last fiscal year and implemented layoffs, staff furloughs and a spending freeze in an attempt to make ends meet. 
Lawmakers and university leaders hope the transfer will have a positive impact on student numbers. Despite the national trend of falling enrollment, every school in the LSU System has reported increasing, often record-breaking enrollment over the past several years.

Members of the New Mexico Congressional delegation are calling on the USDA Secretary to exempt New Mexico's federal forests from a rescission of the ""roadless rule,"" saying opening up swaths of wild forests to timber or other uses exposes the state to wildfires and has other costs. (Courtesy Gila National Forest)All five members of New Mexico’s all-Democratic Congressional delegation have signed on to a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins that requests the state be excluded from the Trump administration’s proposed repeal of the so-called Roadless Rule.
The 24-year-old Roadless Area Conservation Rule was implemented to restrict road construction and timber harvesting on over 58 million acres of federal Forest Service land across 38 states. This includes about 1.6 million acres of land in New Mexico, which impacts all five of the state’s national forests. However, the Gila National Forest has the most protected acreage.
Rollins announced the proposal to rescind the rule in June during the Western Governors’ Association meeting held in Santa Fe, and contends the rule change will give state and local experts the freedom to make decisions about forest management and allow the logging industry to grow.
New Mexico’s Congressional delegation sent a letter to Rollins on Sept. 19, after three weeks of public comment ended. The delegation asked the secretary to exclude New Mexico from the rollback, citing negative impacts to the state’s vulnerability to wildfires, public safety and the outdoor recreation economy.
“New Mexico is particularly vulnerable to wildfire,” the letter reads,” with a risk profile higher than 82% of the United States. Multiple studies, including those conducted by the federal government, have confirmed that wildfires are much less likely to ignite in roadless areas.”
According to the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, about 1,000 wildfires have been reported in 2025 as of September, impacting more than 197,000 acres of land. Communities across the state are still recovering from wildfires in recent years, which exacerbate flooding conditions and landslides, disproportionately affecting rural and lower income residents, the letter states.
The delegation also pointed to the disruption of wildlife movement and habitat conservation by road construction, as well as outdoor recreation, which they said generates “$3.2 billion in New Mexico and supports nearly 30,000 jobs.” Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) recently urged New Mexicans to provide public input on the proposed rule change.
“This is being imposed…by people in the White House, who frankly have never harvested a bull elk or [caught and] released a native trout,” he said on the U.S. Senate floor. “The truth is that the roadless rule protects us from wildfires, it ensures clean drinking water for communities, and it sustains wildlife habitat for wildlife and for sportsmen.” 
Last week’s letter noted that road construction in backcountry areas is linked to an increase in dust and runoff and will negatively impact watersheds that provide water to multiple cities in New Mexico and could pose a threat to native aquatic species. The delegation also pointed out that the Roadless Rule already allows for timber harvesting for purposes of “ecological or wildfire mitigation purposes.” 
According to the national environmental law nonprofit organization Earthjustice, more than half of the responses received by the USDA opposed the proposed rule change. The organization noted in a statement that other members of Congress have also asked for more time for the public to provide comments.
“Many of the submitted comments centered on how irresponsible this rollback would be considering the trend of hotter and more severe wildfires that have plagued national forests in recent years,” the organization stated.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/52538309861_f11dae585d_o.jpg,,,2025-09-23 18:58:27.544124

(Photo by Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina lawmakers have passed a wide-ranging crime bill, making changes to pre-trial release requirements and paving a new path to resume the death penalty in a Republican-led package that sparked fierce partisan disagreements.
The House approved the bill Tuesday, sending it to Gov. Josh Stein’s desk less than 48 hours after it was made public. Titled “Iryna’s Law,” it comes weeks after Ukrainian Iryna Zarutska was fatally stabbed on Charlotte light rail.
GOP leaders, who hold majorities in both chambers, tout the legislation as a key step in cracking down on violent crime and repeat offenders, while laying the groundwork to resume the state’s death penalty.
“Iryna Zarutska’s murder is a tragic reminder of what’s at stake,” Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) said. “That’s why we are delivering some of the strongest tough-on-crime reforms in North Carolina history.”
Democrats argue the bill would not have prevented Zarutska’s death. They have decried a lack of investment into mental health treatment and public defenders. And late changes to the bill’s death penalty language prompted several Democratic senators to walk out ahead of a vote Monday night.
“We have to address the root issues,” said Rep. Terry Brown (D-Mecklenburg). “And that takes hard work, deliberation and thoughtfulness. We must stop puffing our chests out … and using inflammatory language, and be serious.”
The bill limits pre-trial release options for defendants accused of “violent offenses,” and funnels repeat offenders toward involuntary commitment at mental hospitals.
It also ramps up judicial scrutiny of court magistrates, while streamlining the death penalty process and pursuing new methods of execution.
House Bill 307 passed the House on Tuesday, 82-30, after hours of tense and emotional debate. The Senate vote Monday was 28-8, with a majority of Democrats walking out of the vote.
Stein has not yet said whether he will sign or veto the bill. He has said he supports several key provisions, but has not weighed in on changes it makes to the death penalty.
Leaders agree on importance of mental health, but remain far apart on solutions
Mental health services and treatment remain critical to the state’s criminal justice system, Republicans acknowledge.
Sen. Danny Britt (R-Hoke) said there was “more work to do” on the matter. And Iryna’s Law would send more repeat offenders directly to hospitals for mental health evaluations. The man charged with murdering Zarutska, Decarlos Brown, Jr., reportedly had untreated schizophrenia.
But GOP leaders were reluctant to allocate money on mental health in the bill, shooting down amendments to spend millions on training magistrates and law enforcement.
“It’s not my understanding that the reason he was failed is because there wasn’t resources to get him an evaluation,” Senate President Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters Monday night. “He was failed because his mother wanted somebody to pick him up, and there was not the willingness on the part of the system to do that.”
Brown was previously admitted to a mental hospital for two weeks, The Charlotte Observer reported in an interview with his mother, and received medication. But they did not take him in long-term, and he stopped taking the medication.
Asked how the legislature could legislate the “willingness” he referenced, Berger responded: “You hope that you have people in positions that are making those kinds of decisions, that understand the consequences of failure to act. And if you don’t … then we need to get other people in there.”
Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) fumed after the vote Monday night that Republicans were unwilling to spend more money. The bill failed to address “our broken mental health system” and “underfunded and overtaxed law enforcement,” Batch said. A representative of the state’s ACLU chapter has called the bill’s approach to involuntary commitment “a road to nowhere.”

“We just don’t want to pay for it,” said Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) during House debate on Tuesday. “We want to punish our way out of it.”
Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg) said Monday she had dealt with the involuntary commitment process first-hand, with her teenage son.
“This ain’t going to solve it,” Cunningham said. “This ain’t going to fix it.”
Could NC begin using electric chair or firing squad?
In its original form, Iryna’s Law made some procedural changes to North Carolina’s death penalty process. Defendants’ appeals would be governed by stricter rules, and cases involving capital punishment would proceed in their own counties, rather than just Wake County.
But an amendment tacked on mid-debate on the Senate floor by Republicans expanded those changes.
Now, the bill would require the state to adopt another method of execution if lethal injection — currently the state’s default method — is found to be unconstitutional.
Executions have been on pause in North Carolina for almost 20 years, tied up by legal and regulatory challenges. The bill’s new language means that when the courts do eventually rule on the practice, the Department of Adult Corrections would adopt another method used by another state. That could include the electric chair or a firing squad.
There are 122 offenders on North Carolina’s death row with a case dating back to 1985.
Berger told reporters he believed there were opponents to the death penalty that were seeking “so many roadblocks that it’s never going to be implemented.”
“Other states have been able to untie those kinds of situations,” he said. “And it’s our belief that these measures should help us move forward in those cases where folks have exhausted all their appeals, and judgment has been rendered.”

Rep. Sarah Stevens (R-Surry) defended the capital punishment process during debate Tuesday, saying those on death row “are getting a fair trial because they have experts in the death penalty” — referring to capital defenders.
Berger’s changes came as a surprise to Democrats. Several had planned to support the bill, but said they couldn’t vote for it as amended.
“The General Assembly should not be using the death of this young lady to sanction state-sponsored murder of individuals who are on death row,” said Sen. Mujtaba Mohammed (D-Mecklenburg), who has met with Zarutska’s family.
When the bill came up for a final vote on Monday night, a group of Senate Democrats walked out of the chamber.
“Until they decide to stop being petulant children, we don’t have to continue to participate in their nonsense,” said Batch, the Democratic leader.

The changes saw similar blowback across the building, where House Democratic Leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) called the final product “cynical” and “mean.”
“The battle may be done, the war isn’t,” Reives said. “But I really, really wish we had done this different.”
Violent crime rates have decreased
Available data shows that violent crime rates have decreased, both in North Carolina and nationally, over recent years.
The rate of violent incidents in North Carolina dropped 1% from 2019 to 2024, according to the Council of State Governments Justice Center’s analysis of FBI data.
That’s one of 39 states in which violent crime decreased during that period; 11 other states saw violent crime increase.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-23 22:05:49+00:00,Mississippi Today,Federal hazing lawsuit filed against University of Southern Mississippi and fraternity,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/23/federal-hazing-lawsuit-filed-against-usm-and-fraternity/,Rafeal Joseph filed a federal lawsuit that alleges he suffered serious injuries during hazing by the Omega Psi Phi chapter at USM.,"The University of Southern Mississippi and Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc. are facing a federal lawsuit from a student who was hospitalized after a hazing incident that resulted in  surgery and a blood transfusion. 
Rafeal Joseph filed a complaint Monday in federal court in Hattiesburg against the university; Valencia Walls, associate director of USM’s Office of Fraternity and Sorority life; Omega Psi Phi, a national Black fraternity organization; Nu Eta, USM chapter of the fraternity; and multiple other people. 
According to the lawsuit, the abuse began in December 2022 when Joseph and other fraternity pledges for the Nu Eta chapter met in the library to have a “haze talk.” Members told pledges they would take their money and food and deprive them of sleep, and that the members would use intimidation and threaten pledges with physical abuse and beatings with a 2×4 plank of wood cut into the shape of a paddle, the lawsuit says. 
The culmination of the hazing occurred in April 2023 during the fraternity’s “Hell Night,” a ritual where members beat Joseph and pledges severely with a wooden paddle, the lawsuit alleges. Joseph was sent to the emergency room, spent nearly 11 days in the hospital and had to relearn how to walk, the suit says. 
University officials were made aware of the abuse and did nothing to help Joseph or discipline his abusers, according to the lawsuit. 
The University of Southern Mississippi and Omega Psi Phi did not respond to Mississippi Today’s request for comment by press time Tuesday. 
“We see violent incidents like these time and again across the nation but, instead of taking action, fraternity leaders and university officials alike sweep it under the rug and write it off as ‘boys will be boys,’” Bakari Sellers, a civil rights attorney at Strom Law Firm, who is representing Joseph, said in a press statement. “This isn’t youthful indiscretion. This isn’t tradition and it sure isn’t brotherhood. It’s criminal violence and abuse and it needs to end.” 
The lawsuit also alleges that in fall 2022, a student who pledged Nu Eta, months prior to Joseph also suffered hazing injuries, including a torn ligament in his knee. It required the student to use crutches to participate in the fraternity’s probate ceremony. USM did not investigate hazing-related injuries suffered by this student or take action against the fraternity, according to the lawsuit. 
“If someone struck a stranger with a 2×4, they’d face criminal charges,” Shequeena McKenzie, an attorney in Jackson who is also representing Joseph, said in a press statement. “USM’s response suggests that the same conduct inside a fraternity is somehow acceptable.”
Joseph is seeking compensation to cover medical bills, loss of income and attorney fees. He is also seeking a court order to stop defendants from continuing alleged behavior while leaving room for other remedies to be granted during a jury trial. 
It is another instance in a high-profile hazing case against Omega Psi Phi. Earlier this year, Caleb Wilson, a Southern University student in Louisiana, died in an off-campus hazing incident involving the Beta Sigma chapter of the fraternity. Three members of the organization were later expelled from the fraternity and charged with crimes related to Wilson’s death.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/23165331/AP17110673074171.jpg,,,2025-09-23 18:58:27.544124

(Sam Bailey/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Snap Inc., the parent company of social media platform Snapchat, accusing the app’s creators of harming teenagers.
He said the company designed the social media platform “with manipulative features that prey on the mental health of our children.” He said Snapchat has been marketed as safe for teens.
“We allege it is not,” Kobach said.
He added: “They have prioritized profit over safety, and our lawsuit holds them accountable for the devastating harm caused to Kansas families.”
The 40-page lawsuit, filed in Washington County on Kansas’ northern border, contains redactions and compiles information from internal Snap reports, news interviews and content from the app to build its case.
It alleges Snap violated the Kansas Consumer Protection Act. Those violations are based on the app’s age rating in app stores, around 12 years old and up, and app store disclaimers citing infrequent or mild profanity, mature and suggestive themes, sexual content, nudity and substance use or references.
“In reality, content in all of those categories appears frequently and is intense on Snapchat,” the lawsuit reads.
The lawsuit references the death of a teenage boy from Shawnee, who died in 2021of fentanyl poisoning after reportedly purchasing from a drug dealer on Snapchat.
“Numerous young people, including young people in Washington County, Kansas, have been exposed to drug dealers on Snapchat offering illicit or regulated drugs for sale,” the lawsuit said. “Such content on Snapchat includes posts featuring lists of drugs and prices.”
That was the only mention of Washington County residents, of whom there are around 5,500, in the lawsuit. 
A Snap spokesperson said in a statement that the safety of users is a top priority. The company didn’t directly address the lawsuit but said it has incorporated privacy and safety features into the app since its inception.
“Unfortunately, the reality is this — there is no single safety feature or policy that can eliminate every potential threat online or in the world around us,” the statement said. “This is why we continually adapt our strategies to fight against bad actors, who change their tactics to exploit online platforms for their nefarious ends, and this will remain a crucial part of our efforts to help keep Snapchatters safe.”
For the past three years, the company has commissioned research into the experiences of Gen Z teens and young adults from six countries, including the United States, on online platforms.
The 2024 surveys asked more than 9,000 people — around 3,000 teens, 3,000 young adults ages 18-24 and 3,000 parents of teenage children — about online risks, digital wellbeing, defense against online threats and sextortion.
The survey found that online risk was at a three-year high for Gen Z users in 2024. Misinformation, hate speech and bullying, sexual risks, threats of violence, impersonation, extremist content and self-harm were all perceived as more prevalent than in previous years.
Of the Gen Z teens and young adults surveyed, 80% reported experiencing some online risk, a two percentage point increase from 2023. Forty-seven percent of Gen Z respondents said they had some interaction with intimate or sexual imagery.
Of those, 39% received such imagery, 35% were asked for imagery of themselves and 17% shared or distributed content depicting someone else.
Joseph Sciarrotta, the attorney general’s chief deputy who was hired last month, said the office investigated Snap, finding its features “are intentionally designed to exploit the vulnerabilities of young minds.”
“From Snapstreaks that create immense social pressure to an infinite scroll that eliminates natural stopping points, the platform is a digital trap for children,” Sciarrotta said. “This action alleges that the company made deceptive and misleading claims about safety and parental controls that have contributed to an unacceptable mental health crisis among our youth.”
The lawsuit asks for a judge to find Snap in violation of state law, prohibit the company from continuing the violations and force Snap to pay fines, fees and court costs. The attorney general’s office enlisted Washington, D.C.-based firm Cooper and Kirk to help argue its case.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Kobach-9-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-23 17:57:59.866609

Research reveals that animals that summer on ranchland and in residential subdivisions near town pile up on the National Elk Refuge's southern end — a trait that will help wildlife managers steer hunters toward the problematic cohort.   
The post ‘Judas elk’ to help target Jackson Hole ‘suburban elk,’ easing pressure on Yellowstone migrants appeared first[...]","In the coming months, thousands of elk will migrate onto the National Elk Refuge, just outside the town of Jackson, where the Jackson Elk Herd winters. 
Historically, they’ve traveled long distances from summer range in places like southern Yellowstone National Park, but so-called “suburban elk” that stick nearer to Jackson to feed off hayfields and in residential subdivisions are increasing. It’s a headache for ranchers and wildlife managers that also reduces hunting opportunities and threatens the herd’s natural biodiversity. To best conserve long-range migration, wildlife managers would ideally concentrate hunting pressure on the refuge on the “suburban elk” — a task that has been nearly impossible until now.
“When they’re on the refuge and there’s thousands of elk milling around, you can’t tell just by looking at them whether they migrated eight kilometers or 80 kilometers,” said Gavin Cotterill, a quantitative disease ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. 
New research Cotterill headed changes the equation. 
“Based on this work,” he said, “we can predict where conflict-prone suburban elk [that get into livestock feed] are going to be.” 
Cotterill’s study, “Elk personality and anthropogenic food subsidy: Managing conflict and migration loss,” assists wildlife managers with tools to decipher which of the 10,000 elk in the herd are migrating from where. Specifically, the research could help concentrate hunting pressure on the lowland elk that summer on ranchland and amid the trophy homes of the wealthiest Americans once they reach the National Elk Refuge. Doing so could help efforts to preserve struggling migratory elk that now take the brunt of the gunfire. 

Migrating animals in the Jackson Elk Herd travel an average one-way distance of 39 miles, with journeys topping out at 168 miles. The routes are delineated in this map from the U.S. Geological Survey’s Ungulate Migrations of the Western United States, Volume 1. (USGS)
How does it work? With location data from 101 GPS-collared female elk, Cotterill used modeling to discover that the conflict-prone elk that generally live south of Grand Teton National Park were four times more likely to use the southernmost feeding areas on the refuge nearer to the town of Jackson. 
“The single strongest predictor of which feeding area they’re going to use was whether they ate livestock feed in suburban areas,” Cotterill said. 
That’s a finding the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has a keen interest in, and it has potential to help reverse an undesirable trend that’s long been afoot in the Jackson Elk Herd. Historically, virtually all animals that winter on the National Elk Refuge were considered “long-distance migrants” that spent summer in places like Yellowstone National Park, the Teton Wilderness, the Gros Ventre drainage and northern Grand Teton National Park. By 2012, however, the proportion was less than 60% — and the suburban elk are potentially still in the process of taking over.
“We may actually be seeing a slight increase in those short-distance migrants,” Game and Fish Disease Biologist Ben Wise said.

The growing imbalance, he said, is related to big differences in reproductive success and calf survival. Lowland elk that live in housing subdivisions and on ranches are adding 40 or 50 calves to their ranks for every 100 cows, but the calf ratio is only about 20 per 100 for migrating elk. 
Wise, who’s a co-author of the study, explained that come fall of 2026, the bolder elk that dwell in the refuge’s southernmost feeding areas will have more of a target on their back. And it’ll be because of their own kind. He’s using the term “Judas elk” to describe GPS-collared animals that will assist Game and Fish in pointing hunters toward the problematic suburban elk. The tracked animals, in essence, will be attracting a source of danger — human hunters — to their herdmates. 
“It’s something that’s really kind of novel for this area,” Wise said. “We have so many different elk coming from so many different summer ranges into this winter range [on the refuge]. And we’re definitely trying to manage for certain segments and bolster those populations where we can, while still getting harvest on the segments that we don’t have a lot of access to anywhere else.” 
Easing hunting pressure on the long-distance migratory elk has historically proven a great challenge because the herds cut through other late-season hunt areas, like Grand Teton National Park. Then they’re the first to arrive at the federal wildlife refuge, where hunters are waiting for them.   
Jackson Hole’s pesky suburban elk, meanwhile, spend most of the fall in a much trickier landscape where they’re hard to hunt. Then they’re typically the last cohort to show up on the refuge.

The “Judas elk” will help wildlife managers point hunters toward the so-called suburban elk when they do arrive. 
“When they cross the line, how do we get hunters to go out there?” Wise said. 
The elk will be tracked this winter as part of a broader effort to equip 150 members of the Jackson Elk Herd with GPS collars. They’ll be programmed to transmit “finite, fine-scale information” about their location several times a day from November through early January, Wise said.  
In wildlife management, the concept of a “Judas” animal — a nod to the Christian Bible’s apostle who betrayed Jesus— is well established. “Judas wolves” were used during the mid-1990s to capture packmates of Canadian wolves reintroduced into the Northern Rockies, and “Judas lake trout” have also been used to map out the nonnative species’ spawning beds in Yellowstone Lake with the intent of choking out the next generation before it begins. 
Using “Judas elk” to help hunters go after Jackson Hole’s conflict-prone suburban elk comes after years of effort to rebalance the herd by conserving the long-distance migrants.
“Elk are pretty, pretty savvy to anything that we’ve done,” Wise said. “How do we outsmart this herd of elk for more than just one year?”
Cotterill’s study also reflected on the complex task of conserving the Jackson Elk Herd’s migrations. Movement corridors in Jackson Hole cut through protected landscapes like the Bridger-Teton National Forest and are “pretty well preserved” as open spaces, he said. 
“What we’re saying is that might not be enough,” Cotterill said. 
Adaptable species like elk readily capitalize on human-related food sources, like hay meant for cattle. They also take “anthropogenic refuge” from predation, and have less risk of being eaten by grizzly bears or wolves in the suburbs than they do in wilder places. 
“That’s working against long-distance migration,” Cotterill said, “in the favor of these short-distance migrants.”
Cotterill’s study was supported by the USGS’ Ecosystems Mission Area. It’s a division of the federal agency that the Trump administration is seeking to almost completely eliminate.

St. Louis County Councilwoman Lisa Clancy, the bill sponsor, dropped the bill during the council’s Tuesday meeting. 
“After engaging with stakeholders and hearing a lot of thoughtful discussion between stakeholders and also the council, I have come to the conclusion that there is not a pathway at this time or a consensus to move forward on this,” Clancy said during the meeting.
Clancy said she’s hopeful state legislators will address the “very serious public health and safety issues” when they reconvene in January. 
State law prohibits marijuana products from being sold outside of dispensaries. 
However, thousands of gas stations and other stores statewide currently sell THC products – such as gummies, beverages and vapes – that get people high the same way that marijuana does. 
The difference, producers say, is that the products are made from hemp. Lab and cannabis experts testified last week before the council that there’s no way to ensure these products aren’t made from black-market marijuana without a track-and-track system like the one that’s required for regulated marijuana. 
While some liquor stores – including Total Wine – have self-imposed age restrictions on purchasing the beverages, there’s no government agency regulating the products – and that includes who can buy them. 
For the past three years, Missouri lawmakers have debated legislation that would put all THC products under the same regulatory framework as marijuana. The proposals were met by fierce opposition, particularly from associations representing convenience stores, hemp companies and veterans.
This past spring, Republican state Sen. Nick Schroer of Defiance offered a proposal that carved out an exception for low-dose THC beverages, which have been sold in Missouri’s bars and liquor stores for seven years. It still required things like high-dose gummies, THCA flower and vapes to only be sold in marijuana dispensaries. 
Schroer’s bill was filibustered by state Sen. Karla May and other St. Louis Democratic senators, who argued that it would create a monopoly for the marijuana industry and harm small businesses.
Hemp naturally has very little THC, the intoxicating component mostly associated with marijuana. But that potency can be increased with some science.
While marijuana, from seed to final product, is governed by a state regulatory regime, intoxicating hemp products have been completely unregulated by any governmental agency since 2018 — when Congress passed a Farm Bill that legalized hemp. 
If enacted, Clancy’s bill would’ve effectively banned those products in Missouri’s largest county. 
Clancy dropped the bill just before another council member was going to offer a substitute draft.
Earlier in the day, the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association urged Clancy and other council members to drop the bill. 
“We appreciate the efforts of local elected officials in St. Louis County to prevent more area kids from buying and using these unregulated products,”  said Andrew Mullins, executive director of MoCannTrade, “but it is becoming clearer that it’s Missouri state government that needs to lead the way on this public safety issue.” 
Mullins asked the council to withdraw the measure and join the association in Jefferson City to lobby for regulations.
“While a patchwork of regulations and bans across Missouri’s 114 counties is certainly better than the current wild west reality,” he said, “it wouldn’t give parents, teachers and law enforcement the peace of mind they need to hold the bad actors selling and making these products accountable.”
Clancy said if the state fails to take action again next year, then the council “may re-evaluate and reconsider.”
“I’m hopeful that the state will pick this up and their session this coming winter,” she said. “I think all of us on the council will be watching it carefully.”

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)State utility regulators split Tuesday in Pierre over whether a proposed 120-megawatt energy storage facility in northeast South Dakota needs a state permit, ultimately voting 2-1 to deny a developer’s request for an exemption.
Crowned Ridge Energy Storage petitioned the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission in August for a declaratory ruling that the project does not meet the legal definition of a facility subject to state permitting. The project is designed to store excess electricity from the electrical grid and from Crowned Ridge Wind’s turbines in the Watertown area. It would store enough electricity to power tens of thousands of homes. 
Crowned Ridge is an affiliate of Florida-headquartered NextEra Energy Resources.
Commissioner Chris Nelson moved to grant the company’s petition. He said regulating large-scale batteries would exceed the commission’s legal authority. 
“Batteries don’t generate electricity,” Nelson said. “Secondly, if the Legislature had intended for these to be cited, they need to flat out say so, and not make us try to be electrochemical analysts to figure out whether it should or shouldn’t be.” 
The energy storage facility, planned for commercial operation in December 2027, would be among the first large-scale energy storage projects in the state. Documents in the commission docket say the project would consist of rows of large lithium-ion batteries housed in white, semi-trailer-sized containers on about 15 acres.

Mike Nadolski, a lawyer for the company, said the battery system does not generate new electricity and therefore falls outside the commission’s authority. He said the project simply stores and later injects that energy back into the power grid.
The state’s three elected commissioners are assisted by staff. Staff attorney Amanda Reiss said their review centered on whether discharging stored power back into the grid could legally be considered “generation.” Staff wrote in their review that the project could qualify as an energy conversion facility, which would require a permit. Staff left the question to commissioners after noting the laws were open to interpretation.
Commissioner Kristie Fiegen offered a substitute motion to deny the company’s petition and make it seek a permit.
“Yes, energy is stored chemically, but when it comes out, electricity is generated,” Fiegen said. “I’d rather err on the side of customer protection.”
Chairman Gary Hanson joined Fiegen, calling the matter “the beginning of a new era in electricity in South Dakota.” He said large-scale energy storage could reshape the grid and deserves regulation.
The 2-1 vote means Crowned Ridge must pursue a state permit; however, commissioners said the Legislature could still clarify how battery storage projects should be treated under South Dakota law. The Legislature will begin its annual lawmaking session in January.

(Photo by Brian Bahr/Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma State University owes its long-time football coach as much as $15 million after cutting ties with him, according to his renegotiated contract.
OSU Athletic Director Chad Weiberg said when he met with Mike Gundy on Tuesday to end his employment, the two did not discuss lowering the $15 million buyout that Gundy is guaranteed if he’s terminated without just cause. 
The funds for the buyout will come from the general revenue or operating budget, and OSU plans to honor its contractual obligations to Gundy, he said. 
Gundy is departing the state’s largest university system in the middle of his 21st season and amid a poor record in recent years. OSU has lost 11 of its last 12 games, including most recently to the University of Tulsa. This marks the first OSU loss to the team since 1998. 
Weiberg said in a statement that the football program experienced “unprecedented” success under Gundy’s leadership, but the college football landscape has “drastically” changed in recent years. 
“This was not something that I thought we would be doing today on this Tuesday,” Weiberg said at a press conference. “I fully expected to beat the University of Tulsa. I expected the results of this season to be different than they’ve been so far. … We have higher expectations than that. So when it just appeared that that was not going to be met, it felt like for the good of the program.” 
Gundy was being paid over $6.8 million, a $1 million cut from previous years after his contract was renegotiated in December, according to reporting from The Oklahoman. 
He signed a restructured contract in December that makes him eligible for the $15 million buyout should he be terminated in the first three years, according to a copy of his contract obtained by Oklahoma Voice. The new contract was negotiated amid a 3-9 losing season and inflammatory remarks from the coach calling some OSU fans “failures.” 
Gundy’s renegotiated contract obligates OSU to pay him in monthly installments for “liquidated damages,” according to his contract. If he were fired in 2028, the number would have dropped to $10 million. 
Just causes, as defined in the contract, include insubordination, violation of athletic rules, criminal convictions, conduct affecting the athletic department, improper personal conduct and dishonesty, among other things. 
Weiberg said he and OSU President Jim Hess are in “lock step” with this decision. 
“This is a decision about what’s best for our football program, our student-athletes and Oklahoma State University and it reflects our unwavering commitment to championship-level football and competing for national success,” Hess said in a statement. 
OSU’s offensive coordinator Doug Meacham was named interim head coach while OSU conducts a search for a permanent replacement.

WEST RUTLAND — After stepping into his new role of executive director at West Rutland’s Carving Studio & Sculpture Center, Noel Sinozich is shaping the start of the organization next chapter with the unveiling of two new pavilions.
Following the retirement of longtime studio director Carol Driscoll, Sinozich stepped into the role earlier this summer and is taking on the responsibility of honoring the foundation Driscoll laid for the future.
With a long-time background in finance, working for companies such as Boston Globe Media and its umbrella companies as a business and financial analyst, Sinozich brings strong organizational management skills to the studio.
Sinozich’s arrival brings the organization more than just a new executive director, as the studio also welcomes new Board of Trustees President Jeff Yates and Vice President Marianne Klimchuk.
“We have a new director, we have a new president and vice president of the board. It’s a really fun reset moment. It’s really exciting that you come into this place that has all this history, and even now you’ll see alumni who have been coming here for 20 years,” Sinozich said.
One of Sinozich’s and the board’s goals for their new initiatives at the studio is to strengthen community outreach and connect with the surrounding neighborhoods more.
Two projects that already achieve this are the Downtown Rutland Sculpture Trail, featuring multiple artists creating marble monuments for notable Rutland figures; and the Stone Bench Project, bringing together local teens to work with limestone to create benches for neighboring towns.
“The board brought me on to grow the offerings of the studio. They want to do more for the local community of Rutland and West Rutland, neighboring Castleton, all the other towns as well. Do more stone programs, do more metal programs, bring in new mediums, get new equipment — you know, just be able for the studio to really kind of put itself in a place where it is at the forefront of, if you want to learn a really high barrier to entry form of sculpture, this is where you come,” Sinozich said.

Sinozich explained he sees these programs as just the beginning of wider efforts to engage the local community and make the studio a resource for people across Rutland County.
“I think our biggest thing is we want to make sure that people in this community, in West Rutland, know that this is a resource for them, too,” Yates said. “If we can reach out to the community, that’s what I would want to do. I feel like they’re right down there. I want to bring them up here. When I say to people, ‘Oh, I’m the president of a carving studio,’ and they go, ‘There’s a carving studio?’ And I go, ‘Yes! You should look it up, you should come here.’”
Yates and Sinozich are not the only two passionate about being a larger resource for the surrounding community.
“We feel like we’re an underutilized asset for the community, said longtime Board Member Carolyn Enz Hack. “We hope to see more people who live in the area come and visit us, come to our parties, come to walk in the sculpture garden.”
Other plans now in place since Sinozich has taken control of the studio include more winter programs and preparing the studio for working during the colder months.
“The key thing for me right now is to provide more programming year-round. Right now, a lot of the programming is really clustered from June to September. We have some programming before that in May, and after that in October, but I’ve been working on making sure that the insulation and heating systems are in place, and all that, so we can do some stuff in the winter,” Sinozich said.
Sinozich also discussed doing more partnerships with universities’ sculpture programs, both locally and nationally, to focus on stone. Stone is often hard for universities to let their students work on due to its weight, and many programs don’t have access to it. Sinozich said he is already in talks with professors to reach this goal.
In a symbolic passing of the torch, the studio unveiled two new 800-square-foot timber-framed pavilions last Friday. Originally planned and mostly constructed under Driscoll’s direction, Sinozich saw the pavilions to completion.
“We used to always be underneath these little plastic tents. They leak, they really don’t keep you cool in the summer. As the sun came in, you tried to hide somewhere in the shade. Everybody tries to get to one side because the sun slants in one way,” Yates said.
In addition to shielding artists from outdoor conditions, the new pavilions are also equipped fully for convenience.

“Stone carvers use a lot of power, so each of the posts of the pavilions has its own dedicated circuit and air, and each of the pavilions has an underground air feed that powers their pneumatic tools, air chisels, and just makes the work so much faster. Being able to get everybody the right amount of air and power in a place that’s right by their workspace, so they’re not tripping on hoses and stuff like that, provides not only just a more pleasant experience, but a safer one,” Sinozich said.
The second pavilion, placed behind the studio, is geared toward the welding and metal workshop. Those outlets allow for more heavy-duty metal wielding and power tool usage. This allows for a seamless environment for students and teachers during programs and classes.
“People come here, and then they really just love the community. I mean, really come back for the community as much as the classes, but that really helps, you know, if you can get more people at a time, because we’ll run courses with whatever number,” Driscoll said.
With new programs and ideas on the horizon, and new leadership with Sinozich, the studio is hoping to continue gathering the community together and serving as a hub for aspiring and longtime artists. Trustee Klimchuk said she is looking forward to Sinozich’s approach and attitude for the future.
“He’s a visionary, he’s got great finance skills. He sees the great potential of this organization that we’ve all seen. He can really take it to the next level. He’s got such a can-do attitude,” Klimchuk said.
Klimchuk’s optimism in Sinozich’s leadership reflects the feeling throughout the entire studio, from staff to board members, that the studio is set on a good path for their future endeavors.
“We’re really excited about what the future brings, and broadly speaking, it’s just the kind of energy that begets energy. It’s an exciting time,” Sinozich said.

June 30, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers filed a lawsuit against Lorex Corp. for what he claims is deceptive marketing that put Nebraska consumers at risk.
Lorex was previously owned by Dahua, a Chinese manufacturer of surveillance equipment that was blacklisted by the U.S. government due to its involvement in surveillance and oppression of ethnic minorities in China, according to a press release from the Attorney General’s Office.
In 2022, the Federal Communications Commission severely limited imports of Dahua products due to “national security concerns.” Before the FCC issued its order, Dahua sold Lorex to Skywatch, a Taiwanese holding company.

Despite the sale, Lorex continues to use Dahua to source the components of its cameras and other surveillance equipment and its networks and systems are still associated with Dahua, Hilgers claimed. He said the companies are separated “in name only.”
“You can sort of change the lipstick on the pig, but it’s still a pig,” Hilgers said.
Lorex products are sold in various Nebraska retailers, including Costco and Home Depot, Hilgers said.
Hilgers alleged Lorex cameras, through its association to Dahua, have serious security flaws that allow hackers, including those affiliated with the Chinese government, to access video and audio feeds and archives. Lorex has continued to assure consumers that its cameras were “safe and secure.” But Hilgers and others have urged caution about their placement in private areas of the home, like a child’s bedroom.

“These are cameras that are being placed in people’s nurseries,” Hilgers said.
Hilgers said he has no evidence that any Nebraskans have been hacked through Lorex products. The lawsuit is more focused on Lorex misrepresenting their products as safe and separate from Dahua, he said.
Hilgers argued Lorex’s ongoing relationship with Dahua was wholly inconsistent with a “commitment” to “integrity, privacy and security.”
It’s a similar angle to other lawsuits the AG’s Office has filed against Chinese-affiliated companies like Temu and TikTok. In both cases, Hilgers argued each company was misrepresenting services provided in a way that posed a risk to Nebraskans’ security.
“We think we’ve been a national leader on fighting back against consumer products that have Chinese Communist Party ties,” Hilgers said.
The lawsuit seeks to prevent Lorex from misleading consumers and raise awareness of privacy risks that Lorex cameras pose, the AG’s Office said in the release. Hilgers said the goal is to push the company to be more honest about product risks.
The lawsuit filed by the Attorney General’s Office seeks civil penalties and fees from Lorex for their violations of Nebraska’s Consumer Protection Act and Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, among other relief.
“Either be honest, or don’t sell,” Hilgers said.

Shigley, the lone Democrat in the race, won 40% of the vote last month in the first round of voting. Dickerson won 17.4% of the vote. A candidate must claim 50% of the vote to win in Georgia.
The race has since gone from a seven-way contest to a head-to-head matchup.
The special election was called after former state Sen. Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican and staunch ally of President Donald Trump, was appointed to serve as U.S. treasurer.
The district, which includes north Fulton and Cherokee counties, reelected Beach with 70% of the vote just last year. That’s why Shigley’s 40% vote tally – which was 10 percentage points better than Beach’s Democratic opponent did less than a year ago – turned heads.

A special Chittenden County program that convenes addiction recovery resources in family court will shutter at the end of the year due to a lack of federal funding. 
Vermont Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Reiber announced the family treatment docket’s end in a Sept. 10 letter.
In 2018, spurred by the state Supreme Court, the Vermont Judicial Commission on Family Treatment Dockets began studying ways for the legal system to address the burgeoning opioid epidemic and its impact on children. At the time, abuse and neglect cases in family court were skyrocketing, up 68% between fiscal years 2013 and 2018, according to the commission’s report.

The commission’s work helped launch the Chittenden County family treatment docket in 2021, the only program of its kind in Vermont currently, though the model is used across the country. Other special treatment dockets exist in Chittenden, Rutland, Washington and Windsor counties, according to the state judiciary’s website, but those programs aren’t operated within family court and tend to involve people who have already pleaded guilty to certain crimes. 
The family treatment docket seeks to steer eligible family court cases toward treatment and services. Parents in the program have often, through legal intervention, lost full custody of their children. In order for a case to be referred to the program, all parties need to agree that the goal would be to reunify the parent with their children if not for substance use standing in the way. 
The docket’s mission is to “improve the safety and well-being of children who have experienced abuse, neglect, or have been placed at risk of harm due to a caregiver with a substance use disorder,” according to Reiber’s letter. Toward that end, the special docket helps lead participants to substance use and mental health treatment, housing assistance and parenting coaching. 
The program is funded solely through a three-year grant from the U.S. Department of Justice, according to the letter, a source the court expects will dry up by the end of the year. Vermont received a nearly $900,000 grant to fund the docket, which had annual operating costs around $300,000, according to Teri Corsones, Vermont’s state court administrator, who added that one court position hired specifically for the program would end.
“Under past experience we anticipated that DOJ would have issued a new round of solicitations for federal funding by now, but to date there has not been one,” Reiber wrote. 
“We want to be clear: the decision to suspend the program if there is no funding is not a reflection of the program’s value or effectiveness,” he wrote. “It is a reflection of the financial reality we face.” 
The docket has seen relatively sparse use — there are currently six participants, according to Corsones. As of April, 33 parents had participated in the docket, incorporating a total of 55 children, since its creation, according to a report conducted by the public policy organization Children and Family Futures. 
The report noted that children who reunified with their parents after their parents’ participation in the program spent less time in out-of-home settings than children who were ultimately adopted and not reunified with their parents. As of April, just more than 20% of participants successfully graduated from the docket, and 30% remained active participants, according to the report’s findings, while just under 49% of parents did not complete the program. 
The Chittenden County State’s Attorney’s Office is “devastated” that the docket is ending, Sarah George, the county’s top prosecutor, wrote in an email. 
William Gardella, a Chittenden County deputy state’s attorney who primarily handles the county’s child-in-need-of-supervision cases, or CHINS, said the family treatment docket empowered the court to do something rare.
“The court is actually trying to solve a problem and repair a relationship,” he said.
Rather than ordering treatment, which might occur in a regular family court case, the family treatment court brings peer advocates into the process from the addiction recovery nonprofit Turning Point Center of Chittenden County and staff from the Howard Center, a social services organization. 
“All the service providers that DCF wants you to work with, they’re bringing them to you,” Gardella said, explaining how the docket cut through road blocks to accessing treatment.
Gardella said the program has been operating at full capacity over the last year or so. Participants, service providers and court officials meet regularly — weekly, every other week or monthly depending on the case, according to Gardella. Peer support is central to the process as well. 
“We’ve heard about hiking groups starting out of this program,” he said, “ongoing connections that people were going to build to look out for people in the community.”

“Today, we are ready to take the next step to make sure the Charleston facility becomes a crucial part of our growth strategy,” Hakan Samuelsson, Volvo’s chief executive, said during an event at the plant off Interstate 26.

Volvo will continue making the all-electric EX90 SUV at the $1.3 billion factory but will shift much of its focus toward building models that more Americans want to drive.
That includes the XC60 sport utility vehicle, which Volvo previously said it will add to the production line by late next year. More than 27,000 of those vehicles have sold in the U.S. so far this year – a 20% jump from 2024 – while just 2,500 EX90s have sold.
Volvo also said it will add a new hybrid model to the Lowcountry production line by the end of this decade. The new hybrid vehicle is reported to be the next-generation XC90 SUV, but Volvo would not confirm that Tuesday.
“We do see that the XC90, the size and type of that vehicle, is an extremely important product for this market,” said Erik Severinson, chief commercial officer. “It’s also the segment where we see the demand for plug-in hybrid or extended-range technology is the biggest. So, for us, it’s a very natural size of product to think about.”
Finding a way to juice production at the Ridgeville site is taking on greater urgency as tariffs make Volvo’s most popular cars — currently built overseas — more expensive for U.S. buyers. The plant opened in September 2018 with the S60 sedan as its only vehicle, but the model never caught on with U.S. buyers and was discontinued in 2024.
“Today, Charleston produces less than 5% of U.S. sales volumes,” said Francesca Gamboni, Volvo’s chief industrial operations officer. The remaining 95% of Volvos sold in the U.S. — including the automaker’s popular SUVs — are built overseas.

“In five years, our aim is to produce more than 50% of the U.S. volume right here in this facility,” Gamboni said.
She added that the automaker will hire more local suppliers and invest in state-of-the-art manufacturing, such as artificial intelligence, to speed up the transformation.
“We are on an aggressive timeline to bring these new cars to Charleston — as quick as possible,” she said.
Volvo’s South Carolina factory can build as many as 150,000 vehicles per year, but it has been operating at only about 20% capacity to date. The automaker said it plans to move closer to full production while also building the Polestar 3 SUV for its sister brand.
“The Charleston plant is foundational to our strategic growth plan for the U.S.,” Luis Reende, Volvo’s president of the Americas, said in a written statement. “By adding another model into production here, we’ll take a big step toward realizing the full potential of our local manufacturing investments and workforce, and accelerate progress toward our ambitious commercial targets in the coming years.”

The Lowcountry plant currently employs about 2,000 people and has invested $1.3 billion over the last 10 years.
Volvo must have a workforce of at least 3,910 by the end of 2027 to comply with its contract with the state, which pledged more than $200 million in tax breaks and other incentives to lure the automaker a decade ago. Volvo officials say they’re confident the plant will hit its employment goals.
“Volvo Cars’ decision to further invest in Ridgeville reinforces South Carolina’s position as a national leader in automotive manufacturing,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a written statement.
The automotive industry, led by BMW’s massive Upstate facility, employs more than 75,000 people statewide and accounts for more than $27 billion a year in economic impact, according to the S.C. Commerce Department.
Volvo, which is based in Sweden but majority owned by China’s Geely Holding Group, sold more than 763,000 vehicles globally in 2024. The automaker reported a record $2.9 billion in core operating profit last year on revenues of nearly $43 billion.
Volvo was founded in 1927 and has been sold in the U.S. market for 70 years. The company recently sold its 5 millionth Volvo to a U.S. customer.

The Utah Division of Outdoor Recreation issued a news release on Tuesday announcing a community survey to “help shape the future of outdoor recreation” in the state’s central region, which includes the rural areas of Juab, Millard, Sanpete, Sevier, Piute and Wayne counties. The area is rich with state and national parks, lakes, rivers, and hundreds of miles of motorized and non-motorized trails. 
The survey is part of the state’s first-ever regional recreation planning effort, with state leaders welcoming community input to guide future investments in trails, parks, open space and recreation facilities across the region. 
“From red rock canyons to alpine forests, the region offers a diverse range of outdoor experiences, and this planning process aims to ensure that these opportunities continue to grow and improve in ways that meet community needs,” the division said.

The central region “long-range recreation plan” will help guide infrastructure and restoration investments through the division’s “outdoor recreation initiative,” which aims to leverage city, state, federal and private dollars to create a “lasting legacy of well-preserved public recreation opportunities,” according to the initiative’s mission listed on the state’s website. 
“Our goal is to provide a variety of recreational experiences that strengthen local communities and foster a deep connection between people and the great outdoors,” the initiative’s mission statement says. 
Jason Curry, director of the Utah Division of Outdoor Recreation, said state leaders want to “grow outdoor recreation the right way, by expanding access while caring for the places that make Central Utah special.” 
“If you hike, ride, paddle or simply enjoy time outside,” Curry said, “this quick survey is your chance to tell us what’s working, what’s missing and where to invest so we can deliver trails, parks and safe access that serve families, visitors and communities for years to come.”
The survey will be open through Oct. 20, available in both English and Spanish. It asks respondents about their primary outdoor recreation activities in Central Utah, challenges they’ve experienced and ideas for improvement. 
“Feedback will directly inform the Central Region Recreation Plan, which will set a vision for the region and direct state investment for years to come,” the division said.

The suit in U.S. District Court in Orlando named Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, the Republican National Committee, Republican Party of Florida, and supervisors of elections in Broward, Miami-Dade, Duval, and Orange counties.
Florida Rising Together filed its complaint a year ago claiming that the “matching protocol” — requiring voters to include the last four digits of their drivers’ licenses or Social Security numbers to register to vote — “is compounded by a legacy of historic and deliberate disenfranchisement and interacts with the effects of racial and economic discrimination in access to the ballot that continue to plague Florida.”
Tuesday, Secretary of State Cord Byrd celebrated U.S. District Judge Wendy Berger’s dismissal.

— Cord Byrd (@CordByrd) September 23, 2025

Florida Rising, a voting-rights organization, alleged disenfranchising administrative policies used by the state, saying that since 2018 more than 43,000 people eligible to vote had been denied due to the matching protocol, and communities of color have been disproportionately affected. 
Florida Rising is free to refile an amended complaint by Oct. 6.
Under the 2002 federal Help America Vote Act, voter registration applications are only accepted after the Department of State verifies the applicants’ identities through Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles or Social Security Administration databases.
If the numbers don’t match, voters may fix them or cast a provisional ballot. The voter then has until two days after the election to verify identity. 
That protocol is laid out in statute, and defined in more detail by administrative code. Florida Rising was challenging the matching protocol as it was established through administrative policy, calling it error-prone and that it disenfranchises eligible Florida citizens, especially minorities.
Not enough plaintiffs
“At the very least, Florida Rising’s failure to meaningfully allege or argue a factual or legal distinction between the requirements of HAVA, section 97.053, and the Administrative Policy, raises serious standing concerns. Nonetheless, because the Complaint will be dismissed on other grounds, the Court need not address standing at this juncture,” Berger wrote. 
The court said the group hadn’t named all of the state’s elections supervisors as plaintiffs.
“Indeed, the challenged protocol is a state mandate, which obligates all Florida Supervisors of Elections to execute portions of the Matching Protocol. Thus, the sixty-three non-party Supervisors’ rights and interests are at issue in this case. 
“Florida Rising offers no distinction for initiating the instant action against only the four Supervisors that are parties to this action. Therefore, to afford Florida Rising the statewide relief it seeks, the remaining sixty-three Supervisors must be party to the action, which will not deprive this Court of subject-matter jurisdiction,” Berger wrote.

“We have a lot of catching up to do,” Lamont told reporters from a vantage point overlooking the staging area at the State Pier, which was jam-packed with sections of turbines ready to be loaded onto ships and taken out to sea for installation. 
That installation work, which was shut down for nearly a month on the orders of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, is slated to restart as soon as Wednesday, Lamont said.
“When these wind turbines are spinning in less than a year, it’s going to bring down the price of electricity, because it brings down peak pricing during the winter months, which is the most expensive time,” Lamont said. “This is a big deal for business, so it’s good.”
Lamont was joined in New London by his counterpart in Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, along with a throng of union workers and state and local officials to celebrate Monday’s decision by U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth, which lifted the stop-work order.
While the Trump administration may still appeal that decision, Lamberth did not stay his order — thus allowing work to resume immediately on the $6 billion project.
In a statement on Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said that Lamberth’s ruling “will not be the final say on the matter.”
“President Trump was elected with a resounding mandate to end Joe Biden’s war on American energy and restore our country’s energy dominance — which includes prioritizing the most effective and reliable tools to power our country,” Kelly said. 
Rather than gloating on their initial victory, however, both Lamont and McKee offered a conciliatory note to President Donald J. Trump, saying they were engaged in conversations with administration officials about a broader energy strategy for the New England region. 
“We’re working very closely with the Trump administration,” Lamont said. “We’re doing everything it can, not just right here [in New London] but what we can do to add on additional energy across our region. That’s all the above, from my point of view.”
Lamont has repeatedly touted his relationships with two Trump administration figures in particular: Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. He met with both officials during a visit to Washington, D.C., in February during which he expressed an interest in working with the federal government to secure permits for an expansion of natural gas infrastructure and state-of-the-art nuclear reactors.
The governor also noted that a purported deal between officials in New York and the federal government, which would allow the construction of new gas pipelines, was widely seen as necessary to spare another wind project — Empire Wind — from cancellation by the Trump administration.
But in his efforts to negotiate a similar deal to save Revolution Wind, Lamont said his overtures were repeatedly met with silence. “Show me the ransom note,” was how he characterized those talks to reporters last week, before the judge granted an injunction, allowing work to resume.
And while Lamont suggested some progress was made in talks held over the weekend, he confirmed on Tuesday that federal officials have not made any explicit request for Connecticut to approve natural gas pipelines in order to get them to lift their opposition to Revolution Wind.
Lamont’s willingness to strike a deal with the Trump administration involving an expansion of natural gas pipelines also risks alienating environmental advocates, who see gas as a costly and polluting source of power generation.  
“I don’t think more natural gas is an ‘all of the above’ strategy,” said Charles Rothenberger, a climate and energy attorney for Save the Sound. “We’re full up on natural gas. You know, it’s by far the majority of what’s powering our electricity grid in the region. Here in Connecticut, we use an awful lot of it for home heating, and that creates a conflict. That’s a conflict, particularly with winter reliability, that offshore wind… is ideally designed to meet.”
Still, Rothenberger said he did not see much downside to officials like Lamont retaining “cordial” relationships with the Trump administration.
In addition to the soon-to-be-installed components of the Revolution Wind development that were stacked up on the State Pier Tuesday, equipment for the developers’ next project — the even larger Sunrise Wind, which will send power to New York — were being staged in preparation for offshore construction.
Asked whether he feared retaliation from the Trump administration targeting that project, Rhode Island’s McKee said the states would act similarly to protect workers and sources of clean energy.
“Those battles could come our way, but we’re prepared to fight them,” McKee said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6535-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 16:59:37.668391

(Photo: Screenshot of committee meeting)A bill to increase the state’s disabled veteran property tax homestead exclusion amount received a favorable hearing Tuesday in the House Finance Committee.
Under House Bill 118, the first $61,000 of appraised value of a disabled veterans residence would be excluded from taxation. Currently, the first $45,000 is excluded. Surviving spouses may continue to use the benefit under HB 118 unless they remarry.
The committee endorsed a preferred committee substitute with a provision to reimburse local governments 50% of tax dollars lost due to the higher homestead exclusion amount. The bill was referred to the House Rules Committee.
Earlier this year, county and municipal leaders had expressed concern that further lowering tax bills for disabled veterans would make it difficult to provide services county wide.
Brent Lucas, a staffer in the NC General Assembly’s Fiscal Research Division, said Cumberland County and Onslow County, which are home to two large military installations, Ft. Bragg and Camp Lejeune respectively, would feel the impact of the tax breaks the most. Wake, Guilford, Mecklenberg and Harnett counties would also be impacted, Lucas said.
State Rep. Deb Butler, D-New Hanover, said the number of disabled veterans in North Carolina has grown from 45,000 to 75,000 the past five years.
“I’m supportive of the bill but I do think that we need to be careful, particularly right now when we have some unmet needs in this state,” Butler said. “Obviously we want to support our veterans but I do have that cautionary observation for us.”
State Rep. Grant Campbell,  R-Kannapolis, one of the bill’s sponsors, said even with the higher exemption, North Carolina remains “significantly behind” neighboring states in tax relief for disabled veterans.
“We’re still on the lower end of that but I take your point,” Campbell said in response to Butler’s remarks.
An eligible veterans must satisfy at least one of the following requirements:

Have a service-connected total and permanent disability that has been certified by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs or another federal agency agency.
Has previously received benefits under the section of the United States Code that authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to assist disabled veterans with acquiring special fixtures or movable facilities to accommodate their disability, which could include land for housing.
The veteran has died and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs or another federal agency has certified that, as of Jan.1 preceding the taxable year for which the exclusion is claimed, the veteran’s death was the result of a service-connected condition.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Image-1024x569.jpeg,,,2025-09-23 16:59:37.668391

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
In America, diapers have long been treated as a luxury good rather than a necessity.
Half of families with young kids struggle to afford all the diapers they need. A quarter of families miss work as a result, often because they don’t have enough diapers to send with their children to child care.
It’s a largely invisible issue with enormous consequences for the health of parents and children. Studies have found that diaper need is a greater contributor to postpartum depression than food insecurity and housing instability. And when parents don’t have enough diapers, they make do with sanitary pads, rags or other materials. Some report having to leave their children in soiled diapers for extended periods, raising the risk for urinary tract infections and diaper rash.
So Amy Kadens, who has worked in the diaper space for nearly 15 years, wondered: What if diapers were free for the parents who need them most? For decades, the United States has not had a good answer. So she came up with her own.
Diaper banks started popping up across the nation in 2011, collecting donations and dispersing diapers to families through a complex network of local partnerships. They are one of the few lifelines for parents.
Kadens, who co-founded a nonprofit that provides diapers called Share our Spare in 2011, knew that diaper banks often operate with limited staff and resources, and operationally can only address a small percentage of a massive need. Without more government support, they can only get at a slice of the problem.
Federal assistance programs that help low-income families, such as food stamps and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), have never allowed families to use those funds to purchase diapers.
“Diaper banks are doing heroic work with very little. I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel,” Kadens said. But, “I wanted to continue to sink my teeth into this.”
So Kadens started to work on a solution that could give people the funds to get whatever diapers they needed, without the warehouses to store donations or the teams to get those donations out.
That solution was Diaper Dollars, a $40 e-card that users get in their email every month. The virtual card comes with a barcode they can scan at checkout at most major retailers, including Walmart, CVS and Walgreens, that will cover the cost of diapers. So far, users in Illinois and Ohio can access the program.
The idea, Kadens said, was to make it as simple as possible, while also giving parents the ability to choose what brands they preferred.
“Families have brand loyalty,” Kadens said. “I wanted to keep dignity and choice at the forefront of everything we did.”
The Diaper Dollars team went through months of market research to refine the tech to work well for participants. They didn’t want coupons because there was too much fraud in the system, and gift cards meant users could be limited on where to shop.
Instead, they landed on a system that allowed them to build out a catalog of diapers at 6,200 retail locations in the country. The bar code on the digital card recognizes the diapers when it’s scanned and deducts the price from the total purchase. That catalog of diapers is monitored daily and updated in case brands come out with new box sizes or products. It also works for online purchases.
The system does have some limitations. It’s not valid in Amazon or Target, two retailers that don’t yet accept that form of payment. And it also likely only covers a portion of the need: The average family spends about $100 on diapers a month, but families earning a median income can only afford to cover about $65, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. It’s also more expensive — parents are paying retail prices plus sales tax (23 states charge sales tax on diapers, including Illinois). By contrast, products at diaper banks are donated or sold to the banks from the manufacturer at deeply discounted rates.
To find participants, Diaper Dollars partners with organizations such as WIC clinics and local hospitals to refer people to the program, which is funded from a mix of philanthropy and financial support from those same partners. Partners establish the eligibility criteria, how long participants can be a part of the program, and whether the stipend will be higher for those with multiple babies.
A pilot program launched in 2023 with 100 people, then in 2024 the Illinois Department of Human Services dedicated $1 million to run its own pilot at a larger scale. Nearly 8,000 people have been served so far, with 10,000 projected by 2026.
Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton told The 19th that she had been looking for solutions that could support people in the postpartum period, when maternal mortality is high, particularly for Black women. Diaper need, specifically, is linked to maternal mental health and considered a potential risk factor for moderate to high maternal depressive symptoms.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2023, the maternal mortality rate for Black women was 50.3 deaths per 100,000 live births. For White women it was 14.5 deaths.
So when Illinois launched a birth equity initiative to address the needs of postpartum parents, from a home visiting program to better diaper access, it chose to partner with Diaper Dollars.
“Giving someone a card where they can go to the store of their choice, decide what’s best, that is what’s part of dignity,” Stratton said. “Every woman deserves to bring life into this world safely and with dignity.”
Brendan Kitt, Diaper Dollars’ program director, said the program was able to offer an operational solution to a problem the state wanted to address but didn’t have a mechanism for. The system works similarly to a universal basic income, where people in need are given a cash stipend, but it’s more targeted.
“Both for funders and supporters, it’s always a question when you talk to people about where the money goes,” he said. “The fact that we can limit the transactions to the specific needs that we’re trying to serve, I think, is one of the biggest things that legitimized our operation over just giving basic cash assistance.”
Parents who benefited from Diaper Dollars told the organization in testimonials that they’ve had to turn to using underwear or old T-shirts when they didn’t have the money for diapers, often making decisions between paying for rent or diapers.
After going through the program, parents reported that the funds gave them the wiggle room to buy their children other essentials or to make them better meals.
About 90 percent of those who went through the program reported being able to better afford essentials like food, rent and other bills. Some 95 percent felt less stressed about not having enough diapers.
Joanne Samuel Goldblum, the CEO of the National Diaper Bank Network, which has more than 240 partners nationwide, said a model like Diaper Dollars can address unmet needs, particularly in rural areas where it’s harder for diaper banks to distribute products.
“The need is really so big, and it’s not going to be addressed through just one sort of answer or one type of program,” Samuel Goldblum said. “It’s really important to have ways to reach people in all sorts of different communities.”
The Diaper Dollars program has raised about $2 million so far — 45 percent from the state of Illinois, 35 percent from philanthropic donors and 20 percent from grants from community partners. It is now also running in Ohio and expected to expand to Washington soon.
Kadens’ dream is to take the program to every state. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned and some red states instituted abortion bans, conservative lawmakers have been looking for ways to support postpartum parents.
In Tennessee, for example, where abortion was banned in 2022, the state rolled out a new policy in 2024 that allowed families enrolled in Tennessee’s Medicaid program to receive up to 100 free diapers a month for the first two years of life.
Samuel Goldblum said the National Diaper Bank Network has seen more bipartisan support for addressing diaper needs this year “than we’ve ever seen before.”
It should be that simple, Kadens said: “It doesn’t matter if you’re blue or red. Babies need diapers.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diapers-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 16:59:37.668391

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout). Bobby Cain, a towering figure in Tenneseee’s civil rights movement and one of the first Black students to integrate a public high school in the South died Monday at the age of 85 in Nashville.
One year before the “Little Rock Nine” integrated Arkansas’s Central High School, Cain was the first African-American graduate of Clinton High School in East Tennessee and was among the “Clinton 12”, a group of Black students who were eligible to attend the school on Aug 26, 1956. 
The school’s integration  followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision that declared segregated public schools unconstitutional. Anderson County ended funding to bus Black students across county lines to Knox County, leaving Cain with little choice but to go to Clinton, a small town located about 30 minutes from Knoxville. It became one of the first communities in the South to implement court ordered desegregation.
In an interview with Bill Carey of Tennessee History for Kids in 2017, Cain said he didn’t want to leave all of his friends at Austin High School where he first attended in Knoxville and that his senior year was just something he had to get through.
“It makes me feel good for my grandson to see what his grandfather has done in the past,” Cain said in 2023. “Hopefully people don’t hold onto the negativity and can see that we overcame what we went through during a moment in time.”
Adam Velk, Director of the Green McAdoo Cultural Center, a museum that commemorates the integration of Clinton High School, said that Cain’s contributions are still felt today.
“Every child across our country has access to an equitable public education system because Bobby Cain graduated from Clinton High School on May 17, 1957,” said Velk. “He was given no choice but to be a part of one of the most difficult social experiments in American history. He is a hero not just because he was the first, but because of the circumstances in which he got his education.
The integration efforts of the “Clinton 12” were met with significant resistance. On the first day of classes, white students stood on the steps of the school shouting threats and obscenities as Black students entered the building. Violence also followed. On his third day at Clinton High, Cain and another student were assaulted by a group of young white men after leaving the school’s campus for lunch. Cain later recounted in interviews that the attackers struck them with sticks until police intervened and took the students into custody for their own safety.

Cain and his classmates endured repeated harassment for the remainder of the school year. White mobs staged protests and riots outside of the school and vandalized the building. Tensions were so high that then-Gov. Frank Clement deployed the Tennessee National Guard, the first time a Southern governor used state troops to enforce school desegregation. 
Several members of the Clinton 12 eventually transferred from the area and moved away. Cain remained and was one of only two to graduate from Clinton High School and was attacked in the school cafeteria following the ceremony. It was an assault that left emotional scars over what he felt should have been a day of celebration.
“Despite the numerous threats to his life, the barrage of slurs, and the acts of cruelty Bobby faced on an every day basis, he still managed to persevere,” Velk said.
Cain went toTennessee State University, a historically Black university in Nashville,  graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1961. He then served in the United States Army from 1963-1965. Following his military service, he went on to have a long career with the Tennessee Department of Human Services, retiring as a supervisor in 2002 after 30years. Cain was a lifetime member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity and faithful member of Asbury United Methodist Church in Clinton. He was also an active associate member of Fifteenth Avenue Baptist Church in Nashville.
With dozens of awards and accolades to his honor, Cain remained committed and tied to his Clinton experience and its history. He participated in numerous ceremonies honoring the Clinton12, including the 2007 unveiling of the statues outside of the Green McAdoo Cultural Center founded in 2006. The museum is the site of the former Green McAdoo Grammar School, which served as a segregated school for African American students from 1935 to 1965. The “Clinton 12” were also formally recognized by Congress in 2021 through the efforts of  fellow member Jo Ann Allen Boyce, who worked to secure the honor.
“Our heart breaks at the news of Cain’s passing,” said Velk. But we hold Bobby Cain as a hero for the changing world as we know it, and for providing inspiration to communities everywhere along the way.”

(Photo by Amelia Knisely/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia State Police, who now have broad immigration enforcement powers through a federal program, arrested 12 individuals for immigration violations over a two day period. The arrests were made during traffic stops. 
This was the first update on immigration-related arrests since Gov. Patrick Morrisey partnered with the United States Immigrations and Customs Enforcement last month to expand immigration enforcement operations in West Virginia.
“I am proud to have West Virginia’s law enforcement working together with ICE to enforce the nation’s immigration laws and support President [Donald] Trump’s border policies,” Morrisey said Tuesday in a statement. “This partnership is already producing results with a dozen arrests made in just the past few days. I want to commend the WVSP for their work as we continue to support actions that protect West Virginians.”  
Members of the WVSP were operating under the ICE 287(g) program, which gives police officers and National Guard personnel the authority to perform specified immigration enforcement functions.
Participating state police and National Guard members have the authority to make warrantless arrests of any undocumented immigrant entering or attempting to unlawfully enter the United States in the officer’s presence or view or if the officer believes the person to be arrested is in violation of the law and likely to escape.
Morrisey’s office said that with the assistance of ICE, 12 undocumented immigrants were apprehended by state police between Sunday and Monday during traffic stops that occurred along Interstate 77, near the Pax area of Fayette County. 
“After all 12 were determined to have entered or remained in the United States illegally, the undocumented immigrants were placed under arrest for immigration violations and taken to South Central Regional Jail,” the governor’s office said. 
West Virginia is participating in the “task force model” of the 287(g) program, the broadest of the program’s models that permits law enforcement to enforce immigration authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties.
The task force agreements with ICE were discontinued in 2012 during the Obama administration after a 2011 Department of Justice investigation found widespread racial profiling and other discrimination against Latinos in an Arizona task force, Stateline reported. 
Only participating law enforcement personnel who are nominated, trained, certified, and authorized have the authority to conduct the delegated immigration officer functions.

The gathering featured community-driven solutions to one of the most pressing public health challenges facing Black youth.
The plan comes as suicide rates among Black youth and young adults have risen sharply nationwide. In North Carolina, from 2013 to 2022, 377 Black North Carolinians ages 10 to 24 died by suicide, according to state data.
Nearly 17% of Black high school students said they had seriously considered suicide, while more than a third of middle schoolers reported the same. The numbers peak at age 24 — and are especially stark for Black girls questioning their sexual orientation, who now report the highest rates of suicide attempts in schools statewide.

“This is about empowering communities and tapping into their inherent strengths,” said Kelly Crosbie, director of the state’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services. “I would much prefer that kids get the support they need well before they have a crisis.”
In her speech on Saturday, Crosbie noted youth ages 10 to 18 are now the largest group calling the national 988 crisis hotline, a statistic she described as both “good and shocking.”
The conference drew dozens of participants despite early funding challenges. Dr. Rodney Harris, who coordinated the event, described it as the product of grassroots persistence. “We’re creating a coalition that saves lives,” Harris said in a speech. “This is love in action, because this is the essence of community and family.”
The day included workshops, a documentary screening, and panel discussions led by young advocates. Panelists spoke candidly about the stigma surrounding mental health in Black communities, particularly the pressure on young men to suppress emotions. They urged peers to seek connection rather than isolation.
“Being vulnerable or asking for help does not make you weak. It actually makes you stronger,” said Nautica McCoy, a member of the North Carolina Black Youth Wellness Advisory Board, during a panel discussion. 
Judith Beth VanBoven, who also serves on the state’s youth advisory board, told the audience that sharing their experiences can help others. “Your testimony will become a legacy that someone else will learn from,” she said.
Rafiah Maxi Cole, founder of Sole Survivors of Chicago, also took part in the panel discussion. 
She spoke with NC Newsline ahead of the conference, sharing her own story of loss. In 2020, her 19-year-old son died by suicide. “I wanted to be vocal about learning more about what happened.” 
Maxi Cole has since dedicated her life to prevention efforts, producing the documentary “While the Children Fade” and leading community outreach in nontraditional spaces — from laundromats to bus stops. 
“We must meet the community where the community is,” she said. “Street outreach is the best outreach.” 
She praised North Carolina’s action plan as an important step in reducing the stigma around mental health struggles. “To recognize that Black youth are surpassing any other ethnicity when it comes to suicide ideations and attempts brings about an awareness,” she said in earlier interview. “It’s time to humanize this subject.”
Throughout the day, speakers framed suicide prevention as a collective responsibility. Brandon Johnson, who leads a national Black youth suicide prevention initiative, said in his speech that “this is an act of love, an act of hope, an act of resilience. We care deeply about each and every one of you.”

Community members also shared stories of local resilience. Corey Kent, a barber student at Edgecombe Community College, described how his decision to pursue barbering became a form of service. On Saturday, he was offering free haircuts both as a way to hone his skills and connect with neighbors. “Write your dreams out. Don’t ever stop chasing them,” Kent said. 
Organizers said that the initiative’s success depends on grassroots involvement. Efforts include training barbers and other community members to recognize warning signs of depression, as well as providing culturally responsive care.
Despite political uncertainty surrounding diversity initiatives, organizers said the community-led approach makes their work resilient. “When the community and the village embrace the work, it can’t be stopped,” said Dr. Sonyia Richardson, a UNC Chapel Hill researcher who helped developed the state plan.
The plan will focus on the 17 counties with the highest suicide rates, while maintaining a commitment to reach all 100 counties in North Carolina.
For Crosbie, the stakes could not be higher. “Suicide is now one of the leading causes of death among youth,” she said. “But prevention is possible when we build safe spaces and strong networks of support.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9204176-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 16:59:37.668391

The United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan on Monday announced that Kevin Delgado would receive a year and a day in prison after pleading guilty to one count of transmitting threats in interstate commerce earlier this year. 
According to court documents, Delgado posted a threatening response in response to a post Nessel made honoring her friend, community leader and activist Samantha Woll, who was murdered. He told Nessel to “watch every step u take,” called her a string of insults which included a homophobic slur, and said she would be “#murdered.”
The case was investigated by the FBI and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Frances Lee Carlson.
While pleading guilty, Delgado admitted that he threatened Nessel because of her religion and her perceived sexual orientation. Nessel is Jewish and gay. 
“The sentencing of Kevin Delgado sends a strong message that public officials elected to serve the people cannot be hindered by threats and must be able to do their jobs free from intimidation,” Reuben Coleman, acting special agent in charge of the FBI Detroit Field Office said in a statement. “The FBI in Michigan will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to identify, and hold accountable, those who issue dangerous threats against officials dedicated to protecting and serving our communities.”

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier declined to offer his opinion Tuesday on whether the Florida Legislature should put the open carrying of firearms in Florida into state statute.
Following the decision by the state First District Court of Appeals on Sept. 10 that the 1987 law banning open carry in Florida was unconstitutional, the AG declared five days later that in light of that ruling, he was declaring that open carry is now the law of the state.
Speaking during a press conference at the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office on Tuesday, Uthmeier acknowledged that changing the law based on the court’s ruling was “not the cleanest situation and there’s likely cleanup that’s going to be needed by the Legislature.”
He went on to caution that federal and state laws still restrict the ability to openly carry a gun in certain locations.
“We’ll see what the Legislature decides to do when they come back,” he said. “I know everybody is taking a look and researching and better understanding the current legal environment right now, so I’m not going to speculate what they do or don’t want to do.”
Uthmeier appeared to be firmer last week that the Legislature would need to pass a law on open carry.
“We’re not going to be enforcing violations of that [open carry] law given this new opinion, but that’s going to have to be addressed — taken out of Florida statute and an open-carry law has got to be put back in place,” he said at a press conference with Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd in Winter Haven last Friday.
Lawmakers are reading and dissecting the judicial ruling, he said, adding that the decision resulted in “some inconsistencies” about concealed-weapons licenses and the permitless carry law passed in Florida in recent years while the open-carry ban was still in place.
Sheriff Judd indicated at that press conference that he believes that the Legislature needs to act.
“When you pluck a piece of that out like the appellate court did without the opportunity to shore up the rest of it, it makes the rest of the law a little wonky,” he said. “I have spoken to the attorney general … the speaker of the House, the president of the Senate, and the chief of staff for the governor, saying, ‘We just need some help so we can redefine and get these lines straight again.’”
No state lawmaker has filed a bill yet that would put open carry into statute. Second Amendment advocates spoke out last week opposing any such bill, fearing such a measure could restrict the open-carry policy the ruling established.
“Member of Florida Gun Rights stand united and strong against any potential infringements on the recent ruling which declared Florida’s ban on open carry as unconstitutional,” said Logan Edge with that group last week.
The new policy is already being observed in Tallahassee in the Capitol.
Scripps Television reporter Forrest Saunders posted a photo on X on Tuesday showing a law enforcement officer with a long gun standing outside a House committee meeting. He reported that the House Sergeant’s office said that it was “a precaution” following the change in law.
Meanwhile, a progressive group in Florida is criticizing Uthmeier for his position.
Voices of Florida, a Sarasota activist organization, is calling on members of the public to sign a petition telling the attorney general that his open carry policy “is reckless, dangerous and a threat to our economy.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-23 20:25:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Report: US DOJ has ongoing concerns about education, housing at youth prison",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/23/manson-youth-institution-juvenile-prison-doj-settlement-report/,"CT's juvenile prison has made progress in some areas but fallen short in key places following a 2024 federal settlement, evaluators found.","Connecticut’s juvenile prison has made progress in complying with a 2024 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, but concerns remain about the residential environment, as well as the education and mental health services incarcerated young people receive in Connecticut, according to a new report. 
The “monitoring report,” released July 15, evaluated the state’s progress toward orders set out in the settlement agreement, which followed a two-year investigation revealing systemic problems with the way mental health and special education services were provided at Manson Youth Institution in Cheshire.
State and federal officials set goals for the facility, including required special education screening for incoming youth, new policies for reviewing and revising special education plans, and maintaining documentation of the services each individual receives. The settlement also required the state Department of Correction to limit the use of isolation as punishment.
Manson has made progress in some areas but fell short in some key places, evaluators found. 
“The monitoring team recommends continued focus on priority areas to achieve substantial compliance and improve the quality of care and services for incarcerated youth at MYI,” the report said. “By addressing these challenges and implementing the recommended improvements, MYI can create a safer, more supportive, and rehabilitative environment for the youth in its care.”
Last week, correctional staff told members of the state’s Juvenile Justice Policy and Oversight Committee that they were making changes to improve their compliance with the orders in the settlement. 
“When the juveniles came into our care, they came into a setting [that was] designed to house adult males,” Michael Pierce, warden at Manson Youth Institute, told the committee. “So when the investigation started, their focus was on education, mental health and our isolation procedures. And, rightfully so, we were found to be in non-compliance … we needed some help there.” 
The report, which was conducted by monitor Michael Dempsey and a group of experts between November 2024 and April 2025, found that the facility had made some strides in decreasing the use of force and that staff were “professional and well-trained.” The facility has had 16 incidents where pepper spray was used between January and August of 2025. Most were related to fights or assaults, according to data provided by the agency. 
But assessors highlighted several areas where the department continues to fall short: school days were cut short; young people had too much idle time without meaningful activities; residential rooms were poorly maintained; and mental health assessments and treatment plans lacked detail. 
Connecticut’s acting Child Advocate Christina Ghio told the Connecticut Mirror that while it’s clear the department is starting to implement the changes outlined in the settlement agreement, there’s still “much, much more work to be done.” 
State Rep. Toni Walker, D-New Haven, co-chair of the Juvenile Justice Policy Oversight Committee, acknowledged that the department had only just begun to implement some of the changes, and underscored the importance of getting regular updates about the department’s progress. 
“We must not continue blaming the kids for failing. We have to take responsibility for the failure of not providing them with what they need,” Walker said. 
Not a therapeutic environment
The report described the rooms of the facility as having “variable levels of cleanliness” and noted a significant amount of graffiti. The monitor recommended creating a “more homelike environment” using soft furniture, more sunlight and calming colors. 
Pierce, the warden at Manson, told members of the JJPOC on Thursday that the facility was built in the 1970s to house adults. He said the department’s budget this year included $5 million for the remodeling of one of the cottages, and that they planned to buy softer furniture, like a new desk with a stool, nightstands and new mattresses, to make it appear more like a college dormitory. 
The report also found that young people were spending what the investigators believed was too much idle time without meaningful activities. Their review found that young people were spending 3.5 hours after school in their rooms, where they also ate their meals. 
“Youth spend most of their time in small, uncomfortable, drab, living units or rooms, leading to boredom and higher rates of incidents of violence,” the investigators wrote. “The team emphasizes the importance of developing more meaningful activities and programs, particularly on weekends when fewer programs are available to keep youth engaged, reduce idleness, and reduce the need for the excessive amount of operational room confinement hours.” 
Pierce said the young people were out of their cells more than the legally-required five hours per day. He said that while they did have programs aimed at incentivizing good behavior in young people, the investigators “felt it was not as meaningful as it could be.” 
Ashley McCarthy, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, said the department took the concerns seriously and was already working to improve conditions.
“Since November 2024 we have expanded programming to support positive engagement and skill-building,” McCarthy wrote in a statement. She cited fitness programs, chess tournaments and other sports, as well as weekend activities. 
Ghio, the state’s child advocate, said, “ If we want to help the children who are there to rehabilitate, if we want to cut down on incidents, we need to have children engaged in meaningful activities throughout their day and on weekends.”
Sarah Eagan, executive director of the Center for Children’s Advocacy and former Child Advocate, said redesigning Manson into a place for adolescents could be “a little bit trying to fit a round peg into a square hole.”
“The state policy makers have a decision to make,” Eagan said. “Is this the setting, is this environment where we can best meet the needs of youth so that they may make gains and return safely and productively to their communities, or not?”
The report also detailed evidence of young people being disciplined using prolonged periods of isolation.
Lynnia Johnson, deputy warden for operations, told the JJPOC that the department has created a new policy around solitary confinement that requires staff members to check on young people placed in isolation every 15 minutes. While the isolation can last up to 72 hours, Johnson said no one had been placed in isolation for more than 1 hour since the policy began in March. She said that isolation was used only as a last resort.
Eagan said she believes the state should create a dashboard or framework for measuring how well the department was doing at keeping teens safe, the quality of services they were getting and the planning process for young people preparing to return to their communities. 
Not making the grade
The report also pointed to problems with consistency in the young people’s educational experience, noting that between January and March 7, 2025, there hadn’t been three consecutive days in which all the students had a full day of school. (A November 2024 report from the Office of the Child Advocate found that in the 2022-23 school year, students lost nearly 25% of the hours they were supposed to be in school.)
The investigators said that dormitories would arrive 15 to 20 minutes late to school on a regular basis, meaning that students with special education needs wouldn’t always get their full services.
DOC spokesperson McCarthy said that students are taught by certified teachers in classroom setting, and that special education students receive their education from specialized teachers. She said “safety and security concerns” have sometimes impacted their schedule, but “we have taken steps to adjust routines to minimize these interruptions and ensure students receive a full school day.” 
While the report praised the special education department for having certified staff providers on site and for its compliance process, the monitor noted that the teams of people responsible for students’ specialized education plans regularly reduce the amount of time and the services that the young people are supposed to receive — a serious problem that came to light in the original investigation. 
About 61% of students in Manson Youth Institute are identified as having special education needs. 
Addressing the JJPOC meeting, Manson Principal Matt Reinke said the facility was implementing a program called MAP, or Making Action Plans, where special education students identify a team of people and outside resources, like community programs, who can support them. They then create a roadmap for what success would look like after they leave Manson Youth Institute, and what steps they would need to take — like vocational training or college — that would help them reach their goals. Another module, Project Genesis, is also supposed to help young people explore possible careers and get ready to transition back into society. 
Many of the young people at Manson are also behind in reading and math skills. The Office of the Child Advocate has reported that 70% of the teenagers assessed in June 2023 were reading at an elementary school level, and more than half were doing math at an elementary school level. 
Reinke outlined the steps the facility has been taking to address those issues, including increased early data collection about students’ goals and their academic abilities. He said students whose skills are below their grade level receive one-on-one remediation, which he said was successful. 
“ The vast majority of the youth that are at Manson are well below grade level in math and reading, right? And so it’s just unacceptable for them to have anything less than a full day of education,” Ghio said. 
A plan for mental health treatment
Mental health was also a focus of the original investigation, in which the Department of Justice found that the facility did not properly assess the incarcerated young people for mental health needs or identify signs of trauma. The monitor’s report found that the treatment plans they reviewed for the teens “mostly lacked detail and at times failed to target the assessed needs.” 
Dr. Michael Moravecek, the mental health supervisor at Manson Youth Institute, told JJPOC members that the facility has increased its staffing and developed a mental health assessment that is relevant for young people — including questions about education, friends and what they do in their free time. He said they’d introduced more detailed documentation, as the settlement agreement required. 
Moravecek said it was “hard to measure” if the treatment was effective, and said his assessment of progress would be more “qualitative.” 
Rep. Walker said she believes the department must develop ways of measuring the outcomes of any programs or changes that the Department of Correction undertook. 
“I need to see the data, and I need to know — have you made improvements with the services you have been charged to provide with the state?” she said. “We’ve got to be much more transparent.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Manson-Exterior-e1625765290544.jpg,,,2025-09-23 17:57:59.866609

FEMA, which is tasked with compensating wildfire victims, told a court recently it will appeal a judge’s order to pay victims for the emotional toll of the 341,000-acre wildfire. (Patrick Lohmann / SourceNM) Lawyers for the Federal Emergency Management Agency intend to appeal a judge’s ruling that orders the agency to award hundreds of millions of dollars to Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims for the emotional toll of the 2022 wildfire, according to recent court filings.
The notices last week from FEMA and lawyers at the United States Attorney’s Office in New Mexico begin another potentially years-long chapter in a long-running legal dispute. The conflict centers on whether the agency must compensate victims of the state’s biggest-ever wildfire for “noneconomic damages,” which are similar to pain and suffering payments. 
A federal judge has repeatedly ruled against FEMA, including in a 99-page ruling late last year and again Aug. 4. The agency has also faced criticism, including from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, for not accepting the court’s ruling and paying the additional compensation to fire victims, some of whom are elderly or low-income and still grappling with the fire’s impact on their lives.
Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims still wait on FEMA’s decision to appeal judge’s ruling

FEMA and United States Attorney’s Office officials declined to comment on the appeal or the criticism.
After the fire, which resulted from two botched U.S. Forest Service prescribed burns, Congress approved $5.5 billion in compensation for people, businesses and others that suffered losses as a result.   
FEMA interpreted the legislation Congress passed to exclude payments for intangible aspects of the wildfire, saying the law only covered losses with a price tag, like homes, property, vehicles or medical expenses.
But plaintiffs’ lawyers representing more than 1,000 fire victims sued in late 2023 in federal court, saying Congress intended its compensation fund to include payments for “noneconomic damages.” They also argued that New Mexico law allows for such payments, which was one element of the lawsuit, an opinion with which the New Mexico Attorney General’s Office concurs.
In the scar of New Mexico’s largest wildfire, a legal battle is brewing over the cost of suffering

In addition to being legal, plaintiffs’ lawyers say the payments mark one way to ensure the distribution of funds is more equitable, particularly for fire victims who had modest economic losses but were nonetheless affected emotionally in the fire. 
The appeals notices themselves do not lay out the basis for FEMA’s decision to fight federal Judge James O. Browning’s rulings. 
Brian Colón, a former state treasurer and lawyer representing fire victims with law firm Singleton Schreiber, told Source New Mexico in an email late Monday that the Solicitor General of the United States has the final say on how the agency will proceed.
“We hope to hear something soon as to the details of what they intend to appeal,” Colón said.
Colón’s firm has previously estimated the total “noneconomic” damage cost to the compensation fund could be about $400 million. 
While FEMA is fighting the judge’s ruling, it has continued to pay out economic damages to fire victims. According to the latest update Sept. 23, the office had paid out $2.98 billion in 21,515 claims. A little more than $2.3 billion of that has gone to individuals and households, according to the agency.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MORA-SNOW-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 16:59:37.668391

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave no indication that future interest rate cuts are coming, despite mounting pressure from President Donald Trump and Trump-appointed officials for the central bank.
Speaking to more than 500 business, nonprofit and political leaders at The Crowne Plaza in Warwick Tuesday, Powell emphasized the need for a cautious approach to monetary policy in the midst of the unique challenge presented by persistent inflation and a softening labor market.
“There is no risk-free path,” said Powell. “If we ease too aggressively, we could leave the inflation job unfinished and need to reverse course later to fully restore 2%. “If we maintain restrictive policies for too long, the labor market could soften unnecessarily. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate.”
Powell’s comments during the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce’s annual economic outlook luncheon marked his first public speech since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last week. Even after the modest rate cut — the first of the year — other central bank officials indicated they support Trump’s push for faster and more aggressive rate cuts to tackle inflation. Stephen Miran, Trump’s economic adviser and a new appointee to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said Monday that the 4.1% interest rate was still too high. Michelle Bowman, another Trump appointee and vice chair for supervision, also backed speedy and swift rate cuts in separate remarks in North Carolina earlier Tuesday.
Yet Powell, also a Trump appointee in 2018 and then reappointed for a second term under President Joe Biden, made no promises on future rate cuts.
“Our policy is not on a preset course,” Powell said, emphasizing the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate to maximize employment while keeping inflation at or near 2%. “We will continue to determine the appropriate stance based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.”
Powell’s data-driven mindset over monetary policy has caused tensions with Trump, who since winning a second term has called Powell names and threatened to fire him amid frustrations at the Fed’s decision to keep interest rates steady. 
Powell has remained unflappable in the face of personal attacks. He responded indirectly Tuesday without calling out Trump by name.
“Most of the people who are calling us political, it’s just a cheap shot,” Powell said. “Our argument is doing our jobs. We don’t get into the back and forth with external people.”
U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, who introduced Powell to the sold-out crowd Tuesday, was less reserved in his criticism of the federal administration, blasting Trump for his “direct assault” on the central bank’s independence and its members.
“Chair Powell has met these challenges with equanimity and professionalism,” Reed said. “He has somehow managed to stay laser-focused on achieving the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum employment and stable pricing.”
Indeed, Powell focused much of his opening address and question-and-answer session with Laurie White, president of the Providence chamber, on the mechanics behind the central bank’s decisions. He rattled off a list of economic indicators that inform the Federal Reserve’s approach: inflation and the labor market chief among them, but also financial markets, housing affordability and tariffs.

Explaining the rate cut
The softening of the labor market, evidenced by a rising unemployment rate and depressed job growth, prompted the central bank’s decision to lower interest rates slightly, easing off the “tight” monetary policy it has maintained in the face of inflation through much of the year. 
However, Powell noted that other labor market signals remain stable, including the ratio of job openings to unemployment, while inflation remains elevated. “We took very much a risk management approach,” he said of the most recent rate cuts. “We try to have a policy that can cover the range of plausible outcomes, not just one outcome.”
It’s the attitude that guided Powell, a D.C. native, through a career in finance, first as an investment banker and lawyer in New York before working for the U.S. Department of the Treasury under President George H. W. Bush, and, since 2012, as a member of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. 
But the economic highs and lows have sharpened in the five years since Powell last visited Rhode Island. Soon after his November 2019 visit, also as part of a Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce event, the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, its grip on the world’s health and economy still lingering today.
“In democracies around the world, public trust in economic and political institutions has been challenged,” Powell said. “Those of us who are in public service at this time need to focus tightly on carrying out our critical missions to the best of our ability in the midst of stormy seas and powerful crosswinds.”
Especially under a federal administration whose trade wars and immigration policies created what Powell characterized as an “unusual and challenging”  slowdown in  supply of and demand for workers.
“It’s really an unusual kind of balance, the lower demand and lower need for workers,” Powell said.
He stressed that the central bank’s control of interest rates is its only tool, and that upheaval of the economy caused by artificial intelligence and structural labor force shifts were better solved through legislators and the private sector.
“We get a disproportionate amount of attention compared to the things that really matter, which are the things that Congress can do and the private sector can do,” Powell said.
Stocks started to slide after Powell spoke, with all major index averages falling. The S&P 500 was down more than 36 points when markets closed.
U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner and a host of state legislative and general officeholders, including House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos and General Treasurer James Diossa, also attended the Chamber event Tuesday. Gov. Dan McKee was not present, having appeared at a joint event in New London, Connecticut, with Gov. Ned Lamont to speak about offshore wind an hour earlier.

Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, announced her run for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District Tuesday, joining a growing field of Republicans aiming to take the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson.
In a social media post Tuesday morning, Lundgren announced her U.S. House campaign, kicking off by stating her early support for President Donald Trump during the 2016 election cycle.
“I proudly supported President Trump in August of 2015 because I knew our country needed his strong leadership to get us back on track after decades of establishment politicians forgetting about working families and rural America,” Lundgren said in post. “In the 2024 caucuses, I proudly stood with him early again. Now, I’m stepping up to serve Iowans in Congress because President Trump needs that type of unwavering, loyal conservative fighters in Congress to deport illegal immigrants and make America safe, support our small businesses and working families, help Iowans afford housing and health care, protect Social Security and Medicare, and end the woke gender ideology that endangers our daughters.”
Lundgren has served for five terms in the Iowa House, chairing the House Commerce Committee, and is the owner and operator of Trackside Bar & Grill in Peosta alongside her husband, Charlie. She said that as a small business owner, she knows the struggles and needs of people and businesses in northeast Iowa, and that she would work in Congress to be “the strongest advocate for Iowa’s workers and small businesses who are the backbone of our American economy.”
“Charlie and I are excited to earn support across northeast Iowa,” Lundgren said. “We will keep this seat red and fight, fight, fight alongside President Trump to put Iowa and America first.”
With Lundgren’s announcement, there are now four Republicans running to become the 2nd Congressional District Republican nominee in the 2026 election. The race heated up quickly after Hinson, the incumbent, announced she will instead run for U.S. Senate after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst shared that she will not seek a third term in office.
Earlier in September, state Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, and former state lawmaker Joe Mitchell announced their campaigns for the seat.
Blum announces campaign

Former U.S. Rep. Rod Blum joined the race on Friday. Blum, who previously represented northeast Iowa in Congress, was first elected to the U.S. House in 2014 before losing to former U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat, in the 2018 midterm election.
Blum had hinted he would join the race shortly after Hinson’s Senate campaign launch. In his announcement, Blum said he would prioritize issues like border security, energy independence and strengthening the U.S. economy “through fair trade deals that put more money in the pockets of American workers” if elected to Congress.
The 70-year-old Dubuque resident said he was kickstarting his campaign with a personal $250,000 investment. Blum previously worked as CEO and president of Eagle Point Software, as well as the construction software company Digital Canal.
“We also need more Republicans in Washington who understand the business world and what it means to create jobs, balance budgets and make tough decisions,” Blum said in a statement. “I look forward to working hard every day to earn the Republican nomination, hold this seat for our Republican majority next November and get to work protecting our constitutional freedoms as Americans.”
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Katie Smith criticized the recently announced Republican candidates in the race, calling Lundgren “the latest out-of-touch Republican gearing up for a crowded, messy primary fight over who can best cater to Washington special interests and rubber stamp health care cuts and price-spiking tariffs.”
“Iowans deserve change, not more of the same corrupt Washington politics,” Smith said. “Democrats will flip this seat because voters are ready for someone who actually fights to lower their costs and puts them first.”
Rep. Lindsay James gains Star Trek actor’s endorsement
There are also three Democrats competing to become their party’s nominee in the 2nd District — Iowa Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25 and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College.
On Monday, James snagged the endorsement of an celebrity born in the district — actor Kate Mulgrew. Mulgrew, 70, was born in Dubuque, and is known for her roles in television shows like “Star Trek: Voyager,” and “Orange Is the New Black.” Mulgrew toured Feed Iowa First, a nonprofit urban farm in Marion, with James on Monday while offering her support for the candidate.
Mulgrew said she supported James’ bid for the seat because she believes James would be able to win in 2026, according to the Gazette.
“I came here to stand by her side and to give it a little push, because I think she’s going to flip this seat,” Mulgrew said. “… She’s got the passion and she’s got the fire in the belly to do it.”
The race for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District could be more contentious in 2026 than previously expected. Cook Political Report, a political forecaster, shifted the district’s rating from “solid Republican” to “likely Republican” following the September campaign shake-up.

Joe Morrissey, shown in Richmond in 2020, is among the Democrats backing Republican John Reid’s campaign for lieutenant governor. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)John Reid, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, on Tuesday launched Democrats for John Reid, a coalition of Virginia Democrats publicly lining up behind his candidacy — a twist that promises to sharpen contrasts with his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond. 
One of the most prominent defectors in the new group is former state Sen. Joe Morrissey, a Democrat whose career has long been marked by clashes with his own party.
“Virginians know that our commonwealth works best when we work together,” Reid said in a statement. “I am proud to have the support of Democrats who are standing up for common sense and for a government that is accountable to the people; not the political class in Richmond. Together, we’re building a broad coalition to move Virginia forward.”
The coalition is chaired by former International President of B’nai B’rith Tommy Baer, and includes a number of Richmond community leaders, working professionals, and former Democratic officials such as Kimberly Gray, Alexander Benedict McMurtrie Jr., Ajay Brewer and Christopher Woody. 
Reid’s campaign said these individuals are “putting people over politics” in supporting the Republican’s promise to be a check on Richmond’s political class and to focus on common sense solutions.
But it is Morrissey’s break that stands out. 
In an interview with The Mercury on Tuesday, he explained the reasons he will support Reid rather than Hashmi, citing personal experience serving with her in the Senate and disagreement over what he views as partisanship in her actions and policy positions. 
Among his complaints are that Hashmi “was strictly partisan, and did not do what was best, what I thought, for the commonwealth.” 
He contrasted that with Reid, saying he believes Reid will do a “much better job for Virginians.” He praised Reid’s emphasis on measurable improvements in schools and his attention to infrastructure — areas in which Morrissey said Hashmi has not been as outspoken or action-oriented.
Morrissey left no ambiguity: “It doesn’t matter who the other Democrats are that are supporting John, but my own reasons are that I served with Ghazala in the Senate. I know her behavior, mannerisms, her voting record, and because of that, I’m supporting John Reid.” 
He said he votes not for his party, but for what he thinks is best for Virginia — even under Democratic governors. 
He also addressed the fact that Reid is the first openly gay candidate on a statewide ticket in the commonwealth, saying “The fact that he is gay is irrelevant to whether or not you’ll be a great leader for Virginia,” but added that Reid is more open to “all sides,” in contrast with Hashmi, whom Morrissey characterized as aligned with the “far left crowd in Virginia.”
Despite his rejection of Hashmi in this race, Morrissey made clear he continues to support other Democrats on the ticket: Abigail Spanberger for governor and Jay Jones for attorney general. 
Morrissey’s long history in Virginia politics is well documented. He represented the 16th district in the State Senate from 2020 to 2024, following several terms in the House of Delegates. He has often positioned himself as a maverick within the Democratic Party, sometimes allying with Republicans or breaking with Democratic caucus positions — actions that have earned him rebukes from fellow party members.
And in 2014, while serving in the House, he was convicted on a misdemeanor charge stemming from allegations of an inappropriate relationship with a 17-year old receptionist in his law office. He entered an Alford plea to a felony charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, resigned his seat, and served a brief jail sentence while continuing to campaign. 
Despite the scandal, voters later returned him to the legislature, first re-electing him to the House and then to the state Senate. 
Hashmi, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, is a state senator from Virginia’s 15th district. She won a crowded six-way primary in June. If elected in November, she would make history as Virginia’s first Asian-American and Muslim statewide officeholder. Her campaign has emphasized her background as an educator, her record in the Senate on health, housing, education, and her work as chair of education and health committees.
Reid’s campaign is likely to use the newly formed Democratic coalition not just to highlight Democratic defections, but as proof of broader appeal beyond traditional Republican bases. 
Baer, the coalition’s chair, said in a statement, “This is no longer the party of John F. Kennedy or even Bill Clinton. It has moved to the extremes, and I can’t help but feel the party has left me. John Reid represents common-sense. His policies are designed to address the problems confronting the working class … he is pro-law enforcement … he will represent all the citizens … whether they be Christian, Jew, Muslim, or whatever walk of life they may come from.” 
Whether Morrissey’s criticism of Hashmi for being “strictly partisan” will resonate with moderate Democrats, independents, or swing voters remains to be seen. As the campaign heads into fall, Reid’s new coalition and Morrissey’s outspoken defection add another layer of complexity to what already is a closely watched race.

Root 5 Farm in Fairlee held their second annual Fermentation Celebration, inviting people to listen to bread bakers, beer makers and kombucha makers talk about their natural production methods, all of which involve fermentation.

This story by Nicola Smith was first published in the Valley News on Sept. 22, 2025.
FAIRLEE — In the last week, the dewy layer of morning frost on the fields has signaled that the Upper Valley’s growing season is winding down. But the warm days and cool nights benefit root vegetables such as carrots and turnips, and above-ground vegetables such as kale, brussel sprouts and cabbage, which are at their peak in the fall.
Cabbage is one of the staple crops at Root 5 Farm, which is on high ground overlooking the Connecticut River in Fairlee.
Owners Danielle Allen and Ben Dana operate a vegetable CSA and use the cabbage they grow in their homemade sauerkraut, or PowerKraut, which is made through natural fermentation. They also make kimchi, the Korean dish that blends cabbage, spices, garlic and ginger.
Over the weekend, Allen and Dana staged their second annual Fermentation Celebration. People throughout the Upper Valley and beyond came to listen to bread bakers, and makers of beer, mead and kombucha, talk about their natural production methods, all of which involve fermentation. The one-day event also showcased Root 5’s own produce.
“We eat everything we grow and ferment,” Allen said.
Allen and Dana started farming in the Burlington’s Intervale 20 years ago but decided to relocate to the Upper Valley after the Winooski River flooded their farm during Tropical Storm Irene. They bought the property, which was already an existing farm, in 2014.
Jars of sauerkraut, kimchi and fermented hot sauces are available to sample during a fermentation celebration at Root 5 Farm in Fairlee on Saturday, Sept. 20. The farm uses late-season cabbage that is harvested after a frost to make their fermented products, which lends an additional sweetness. “It’s something unique we can do in this region,” said farm owner Danielle Allen. Photo by Alex Driehaus/Valley News
Last year the farm, under the direction of chef and chief fermenter Cindy Ross, made 8,000 pounds of sauerkraut and 3,000 pounds of kimchi, Allen said. The PowerKraut and kimchi are sold both on the farm and at stores throughout the Upper Valley.
Ross, who was at Fermentation Celebration overseeing a demonstration of sauerkraut making, said that the farm’s sauerkraut ferments in the natural brine created by the cabbage, salt and spices. She does not use vinegar.
Despite the attention paid to the health benefits of the fermentation method over the past 20 years, partially due to the writing of fermentation guru Sandor Katz, many people still don’t know much about it. “This is why we have today — for educational purposes,” Ross said.
Introducing people to foods that are made through fermentation is part of the Root 5 mission.

“We’re trying to be that first good experience, for people eating fermented foods,” Dana said. “Our sauerkraut is alive, not pasteurized. I love the living part of it, which is supposed to be probiotic.”
Probiotics are live microorganisms in such foods as yogurt, some cheeses, kefir and sauerkraut that are said to be beneficial in digestion, and in supporting the health of the immune system.
Not least, fermentation is a “way to explore the world’s foods,” Dana added.
Craft beer makers Billy and Brooke Martin, who are taking over Brocklebank Brewery in Tunbridge, described the yeast-based fermentation for their pilsners and IPAs as “doing all the work. We’re preparing a very tasty snack for yeast.” The beer makers impart subtle flavors to their beer with the addition of dandelions, red clover and currants.

Some in attendance at the event were attracted by the health benefits of fermented foods. Researchers at Stanford School of Medicine found in a controlled study in 2021 that a diet “rich in fermented foods enhances the diversity of gut microbes and decreases molecular signs of inflammation,” the School reported.
“I’m definitely sold on the idea of healthy bacteria for your gut,” said Connor Lawless, an Orford resident attending the celebration.
Others came to fermentation as a way to showcase area ingredients.

Alexandre Apfel, who owns Golden Rule Mead in Middlebury started the business six years ago, after he became interested in making natural wines. Calling himself a fermenter, Apfel uses fruit, herbs, honey and maple syrup in the production of the alcoholic mead.
“It matters what we’re making this stuff out of. I believe strongly in local food systems,” said Apfel, who works with beekeepers and gardeners in the Middlebury area. “I’m making a product that reflects the world around me.”
At the event, Suzanne Hawley, of Hanover, explored the products on sale and leafed through books on display. She is particularly interested in sourdough bread, which she makes at home using her own carefully-cultivated sourdough starter, which she named Zeke (short for Ezekiel).
Like Apfel, Hawley is drawn to the naturally occurring microcosmos of fermentation, in which the food or drink, in some ways, makes itself.
“It’s a living thing,” she said.

This week, Nebraska State Auditor Mike Foley beat them to the punch.
On Tuesday, Foley released his team’s examination of state costs to deliver Applied Behavioral Analysis services to Nebraskans. That’s a widely used therapeutic approach that helps youths with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental and social communication delays function better in society.

The auditor’s 24-page report noted deficiencies such as a few duplicate claims for ABA services submitted by certain companies, resulting in what the auditor described as needless costs being paid by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.
Foley said in a statement that the audit sample was “quite limited” and that more instances likely would surface with broader reach. He said the report offers DHHS insight and another “roadmap on how to mitigate this problem.”
“DHHS has a full plate in front of it as it addresses the rapidly expanding population of citizens needing ABA services while trying to control the budgetary impact of service delivery,” Foley said.
 Review was welcomed

The review was requested by DHHS CEO Steve Corsi, Foley said. Its findings come as DHHS has implemented changes to the ABA program — sparking controversy and challenges from families and advocates for youths with autism.
In August, DHHS reduced Medicaid reimbursement rates to providers of the services. Months earlier, it created and approved new guardrails aimed at more efficiency and accountability.
 

 Rising incidences of autism 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that one in 31 youths are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder today, compared to one in 150 kids 25 years ago.
The National Institute of Mental Health defines the condition as a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn and behave. Though it can be diagnosed at any age, symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life.



The attention came in light of ballooning state costs to provide ABA services. DHHS has said that before the August changes, Nebraska had the highest reimbursement rates of any state for the therapy. The agency said those higher rates contributed to the increase in state expenses from $4.6 million in 2000 to about $85.6 million last year.
State auditors said the number of companies working with DHHS through Heritage Health to deliver autism services to low-income and eligible young Nebraskans has nearly quadrupled in five years from 10 to 38.
DHHS Medicaid officials have said the agency’s recent efforts were intended to set clearer parameters, expectations and to rein in potential overauthorization of services. They said they’re cognizant and have monitored federal audits and multimillion-dollar fines levied against other states’ Medicaid-covered behavioral health programs, and want to minimize the risk to the state of federal efforts to claw back funds. 
Earlier this month, Nebraska lawmakers held a public hearing to hear how the recent state cuts to Medicaid reimbursement for ABA services had affected Nebraska and its youngest members on the autism spectrum. The hearing was part of an interim study to inform the Legislature how it might help ensure the viability of Medicaid-funded ABA services.
Foley said his team’s audit did not play a role in DHHS’ decision to revise reimbursement rates. He believes the rates were the driving reason for fast-rising costs and said the auditor’s review could provide insight into internal deficiencies that could lead to better efficiencies.
The audit, Foley said, revealed examples of costly, “erroneous” claims for reimbursement filed with the managed care organizations that process claims for the state’s Medicaid program and a need for better support documentation. 
Among deficiencies noted by state auditors:

Two claims appeared to be duplicate payments of claims previously paid, leading to potential overpayment of about $29,500.
A “significant number of claims” lacked adequate information on service providers. “Testing revealed, moreover, that the service provider designated in the claim data did not agree to the actual service provider for 87 of the 179 claims tested,” the report said.
Several providers “lacked professional credentials to be a service provider yet successfully billed DHHS for services,” Foley said. The audit report said lax qualification checks increase risk for children not receiving appropriate care. 
Limited testing showed one claim paid at a rate more than three times the approved Medicaid reimbursement rate, resulting in overpayment of $603. The provider agreed to repay the amount, the auditors noted.

The audit recommended continued review and update of service definitions for the ABA program and more specific guidance on documenting claims.
DHHS, in an overall response included in the audit report, said the agency appreciated the review that it asked for: “This collaborative effort provides the department with an objective review of the ABA program, which will be used to make program improvements.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)West Virginia National Guard personnel deployed to Washington, D.C. could be there until the end of November, but there’s no definite end to the operations. 
More than 300 members of the West Virginia National Guard have been in Washington, D.C., for more than a month as part of President Donald Trump’s unprecedented initiative “to restore cleanliness and safety” to the nation’s capital. 
“Currently, we are expecting all members of the West Virginia National Guard deployed for Operation DC Safe & Beautiful to be released from active duty prior to Nov. 30, 2025,” a spokesperson for the National Guard told West Virginia Watch in an email. 
“As with all military operations, that date may change based on operational needs as they occur. Our Guard is proud to support the President’s initiative to keep our Nation’s Capital safe and to demonstrate our commitment to a strong and secure America,” the statement said. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a staunch ally of Trump, ordered West Virginia National Guard members to Washington, D.C. in August following a request from the president. The deployment is federally funded, according to the governor’s office. Other Republican-led states, including Tenenssee and Ohio, have sent troops to the capital.  
There are around 2,500 guard members stationed throughout Washington, D.C, and they’re not authorized to make arrests. Troops have been patrolling alongside local police while also removing trash, mulching and removing graffiti in the city, Axios reports.
Last week, West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey co-led an amicus brief in support of the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C.
“The President has the authority, and the duty, to protect our nation’s capital,” McCuskey said in a statement. “The lawlessness in Washington, D.C., the result of years of soft-on-crime policies, was putting our nation at risk and finally, we have a President willing to step up to secure it.”
Violent crime is declining in the city, hitting a 30-year low in 2024, according to the Justice Department. 
Attorneys general from 22 other states are pushing back on Trump’s actions, supporting D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb’s lawsuit challenging the deployment of National Guard troops to the nation’s capital.
The attorneys general argue the deployment infringes on the police powers reserved to states and localities, and states need their national guards to respond to natural disasters and security at high-profile events.
Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C. is estimated to cost taxpayers roughly $200 million, reports USA Today. That figure doesn’t include the price of deploying personnel from additional states.

Visiting America’s national parks is a treasured public pastime. The wetlands of Congaree in South Carolina, the depths of the Grand Canyon in Arizona and the vistas provided by peaks in Yosemite in California are iconic American experiences for residents and for people who travel from other countries to vacation.
There are lots of benefits of visiting national parks, or parks in general. Spending time in nature is good for people’s mental health.
Moving in the outdoors – walking, biking, running, paddling – benefits people’s physical health. Sharing experiences with others helps build social connections with old friends or newfound ones. Visitors also learn about ecosystems and cultural history, developing their own relationship to the landscape.
National park visitation is growing, with record-high visitor numbers in 2024 across the entire 398-property system, as well as at the 63 formally designated national parks. And there has been a general trend of people gravitating to Instagram-popular parks, and even specific spots within popular parks.
Reductions in federal funding and staffing at national parks means visitors may see longer lines to enter parks or popular locations within them, fewer visitor services and educational programs, and fewer rangers to ask for advice or assistance.
As scholars of parks and recreation, we know crowded conditions make it harder to enjoy national parks. But we also know that if you plan carefully, you can create a great experience.

What gets in the way of fun?
In general, research identifies three main barriers to recreational fun.
One is how confident people are in their own physical abilities and how safe they feel in the park. For example, someone may want to go kayaking in Florida’s Everglades or Minnesota’s Voyageurs National Park but doesn’t know where to rent a boat, where to put it in the water, or which stretches of water are best for a beginner.

Another is the presence – or absence – of people to enjoy the space with, or family obligations or relationships that might preclude them from an activity.
Culture can also play a role in where people visit and what they do there.
For instance, a national park may be a source of escape where individuals seek autonomy and independence. For others, a national park visit can be a focal point for social gatherings and a time to reconnect with family and friends.
There are also external factors, like how much free time a person has for recreation and how easy it is to get to a national park from their home.
Someone may live a short drive from a national park but not visit simply because they do not know what they can do there, or how to have a positive experience.
More recently, research has also identified environmental barriers outside visitors’ control.
Thin ice or lack of snow prevents many winter activities in Colorado’s Rocky Mountain National Park and Maine’s Acadia National Park, just as excessive heat can decrease the attractiveness of summer recreation in parks like the Everglades or California’s Death Valley.
Extreme weather events such as inland flooding and coastal hurricanes can block roads and damage parks, posing both physical and logistical barriers in parks such as Cape Lookout National Seashore in North Carolina.
Wildlife habits also affect visitors, who may flock to an area where they can see wildlife. Or they may avoid – or may be restricted from – areas with dangerous wildlife.
Adapting to find enjoyment anyway
If the national park places you want to visit seem too busy, think about your options. You could change your travel dates to a less busy time. People who want to visit Yellowstone in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana could find campground reservations unavailable for some weeks but plentiful for other weeks – or they could choose to stay in a local hotel instead of camping.
You could try a different park or activity. For example, an angler who typically visits Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee to fish for trout may find that some streams are warming and no longer support this activity. They might go fishing elsewhere or stay in the Smokies and bird-watch, hike or read by a stream.
If you really want to visit during a busy time, you can also simply change your expectations, like not expecting Old Faithful to be a quiet place with only a few visitors.
Park personnel often seek to manage visitor numbers to protect the park from too much traffic, but also so everyone who visits can enjoy the experience. For example, implementing reservations for Acadia’s Cadillac Mountain at sunrise means at least some people get a relatively serene experience, as opposed to lots of people having an overcrowded experience.
Park staff also design park amenities so roads, boat ramps, trailheads and parking are in useful locations that work well for the number of visitors expected.
And park workers provide advance information for visitors, in brochures and on websites, charge fees for entry, conduct tours or other programs at the location – and ticket or arrest people who are in places or doing activities they’re not supposed to – to reduce the effects of overcrowding.
Reservations are required to enter Haleakalā National Park in Maui between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. to view sunrise from the summit of the volcano that rises more than 10,000 feet above sea level. Originally part of Hawaii National Park, Haleakalā (which means “house of the sun” in Hawaiian) became a separate national park in 1961. (Photo by Seanna Adcox/SC Daily Gazette)
Planning is key
We have found that the most effective way for people to have the park experiences they want, and enjoy them as much as they hope, is to plan ahead.
Planning can include looking at parks’ websites for ideas and considering the best time to visit – both for your own schedule and what you want to do.
Understanding the weather and climate of the region will help you determine what to bring, but also what conditions will be like if you’re hiking, paddling or driving.
Advance preparation definitely includes finding lodging – and making reservations whenever possible.
If reservations aren’t possible, see whether you can increase your chances of finding a place to sleep when you arrive by choosing lesser-visited parts of the park or identifying nearby backup options, such as state parks and private campgrounds, that might provide a break from the crowds.
And you can make sure you’re prepared for whatever you’re going to do, whether it’s getting used to walking long distances before a big hike or learning about local flora and fauna before you arrive.
Thinking ahead also means you can share your itinerary with friends and family – either as invitations to join you or for periodic safety check-ins.
It is also helpful to talk to park personnel. Park staff will have great insights into hidden gems that might be slightly off the beaten path but away from the crowds and able to provide a unique visitor experience. Rangers or other staff can help you determine the best choices for settings and activities that match your abilities, interests, time and needs.
And finally, don’t forget to be considerate of other visitors. Have patience in the parking lots, visitor centers, trailheads and lookout points. Others in the park seek the same awe-inspiring views and heart-pumping recreation activities as you. In many cases, it’s not the number of people but the attitudes and behaviors of those people that can make a place either feel crowded or like a community of like-minded outdoor enthusiasts.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)A Republican vacancy committee appointed Second Amendment activist Ava Flanell to represent Colorado’s House District 14 on Monday night.
Flanell will replace former Minority Leader Rose Pugliese, who resigned about one week ago. Republicans chose Rep. Jarvis Caldwell to replace Pugliese as minority leader.
“Ava is a small business owner, firearms instructor, and grassroots leader who has been a strong voice for protecting our Second Amendment rights. She will work tirelessly for the families of El Paso County and be a dedicated partner in our caucus,” Caldwell said in a Tuesday statement.

The El Paso County Republican Party did not have information about other candidates for the vacant position, the number of people in the vacancy committee or the vote breakdown when reached Tuesday morning.
Flanell hosts a podcast about the firearms industry and has a large online following. She regularly testifies at the Colorado Capitol against firearm regulations, including this year’s law mandating safety training for most semiautomatic rifle purchases. She has owned Elite Firearms and Training in Colorado Springs since 2013.
“I am not a career politician. I bring a fresh perspective with over a decade of experience as a small business owner, firearms instructor, and gun rights advocate. Like many of you, I have dedicated my time, talent, and treasure to the grassroots work of helping to flip seats and defend our conservative principles,” she wrote in a social media post announcing her intent to run for the vacant seat. The post was accompanied by a photo with her and President Donald Trump.
Flanell joins two other Republicans who were appointed during the interim: Rep. Scott Slaugh replaced former Rep. Ryan Armagost and Sen. Lynda Zamora Wilson in Senate District replaced former Sen. Paul Lundeen.
The Legislature is set to reconvene in January. Democrats control strong majorities in both chambers.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)IDAHO FALLS – If Idaho is going to lead a nuclear renaissance in America, Idaho legislators and other policy makers must focus on workforce development, training and educational opportunities, Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner said. 
Wagner emphasized the importance of workforce development and education during the Western Governors’ Association’s two-day Energy Superabundance conference held Monday and Tuesday at Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls.  
‘Searching for energy solutions,’ Idaho Gov. Little creates new task force to advance nuclear energy

During the conference, Wagner told Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox that America is in the middle of a nuclear renaissance and Idaho National Laboratory is in the process of building and permitting new nuclear reactors for the first time in 50 years to help meet the country’s increasing energy demands. 
To tackle the challenge and lead the renaissance, Idaho will need a robust workforce with a variety of skills, Wagner said. 
“When you think about your path, fast forward, and we’re building out many reactors in the West and beyond. It’s not just about nuclear engineers anymore,” Wagner said in an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun. “It’s about welders. It’s about all the different crafts. It’s about nuclear operators.”
SUB: Idaho National Laboratory director says Launch program can help state’s workforce pipeline
Wagner said Little’s Idaho Launch program, which provides up to $8,000 for Idaho students to receive career-technical training or enroll in eligible higher education programs tied to in-demand careers, is an excellent program that he supports.
“Making that easier to get first-generation college graduates into the pipeline is fantastic,” Wagner told the Sun. “I myself am a first generation college graduate, so l love that. That’s a great example of what can be done.”
Little has continuously championed the Idaho Launch program, but funding has come under fire over the past two years by conservative Republican legislators looking to reduce state spending. 
Wagner also said new workforce training initiatives need to be launched. He suggested Idaho legislators could look to the Navy Nuclear Power School for ideas and best practices to replicate in Idaho. The Navy Nuclear Power School is a technical training program that helps train enlisted students and officers in math, physics and other disciplines to prepare students to work in nuclear power for the Navy. 










When you think about your path, fast forward, and we're building out many reactors in the West and beyond. It's not just about nuclear engineers anymore. It's about welders. It's about all the different crafts. It's about nuclear operators.


– John Wagner, Idaho National Laboratory director


Wagner did not have a specific proposal to put forward, but suggested Idaho elected officials could leverage the state’s existing higher education institutions like the College of Eastern Idaho, Idaho State University, Boise State University, University of Idaho and more to develop a workforce training program to prepare students to work at Idaho National Laboratory or in the nuclear industry. 
Wagner said he has met with leaders in Utah and Idaho about creating the equivalent of a nuclear power school located in the West.
“How do you leverage what’s there, adjust the curriculum, and provide that sort of package?” Wagner said. “I would love to see us do something like that.”
Nuclear Regulatory Commission Commissioner Bradley Crowell also emphasized the importance of developing a competent and reliable workforce when he spoke Monday during the Energy Superabundance conference at INL.
“My biggest concern I shared with (Govs. Little and Cox): the highest hurdle to success, going forward, is workforce,” Crowell said Monday. “That’s workforce both for trade and scientists and engineers, et cetera. In the private sector, there’s not enough there – they are hiring actively. And on the government side, in the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) we have serious current workforce shortcomings that are going to be exacerbated going forward.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Idaho National Laboratory has hired 700 to 1,000 employees per year recently

As one of the state’s largest employers, Idaho National Laboratory will continue to need a robust and skilled workforce, Wagner said. 
The INL has experienced significant growth in the past seven years, Wagner said. It increased its workforce from about 4,000 employees roughly seven years ago to about 6,000 employees today.
Over the past couple of years, the Idaho National Laboratory has hired between 700 and 1,000 people a year, Wagner said. Although he does not see that level of growth continuing now that he views INL’s staff as “right-sized,” Wagner said the lab will need to continue to hire staff due to attrition, retirement and the need for specialized skills and positions. 
“Which is still significant when you’re talking about 6,000 people,” Wagner said. “So we will continue to have those needs.”
Wagner said Idaho National Laboratory employees have not been subject to workforce reductions, early retirement buyouts and deferred resignations that have affected the federal government this year, because INL employees are not federal employees. The U.S. Department of Energy owns the laboratory, but it hires a contractor, Battelle Energy Alliance, to operate and manage the lab. Instead of being federal employees, the Idaho National Laboratory’s workforce are Battelle Energy Alliance employees.
The Energy Superabundance conference wrapped up Tuesday.
On Monday, Little and Cox spoke about the significant increase in projected energy demand, which is fueled in part by the growth of AI data centers and large commercial/industrial projects. On Monday, Little created a new Idaho Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force, which he says replaces and modernizes the Idaho Leadership in Nuclear Energy Commission, or LINE Commission, that his predecessor, former Idaho Gov. Butch Otter, created.

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville after a jury convicted him in a federal corruption case. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Six years after being bounced from the Tennessee House speakership, former Rep. Glen Casada was sentenced Tuesday to 36 months in prison for his role in a kickback scheme.
U.S. District Judge Eli Richardson meted out the punishment to Casada on 14 counts of fraud, bribery, theft, conspiracy and money laundering in connection with a shell company called Phoenix Solutions run by his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren, who was sentenced to 30 months last week.
Casada also must pay a $30,000 fine and remain on probation for one year once he serves his time. Defense attorneys said they will appeal the case to a higher court.
Attorneys for Casada and Cothren requested a mistrial during their four-week trial that stretched from mid-April into May after prosecutors inadvertently played an unredacted recording of an FBI interview with Casada that incriminated Cothren. They also sought a new trial just before sentencing, but Richardson denied the request.
Casada and Cothren were convicted of setting up the secret company that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”
Casada’s attorneys argued Tuesday that he was merely trying to start a new business, Right Way Consulting, that caught the eye of federal investigators.
Richardson acquitted Casada and Cothren of three counts of fraudulently obtaining state property because the prosecution was unable to prove they were agents of the state.
Cothren resigned from his chief of staff post in early 2019 amid a racist and sexist texting scandal. Casada stepped down from the speaker’s post following a no-confidence vote spurred by heavy-handed leadership and the scandal surrounding Cothren. 
He remained in the General Assembly for one more term, though, when he got involved with Cothren and Smith in the Phoenix Solutions scheme. The trio tried to conceal Cothren’s identity because of his resignation and direct business to Phoenix Solutions. In turn, they received money from the business in the form of kickbacks, according to federal prosecutors.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Two men arrested earlier this month after police found a bomb under a news vehicle now face charges stemming from the search of their home.
Adeeb Nasir, 58, and Adil Justice Ahmed Nasir, 31, are each charged with two counts of manufacturing, possessing, selling or using a weapon of mass destruction, both second-degree felonies.
Adeeb Nasir also faces two third-degree felony charges of possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person due to controlled substance use.
The two men are being held without bail as the investigation continues.
The charges filed late Monday do not mention the suspicious device that was found under a news vehicle Sept. 12 while it was parked next to an occupied building in Salt Lake City. Jail booking affidavits for the two men said the incendiary device was real and had been lit, but the fuse malfunctioned. 
FOX 13 News reported the targeted vehicle was part of its fleet.  
According to the charges, investigators executed a search warrant on the men’s home on the 2700 South block of 8500 West found what appeared to be a stick of dynamite with a blasting cap and fuse in a kitchen cabinet, and another in Adeeb Nasir’s bedroom closet. Because the men told investigators the explosives were real, the home and surrounding area were evacuated.
Bomb technicians determined the dynamite was fake, the charges say.
Investigators also found marijuana and multiple firearms in the home.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the incident. In a statement, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said his office cannot comment on the federal investigation. 
News of the incendiary device under a Utah news vehicle is not the first case of an apparent attack on media this month. On Friday, shots were fired through a window of the ABC10 news building, according to the Sacramento Bee. A Sacramento man, 64-year-old Anibal Hernandez Santana, faces three felony charges of firing a gun at an inhabited building, assault with a deadly weapon and firing a gun in a negligent manner, the Bee reported.

UVM Larner College of Medicine alumna Imelda Muller is one of NASA’s 10 new astronaut candidates, out of a pool of 8,000, the space agency announced Monday. 
“With upcoming exploration missions, we are pushing the boundaries of human performance. The lessons that we learn, the knowledge that we gain, all of these things are going to help us excel not just in space but in areas of human health here on Earth. The future of medicine is now, and I’m incredibly honored to be here with this team, Muller said during NASA’s announcement at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. 
Muller, an anesthesiologist, graduated from the medical school in 2017 and then worked as an undersea medical officer following training at the Naval Undersea Medical Institute, in Connecticut. She studied in the Naval Medical Center in San Diego and became a naval lieutenant. She did her residency in anesthesia and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
“That experience gave me the opportunity to work with multidisciplinary teams in experimental and saturation diving, and I developed a passion for learning about the way the body adapts in extreme environments,” Muller said at the announcement event. “This led me to pursue medical residency training in anesthesia, where I deepened that understanding of how our body responds when it’s under stress. I am incredibly excited to be here alongside this team and to build on that foundation.”
Before coming to UVM, Muller studied behavioral neuroscience as an undergraduate at Northeastern University.  
Now, she and the other nine candidates will go through two years of NASA training to become eligible for flight assignments. The program will include spacewalk simulations and survival training.
Muller is one of two in the astronaut training class with a medical background and, at 34, is one of the youngest on the team.  
“The UVM community is thrilled to see Dr. Imelda Muller joining NASA’s newest cadre of astronaut candidates,” UVM President Marlene Tromp said in the university’s press release. She also attended the announcement event at the Johnson Space Center. 
UVM is part of the Vermont Space Grant Consortium, a NASA partner program that connects those interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics projects with opportunities to work with the space agency. Many Larner students have participated in a four-week Aerospace Medicine Clerkship at the Johnson Space Center.

,DC,2025-09-23 19:26:45+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,'Your countries are going to hell': Trump lashes out at world leaders at UN,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/your-countries-are-going-hell-trump-lashes-out-world-leaders-un,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump harshly criticized fellow world leaders Tuesday at the United Nations General Assembly days after key allies of the United States recognized a Palestinian state, and as NATO vows to defend Europe amid recent Russian air incursions.During his nearly hour-long address at the annual meeting in New York City, Trump briefly brushed on the Israel-Hamas war and his frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But the U.S. president focused much of his attention on the “double-tailed monster” of immigration and energy that he said will cause Europe to “fail.”“Your countries are going to hell,” Trump said, later adding: “And I'm really good at predicting things.” “I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail. And if you don't stop people that you've never seen before, that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail,” Trump continued.Trump said the U.S. stands “ready to provide any country with abundant, affordable energy supplies if you need them, when most of you do,” and specifically encouraged the purchase of U.S. oil and gas.The president attacked multilateral agreements to combat climate change, namely the Paris Climate Accord, and panned the overwhelmingly accepted science as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion.”Trump blames UN for faulty escalator, teleprompterTrump attacked the U.N. as a body numerous times throughout his speech, including for what he claimed were a faulty escalator and teleprompter Tuesday.“I don't mind making this speech without a teleprompter, because the teleprompter is not working. I feel very happy to be up here with you nevertheless, and that way you speak more from the heart, I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,” Trump said at the top of his remarks.Trump claimed he ended “seven wars” without the help of the U.N.“All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that on the way up stopped right in the middle. If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would have fallen, but she's in great shape. We're both in good shape. We both stood,” he said. “And then a teleprompter that didn't work. These are the two things I got from the United Nations, a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter. Thank you very much.”U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock refuted Trump’s claim following his speech, saying, “As we are receiving queries, I would like to assure you that don’t worry, the U.N. teleprompters are working perfectly.”Trump meets with ZelenskyyTrump’s remarks came after negotiations to end Russia’s continued invasion into Ukraine have failed, despite Trump welcoming Putin to Alaska last month.Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for roughly an hour on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting Tuesday afternoon, where Trump said “we have great respect for the fight that Ukraine is putting up. It’s pretty amazing actually.”Zelenskyy said he would brief the president on “good news” from the battlefield and said “we will continue until Russia will stop this war.”Zelenskyy also highlighted conversations with European leaders regarding cutting off dependence on Russian oil and gas.When asked by the press if he thinks NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft if they enter their airspace, Trump responded “Yes, I do,” according to journalists traveling with him. Trump added it “depends on the circumstance” whether or not the U.S. would back up NATO allies.When asked for an update on negotiations with Putin and if he still trusts the Russian president, Trump told reporters “I'll let you know in about a month from now.” Gaza crisisThe U.S. president’s speech to world leaders also comes after Israel all but blindsided the U.S. two weeks ago with a strike on Qatar, a key Middle East ally that hosts both a massive U.S. military presence as well as the Hamas political offices. Trump received applause as he called for Hamas militants to release the remaining hostages kidnapped from Israel nearly two years ago during the group’s brutal attack. But he criticized any recognition of a Palestinian state as “a reward for these horrible atrocities.”On Monday, France joined more than 150 countries to recognize Palestinian statehood. The United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Portugal declared recognition Sunday.Numerous world leaders, including those from Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey and Jordan, spoke on the assembly floor Tuesday about the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. More than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities. The U.N. has declared a famine in the roughly 25-mile-long coastal strip that borders Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.“The terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas are indefensible from any angle, but nothing, absolutely nothing, justifies the ongoing genocide in Gaza,” Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said before Trump took the floor.“Under tons of rubble are buried tens of thousands of innocent women and children. There we can see that international humanitarian law and the myth of ethical exceptionalism of the West are also being buried there. This massacre would not have happened without the complicity of those who could have prevented it,” da Silva said.Trump touts mass deportationsAdministration officials seated at the U.S. table in the assembly hall included Trump’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, Middle East Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and recently confirmed U.N. Ambassador Mike Waltz, according to journalists traveling with the president. Trump touted his domestic policies, including mass deportations and sending federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to Democratic-led American cities. “Our message is very simple, if you come illegally into the United States, you're going to jail, or you're going back to where you came from, or perhaps even further than that. You know what that means,” Trump said.He then thanked the El Salvadoran government for its “successful and professional job they've done in receiving and jailing so many criminals that entered our country.”The U.S. agreed to pay El Salvador $4.76 million in March to detain up to 300 immigrant men, many of them Venezuelan nationals, for up to a year at a notorious mega-prison where several maintain they faced physical and psychological torture. Many argue they were wrongfully deported and are not affiliated with criminal gangs the administration has targeted.Brazil, VenezuelaTrump also lauded his global tariff policy as his strategy to “defend our sovereignty and security throughout the world, including against nations that have taken advantage of former U.S. administrations for decades.”He called out da Silva by name, saying he and the Brazilian leader quickly agreed before he walked on the floor to meet next week.“I'm very sorry to say this, Brazil is doing poorly and will continue to do poorly. They can only do well when they're working with us,” Trump said.Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods coming into the U.S. after its Supreme Court prosecuted former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for plotting a coup. Trump has dubbed the prosecution a “witch hunt.”The U.S. Supreme Court will take up the question in November on whether Trump’s sweeping global tariffs are legal.Trump also remarked on the U.S. military’s increased activity in the Caribbean Sea.“Let's put it this way, people don't like taking big loads of drugs in boats anymore,” he said, referring to recent deadly U.S. strikes on boats near the coast of Venezuela.The administration alleges the boats are involved in illegal drug smuggling. Trump’s use of deadly military force against the vessels has drawn both criticism and praise from U.S. lawmakers.",,,,2025-09-23 15:58:15.872027

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)A federal judge has cleared the way for work to resume on an offshore wind farm in New England, ruling Monday that the Trump administration failed to justify its order to stop work on the nearly complete Revolution Wind project.
U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said the administration had failed to substantiate its claims that the project would cause national security risks, the Rhode Island Current reported, calling the order “the height of arbitrary and capricious action.”
Lamberth said the government’s stop-work order jeopardized the $6.2 billion project, causing “irreparable harm.” The project, which is 80% complete, is slated to provide more than 700 megawatts of power by the end of 2026. 
Trump has crushed offshore wind plans, but states haven’t quite given up hope

State leaders and grid operators in New England have said the Trump administration’s order is a threat to grid reliability and energy prices. Revolution Wind, which will provide power to Connecticut and Rhode Island, will make up about 2.5% of the power across New England. 
The attorneys general in Connecticut and Rhode Island joined project developers in suing the government, asking for work to resume. 
“The Trump Administration should see the writing on the wall with this decision and drop its defense of their indefensible actions,” Connecticut Attorney General Tong said in a statement. “Every day that this project is stymied is a day of lost employment, another day of unaffordable energy costs, and another day burning fossil fuels when American-made clean energy is within reach.”
Project developers for Revolution Wind said they will resume work as quickly as possible. Trump officials did not say whether they will appeal the ruling. 
President Donald Trump has waged an all-out assault on offshore wind, halting leases for new projects, revoking permits, canceling funding to support manufacturing and ports, and threatening even projects that are under construction. 
Last week, the Interior Department sought to remand approvals for projects it had previously permitted in Maryland and New England, The New Bedford Light reported.

Vicki Lopez and Rep. Toby Overdorf speak to reporters after a House property tax committee meeting. (Photo by Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)After months of financial abuse allegations lobbed by Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration against local governments, city leaders pushed back Tuesday in a Florida House meeting focused on cutting property taxes.
“Waste is in the eye of the beholder,” said Casey Cook, the Florida League of Cities’ chief of legislative affairs. “Nobody likes paying taxes, but safe isn’t free. Clean isn’t free.”
Cook, joined by other county and city leaders, spoke Tuesday morning during the Florida House’s fourth meeting of the Select Committee on Property Taxes, hosted to explore the best way to slash the “most hated tax” and bring relief to Floridians struggling under the weight of rising costs.
DeSantis and top leaders have targeted local governments over property tax levels, decrying city and county officials for alleged rampant “waste, fraud, and abuse” at a slew of statewide press conferences.
But on Tuesday, local government officials took the public stage for the first time to claim that that’s not true.
“One person’s community amenity could be the next person’s biggest waste ever,” Cook said, noting the subjectivity of how property tax allocations can benefit some citizens and over-tax others. “And one person’s exemption is another person’s tax increase.”
Property taxes vary city to city and county to county, contributing roughly 47% of public school funding statewide. They also help pay for public safety operations, which include law enforcement, fire stations, and emergency management. In 2024, counties spent a total of $60.17 billion, $16.13 billion of which went to public safety, said Davin Suggs, deputy executive eirector of the Florida Association of Counties.
Rep. Vicki Lopez, a Miami Republican who co-chairs the Florida House’s property tax committee, said that the local governments’ presentations made her more clearly understand the case-by-case basis that different cities and counties operate on when it comes to property tax, making a one-size-fits-all approach to the dilemma far less likely, she told reporters after the four-hour meeting.
“I do believe that today we’ve learned maybe there are some counties and cities that are doing it right, and maybe there are counties and cities that need a little help in reducing their expenses,” Lopez said, adding that she looks forward to the Florida DOGE team’s findings from the seven counties and five municipalities they’ve investigated.
Despite the difficulty, Lopez and co-chair Rep. Toby Overdorf, a Palm City Republican, “absolutely” believe that at least one constitutional amendment on property taxes will be on the ballot in 2026.
What is DOGE doing for property taxes?
DeSantis has repeatedly called for property tax cuts to ease homeowners’ financial burdens. He pressured the Florida Legislature during the 2025 session for property tax relief, but lawmakers struggled to determine how to balance slashing property taxes while still funding key public institutions.
To address the situation, the House created a 37-member property tax committee while DeSantis directed his new DOGE team to investigate local governments for alleged “waste, fraud, and abuse” — some of which he claims is driving up property tax rates.
On Tuesday, Leda Kelly, director of the Office of Policy and Budget in the Executive Office of the Governor, presented an overview of the Florida DOGE team. She faced minimal questioning from lawmakers, but insisted the team remains “committed” to locating efficiency and stomping out inefficiency across local governments.
Democrat Rep. Anna Eskamani, representing Orlando, isn’t so sure.
“I do find it ironic that the search for efficiency can be so inefficient,” she said. Eskamani referenced DOGE hiring a team leader, Eric Soskin, while “co-opting” other department employees into the task force.
Cook touched on a similar vein when he was asked to detail the salaries of local government workers in a question hinting at some city managers who rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars. Cook pointed out that nearly 2,000 state employees make more than DeSantis’s $141K yearly salary. Beyond that, DeSantis’ cost of living is nearly entirely footed by the taxpayer, he said.
“The governor has a security detail, his family has a security detail, the governor has a driver, probably part of the security detail, and when the governor travels, he travels on a private plane,” Cook said, adding that DeSantis lives in Tallahassee’s Governor’s Mansion.
“If you were to break that down with a total cost to the taxpayer, I would wager that the typical city manager makes less than 10-20 times the total compensation of the governor.”
One of those state employees who makes more than the governor is Soskin. His salary is more than $197K.

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The son of a Calhoun County woman murdered in 1997 urged Gov. Kay Ivey Tuesday to stop Thursday’s planned execution of the man convicted of killing her.
Will Berry, the son of Margaret Parrish Barry, requested that Ivey halt the execution for West before accompanying a group to deliver a petition to the Governor’s Office signed by people who opposed the execution scheduled for Thursday.
“There shouldn’t be any more dead,” Will Berry said to the roughly 20 people who attended the event. “There should be healing and moving forward with this. I would like a relationship with Geoffrey West and his family from here on out. I do not want this man to die.”

West was convicted by a jury in 1999 for his role in the murder of Margaret Parrish in 1997. His execution is scheduled to take place in a 30-hour window starting at midnight on Thursday until 6 a.m. by nitrogen gas, and so far, West does not have any appeals pending in attempts to stop the pending execution.
Berry, who has written about his desire to meet West,  said that he and his family had forgiven West and did not want Alabama to carry out the execution in his name.
“Forgiveness is a commandment,” Will Berry said in an interview on Monday. “It helps me in my own heart with the Lord. Vengeance is the Lord’s, not mine or the state of Alabama. I don’t want his mother to have to go through this, or his family.”
Berry said the path to forgiveness began years ago when he said to his spouse that he wanted to help West get out from death row.
He said he requested a meeting with West but that the Alabama Department of Corrections denied his request, citing policy, according to Will Berry.
“I would not ask him anything,” Will Berry said. “I would tell him I love him, I forgive him. My mother forgives him. We love him and his family.”
A spokesperson for the ADOC said that the request was denied because it would violate the department’s policy to allow families of the victim to meet with the person scheduled to be executed.
“An individual who is a victim of an inmate will not be approved to visit,” the administrative regulation states about people who want to visit the person to be executed.
A message was sent to Ivey Tuesday seeking comment.
As of Tuesday afternoon, there have not been any new appeals filed to challenge the scheduled execution.
Ivey scheduled West’s execution in July.
According to court documents, a jury convicted West of capital murder in 1999 after he and his girlfriend at the time entered an Etowah County convenience store that he previously worked to rob the location. Margaret Berry was working at the convenience store when West shot and killed her, later taking $250 from the store.
If the execution takes place on Friday, it will be fourth execution in Alabama for 2025 , and the third time it will use nitrogen gas as the method of execution.
Alabama executed Demetrius Terrence Frazier in February and Gregory Hunt in June, both times by nitrogen gas. It also put James Osgood to death by lethal injection in April.
Ivey said she scheduled the execution of Anthony Boyd in October by nitrogen gas while the execution of David Lee Roberts was delayed after Marion County Circuit Judge Lee Carter issued a stay of execution to have him evaluated to determine his mental capacity to be executed.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7401-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 15:58:15.872027

Political violence is no longer an abstract threat but a heavy reality for Americans.
In recent months, we have seen Pennsylvania’s Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family targeted during Passover, a Minnesota state legislator and her husband assassinated in their own home, another Minnesota legislator and his wife shot  and now the high-profile killing of Charlie Kirk at a college campus rally. Most Americans are struggling to make sense of the state of our union.
Political fallout related to Kirk’s assassination has been immediate with a chilling effect spreading beyond violence itself.
ABC talk show host Jimmy Kimmel was yanked off the air temporarily for remarks he made about Kirk’s death. Both private citizens and public figures face the threat of professional ruin for speaking, or being perceived as speaking, too freely.

America is wounded. And the role of public officials should be obvious: lower the temperature, uphold the rule of law and safeguard citizens’ rights. Instead, state Auditor Shad White – the first millennial to serve in statewide office in Mississippi – chose to weaponize his platform and power against two women for expressing their views on their personal social media accounts.
On Sept. 11, Auditor White logged onto Facebook and X where he published the headshot, contact information and social media account of a University of Mississippi employee. Two days later, he doxed another Mississippian — a small business owner in Lucedale. With the Lucedale woman, White took it a step further and advised: “Everyone, I would buy from a differently owned local business if I were you.”
What followed should have been predictable and completely foreseeable to a Harvard-trained lawyer like White. Both women and their families received threats. Both now face the possibility of losing livelihoods and reputations they worked years to build.
This was not auditing. This was intimidation. This was the state’s chief watchdog turning his authority into a cudgel against his own constituents.
As state auditor, White has lawful tools at his disposal if he truly believes a public employee engaged in misconduct: internal reviews, disciplinary referrals, even formal investigations. Those mechanisms ensure due process that is the constitutional safeguard protecting every American from arbitrary government action.
White substituted the rule of law for online outrage in direct retaliation against private citizens for speech protected by the First Amendment.
When government officials weaponize their office to punish speech, it doesn’t just chill debate. It endangers lives. The predictable harassment these women now face is not an unfortunate accident; it is the natural consequence of a public official broadcasting their personal information to an inflamed audience of more than 38,000 followers.
What White did is not just bad judgment but an abuse of office. Elected officials swear an oath to their constituents and are bound by fiduciary duties to the taxpayers they serve. Using state resources and official platforms for personal political gain violates that trust and exposes the state, and its taxpayers, to legal liability.
It also sets a precedent no Mississippian wants: Your livelihood, your safety and your family can be put at risk at the whim of a politician chasing clicks. Today, it’s two women who criticized Charlie Kirk. Tomorrow, it could be anyone who dares to speak against those in power.
The irony should not escape anyone: White, who publicly champions Christian conservative values, singled out two vulnerable women at a moment when violence against political dissent dominates national headlines.
True leadership requires empathy and restraint. In his post about the woman in Lucedale, White wrote: “There is no place for political violence in America, even if you disagree with (Kirk).” It is baffling that White condemns political violence when it suits his brand of politics but remains silent while his own actions incite harassment against the very people he swore an oath to protect.
I’ve spent my career representing people and businesses facing government overreach and government failure, often when the stakes are high and emotion flows freely. What happened here in Mississippi is not a local story but a case study in how fragile constitutional protections become when officials place ambition above duty.
From Kimmel being pulled off air, to women in Lucedale and Oxford receiving threats, to families grieving after senseless acts of political violence, the throughline is clear: When speech is chilled, due process is eliminated. When power is abused, our civil rights are not safe.
That is why I fight in the courtroom and in the public square to hold government accountable and to ensure that, even in moments of chaos, the rule of law remains.
If Mississippi’s auditor believes weaponizing his office against his own citizens is acceptable conduct, then he has disqualified himself from holding any public office going forward. Because in America, we do not audit dissent. We audit dollars.

 “After a series of recent medical tests, I have been diagnosed with Large B-Cell Lymphoma, a serious but treatable form of cancer,” Alves said in a statement. “I have begun treatment, and I am in good hands with my team of doctors.”
The diagnosis comes in the midst of Alves’ campaign for reelection to a second two-year term as mayor of Danbury, a racially diverse city of 88,000 on the state’s southwestern border with New York.
“My prognosis is strong, and I will continue to serve Danbury as Mayor, our state as Chair of the Connecticut Democratic Party, and in all of my responsibilities, which I take very seriously,” he said in the statement. Those responsibilities include continuing his campaign, a spokeswoman said.
His statement did not disclose where or how he was being treated, nor did it state at what stage it was diagnosed. His spokeswoman later said said he will be treated with chemotherapy.
Alves, who could not be reached for comment, indicated in his statement a desire to strike a balance between transparency and privacy.
“While this is a deeply personal matter for my family and me, I believe it is important to be transparent with the community I serve,” Alves said. 
Alves, 42, is a Brazilian immigrant who came to the U.S. as a child and became a U.S. citizen in 2017.

Mike Braun proclaimed that he'll ""be that voice"" for Hoosier ratepayers angry about rising utility bills.","Indiana Gov. Mike Braun and Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzie Jaworowski hold a news conference at the Statehouse on Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Applications opened on Tuesday to join the powerful body that regulates Indiana’s utility companies — and sets their rates.
Gov. Mike Braun is seeking “entrepreneurial” candidates to fill three vacancies on the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and take on rising customer bills.
“If you’re interested in protecting ratepayers, ensuring Indiana has a stable energy supply … and if you can bring objectivity and fairness to the table, we want to hear from you,” Braun said.

Interested candidates can apply here. Applications are due Oct. 14th.

“We will ensure that energy progress doesn’t come at the expense of Hoosier ratepayers’ ability to afford their energy bills,” he added, speaking during a Tuesday news conference.
Commissioners Sarah Freeman and Wesley Bennett are leaving in October — months before their terms were set to end — and Chair Jim Huston’s term lapsed in April, but he will remain until a replacement is chosen.
Braun finalized a nominating committee, which will conduct interviews after the application period ends Oct. 14.
He named three appointees: Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzie Jaworowski; former state Rep. Dollyne Sherman; and Cory Cochran, an executive at commercial construction firm McRae Enterprises.
They join four appointees by the Indiana General Assembly:

Indiana Senate Republicans: Jim Merritt, president of JWM Consulting Corp. and a former state senator.
Indiana House Democrats: Grant Smith, a senior energy policy adviser at the Civil Society Institute.
Indiana House Republicans: Bill Champion, of corrugated pipe manufacturer Fratco.
Indiana Senate Democrats: Lindsay Shipps Haake, a government affairs specialist who has lobbied for utility customer advocates.

Asked if the nominating committee already has candidates in mind, Jaworowski said, “No, a lot of people have expressed interest, but we don’t know who will apply yet.”
The group will make recommendations, but final decisions are up to Braun.
Indiana is in the minority of states that gives the executive branch complete control over utility regulator selection.
In 13 states, they’re elected — mostly by voters, but also by lawmakers or political parties, according to research by Citizens Action Coalition, a utility customer advocacy group. 
In 33 states, regulators are appointed but must be confirmed by the legislative branch. Appointed regulators in Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada and New Hampshire aren’t.
Braun names next top utility customer advocate, tees up regulator overhaul

The IURC is charged with ensuring that utilities provide safe, reliable service at just and reasonable rates. It is “an advocate of neither the public nor the utilities,” according to its website.
But Braun suggested it has leaned too far in one direction.
“Ratepayers, I think, have taken the brunt of it,” he told reporters — and called the affordability uproar “very analogous to what we went through on property taxes.”
Braun asserted that, just as taxpayers didn’t have high-powered lobbyists representing them in the property tax debate, “probably ratepayers don’t” when it comes to utilities.
“That’s where someone’s got to be a voice for it,” he said. “And I will be that voice.”
Braun also named a new leader for the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor this month. Counselor Abby Gray’s first public action was to recommend denial of one utility company’s proposed hike — and endorse reductions in its current rates.
“Utility companies … had legitimate cost increases,” Braun said. “But whenever you go beyond covering your costs and it looks like you’re trying to do more, then you’re taking advantage of a system that needs to be a little more attentive.”

(Courtesy of University of South Dakota)A University of South Dakota art professor facing the loss of his job over his online comments about the killing of Charlie Kirk filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to stop the university and state Board of Regents from terminating his employment.
Michael Hook, a tenured art professor, is alleging his placement on administrative leave and impending termination are a violation of his constitutional right to free speech. Hook wrote social media posts on his personal account in reaction to the killing of Kirk, a prominent conservative political commentator who was fatally shot on Sept. 10 during a public event a Utah university.
Hook’s first post on Sept. 10 after the shooting included profanity and used a derogatory term to describe Kirk. Hook questioned the difference in coverage and “concern” between Kirk’s killing and the killing of a Minnesota legislator this summer and other school shootings.
He deleted the original and posted an apology “to those who were offended” three hours later.
South Dakota political leaders, including Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden and Republican House Speaker Jon Hansen, criticized Hook and publicly supported his termination.

Other educators around the country are also facing termination or discipline after sharing opinions on social media about the killing. An Iowa teacher, a South Carolina teacher aide and a Ball State employee filed lawsuits over their terminations following social media posts. A Sioux Falls School District staff member was terminated last year after she made a social media post about an assassination attempt on President Donald Trump.
Hook’s lawsuit says his impending termination and the South Dakota Board of Regents’ “overbroad regulation of speech” will have a chilling effect on free speech in the state for professors, students and citizens.
Hook and his attorney, Jim Leach, of Rapid City, filed the lawsuit in South Dakota federal court, calling the premise for the termination “vague, overbroad and unconstitutional.” The lawsuit seeks orders preventing retaliation against Hook, ending his administrative leave and canceling a Sept. 29 personal conference with him.
The lawsuit says Hook’s social media posts are protected political speech under the U.S. Constitution and do not impact his professional role at the university. 
“The debate about Mr. Kirk’s beliefs is for the marketplace of ideas,” the lawsuit says. “The First Amendment guarantees the marketplace stays open. The government may not punish people for their ideas.”
The Board of Regents filed an intent to fire Hook after the post circulated online. Spokeswoman Shuree Mortenson said the organization doesn’t comment on pending litigation.
The University of South Dakota notified Hook about his imminent termination on Sept. 12, based on the system’s termination policy regarding “neglect of duty, misconduct, incompetence, abuse of power or other actions that manifest an unfitness to discharge the trust reposed in public university faculty members or to perform assigned duties.” 
Under the policy, Hook is able to attend a personal conference “to discuss” his planned termination. Hook is placed on administrative leave until he is officially fired or another decision is made.
The employee code of conduct establishes that when faculty “speak or write as private citizens on matters of public concern” they are “free of institutional censorship or discipline.” At the same time, their “special position in the community imposes special obligations.”

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)Washington’s secretary of state on Tuesday denied the Trump administration’s request for personal information contained in the state’s voter rolls, saying to hand over the data would violate state and federal law.
Secretary Steve Hobbs told the Department of Justice he would be willing to provide voter names, addresses, genders, years of birth, voting records, registration dates and registration numbers. But he wouldn’t give dates of birth, driver license numbers and the last four digits of social security numbers. He wrote that information is protected under Washington law.
“As Washington state’s chief elections officer, I take my duty to protect voters and the sensitive information they entrust to the state very seriously,” Hobbs said in a statement. “While we will provide the DOJ with the voter registration data that state law already makes public, we will not compromise the privacy of Washington voters by turning over confidential information that both state and federal law prohibit us from disclosing.”
Hobbs’ position sets the stage for another legal clash between the state and the Trump administration.
Last week, the Justice Department sued Oregon and Maine for rejecting its demand for personal information contained in the states’ voter rolls.
The Justice Department requested the voter data from Washington two weeks ago amid its ongoing search for evidence to back up President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud caused by immigrants without legal status voting. Similar letters have gone to many states.
It’s one of several ways the Trump administration has pushed to get state data it otherwise wouldn’t receive. 
Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant attorney general in the DOJ’s civil rights division, cited compliance with the National Voter Registration Act and Help America Vote Act as the reason for the request for Washington’s confidential data. Specifically, Dhillon said she wanted to ensure the state was adequately updating its voter list. 
But Hobbs, a Democrat who oversees the state’s elections, worried “this is not the real reason for your request,” he wrote in his response Tuesday. 
Hobbs fears the information would be shared with the Department of Homeland Security to fuel the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. He notes that the information he is willing to give “should be more than sufficient to assess Washington’s list maintenance efforts.”
Hobbs is also concerned the collection could violate federal privacy law. He asked Dhillon, a former legal adviser to Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign, to explain how the request complies with such laws, and for clarification on how the data would be used.
“In addition to ensuring that Washington’s voter registration list complies with all applicable federal and state laws, my obligation also includes protecting Washington voters from unnecessary and illegitimate intrusions on their privacy,” Hobbs wrote.

Hobbs closed his letter with a link to where the Department of Justice can request Washington’s public voter registration list. Such data is often requested by news outlets and political parties.
Trump has also attacked the vote-by-mail election system Washington and other states have chosen. He has threatened via executive order to withhold federal funding to states that don’t comply with dramatic rule changes, like requiring documentation of U.S. citizenship to register to vote. The order signed in March also seeks to prevent states from counting ballots received after Election Day.

Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, to a six-month jail sentence with eligibility for work release, meaning she can work outside the jail during the day and sleep there at night.
A jury found Mitchell guilty of first-degree burglary and possession of burglary tools in July after she broke into her stepmother’s Detroit Lakes home in April 2024.
Fritz ordered Mitchell to serve her six months sentence in Ramsey County jail. Defendants are typically incarcerated where the conviction occurred — in this case Becker County — but Fritz allowed her to serve her jail sentence in her home county so she can participate in work release. Minnesota requires convicted felons to serve two-thirds of their sentences incarcerated, so Mitchell will be in jail for at least four months.
Mitchell, who resigned from the Minnesota Senate shortly after her trial, was also sentenced to five years of probation.
The Woodbury Democrat was found guilty of felony burglary and possession of burglary tools in July after a five-day trial in Detroit Lakes. The prosecution successfully argued that Mitchell intended to steal her late father’s possessions from her stepmother when she broke into her Detroit Lakes home on April 22, 2024. The state’s main evidence was that she told police as much during her arrest, and the jury saw the footage of her admissions from police officers’ body-worn cameras.
Mitchell testified during her trial, and on Tuesday during her sentencing hearing she told Fritz prior to her sentencing that she “deserved” to be there.
“I broke into her home. I was selfish. I was worried about my own feelings and a possible confrontation … and I did something ridiculous and illegal and selfish,” Mitchell said.
Becker County Attorney Brian McDonald read aloud a written statement from Carol Mitchell — Nicole Mitchell’s stepmother — during the sentencing hearing.
Carol Mitchell said she still does not feel safe after the break-in and can never trust her stepdaughter again.
“The fear that Nicole created when she broke into my house has not left me,” Carol Mitchell wrote.

Laura Kelly opposes mid-decade congressional redistricting, but seeks public hearings if GOP legislators insist on special session to remap boundaries.","Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly rejects Republicans' call for mid-decade congressional redistricting in Kansas during a special session of the Legislature. She said if the GOP proceeds with that strategy, the public should be able to share their views at a series of town hall meetings. In this image, Kelly speaks in January 2025 at the Capitol. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly on Tuesday recommended the Kansas Legislature gather public testimony about Republican plans to redraw the state’s four congressional districts to disadvantage Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids in the next election.
“I am calling on legislative leadership to host town halls prior to circulating a petition for a special session,” Kelly said in a statement. “Kansans must be offered the opportunity to express their opinions directly to their representatives, as they have during previous redistricting processes.”
The Republican-led Legislature convened 18 public sessions in 2021 in advance of the House and Senate votes in 2022 to reconfigure U.S. House district boundaries. That congressional map was expected to be in place for a decade, but President Donald Trump applied pressure on Kansas and other states to perform mid-decade redistricting in an attempt to swell the ranks of GOP members in the U.S. House after the 2026 election cycle.
Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, both Wichita-area Republicans seeking election to statewide offices, have contemplated convening a special session in November to work on maps that would split moderate voters of Johnson County among multiple congressional districts.
The political objective would be to make the 3rd District, which is represented by Davids and anchored by Johnson and Wyandotte counties, more winnable for Republican candidates. At the same time, the districts of GOP U.S. Reps. Tracey Mann, Derek Schmidt and Ron Estes would lose a portion of their Republican edge in terms of registered voters.
Kelly said she wouldn’t call a special session for the purpose of redistricting. Masterson and Hawkins have the option of gathering petition signatures from two-thirds of Senate and House members to compel a special session of the Legislature. Currently, Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers and numerically could reach that threshold.
The Democratic governor said discussions about a special session and congressional redistricting “must be brought out from behind closed doors and into the public domain.”
In 2021, then-House Speaker Ron Ryckman said redistricting in Kansas should be viewed as a multi-year process that included town halls to gauge what Kansas wanted to see in terms of adjustments to district boundaries. The Olathe Republican insisted at that time the process should allow for “additional public input” beyond views of legislators.
In 2022, Masterson said it was important to keep a united Johnson County at the core of the 3rd District held by Davids.
In wake of Trump’s call on Kansas to shift its congressional boundaries, Masterson said his consideration of redistricting wouldn’t be connected to his quest to secure Trump’s endorsement in the upcoming governor’s race. While Masterson is among GOP candidates for governor, Hawkins is running for state insurance commissioner.
Kelly said Kansas lawmakers ought to adhere to precedent and offer robust in-person and online public comment options.
She said residents of Johnson County should have a voice in planning an unprecedented mid-decade redistricting of U.S. House boundaries, especially when that action could be taken without referencing new Census data needed to divide the population into four districts.
“I do not agree with mid-decade redistricting based on old data and a clearly partisan agenda,” Kelly said in a statement.
Hawkins, the House speaker, said he was puzzled Kelly opposed redistricting in Kansas but encouraged redistricting in Democrat-led states such as California in response to action by Republican-controlled states such as Texas. Kelly chairs the Democratic Governors Association.
“Governor Laura Kelly made it clear at the Democratic Governors Association that Democrats should pursue redistricting across the country,” Hawkins said. “To quote the governor, ‘there is a bigger risk in doing nothing.’ It is certainly an issue we are considering seriously.”
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes and House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, both Democrats from Johnson County, echoed Kelly’s opposition to a special session and support for hearings on redistricting.
“This push for redistricting is a blatant attempt to curry favor with Trump and boost GOP political ambitions, not to serve Kansans,” Woodard said. “If Republican leadership wants a costly special session, they should have the courage to discuss it with the public first. Kansas Democratic leadership is prepared to assist in organizing these meetings to ensure transparency throughout the discussions.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1142484-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-23 14:58:35.500683

With federal funding drying up for hospitals and higher education institutions, the administration argues the state must step in to maintain its competitive edge.","GOV. MAURA HEALY has been applying a full-court press to pass a $400 million bill aimed at strengthening Massachusetts’ research and innovation economy, but lawmakers have left the governor’s plans for a “transformative investment” idling in the seven weeks since Healey proposed it.
Healey’s Discovery, Research and Innovation for a Vibrant Economy (DRIVE) bill aims to attract private investment and preserve research jobs. With federal funding drying up for hospitals and higher education institutions, the administration argues the state must step in to maintain its competitive edge.
After filing the legislation (H 4375) on July 31, just as lawmakers were departing Beacon Hill for a weeks-long summer recess, Healey held a press conference at UMass Memorial Health in Worcester this month about the “incredibly important piece of legislation.” Last week, she convened the first meeting of her high-powered DRIVE Acceleration Team task force led by the state Federal Funds and Infrastructure Director Quentin Palfrey. 
Asked in Worcester about when she wants the legislation back to her desk, Healey said, “As soon as possible. I mean, we need this to happen. We need this to happen now.”
“This is a top priority for me,” Healey told reporters at the State House last week after a meeting of the task force, whose members constitute a collective who’s who of top business, health care and higher education officials including former Centers for Disease Control Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.
While Healey has been publicly promoting her plan, the bill has not been scheduled for its legislative debut: a public hearing before the Joint Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies.
“It is a bill that will be scheduled, I do not have a date yet,” said Rep. Carole Fiola, the House chair of the committee. Fiola noted the bill arrived in August, adding, “We have a schedule of bills right now.”
Fiola said the administration reached out to her in mid-September, and they’re planning to meet in the coming weeks to discuss the proposal. She emphasized that bills already scheduled for hearings will take precedence.
“I guess there’s been quite a bit of publicity trying to be generated about it, but I think we’re going to follow the process that we do as a Legislature,” she said.
Healey says the DRIVE bill is critically important at a time when the Trump administration is defunding medical research — vital for both health care and the state’s economy.
“This isn’t just about filling gaps left by what has been devastating cuts at the federal level. This is actually about designing something that will continue to be a catalytic engine for our state,” Healey said at the press conference in Worcester. “The federal administration is not helping us right now, because they don’t understand the value of science, the value of research, because they’ve continued to defund medical research right now and do other things that undermine public health, in my view. But in Massachusetts, we’re going to move forward.”
Healey created the task force with an Aug. 1 executive order and during their first meeting she urged the group to “move this forward and get this both passed, and also, importantly, implemented, operationalized, as quickly as possible. Time is of the essence.”
Sen. Barry Finegold, the other chair of the committee who controls the fate of the DRIVE bill, seemed to share some of the governor’s urgency.
“We are very much looking forward to the hearing coming up and learning more about the bill, with everything happening on the federal level we need to be on the offensive as a state,” he said in a statement to the News Service.
Fiola said she understands research and life sciences are big economic engines for the state, and needs to learn more about the bill.
“Let’s take a breath and understand just what the numbers are. Where is the need? What is the best way to approach it? That is how we deliberatively work as a body,” she said. “There are a lot of important pressing needs: energy costs, all these federal implications of federal cutbacks. So we’re looking at all of it.”
The committee is holding a hearing on about a dozen bills Thursday, but Healey’s bill is not on the agenda.
Reps. Jeff Roy and Ann-Margaret Ferrante were present at last week’s DRIVE Initiative meeting. Healey acknowledged Finegold’s absence but noted his support. She did not mention Fiola in her opening remarks.
Brooke Thomson, president and CEO of Associated Industries of Massachusetts and a member of the DRIVE Initiative, said the bill is drawing attention from the business community.
“I was over at Biogen yesterday, they had a groundbreaking of their new headquarters,” she said. “By showing movement on this bill… we’re sending a message.”
Thomson added, “With researchers deciding if they’re going to stay here, if they see states like Massachusetts are committing their resources, they might say, ‘I’m not going to take that postdoc in another state, or from someone trying to poach me in Europe. Yes, I’ve lost my fellowship or grant, but I can see Massachusetts is demonstrating they’re trying to keep me. So I’ll stay.'”
AIM sent a letter on September 8 to Senate President Karen Spilka, House Speaker Ron Mariano, Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair Michael Rodrigues and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Aaron Michlewitz urging passage of the bill.
The letter, signed by Thomson, highlighted the broader economic impact: “Every dollar invested in research yields more than twice that amount in economic benefits. Moreover, the impact of research funding extends well beyond labs and universities — two out of every five jobs supported are in other sectors such as construction, food services, health care, retail, and administrative support.”
While DRIVE remains on the sidelines, Beacon Hill has a history of tackling major issues through omnibus bills. Lawmakers are expected to roll out a comprehensive jobs or economic development package later this session, likely in the coming months as election season approaches. It’s possible Democrats are eyeing DRIVE as a component of that broader effort — though for now, it remains only one idea among many on the table.

U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet joined with members of the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council and Protect Our Care Michigan on Tuesday, with the Bay City Democrat asking her peers in Congress to extend tax credits helping thousands of Michiganders pay for health insurance. 
While Congressional Republicans renewed several provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Congress has not taken steps to renew the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit, which were established through the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and expanded by the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. 
According to KFF, these credits save Michiganders an average of $449 a month.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Health care premiums are expected to rise substantially if the credits are allowed to expire at the end of 2025, with the Citizens Research Council warning premiums would increase by 70% in Michigan. 
“Costs are already way too high, and tariffs are only making things worse. Families and seniors in my district can’t afford an extra $730 for their insurance premiums,” said McDonald Rivet, whose district covers Saginaw and Bay counties, most of Genesee County and parts of Tuscola and Midland counties.
According to the council, these premium tax credits effectively create a cap on the price of health insurance plans for individuals. Since the introduction of the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit, nationwide coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace has doubled.
The Big Beautiful Bill Act also cut funds from several programs, including $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which is expected to strip care away from hundreds of thousands of Michigan residents, carrying negative impacts for hospitals, particularly those in rural areas. 
“The impact of people not buying private insurance through the Marketplace will likely have cascading effects across the state, much in the same way that the Medicaid cuts are expected to,” Robert Schneider, a senior research associate for the council said in a statement. “More uninsured people means health care costs will go up for everyone in the form of higher health insurance premiums, while hospitals will see more uncompensated care, leading to reduced services and even closure. Combined with cuts to Medicaid, health care in our state faces a downward spiral that will put people’s health, safety and well-being at risk.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/unnamed-4-1024x619.png,,,2025-09-23 13:57:18.632327

Authority leaders suspect rising insurance costs are increasing delinquency rates in mortgages the authority subsidizes. (Courtesy Housing NM)
 The rising cost of home insurance across New Mexico is causing some recipients of subsidized mortgages to fall behind on their loans, according to officials from the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority.
The authority, also known as Housing New Mexico, offers mortgage loans at reduced interest rates for low-income, first-time homebuyers, along with down-payment assistance and other subsidies. But the authority lacks control over some costs, MFA Director Isidoro “Izzy “Hernandez said during a “State of Housing” presentation at a recent housing summit  in Albuquerque. 
“We’re starting to see in the portfolio of the loans that we service a little bit higher delinquency rates,” he said. “And I think some of that is due to the insurance payments and the escrow payments…that would be increased in general.”
Kristie Garcia, a spokesperson for the authority, told Source New Mexico via email on Monday afternoon that the authority lacks “solid data” showing that rising homeowners insurance cost is increasing loan defaults, but the authority has asked its loan servicer to help quantify the situation.
“This theory is based on conversations Housing New Mexico employees have had with representatives from our loan servicer,” she said. “We have asked them to start gathering data on insurance premium increases in an effort to better understand the correlation and impact on delinquencies.”
Fires making home insurance unaffordable, impossible, NM lawmakers say

The authority’s 12.46% delinquency rate marks an increase from 11.3% this time last year, Garcia said. 
Rising construction costs and increasingly costly natural disasters across the country factor into statewide insurance premium hikes, state officials have said. 
Premiums increased across the state 16% between 2020 and 2023, according to the Office of the Superintendent of Insurance, making the average annual premium $1,817. Some New Mexico counties saw much-higher increases, namely Hidalgo, Roosevelt and Curry counties, where premiums increased between 40% and 47% in that period, according to the office. 
In response to the rising insurance costs, the authority has started allowing its mortgage recipients to opt in to high-deductible plans, which results in lower premiums. But that has drawbacks for homeowners if they ever need insurance to pay for the cost of damage from a natural disaster or other hazards, said Jeff Payne, Housing New Mexico’s chief loan officer, said at the presentation last week.
“Those higher deductibles are harder to meet when they do need to use their insurance,” Payne said of the high-deductible plan holders with subsidized mortgages. “It’s a real problem.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Carol-Sugarman.jpg,,,2025-09-23 13:57:18.632327

(Photo courtesy of PAcast)Nearly one week after three York County police officers were killed and two were injured after a gunman ambushed them, state Attorney General Dave Sunday is warning about potential scams involving fundraising efforts.
“Pennsylvanians are caring and generous people always willing to help in the wake of tragedy,” Sunday said. “With so many people seeking ways to help those affected by the horrifying shooting last week in York County, it is important to ensure those charitable donations reach those who need them.”
On Wednesday, Detective Sergeant Cody Becker, Detective Mark Baker and Detective Isaiah Emenheiser were shot and killed by Matthew J. Ruth while serving a warrant in North Codorus Township.
Sunday said his office and its Bureau of Consumer Protection is attempting to stay on top  of trending scams that may occur, in order to help the public avoid any problems. The AG noted that scammers tend to look at current events to develop ways to defraud people.
He’s encouraging potential donors to visit the Northern York County Regional Police Department’s Facebook page and the York County, PA’s Sheriff’s Office’s Facebook page for more information on how to make donations.
During a Thursday press conference that provided further details about the shooting, the department-endorsed fundraiser for the families of the killed and injured officers was highlighted.
Sunday also said those looking to donate could also determine the legitimacy of other fundraising efforts by researching whether the affected agencies, involved police officers and whether deputy associations, or Fraternal Order of Police lodges support or endorse a particular effort.
Those who feel they were targeted or fell victim to a scam can file a complaint with the Office of Attorney General’s Bureau of Consumer Protection at www.attorneygeneral.gov or by calling 717-787-3391.
According to the Associated Press, the three slain officers had almost six decades of combined service. The shooting in North Codorus Township is one of the deadliest incidents for Pennsylvania police officers in almost two decades.

And I’ll just sum it up with a bow; I think at the end of the day this, and all current COVID vaccines will fall — once they are FDA approved — will fall into the group that is allowed to be administered by a protocol physician and a pharmacist here in the state of Florida,” Board of Pharmacy chair and Tallahassee pharmacist Dr. Jonathan Hickman said. “So with that, I will entertain a motion to adjourn the meeting.”
The meeting lasted for fewer than 15 minutes and came after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted last week against requiring prescriptions for COVID-19 vaccinations.
The advisory panel did, however, vote to change long-standing recommendations around COVID-19 vaccine access for children and adults and to place a new emphasis on the risks of COVID-19 immunizations, despite agency’s own data demonstrating that the vaccines are safe and effective for most people.
The move by ACIP to require prescriptions was criticized by Dr. Amy Middleman, who serves as an ACIP liaison member on behalf of the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.
“If we start asking for prescriptions for vaccines, which are, again, a primary prevention public health strategy, we are going to overwhelm physicians’ offices. It’s alarming to me that for a primary preventive strategy, we are actually adding access concerns and barriers, rather than diminishing them.”
The number of people getting vaccinated for COVID-19 continues to drop. Nearly 15.4 million people in Florida were vaccinated for COVID-19 in 2021 after the shot first became available. That number dwindled to 5,492,147 in 2022; 2,015,085 in 2023; and to 1,634,826 in 2024. As of Sept. 23, 341,363 people in Florida have been vaccinated for COVID-19, state Department of Health data show.
The Ladapo show
The Florida Board of Pharmacy is housed in the DOH, administered by state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo. He and his boss, Gov. Ron DeSantis, made national headlines last month when they said that all vaccine mandates should be eliminated from Florida’s statutes as well as all its rules and regulations.
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

Ladapo has deep skepticisms about the safety of messenger RNA, or mRNA, which is a molecule that acts as a temporary copy of a gene’s DNA sequence. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA.
In 2022, Ladapo warned of an “abnormally high risk of cardiac-related death” for young men who took the COVID-19 vaccine. The report was criticized by public health experts and Politico later reported Ladapo falsified the findings of the study.
In 2023 Ladapo advised people under age 65 to not get vaccinated for COVID-19.
In January 2024 Ladapo called on the federal government to halt the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
But it’s not just COVID-19 vaccines the state surgeon general has qualms with.
Ladapo last year advised parents that it was up to them to decide whether to keep their children at home amid a measles outbreak in Broward County — counter to usual practice and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of urging parents to keep unvaccinated children at home.

,DC,2025-09-23 16:48:33+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump and RFK Jr. are making claims about autism. What do medical experts say?,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-and-rfk-jr-are-making-claims-about-autism-what-do-medical-experts-say,,"WASHINGTON — Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stirred up major concerns and considerable speculation earlier this year when he announced the administration would release a report revealing the causes of autism by the end of September. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer with no medical degree, stood next to President Donald Trump on Sept. 22 as they presented the over-the-counter drug Tylenol as one potential driving factor behind autism diagnoses and pointed to folate, a B vitamin, as a possible treatment — both conclusions the medical community hasn’t yet reached. Kennedy throughout his tenure has also made overly broad and disparaging statements about people who have an autism diagnosis, often referring to traits exhibited in people with the most severe cases. For example, he claimed in April that children with autism would never function as independent adults, drawing intense criticism for making a generalization that would not apply to every person with a diagnosis.The Trump-Kennedy announcement and Kennedy’s characterizations have raised questions about why someone would be diagnosed, what types of research have been done and what reputable science has found about causes. States Newsroom spoke with three experts before the announcement to gain a better understanding of autism spectrum disorder. Below are brief excerpts from those interviews. What is autism spectrum disorder? The two core characteristics of autism are challenges with social communication and the presence of restrictive and repetitive behavior, according to Autism Science Foundation Chief Science Officer Dr. Alycia Halladay. As understanding of the diagnosis has evolved, she explained, researchers and families have increasingly referred to it as autisms, plural, instead of autism, singular, in part, because there are so many different subtypes.“It makes it more accurate when describing it — that autism is not just one entity of core autism features, that there is so much diversity across the spectrum, that it's actually a group of developmental disorders,” Halladay said. The spectrum, she said, ranges from people who may speak rarely to those who are fluent in language, people with cognitive disabilities to those with IQs of more than 120 and people who can live independently to those who need round-the-clock care.Dr. Michael Murray, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at the Penn State College of Medicine, described it as “a neurodevelopmental disorder, meaning that people are born with it and it's lifelong and it can cause a variety of challenges for people.”“The most common and significant and probably pervasive symptom across the spectrum is challenges in understanding and interpreting what we call neurotypical — meaning everyone who is non-autistic — social behavior,” Murray said. “So just understanding all the non-verbal parts of social communication, understanding nuance and non-literal use of language. All those things can be really difficult for autistic people.”Approximately 1 in 31 children in the United States and 1 in 45 adults fall somewhere along the autism spectrum, according to the advocacy organization Autism Speaks. How is autism diagnosed?Only an expert can diagnose an autism spectrum disorder using criteria in a guide used by health care professionals called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM. “You need someone who knows autism, who knows what to look for, who knows how to elicit behaviors or not elicit behaviors that are indicative of an autism diagnosis,” Halladay said. “So it's really diagnosed by a psychiatrist, a psychologist, or somebody else who's trained to understand what autism is and what it's not.”Murray said there are three social communication behaviors that doctors or other qualified medical professionals look for when considering whether to diagnose someone with autism. “It is difficulty in interpreting social information. It is difficulty giving social information through things like facial expression and tone of voice. And thirdly, is a difficulty maintaining appropriate peer relationships,” Murray said. “Now, once again, this is from a neurotypical description of peer relationships. There's a lot of talk among neurodivergent individuals about whether that's fair, that we rate social relationships based on how we think they should be. But nonetheless, that's the criteria.”Murray explained experts also observe the presence of restrictive and repetitive behaviors in assessing whether someone has autism. “And that captures things that are in the realm of interacting with the physical world around you,” Murray said. “So that need for sameness and inflexibility maintaining routines.”Carissa Cascio, a senior scientist at the University of Kansas Life Span Institute and Kansas Center for Autism Research and Training, reinforced that autism is “strictly diagnosed based on behavior.”“There are genes that have an association with autism that you can test for. There's some genes that have a very strong association, and you can do a test for the presence of one of those genes,” Cascio said. “But for the diagnosis of autism itself, it's strictly based on behavior.”What do we know about the causes of autism?While more scientific research is needed, a combination of genetics and environmental factors is responsible for the formation of autism spectrum disorders. “We know that one of the largest causes of autism is genetics. We know this because it runs in families,” Halladay said, adding there “are over 150 known genes associated with autism.”“If there's a variation in the gene, there's a high likelihood of having an autism diagnosis,” she said. “And those genes are genes that tell cells in the brain where to go and how to connect, which seems to be a core biological feature of autism.”Halladay emphasized that research has established the “most important part is the interaction between genetics and the environment.”“Neither the gene nor the environmental factor is strong enough, but together, they increase the probability of having a child with autism,” Halladay explained. During the last 25 years, as Murray has advanced in his career, the medical community’s thinking about and understanding of autism spectrum disorders has “significantly increased.”“We know right now that 80 to 90% of autism is accounted for by genetic differences .... It's not just you got exposed to this thing in the environment, now you have autism. You have to have the genetic susceptibility first and then the environment might make it more likely, or maybe influence the expression of it,” Murray said.Cascio said that when it comes to environmental factors, studies have shown pregnancy or the very early post-natal time frame are key. “We're still parsing this out, but some of the environmental factors that seem to have more evidence behind them than others are older parental age, perinatal trauma, premature birth and low birth weight,” Cascio said. “And then there's some maternal health factors that are gathering some evidence as well. So maternal infection and immune response, maternal exposure to medications or pollutants are sort of gathering some evidence.” While much more research is needed on the many potential environmental factors, Cascio said scientists know vaccines are not a component. “The things that we definitely can rule out are things that have been studied in great depth and not really produced much association. So you know, the idea that vaccines cause autism is a common belief. There have been dozens and dozens of studies that have all failed to find any association between vaccines and autism,” Cascio said.There’s also not yet a clear link with Tylenol, also called acetaminophen, as a possible environmental factor. “It is unlikely that this is the smoking gun that they're hoping for,” Cascio said. “I think we all want to understand this better, but this is certainly not something that we feel has a strong weight of evidence behind it yet.”A spokesperson for Kenvue, the company that manufactures Tylenol, wrote in a statement released in connection with the Trump-Kennedy press conference that “acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.  “Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives. High fevers and pain are widely recognized as potential risks to a pregnancy if left untreated.”Why have autism diagnoses increased over several decades? Health and Human Services Secretary Kennedy has repeatedly raised concerns with an increase in autism diagnoses over several decades, but experts say there are logical reasons for this. “In the early 1990s the CDC set up a system to collect and count the number of people with autism,” Halladay said. “So it definitely has increased since then, but one of the main reasons that's been shown over and over again is access to services.”Halladay believes most of the increase is due to greater knowledge and access, though she said, “there is room for some of the increase in autism to be a true increase in the number of people with autism due to something else.”Murray explained that about 60% to 70% of people diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum are characterized as having “low-support needs, meaning that they clearly have the features of autism, but they are able to, with the appropriate level of supports, be in traditional schools or typical schools; they can, with job support, work and lead their lives the way they choose to.”When Murray began his career, he said, those people never would have been diagnosed as having autism.  “Secondly, we as a professional community are getting better and better at picking up these symptoms, particularly in kids who are quite young,” Murray said.During the late 1980s and 1990s, Cascio said, a new version of the DSM and better tools helped medical professionals more accurately diagnose people along the entire autism spectrum. Additionally, Cascio said, there’s a similar concept called diagnostic substitution, where people who in the past may have been diagnosed with something else are now being correctly diagnosed with autism. How much research has been done on autism and over how many years?Scientists have been researching autism for decades, building on past work to better understand how to diagnose and assist people across the spectrum, though experts said more is needed.“The many, many scientific discoveries and funding into understanding autism has promoted scientists moving into the field,” Halladay said. “So there's clearly an increased number over the past two decades of the number of people who are focused on studying autism.”Murray said the first papers published in scientific journals regarding autism were in 1944. “So it is 80 years, at a minimum, of work,” Murray said.Murray reiterated that autism spectrum disorders are not simple to study and said a “really important paper came out earlier this year talking about how there's four genetically recognizable subtypes of autism. So it's not a single autism. It is, at the very least, four autisms, and probably more.”Cascio said addressing any aspect of autism is complicated.“The behavior is complex. The genetics are complex. The brain is complex,"" Cascio said. “And so this makes it a huge challenge for research. And there's certainly no possibility that we would go from not fully understanding the causes of autism to having a definitive cause in five months.”What are some of the biggest misconceptions about autism? The internet has led to misinformation, and in many cases disinformation, and health diagnoses are no exception.  Halladay said people often try to simplify autism or believe an actor’s portrayal in a television show or movie is representative of everyone on the spectrum. “I think that because of the narrative of autism being oversimplified, that people are not understanding that it's a more complex disorder,” she said. Murray said the autism spectrum may be pictured as a straight line and an expectation arises when someone is diagnosed that they are in just one spot. “That's not really the way it is. There are needs or strengths that show up variably depending on the demands of the situation,” Murray said. “So for instance, someone who has a really exquisite sensitivity to sound, if they are attending a symphony, that may make that experience so much more rich for him or her versus the average person. “But if they are at a rock concert, it may be overwhelming. The same trait can be a source of vulnerability or a strength depending on the situation.”Murray said there’s often a misconception that all people with autism are antisocial or don’t want to make and maintain friendships.  “And that's true for some people, right? They aren't really interested in social interactions. It's not their thing,” Murray said. “It's also true for some neurotypical people that they're really not interested in social interactions. But the vast, vast majority of autistic individuals just want a friend, and they want someone who they can count on and rely on. They want to be loved, just like everyone else in the world ... They just need more supports or different situations to have that happen.”Cascio said that people can form misconceptions after seeing actors portray people along the spectrum.“I first became interested in autism after watching the movie ‘Rain Man,’” Cascio said. “And I think there's a lot of people who see a depiction like that and think, 'Okay, this is what autism looks like.' And there's just so much more complexity and variability from person to person and I would say that's probably the biggest misconception.”Cascio said it’s also human nature to want one clear answer to why someone develops autism or any other health diagnosis, but that oftentimes the best science shows a more complicated picture. “It's uncomfortable for us to say, ‘This is really complex and we don't understand it yet,’” she said. “And so when there is something that people hold up and say, ‘Here's an explanation.’ I think it can be really tempting for people to just want to have it solved. And that's a very natural reaction.”",,,,2025-09-23 12:57:32.902628

Board member Tim Mihalick said Sanford has the “it factor” that rarely comes along in a leader. The board chose not to do a national search. 
Board member Danita Bye said a national search would have led the board back to Sanford, echoing previous statements from Board Chair Kevin Black. 
Sanford’s title will change from chancellor to commissioner. The motion approving Sanford also changed the title to align with what is in the state constitution. 
Student board member Max Eriksrud said he felt the title change did not change the University System leader’s role, adding that students he has talked to have been impressed by Sanford.  
Sanford likens top North Dakota higher ed job to his experience in governor’s office

Sanford pointed to his time as North Dakota’s lieutenant governor, where one of his duties was chairing the North Dakota Higher Education Challenge Grant Fund that awards state dollars to match private fundraising at the 11 public colleges and universities in the state. 
“I knew your budgets before I knew you,” Sanford, a certified public accountant, told the State Board of Higher Education and campus representatives during a meeting at Minot State University. 
Sanford was asked by Black to give a presentation on his vision for the North Dakota University System and take questions from the board.
One question was about what some perceive as Sanford’s lack of academic credentials. He holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of North Dakota but doesn’t hold an advanced degree. 
That’s when Sanford referenced his six years of Challenge Grant experience under Gov. Doug Burgum. 
Sanford admitted he has limited experience in academia. He served briefly as the interim president of Bismarck State College before being named interim chancellor in April. 
He said being chancellor has been “a better fit than I thought it would be.” 
He described chancellor as being an administrator job. 
“It’s not like running a campus,” he said. 
Sanford’s compensation was not immediately finalized. Sanford is being paid $425,000 a year to be interim chancellor.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The University of Florida remains the seventh best public university in the nation, according to U.S. News & World Report’s 2026 rankings. 
Those rankings feature Florida State University at No. 21 and the University of South Florida at #43, each rising two spots since last year’s rankings. 
“UF’s standing reflects a decade of concerted effort, supported by historic state investment and federal research funding, leading to stronger student outcomes, inspired research accomplishments and ever-greater impact on the economy of Florida,” UF Interim President Donald Landry said in a news release.
The Gainesville university, No. 30 among all public and private universities, has been without a permanent leader since Ben Sasse resigned in July 2024. Since, various leadership positions have been filled on an interim basis. Landry took the helm this month as interim president as the university begins a new search after former University of Michigan President Santa Ono was rejected as UF’s president by the Board of Governors.
UF shares the No. 7 spot with University of Texas-Austin.
Florida International University, the best performing university by Florida metrics, was inside the top 50 public institutions at No. 46. 
“FIU is on a clear path to becoming a Top 30 public university by 2030,” FIU President Jeanette Nuñez said in a news release. “We continue to lead in academics, research, student success, and upward economic mobility.”  
Among various rankings throughout the year, U.S. News & World Report are perhaps the most widely cited. 
Most of the scoring is based on graduation rates and student outcomes. Also, 20% is determined by peer assessment, 11% by faculty resources, and the rest by financial resources, student excellence, and faculty research. 
“This year’s rankings reflect the unwavering commitment of Florida’s public universities to delivering academic excellence and world-class faculty expertise,” Board of Governors Chair Brian Lamb said in a news release. “These remarkable outcomes affirm the hard work and dedication of our university trustees, faculty, students, and staff across the state.”
The schools ahead of UF are the University of California, Berkeley; University of California, Los Angeles; University of Michigan-Ann Arbor; University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill; University of Virginia; and University of California, San Diego.
The top 14 schools in the nation are private, according to U.S. News & World Report.

For the seventh consecutive year, Florida A&M University was the No. 1 public historically Black college or university in the nation and No. 5 among all HBCUs.
Separate from the top public category, New College of Florida was ranked No. 135 among 207 National Liberal Arts Colleges, tying with the private Eckerd College in St. Petersburg.
The University of West Florida was ranked the No. 6 best public school in the South region and No. 14 among public and private universities in the South. It ranked below other Florida institutions Rollins College, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Stetson University, Florida Southern College, and the University of Tampa. 
In other university news, UCF achieved preeminence status this week, its president announced. That status is designated by the state, achieved by reaching metrics such as graduation rate, research expenditures, patents, endowment size, and doctoral degrees awarded and provides additional funding to schools that meet them. Other preeminent schools include UF, FSU, USF, and FIU.
In a ranking of campus free speech by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression earlier this month, FSU was rated the best in the state in that category.

Ann Bauer, a researcher who studies Tylenol and autism, felt queasy with anxiety in the weeks leading up to the White House’s much-anticipated autism announcement.
In August, Bauer and her colleagues published an analysis of 46 previous studies on Tylenol, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Many found no link between the drug and the conditions, while some suggested Tylenol might occasionally exacerbate other potential causes of autism, such as genetics.
Bauer, an epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, and her team called for more judicious use of the drug until the science is settled.
On Monday, President Donald Trump stood beside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for what he called a “historic” announcement on autism.
“If you’re pregnant, don’t take Tylenol, and don’t give it to the baby after the baby is born,” Trump said. “There are certain groups of people that don’t take vaccines and don’t take any pills that have no autism,” he added, without providing evidence. “They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies, it’s a disgrace.”
A fact sheet released alongside the White House briefing cited Bauer’s analysis. But she was alarmed by Trump’s comments. If prenatal Tylenol has any association, which it may not, it would help account for only a fraction of cases, she said. Further, research has not deeply examined Tylenol risks in young children, and many rigorous studies refute a link between vaccines and autism.
Bauer worries such statements will cut both ways: People may put themselves at risk to avoid vaccines and Tylenol, the only safe painkiller for use during pregnancy. And she frets that scientists might outright reject her team’s measured concerns about Tylenol in a backlash against misleading remarks from Trump and other members of his “Make America Healthy Again” movement.
“I’m really concerned about how this message is going to play out,” she said. “It’s a sound-bite universe, and everyone wants a simple solution.”
Autism experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were neither consulted for the White House’s long-awaited autism announcement nor asked to review a draft of the findings and recommendations, CDC scientists told KFF Health News, which agreed not to identify them because they fear retaliation.
“Typically, we’d be asked to provide information and review the report for accuracy, but we’ve had absolutely no contact with anyone,” one CDC researcher said. “It is very unusual.”
Trump and Kennedy promised this year that under their leadership the federal government would swiftly figure out what causes autism. Scientists who work in the field have been skeptical, noting that decades of research has shown that no single drug, chemical, or other environmental factor is strongly linked to the developmental disorder. In addition, both Trump and Kennedy have repeated the scientifically debunked notion that childhood vaccines may cause autism.
Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research Excellence at Boston University, called Trump’s comments dangerous. Fevers can harm the mother and the developing fetus, she said, adding that fevers are more strongly associated with autism than Tylenol.
In an emailed response to queries, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America’s unprecedented rise in autism rates.”
White House spokesperson Kush Desai wrote, “President Trump pledged to address America’s rising rate of autism, and to do so with Gold Standard Science.”
Had CDC scientists been allowed to brief Kennedy, they say they would have cautioned that simple fixes won’t make a dent in the number of autism cases in the United States: As many as 1-in-31 8-year-old children had autism spectrum disorder in 2022.
Systemic changes, such as regulations on air pollution, which has been linked to asthma and developmental disabilities including autism, and assistance for parents of disabled children, could improve lives for far more Americans with autism and other conditions than actions taken by the Trump administration on Sept. 22, researchers say.
One federal action is to consider updating the label on Tylenol and to “encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.” The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists already recommends acetaminophen “as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.”
 ‘Political Crusade’ 

Despite Kennedy’s many years of speaking about autism, he rarely cites credible autism research or expert recommendations, Tager-Flusberg said. Instead, Kennedy repeats fringe, scientifically debunked theories linking vaccines to autism, despite rigorous studies published in peer-reviewed journals that refute a link.
At the Sept. 22 briefing, Trump said he spoke with Kennedy about autism 20 years ago: “We understood a lot more than a lot of people who studied it,” he said.
Ahead of Trump’s first term in 2017, Kennedy said he met with the president to consider a commission on vaccine safety and autism. It didn’t happen then. But soon after Kennedy was confirmed as health secretary, he called autism “preventable,” pointed to “environmental toxins,” and contradicted the results of a CDC study finding that the main driver of rising autism diagnoses was that doctors increasingly recognize the disorder.
At a televised Cabinet meeting in April, Kennedy told Trump, “By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures.”
“You stop taking something, you stop eating something, or maybe it’s a shot,” Trump replied.
“He is on a political crusade,” Tager-Flusberg said of Kennedy, adding that vaccines, Tylenol, aluminum, and food dyes make for simple targets to rally against. “We know genetics is the most significant risk factor,” she said, “but you can’t blame Big Pharma for genetics, and you can’t build a political movement on genetics research and ride to victory.”
“RFK makes our work harder,” said Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher and the author of a book about his autistic daughter, “Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism.” He said the book stemmed from conversations with Kennedy in 2017, in which Hotez shared studies pinpointing more than a hundred genes linked to autism, and research into the complex interplay between genetics, biological processes, and things that children and fetuses encounter during development.
“I sat down with him and explained what the science says, but he was unwilling or incapable of thinking deeply about it,” Hotez said. “He is extremely careless.”
In addition to its focus on Tylenol, the White House said it would move to update “prescribing information” on leucovorin — a medication related to the B vitamin folate — to reflect its use as an autism treatment. A small clinical trial in 2012-13 suggested the drug may help treat language problems in some children with autism. Tager-Flusberg said the findings warrant further study but clarified these were “old data, not a breakthrough.”
Likewise, studies finding a modest association between autism and prolonged Tylenol use were published years ago. Researchers have suggested the medicine might occasionally exacerbate factors associated with autism, such as genetics and oxidative stress, a biological condition that occurs for a variety of reasons that scientists are still unraveling.
Still, these studies couldn’t rule out the possibility that fevers prompting women to take Tylenol, rather than the medicine itself, might instead be to blame. Fevers and infections — including those prevented by vaccines — have also been linked to autism.
Nonetheless, Bauer’s recommendation would be to pause before taking acetaminophen while pregnant — blanket advice that doctors give for all medications during that period, but which may be ignored.
“Try to alleviate discomfort in some other ways, like with a cold compress, hydration, or massage, before taking it,” Bauer said.
She welcomed the White House’s motion to consider labeling Tylenol to emphasize judicious use of the drug but worries about how the MAHA movement might distort a careful message. On Sept. 2, the right-wing news outlet One America News Network posted an interview with newly appointed CDC vaccine adviser Robert Malone, writing that Malone “speculates RFK Jr. may have an important announcement this month regarding a potential link between Tylenol, multiple vaccinations and autism in children.”
“I was sick to my stomach,” Bauer said, concerned that Kennedy would link her study to discredited theories, causing doctors and scientists to reject her far more measured work.
  ‘The Boy Who Cried Wolf’ 

Several medical and scientific associations have called for Kennedy’s removal or resignation. Many scientists are skeptical of what he says because much of it has been misleading or wrong. For example, he’s said HIV isn’t the only cause of AIDS (it is), that antidepressant drugs cause mass shootings (they don’t), that older adults don’t have severe autism (some do), that the measles vaccine causes brain swelling (it doesn’t), that covid vaccines were the deadliest vaccines ever made (they aren’t), that vaccines aren’t safety-tested (they are), and that vaccines contribute to autism (they don’t).
“This is like the boy who cried wolf,” said Brian Lee, an epidemiologist at Drexel University. “One day he might be right about something and Americans who are not prone to conspiracies won’t trust it because it’s coming from RFK’s mouth. And that could be a problem.”
What’s more, the Trump administration is eroding scientists’ ability to probe the safety of pharmaceuticals, said Robert Steinbrook, head of health research at Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer protection group.
“Public Citizen is very supportive of research on medications that could be linked to diseases,” he said. “But it needs to be through an open process, which looks at scientific evidence, and which doesn’t cherry-pick studies to support a preconceived point of view.”
Steinbrook said the administration has undermined his confidence in the government’s ability to conduct credible work. The Food and Drug Administration has held less than a third the number of advisory committee meetings this year as it did last, meaning fewer opportunities for experts to discuss research on the risks and benefits of drugs. The Trump administration has fired hundreds of career scientists at the CDC and FDA and cut millions of dollars in research funds, including to projects studying autism.
In early September, the CDC issued an unusual contract with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to analyze datasets for signs that vaccinated children were more likely to have autism. Unlike with other research initiatives, the CDC didn’t post an open call for applications in advance. This allows agency experts to review proposals and select studies best designed to answer the question at hand.
CDC researchers told KFF Health News that experts in the agency’s autism and disability group weren’t aware of the contract or asked to review the proposal. That’s important, they said, because researchers digging through data to find clues about autism must show how they’ll rule out biological and environmental exposures that muddy the results, and ensure that children have been accurately diagnosed. One researcher said, “It absolutely looks like Kennedy has subverted the grantmaking process.”
The CDC and HHS did not respond to KFF Health News’ requests for information on the grant, including through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The new vaccine study is separate from Kennedy’s autism data-science initiative, which was posted as an open call at the National Institutes of Health. “The hope is that something good comes of it, and that the government won’t cherry-pick or censor what scientists find out,” Lee said.
Bauer said she didn’t apply to be part of the initiative because of Kennedy’s outsize presence at HHS.
“I would not take his funding because it could take away from the credibility of my study,” she said, “in the same way that taking money from pharmaceutical companies does.”

This week, as we approach the first anniversary of Hurricane Helene – one of the worst natural disasters ever to hit western North Carolina – it’s important to take a look at how we’re doing. Where do we stand and what do we still need? Who is worthy of praise and who isn’t?
I’m a native of Buncombe County with family in the area stretching back multiple generations, so this is personal to me. And as someone who works advocating on environmental issues with our elected officials, I have a professional opinion as well.
In terms of the people impacted by this storm, my admiration and appreciation for their commitment to help their neighbors, combined with their grit, determination, and resilience in coming back from Helene’s devastating impact is off the charts. The people of western NC demonstrated why I’m proud to say that’s where I’m from.
Nonprofits also did an incredible job after the storm – organizations providing meals, putting solar microgrids in place to reestablish power, winter clothing donations and distribution, churches becoming community relief centers. The list goes on and on.
As for the government response, the reviews are more mixed. Local governments really stepped up. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, they worked to serve their communities and stand them back up. In many cases, they spent huge amounts of money based on the reimbursement promise of the federal government. This is normal following natural disasters.
At the state level, then-Governor Roy Cooper was on the ground almost immediately after the storm. He was in constant contact with state and federal agencies to mobilize resources. His leadership was critical.
When current Governor Josh Stein took office in January, he made recovery from Helene a top priority from day one. He has been a constant presence – working to move rebuilding forward, especially opening roads and bridges that allow commerce to flow. He established the Governor’s Recovery Office for Western NC (GROW NC) with a focus on incorporating greater resilience in rebuilding to help prepare for future storms. And he and first lady Anna Stein have spent significant time in the region to encourage others to visit and spend tourism dollars that are vital to the regional economy. Last week, he traveled to Washington to detail additional funding requests, while urging previously approved money be released (more on that in a minute).
The Republican majority in the state legislature has been unimpressive. After the November election, they used Helene relief as cover for a partisan power grab. This year, they have consistently provided less support for recovery than Gov. Stein requested. Most significantly, they have not provided relief funds for small businesses who are struggling to survive.
Our Congressional delegation and Congress have generally been responsive. They initially passed nearly $10 billion in Helene relief. Hopefully, they will be receptive to the next round of requests from Gov. Stein.
The biggest obstacle to recovery has been the current administration, especially the Department of Homeland Security (which oversees FEMA) and the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been the opposite of efficient. They have both held up prompt distribution of relief funds.
So far, the federal government has only distributed approximately $3.8 billion of the $10 billion already appropriated by Congress. This is pathetic.
In total, federal support to date amounts to approximately 9% of the total damage western North Carolina suffered. By comparison, storms that were similarly devastating – such as Hurricanes Katrina, Maria, and Sandy – saw more than 70% of the cost of recovery efforts covered by federal funding. Gov. Stein’s $23 billion request last week would bring the federal support North Carolina received to 47%.
North Carolinians aren’t looking for a handout. We just want to be treated fairly and want the money to arrive before it’s too late. Farmers, small businesses, and local governments are hanging by a thread. We need officials in Washington to do their job and act with urgency, not hide behind empty rhetoric about creating efficiency.
The increasing frequency of extreme weather is a new reality for people across North Carolina, and across the country. We need the federal government to get better at relief and recovery, not worse.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-4-1024x642.jpeg,,,2025-09-23 12:57:32.902628

(Image via University of New England)A research team from the University of New England published a report Monday that showed the extensive coastal damage caused by the January 2024 storms, including the destruction of more than a quarter of coastal dunes along four beaches in southern Maine. 
Will Kochtitzky, an assistant professor in the School of Marine and Environmental Programs, and a team of six current and former students found that beaches in Saco, Biddeford and Kennebunkport lost 28% of coastal dunes in the back-to-back storms that hit the state on Jan. 10 and Jan. 13. Their findings were published Monday in the journal Geomorphica.
“The data sets we collect are really unique,” Kochtitzky said. “We plan to continue our coastal erosion monitoring efforts to support coastal Maine communities in the years ahead.” 
Dunes serve as the first line of defense along the coast, protecting homes, roads and wildlife habitat during severe storms. 
The Jan. 13 storm brought Maine’s highest water level on record. Across the four shorelines the team studied, the damage varied with the most extreme loss resulting in dune areas almost being cut in half. The researchers also found that only 10% to 50% of dune volume was recovered nine months after the storm. 
Bipartisan leaders come together to try to make Maine more resilient to extreme weather

However, their work showed restoration efforts, including beach scraping and dune grass planting, to be more effective than taking no action. With severe storms expected to become more frequent, “restoration efforts may be essential for the recovery, longevity, and stability of dunes and beach faces,” the report noted. 
The research team mapped the devastation using drone photography that produced two- and three-dimensional models. Their work provided data that can be used by Maine coastal communities to prepare for severe weather events in the future, according to a news release from the Biddeford-based university. 
The two January storms, in addition to a third severe storm that ravaged the coast a month earlier in December 2023, caused an estimated $90 million in damage to public infrastructure across Maine. Earlier this year, Gov. Janet Mills signed a three-part proposal into law to improve emergency communications, create funding opportunities to make Maine homes more resilient and establish a new State Resilience Office to address flooding and other impacts.
Of the six students who worked on the project, four of them —  Johanna Birchem, Bryan Corvelo, Tyler Janik, Ruth Ellis — are current UNE students. The other two students, Katelyn DeWater and Paige-Marie Merrill, graduated in 2025 and 2024, respectively.
The team gathered the data as part of Kochtitzky’s geographic information systems courses and additional research, which was funded by the Maine Space Grant Consortium and the Maine Outdoor Heritage Fund.  
The UNE students also created a website to share their research in a more accessible format.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Nine states are swapping voter rolls with Texas, and officials say the agreement will “improve the accuracy of voter registration records.”
Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab’s office announced the partnership Thursday, describing it as a way to identify duplicate registrations. Schwab, who is running for governor, said the agreement with Texas helps Kansas to maintain accurate voter rolls, which bolsters election integrity and administration.
The basis of Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson’s agreements with Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia is outlined in memoranda that allow the states to exchange voter registration data with Texas while “adhering to strict confidentiality and cybersecurity protocols.”
“This is a common sense step toward cleaner rolls and better election administration,” Schwab said. “We look forward to establishing agreements with other states in the future.”
Schwab said the agreement is part of a growing trend among states. Any duplicate registrations or instances of potential voter fraud identified through the data swapping would be referred to the appropriate authorities for further investigation, Nelson’s office said.
The agreement comes as some Republican secretaries of state, Schwab included, are resisting turning over sensitive voter information to the U.S. Department of Justice. A spokesperson for the Kansas Secretary of State’s office, Whitney Tempel, said Texas can’t share other states’ data with the federal government. A provision in the agreement prohibits states from sharing data with any third party.
“Secretary Schwab has been steadily adding new tools throughout his tenure to improve voter list maintenance, and this agreement is another step in that ongoing effort,” Tempel said.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas sued the state in 2018 over privacy concerns for its use of Crosscheck, a program that had been used to compare voter data across state lines. The program produced false positives 99% of the time, and officials mistakenly exposed sensitive information, including partial Social Security numbers, of nearly 1,000 Kansas voters under former Secretary of State Kris Kobach.
Schwab settled the case after he took office in 2019 by agreeing not to use the program.
The ACLU of Kansas is not convinced the agreement with Texas is much different than Crosscheck. Esmie Tseng, a spokesperson for the organization, said in a statement that the agreements politicize the right to vote and undermine “every Kansas voter’s right to privacy.” The organization fears the agreement will put thousands of Kansans’ data at risk because of “how insecure and error-prone government databases and sharing processes are,” she said.
“This is another example of how politicians are weaponizing xenophobia and the total myth of voter fraud to remove eligible voters from the rolls and attack our fundamental right to vote,” the statement said. “Secretary Schwab may claim this is not the same as Crosscheck, but there is little evidence of how he has moved to meaningfully ensure Kansans will be protected from data breaches or being removed incorrectly.”
Voter fraud is extremely rare in Kansas. The ACLU won a high-profile legal battle with Kobach in 2018 when he failed to prove his claims of widespread voter fraud.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6210915-e1731703263270-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-09-23 11:59:39.746762

Their announcement came shortly after the Miami Dade College’s Board […],"The Freedom Tower (Photo from Miami Dade College)Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier said Tuesday that a state board made up of the governor and the Florida Cabinet will vote to dedicate land at Miami Dade College next to the Freedom Tower to house the presidential library of Donald Trump.
Their announcement came shortly after the Miami Dade College’s Board of Trustees approved the transfer of property earlier on Tuesday, as reported by the Miami Herald.
The governor’s office said in a press release that he and the Cabinet, meeting as the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, will propose an item to convey a 2.63 acre parcel for the Donald J. Presidential Library. That board consists of the governor, the attorney general, the chief financial officer, and the commissioner of agriculture. It is responsible for the acquisition, management, protection, and disposition of state lands.
All are elected independently statewide and all are Republicans.
“President Trump has achieved results for the American people and made a lasting impact on our nation’s history,” DeSantis said in a press release. “No state has better delivered the President’s agenda than the Free State of Florida, and we would be honored to house his presidential library here in his home state.”
“I’ll be voting yes!” Uthmeier added in a video posted on X. “Surviving two assassination attempts, securing the border, and rebuilding our nation’s military are just a few stories this great library will tell.”
The video goes on to show Uthmeier walking near the Freedom Tower, located on Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami. The Freedom Tower was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2008 for its role in hosting people fleeing communist Cuba for Florida following the 1959 Cuban revolution.
“I can think of no better location to tell the story of Donald Trump,” Uthmeier says in the video. “A story of strength. One of redemption, one of victory, and one of sacrifice for the American people. It is the greatest political comeback story in history.”
Uthmeier is running unopposed for the Republican nomination of attorney general but has not been endorsed by the president ahead of the 2026 election. There has been speculation that “people close to Trump” have been courting Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez to challenge Uthmeier next year.
It’s not a surprise that Trump’s library will be located in South Florida. Officials close to the president, including Eric Trump and Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the United Nations, had been discussing possible sites in the region for months, NBC News reported earlier this year. The story reported that officials at Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University were lobbying to land the site.
The Florida Legislature earlier this year passed legislation (SB 118) that banned local governments in the state from interfering with any plans to construct a presidential library in Florida. The bill passed 36-3 in the GOP-controlled Senate and 89-20 in the GOP-controlled House.
‘Irony’
One of the Democrats who opposed the measure, Rep. Angie Nixon (D-Jacksonville), at the time found “irony” in what the House was doing.
“If we are going to support bringing this library here, we should support returning citizens all across the board, and not attack returning citizens, especially when they want to do things like vote, because we have one of the biggest returning citizens a/k/a felons in the administration right now,” she said, referring to Trump being found guilty in May 2024 in a New York courtroom on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money.
She referred to the 2018 constitutional amendment that legalized felons in Florida who had completed their sentence to be able to vote. However, an implementing bill in the following legislative session significantly narrowed the number of felons who can actually vote.
The president ultimately received an unconditional discharge. That meant that while the conviction stands, he will face no additional penalties, such as prison time, fines, or probation.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-23 14:30:12+00:00,CT Mirror,"‘Sick to my stomach’: Trump distorts facts on autism, Tylenol and vaccines, scientists say",Amy Maxmen | KFF Health News,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/23/trump-autism-tylenol-vaccines/,"CDC autism experts weren't consulted on the White House's announcement or asked to review a draft of findings and recommendations, they said.","Ann Bauer, a researcher who studies Tylenol and autism, felt queasy with anxiety in the weeks leading up to the White House’s much-anticipated autism announcement.
In August, Bauer and her colleagues published an analysis of 46 previous studies on Tylenol, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Many found no link between the drug and the conditions, while some suggested Tylenol might occasionally exacerbate other potential causes of autism, such as genetics.
Bauer, an epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, and her team called for more judicious use of the drug until the science is settled.
On Monday, President Donald Trump stood beside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for what he called a “historic” announcement on autism. “If you’re pregnant, don’t take Tylenol, and don’t give it to the baby after the baby is born,” Trump said. “There are certain groups of people that don’t take vaccines and don’t take any pills that have no autism,” he added, without providing evidence. “They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies, it’s a disgrace.”
A fact sheet released alongside the White House briefing cited Bauer’s analysis. But she was alarmed by Trump’s comments. If prenatal Tylenol has any association, which it may not, it would help account for only a fraction of cases, she said. Further, research has not deeply examined Tylenol risks in young children, and many rigorous studies refute a link between vaccines and autism.
Bauer worries such statements will cut both ways: People may put themselves at risk to avoid vaccines and Tylenol, the only safe painkiller for use during pregnancy. And she frets that scientists might outright reject her team’s measured concerns about Tylenol in a backlash against misleading remarks from Trump and other members of his “Make America Healthy Again” movement.
“I’m really concerned about how this message is going to play out,” she said. “It’s a sound-bite universe, and everyone wants a simple solution.”
Autism experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were neither consulted for the White House’s long-awaited autism announcement nor asked to review a draft of the findings and recommendations, CDC scientists told KFF Health News, which agreed not to identify them because they fear retaliation.
“Typically, we’d be asked to provide information and review the report for accuracy, but we’ve had absolutely no contact with anyone,” one CDC researcher said. “It is very unusual.”
Trump and Kennedy promised this year that under their leadership the federal government would swiftly figure out what causes autism. Scientists who work in the field have been skeptical, noting that decades of research has shown that no single drug, chemical, or other environmental factor is strongly linked to the developmental disorder. In addition, both Trump and Kennedy have repeated the scientifically debunked notion that childhood vaccines may cause autism.
Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research Excellence at Boston University, called Trump’s comments dangerous. Fevers can harm the mother and the developing fetus, she said, adding that fevers are more strongly associated with autism than Tylenol.
In an emailed response to queries, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America’s unprecedented rise in autism rates.”
White House spokesperson Kush Desai wrote, “President Trump pledged to address America’s rising rate of autism, and to do so with Gold Standard Science.”
Had CDC scientists been allowed to brief Kennedy, they say they would have cautioned that simple fixes won’t make a dent in the number of autism cases in the United States: As many as 1 in 31 8-year-old children had autism spectrum disorder in 2022.
Systemic changes, such as regulations on air pollution, which has been linked to asthma and developmental disabilities including autism, and assistance for parents of disabled children, could improve lives for far more Americans with autism and other conditions than actions taken by the Trump administration on Sept. 22, researchers say.
One federal action is to consider updating the label on Tylenol and to “encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.” The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists already recommends acetaminophen “as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.”
‘Political Crusade’
Despite Kennedy’s many years of speaking about autism, he rarely cites credible autism research or expert recommendations, Tager-Flusberg said. Instead, Kennedy repeats fringe, scientifically debunked theories linking vaccines to autism, despite rigorous studies published in peer-reviewed journals that refute a link.
At the Sept. 22 briefing, Trump said he spoke with Kennedy about autism 20 years ago: “We understood a lot more than a lot of people who studied it,” he said. Ahead of Trump’s first term in 2017, Kennedy said he met with the president to consider a commission on vaccine safety and autism. It didn’t happen then. But soon after Kennedy was confirmed as health secretary, he called autism “preventable,” pointed to “environmental toxins,” and contradicted the results of a CDC study finding that the main driver of rising autism diagnoses was that doctors increasingly recognize the disorder.
At a televised Cabinet meeting in April, Kennedy told Trump, “By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures.”
“You stop taking something, you stop eating something, or maybe it’s a shot,” Trump replied.
“He is on a political crusade,” Tager-Flusberg said of Kennedy, adding that vaccines, Tylenol, aluminum, and food dyes make for simple targets to rally against. “We know genetics is the most significant risk factor,” she said, “but you can’t blame Big Pharma for genetics, and you can’t build a political movement on genetics research and ride to victory.”
“RFK makes our work harder,” said Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher and the author of a book about his autistic daughter, “Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism.” He said the book stemmed from conversations with Kennedy in 2017, in which Hotez shared studies pinpointing more than a hundred genes linked to autism, and research into the complex interplay between genetics, biological processes, and things that children and fetuses encounter during development.
“I sat down with him and explained what the science says, but he was unwilling or incapable of thinking deeply about it,” Hotez said. “He is extremely careless.”
In addition to its focus on Tylenol, the White House said it would move to update “prescribing information” on leucovorin — a medication related to the B vitamin folate — to reflect its use as an autism treatment. A small clinical trial in 2012-13 suggested the drug may help treat language problems in some children with autism. Tager-Flusberg said the findings warrant further study but clarified these were “old data, not a breakthrough.”
Likewise, studies finding a modest association between autism and prolonged Tylenol use were published years ago. Researchers have suggested the medicine might occasionally exacerbate factors associated with autism, such as genetics and oxidative stress, a biological condition that occurs for a variety of reasons that scientists are still unraveling.
Still, these studies couldn’t rule out the possibility that fevers prompting women to take Tylenol, rather than the medicine itself, might instead be to blame. Fevers and infections — including those prevented by vaccines — have also been linked to autism.
Nonetheless, Bauer’s recommendation would be to pause before taking acetaminophen while pregnant — blanket advice that doctors give for all medications during that period, but which may be ignored. “Try to alleviate discomfort in some other ways, like with a cold compress, hydration, or massage, before taking it,” Bauer said.
She welcomed the White House’s motion to consider labeling Tylenol to emphasize judicious use of the drug but worries about how the MAHA movement might distort a careful message. On Sept. 2, the right-wing news outlet One America News Network posted an interview with newly appointed CDC vaccine adviser Robert Malone, writing that Malone “speculates RFK Jr. may have an important announcement this month regarding a potential link between Tylenol, multiple vaccinations and autism in children.”
“I was sick to my stomach,” Bauer said, concerned that Kennedy would link her study to discredited theories, causing doctors and scientists to reject her far more measured work.
‘The boy who cried wolf’
Several medical and scientific associations have called for Kennedy’s removal or resignation. Many scientists are skeptical of what he says because much of it has been misleading or wrong. For example, he’s said HIV isn’t the only cause of AIDS (it is), that antidepressant drugs cause mass shootings (they don’t), that older adults don’t have severe autism (some do), that the measles vaccine causes brain swelling (it doesn’t), that covid vaccines were the deadliest vaccines ever made (they aren’t), that vaccines aren’t safety-tested (they are), and that vaccines contribute to autism (they don’t).
“This is like the boy who cried wolf,” said Brian Lee, an epidemiologist at Drexel University. “One day he might be right about something and Americans who are not prone to conspiracies won’t trust it because it’s coming from RFK’s mouth. And that could be a problem.”
What’s more, the Trump administration is eroding scientists’ ability to probe the safety of pharmaceuticals, said Robert Steinbrook, head of health research at Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer protection group.
“Public Citizen is very supportive of research on medications that could be linked to diseases,” he said. “But it needs to be through an open process, which looks at scientific evidence, and which doesn’t cherry-pick studies to support a preconceived point of view.”
Steinbrook said the administration has undermined his confidence in the government’s ability to conduct credible work. The Food and Drug Administration has held less than a third the number of advisory committee meetings this year as it did last, meaning fewer opportunities for experts to discuss research on the risks and benefits of drugs. The Trump administration has fired hundreds of career scientists at the CDC and FDA and cut millions of dollars in research funds, including to projects studying autism.
In early September, the CDC issued an unusual contract with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to analyze datasets for signs that vaccinated children were more likely to have autism. Unlike with other research initiatives, the CDC didn’t post an open call for applications in advance. This allows agency experts to review proposals and select studies best designed to answer the question at hand.
CDC researchers told KFF Health News that experts in the agency’s autism and disability group weren’t aware of the contract or asked to review the proposal. That’s important, they said, because researchers digging through data to find clues about autism must show how they’ll rule out biological and environmental exposures that muddy the results, and ensure that children have been accurately diagnosed. One researcher said, “It absolutely looks like Kennedy has subverted the grantmaking process.”
The CDC and HHS did not respond to KFF Health News’ requests for information on the grant, including through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The new vaccine study is separate from Kennedy’s autism data-science initiative, which was posted as an open call at the National Institutes of Health. “The hope is that something good comes of it, and that the government won’t cherry-pick or censor what scientists find out,” Lee said.
Bauer said she didn’t apply to be part of the initiative because of Kennedy’s outsize presence at HHS.
“I would not take his funding because it could take away from the credibility of my study,” she said, “in the same way that taking money from pharmaceutical companies does.”

The Delaware Department of Agriculture has confirmed the presence of a box tree moth (Cydalima perspectalis) in New Castle County during inspections of traps set along the New Castle County-Kent County border.
The box tree moth is a federally regulated pest that primarily targets boxwood species (Buxus spp.), a popular evergreen shrub used in landscaping. Left unchecked, it can cause extensive damage and even kill the plants.
This is the first discovery of the insect in New Castle County. Delaware first confirmed a box tree moth in Kent County in July 2024, three years after the pest was first detected in the United States in 2021.
“We continue to work closely with our partners at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and University of Delaware extension to monitor this invasive pest,” said Jeffrey Brothers, Delaware Department of Agriculture’s Plant Industries Administrator. 
“A box tree moth caterpillar can quickly defoliate boxwoods and remain active until September or October. Homeowners and nurseries should be on the lookout for signs of damage to their plants.”

The caterpillars can grow up to 1.5 inches and are identified by their lime-green color, black stripes, white spots, hair, and shiny black heads. They produce heavy webbing on plants and can completely defoliate host shrubs. After leaves are stripped, they feed on bark, eventually killing the plant.
Adult box tree moths typically have white wings bordered with thick brown. They are most active at night and can sometimes be mistaken for melonworm moths.
What residents can do
Delawareans are urged to help prevent the spread of the pest by monitoring and managing infestations. Signs to watch for include brown or skeletonized leaves, defoliation, and webbing with caterpillars present.
Guidance on insecticide options is available here. Officials remind homeowners that “the label is the law. Always read and follow the pesticide label.”
For infestations, homeowners are advised to remove affected boxwood branches or, in severe cases, cut shrubs to the base. Plants can regrow from the roots, but debris must be double-bagged in plastic and placed in the trash.
Nursery businesses are encouraged to closely monitor their boxwoods and report any detections to the Delaware Department of Agriculture at DDA_PlantPests@delaware.gov.

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th. 
The divisions in American politics are usually obvious, often nowhere more than in the House of Representatives. But there are also glimmers of bipartisanship, and, lately, many of those have been driven by women.
At the start of this year, Reps. Brittany Pettersen, a Democrat, and Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican, united forces to challenge House leadership with a push to make the House friendlier for new mothers. More recently, three of the most outspoken House Republican women broke ranks with their party — and bucked President Donald Trump — in an effort to release more files related to the case of the late disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
And earlier this month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Republican Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida and Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California came together on a House resolution calling for expanded early screening for Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS), a blood-clotting disorder that can cause miscarriages and stillbirths.
They credited their cooperation to singer Christina Perri, who learned she had APS after losing her daughter Rosie late in pregnancy in 2020. Perri is now channeling her grief into advocacy. She said in an interview that it was “a privilege” to see lawmakers like Kamlager-Dove and Cammack putting their party affiliations to the side and uniting on an issue so important to her.
“What matters is that we’re women, we’re moms, we just want other women and moms to be okay,” she said. “And I find that really inspiring at a time where everything is just so messy, and I feel grateful to be a part of something like this.”
Women make up half of the U.S. population but hold just 28% of seats in Congress.
Research has not backed up the notion that women lawmakers are, overall, more bipartisan than men at the federal level. But select instances so far in this Congress show how unlikely coalitions of women lawmakers have united across party lines, challenged party leadership or both.
A major news conference at the Capitol with Epstein survivors in early September yielded what four years ago would have been an all but unthinkable scene: Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a progressive Democrat, defending and embracing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a conservative firebrand and staunch Trump ally.
“She has shown so much courage on this issue, so much leadership,” Khanna said of Greene, who was met with an uneven reception by the crowd. “I saw some people, when I was coming here, calling her names. We’ve got to stop that. We’ve got to stop the partisanship on this issue.”
Khanna and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are attempting to force a House floor vote on the Epstein files resolution with a procedural measure known as a discharge petition, which enables members to circumvent House leadership to get a measure to the floor.
Every sitting House Democrat and just three Republicans other than Massie — Greene, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina — have signed the discharge petition, leaving it just one signature short of the 218 required to force a vote.
All three women have maintained their support for the measure despite fierce opposition from Trump and the White House. At the news conference, Massie called Greene “the bravest woman in Congress.” He also posed the question: “Where are the men?”
“Never underestimate a woman,” Boebert said at the Capitol. “We all came here to do work. We all made promises, and some of us live up to them.”
Shared experiences around pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood have united some House members to work across the aisle.
“I think I can say very candidly now, as a new mom, moms just know how to multitask and learn how to get things done,” said Cammack, who welcomed her daughter Auggie last month. “And that might be why you see more bipartisan efforts coming out of the women, even though we represent a minority in Congress.”
At the Sept. 9 news conference, Kamlager-Dove, Cammack and Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman of Ohio all spoke about their experiences with pregnancy losses while building their families.
“What unites us is far deeper than what may appear on the surface,” Kamlager-Dove said. “Many of us share journeys to parenthood that are marked by hope, loss and eventually, resilience.”
Luna, the Florida Republican, and Pettersen, the Colorado Democrat, are also among the handful of House members to give birth while in office — and both missed votes after giving birth.
They teamed up on a measure to allow new parents in the House to temporarily designate another member to vote for them, also known as proxy voting.
House Speaker Mike Johnson vigorously opposed the effort, leading the duo to turn to a discharge petition. They succeeded in getting 218 votes on their discharge petition and overcame Johnson’s effort to quash the measure on the floor, temporarily grinding House business to a halt. Luna later struck a deal with Johnson, standing down on the proxy voting push in exchange for other concessions (Pettersen and other Democrats criticized the deal as insufficient).
Now, Luna is a member of another bipartisan coalition, this one backing a proposed ban on stock trading for members of Congress.
Another member of the group, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a progressive Democrat, said at a Sept. 3 news conference that, unlike in other legislative negotiations, lawmakers turned around a better product than the one they started with.
“It is one of those rare moments where I feel like Washington is working the way it’s supposed to work,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “And it feels foreign. And it feels alien … but I also think it is proof that things can work here.”
Women lawmakers “are better communicators,” Luna told The 19th while leaving House votes Sept. 9. At the stock trading ban news conference days earlier, she indicated she’s prepared to challenge House leadership again if necessary.
“I often feel like an adjudicator in this job,” she said. “And so, I guess I’ll be the one to say that we’ve asked nicely for leadership to put this on the floor. If they don’t, I say timeline is end of month: There’s a discharge petition that is ready to go.”
The most consequential legislation passed by Congress this year has been muscled through without Democratic support, and there have been plenty of moments of acrimony on the floor.
Much of it has been clearly gendered: As the House considered its annual defense spending bill, Mace erupted at Rep. Sara Jacobs, a California Democrat, during debate over Mace’s proposed anti-transgender amendments to the legislation. Rep. Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat who this year became the first openly transgender lawmaker to serve in Congress, has faced repeated attacks and misgendering from some of her Republican colleagues.
High-profile but not expressly political public figures have, in many cases, been the catalysts for bipartisan congressional action.
Years of tireless lobbying by Paris Hilton led to Congress passing a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing child abuse and neglect in youth residential facilities last December.
Engineer, author and science TV host Emily Calandrelli’s personal story of being hassled by TSA as a new parent led to the Senate and a House committee passing bipartisan legislation making it easier for parents to travel with breast milk and breastfeeding equipment through airport security. The legislation has not received a vote on the House floor.
And Epstein’s survivors, Khanna said, are “helping us come together as a country.”
“I’ve never done a press conference with Marjorie Taylor Greene before,” he joked at the Sept. 3 news conference.
Both Cammack and Kamlager-Dove credited Perri with using her platform to raise awareness about APS — and bringing them together on a mission to promote the adoption of what they said is a simple test that could spare so many the heartache of pregnancy loss.
“We bonded over a common story of having a miscarriage and wanting answers to questions that were not easy to come by,” Kamlager-Dove said.
“Without her advocacy, without her courage to come forward, this wouldn’t be happening, and so she has been the driver in really bringing us together to make this a reality,” Cammack said.
Cammack said she’s “very confident” about the resolution on APS testing moving forward and getting a vote on the House floor. Perri said the measure’s passing would be “a win for everybody,” and a victory “that feels kind of rare right now.”
“My hope and goal is to have this changed forever, for women to not need to even know about it,” she said. “But until then, I will always speak about it, and I will help move the needle forward.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/uscapitolmay72025-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-23 10:57:47.434748

The future of our state is inextricably linked to the future of its largest city.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Matt Wormser: An open letter to Gov. Phil Scott about Burlington.","Dear Gov. Phil Scott,


I rode into my office in Burlington in late August, enjoying the new bike paths along the Champlain Parkway and Pine Street along the way. Church Street was alive with the return of students, and the waterfront was similarly vibrant with walkers, bikers and people out enjoying the glory days of late summer. 
I noticed that the new Burlington Square building was looking great, and the painfully slow infrastructure improvements along Main Street and beyond were likewise starting to reveal their final form. 
Also evident in my midday walk through City Hall Park were the well-documented substance use and homelessness issues facing Burlington. These were issues that you discussed briefly in your Aug. 20 press conference, resulting in some “he said-she said” back and forth press with Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak. If I could summarize your comments during your conference, they were that your administration was certainly willing to help but that you were in effect waiting for the phone to ring.

During your conference, you also took issue with the characterization of Burlington as the “economic engine” of the state. To that I respectfully disagree. 
Chittenden County — with Burlington as our epicenter — represents 26% of Vermont’s population but generates 37% of Vermont’s gross domestic product and 35% of its income taxes. Vermonters likewise continue to vote with their feet — 61% of Vermont’s population growth since the year 2000 went Chittenden County — presumably drawn to higher-paying jobs, a vibrant civic life and other opportunities. 
The future of our state is inextricably linked to the future of its largest city.
Scott, I’ll note that I have voted for you on multiple occasions, but if there’s been a critique of your leadership, I have too often heard it’s that you show up long enough to veto the bill without sufficient engagement in crafting it along the way. Whether that’s fair or not, Burlington — and Vermont, by extension — needs your more active involvement to address challenges that fall disproportionately on Burlington that are not the fault of city policy. 
Whatever policy differences I might have with Burlington Progressives — and there are many — I don’t believe they convinced the Sackler family to get a generation of Americans hooked on opioids. I don’t think they caused the nationwide housing shortage and resulting homelessness epidemic. I don’t think they contributed to our insufficient mental health support system, among other issues. 
While the Burlington City Council has belatedly responded to community requests for increased enforcement — especially in City Hall Park — fixing the city’s problems is going to require your administration’s active engagement and in building solutions well beyond recommendations for more enforcement. 
What are opportunities for increased administration involvement? Let’s start with proactive outreach to Mulvaney-Stanak — along with city leaders suffering similar issues in Rutland, Brattleboro and beyond. 
This would help to not only to coordinate statewide policy solutions, but also to increase Vermont State Police’s focus on combatting drug trafficking throughout the state, propose a viable replacement to the motel program, address judiciary and prosecutor shortages, move the police academy to Chittenden County where a majority of recent graduates can more easily attend, or implement similar measures to reduce our policing shortages, among a range of other items. 
Most importantly, however, simply showing up to demonstrate your renewed commitment to supporting the — yes — economic engine of Vermont through your words and actions. 
For many years Chittenden County tax dollars have disproportionately subsidized small schools and provided policing in rural parts of the state, disproportionately funded health care and housing for needy Vermonters, and likewise disproportionately helped with road-building and recovery efforts when the floodwaters rise in Burke, Barre, Ludlow and beyond. 
Well, the floodwaters have risen in Burlington with the trifecta of housing shortages, a national opioid crisis and inadequate mental health services, and Vermont needs your active leadership to help solve it. 
For the good of our state, please step it up.

This type of landslide is among many different types described in a newly published state landslide inventory. (Photo  by Jeff Pedersen/Alaska Wildland Adventures/Provided by the U.S. Geological Survey)More than 10,000 known Alaska landslides or landslide-related events are documented in a new state inventory intended to help improve understanding of risks and what can be done to improve safety.
The inventory, published by the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys, is intended to be integrated into a national landslide inventory maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey.
It will be updated as more information is collected, said Jillian Nicolazzo, a geologist who leads the division’s landslide hazards program.
“This is the first step just to sort of get everything in one place,” Nicolazzo said. “Now that we see what we have, we can start looking at what we don’t have and start filling in the gaps.”
To compile the inventory, state scientists pored over more than 1,000 USGS maps and reviewed aerial imagery, published news accounts and other information on where landslides have occurred in the past. Many of those USGS maps dated back to the 1950s, when the agency was trying to scope out opportunities for mineral extraction or infrastructure development, Nicolazzo said.
“They weren’t looking for landslides. They were just trying to map the geology. And if they happened to see landslides too, they might have noted it on the maps, but they also might not have,” she said.
One map that contributed to the inventory is even older; it was created in 1915.
The new searchable landslide inventory features an Alaska map with colored dots representing the type of event that occurred at each site. Some are slides in which unstable upper layers detach from more stable lower layers. Some are abrupt falls that send rocks or boulders tumbling. Some are considered “flows,” a category that includes the continually moving frozen debris lobes dotting the Brooks Range. Some are considered thaw events. Those and other types of events are described in the inventory.
The dots on the map fill most of the southern half of the state, from the eastern Interior to the eastern Aleutian Islands, and are spread across the Brooks Range in the Arctic. The relatively empty spaces do not necessarily represent a lack of landslides, Nicolazzo said. Rather, those reflect a lack of reports, she said.
So far, the inventory includes only some of the events that have occurred in Southeast Alaska, where slides have killed 12 people in the past decade. That region of the state is already covered by an extensive and periodically updated inventory of landslides in the Tongass National Forest, which comprises most of the Southeast region.
While much of the information used for the inventory is old, Alaska’s landslide monitoring work is relatively new, at least when compared to the programs that have been underway for decades in countries like Norway and Switzerland.
The Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys’ landslide hazards program was established only three years ago, and the inventory has been one of its major projects.
Compared to those other countries, “we’re in the beginning stages. But we have to start somewhere,” Nicolazzo said.
To meet the challenge, agencies have mounted a group effort, she said.
“The state is very large, and we don’t have a lot of state employees working on it. There aren’t a lot of federal employees working on it,” she said. “We tag-team different tasks to each of our strengths.”
Funding to support the effort is also limited, she said. She pointed to the multiagency work monitoring the high-risk Barry Arm landslide site in Prince William Sound as evidence of that.
“There is a lot of money spent on equipment looking just at that one landslide, and we know it’s not the only one in the area,” she said. “It would require a lot more money than we have available to monitor everything the same as we’re monitoring that one.”

Longtime Burlington musician Kevin Bloom is trying their hand at politics, announcing their early bid for Chittenden County sheriff on Sept. 9. After landing on the ballot for the 2026 race, Bloom has carried on collecting signatures across the county as means of getting the word out about their campaign. 
As of Monday, Bloom, 31, has garnered 168 signatures from 14 of the 18 municipalities in the county: Burlington, South Burlington, Winooski, Williston, Colchester, Essex, Essex Junction, St. George, Huntington Shelburne, Richmond, Jericho, Hinesburg and Charlotte. 
“It’s been amazing. I’ve been going around to different towns and just talking to people,” Bloom said. “I’ve talked to a bunch of landlords. I’ve talked to tenants. I’ve talked to young people. Older people. People my age. People who have lived here for a while. People who just moved here. Immigrants to America. People whose families have been here for a while.”
Bloom’s main platform as a Democratic candidate for Chittenden County sheriff is to end the blanket enforcement of evictions, which they called “a radical investment in our community, that would have some pretty profound results.” Bloom said they would like to cultivate relationships with tenants, landlords, housing developers and community organizations, and connect people with resources to prevent them from losing housing.
“What’s affecting everyone in the county is the housing crisis, and so people who I have talked to on all ends of the political spectrum have agreed that this is a pretty serious problem that’s affecting people in our community in immeasurably negative ways,” Bloom said. “A common theme has been a real resonance with the idea that we should address the problem and stop throwing people out into the street, especially families and especially children.”
Bloom said they did not support people withholding rent, and acknowledged there are some uncommon circumstances where eviction may be necessary.
But Bloom said eviction could be avoided in the vast majority of cases if people were connected with new housing options, job support or other resources. In the usual situation where an eviction is necessary, Bloom said that there should be more of an effort to connect people with the help rather than letting them slip through the cracks.
Along with addressing the “omnipresent” housing issue in Chittenden County, Bloom said they would like to be a resource to community members facing wage theft, hate crimes, racial profiling, and violence against the unhoused, helping connect people to the right entities to report crimes and gain justice. 
“These are small or large acts of violence against a community that people just in power seem to not really care about,” Bloom said. 
Bloom also said they would not assist federal Immigration, Customs and Enforcement officials’ actions in the county if requested. Bloom also said they want to serve as a mechanism of police oversight to provide accountability to address cases like Burlington police officers being accused of using excessive force this year and in previous years. 
Acknowledging the fear many may feel around law enforcement, Bloom said they want to change the relationship between the community and the Chittenden County Sheriff’s Office, if elected, by listening to residents’ needs.

Bloom also heads the Burlington-based experimental, psych-rock band The Dead Shakers, which released their sixth album, “Now That’s What I Call Missiles & Bombs 4 Kidz!,” on Sept. 19. With songs titled “To Conflate Jewishness With Zionism Is Itself A Profoundly Anti-Semetic Act, And I Question The Motives of Those Who Do Things Like This“ and “Silence is Violence,” Bloom said they worked to ensure their songs were “unco-optible into anything other than political statements.”
But Bloom said they view their music and creative expression about global issues — like what Bloom and the Vermont congressional delegation recognize as a genocide in Gaza — as important but separate from the everyday work of a local sheriff candidate doing local outreach. 
Bloom takes issue with the current direction of the sheriff’s office led by Daniel Gamelin, who has increasingly offered private businesses security services for hire, racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars for the department in 2024, according to Seven Days reporting. 
“The difference between a sheriff’s deputy and a private security guard is that the sheriff’s deputy is allowed to shoot someone if they deem it necessary, and I just don’t think that’s a service that should be offered by the state,” Bloom said. 
In the past election cycle, Gamelin was uncontested for the role in both the primary and general election, so Bloom said they are offering the county an alternative.
Gamelin wrote in an email Friday that he intends on running as an incumbent in 2026 but did not immediately respond to VTDigger for more information on his platform. 
“I want to continue the proud tradition of the Chittenden County Sheriff Office,” Gamelin wrote. “I have a great team here in Burlington and want to continue to build on that.”
Bloom is not collecting campaign donations, believing word of mouth is powerful enough to spread their message. Bloom said the funds would be “better spent buying a meal for someone living on the street and handing it to them.” 
“That would have a much bigger impact immediately,” Bloom said. 
Until Election Day in 2026, Bloom said their goal is to talk with constituents to generate ideas on how to help individuals and the county thrive. 
“I think community interaction is a huge component that they’re just not doing right now,” Bloom said. “The Sheriff’s Department could be such a resource for the community.”

The chief financial officer of Florida is one of three Cabinet-level positions in state government, along with the attorney general and agriculture commissioner, and goes up for election every four years. Together, they help the governor administer a number of state agencies. The CFO is the statutory head of the Department of Financial Services, which oversees more than a dozen agencies, including the State Fire Marshal, Consumer Services, and Inspector General. The position pays $140,000 a year.
The fight to reduce property taxes
Ingoglia has been in the news headlines constantly since his appointment by DeSantis earlier this summer. The two Republicans have been on an unofficial campaign to boost a still-to-written constitutional amendment next year that will ask voters whether they want to substantially reduce their property taxes.
Ingoglia has utilized two new state government agencies in that effort: DOGE (“Department of Governmental Efficiency”) and FAFO (the Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight) to scrutinize spending by local governments throughout the state. That’s been controversial, as Ingoglia has accused several local governments — many (but not all) controlled by Democrats — of excessive and “wasteful” spending.
That strategy was called out in an editorial in the Orlando Sentinel over the weekend.
“The motives are painfully obvious: State leaders are trying to amass proof that local governments are routinely overspending on ridiculous priorities,” says the editorial. “The next step, obviously, is to take away their ability to set property tax rates. That’s been the obvious destination from the start, and it is a straight path to disaster for Florida’s communities.”
Ingoglia said Monday that he has three big priorities: 1) Property tax relief, 2) Holding local governments accountable, and 3) Pushing down property insurance rates.
He said he “cut his teeth” two decades ago claiming that local governments had “gone wild” in their spending and it is funny that “what we are seeing right now is seeing government gone wild and run amok with a lot of our property tax dollars.”
Property Insurance
Another responsibility for the CFO is overseeing insurance regulation.
“We need to hold the insurance companies accountable to do what they say that they are going to do, what they are contractually obligated to pay, because if they don’t they’re going to get fined,” he said, drawing cheers. “I am not here to protect the profits of insurance companies. I am not here to protect the profits of trial attorneys. What I am here to do is protect you, the policyholders, and I will continue do that.”
Democrats question whether Ingoglia will do that.
“Floridians deserve a CFO who will stand up to the insurance companies and help make property insurance more affordable,” Democratic House Leader Fentrice Driskell said upon his appointment to succeed Patronis in July.
“Instead, Ron DeSantis is appointing a Tallahassee politician more loyal to him than to the people. I believe Blaise Ingoglia will talk tough but continue the tradition of giving the insurance companies everything they ask for while Florida’s working families and seniors pay the price.”
Ingoglia is native New Yorker and homebuilder who moved to Spring Hill in Hernando County (about 50 miles north of Tampa) in the mid-1990s. He was elected to the Florida House in 2014 and simultaneously served as Republican Party of Florida chairman from 2015 to 2019. He had served in the Senate since 2022.
The potential competition 
He’s a close political ally of Gov. DeSantis, who will be pushing for his election over the next year. The governor snubbed another Republican lawmaker who had previously announced his candidacy for CFO, Sarasota County’s Joe Gruters, who had already been endorsed by President Donald Trump. Early polls showed Gruters crushing Ingoglia in a presumptive Republican CFO primary in August 2026.
But that likely heavyweight matchup was averted after Trump elevated Gruters to lead the Republican National Committee. However, another Republican that Ingoglia may face next year is Rep. Kevin Steele, R-Dade City, former CEO of a health care technology company who announced on his 2022 financial disclosure form that he is worth more than $400 million.
Steele last week announced creation of a political committee called “Friends of Kevin Steele.” Earlier this month, Florida Politics reported that Steele was being “encouraged” to run by Trump — which could prove a headache for Ingoglia.
Ingoglia boasted to the crowd that he was the RPOF’s chair when Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in Florida in 2016.
“I helped Donald Trump get elected in this state,” he said. “I was a campaign spokesman for him. An official surrogate in 2020. And that man is doing amazing things at the federal level right now.”
Two other Republicans have filed to run for CFO: Frank William Collige and Benjamin Horbowy. No Democrat has filed for the seat, according to the state’s Division of Elections website.
Ingoglia is a fiercely partisan Republican. He joked that when he growing up, his mother said that he could be anything he wanted, “So, I decided to become a problem for Democrats,” he said, generating laughs from the crowd. “And some Republicans, also,” he added.
In 2023, he filed a bill that, if enacted, would have eliminated the Florida Democratic Party. Dubbed “The Ultimate Cancel Act,” it was intended to “cancel” the filings of any party that previously advocated for slavery, which Southern Democrats did in the 19th Century. He later described the bill as a direct response to “leftist activists and their attempts to cancel people and companies.” (The bill never received a committee hearing).
He takes pride in being politically incorrect. He joked during his speech, “I’m a very big fan of DEI — and by that I mean deport every illegal.” In his video announcing his candidacy earlier this month, Ingoglia said that he spoke four languages: English, profanity, sarcasm and “real s—.”
During his tenure in the Legislature, Ingoglia sponsored some of DeSantis’ biggest priorities. In 2023, he led the way on SB 1718, a comprehensive crackdown on illegal immigration in Florida. That measure mandated the use of E-Verify for employers, banned the use of legally issued driver’s licenses from states that issue them regardless of immigration status, and provided $12 million in taxpayer dollars to fund a program that transported immigrants away from Florida.
Ingoglia also sponsored a bill that year that has made it much more difficult for teachers’ unions to collect dues and qualify to represent a bargaining unit.
Among those in attendance for the event were Pinellas County Sen. Nick DiCeglie (emcee of the event),  Rep. Danny Alvarez (R-Hillsborough), Rep. Jeff Holcomb (R-Spring Hill), and former Lakeland area Republican lawmaker Kelli Stargell.
Ingolgia declined to take questions from reporters following the event.

The National Housing Conference (NHC) recently released a report looking at how much people working in different professions must earn in order to afford a mortgage and rent nationwide.
In Connecticut, the report analyzed what it would cost to own a home in the cities of New Haven, Hartford, New London and Bridgeport. The costs associated with buying a home in those locations has increased by about 100% since 2019.
“We cannot think of this as a problem that only exists for a subset of people,” NHC Senior Policy and Research Associate Brittany Webb said. “This is something that matters in every community. Coastal. Non-coastal. This matters for every income level.”
In New Haven, New London and Hartford the income needed to purchase a home with 10% down has doubled, according to Webb. In Bridgeport, the income needed increased by 94%.
More than 30% of tracked occupations in those cities could afford to purchase a home in 2019. By 2024 in those cities, only 6% could afford to purchase, Webb said.
“There are examples of lawyers and dentists and groups of people that have extensive education and are earning high salaries that are still priced out of housing,” Webb said. “That’s what’s been, I think, the most shocking for us.”
Rent also became less attainable for people in many careers, Webb said.
In 2019, about 60% of people in the jobs included in the study could afford the $1,200 a month rent on a 2-bedroom apartment in Bridgeport, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
But by 2024 the average rent on a two bedroom apartment in Bridgeport rose to $1,600 dollars per month and less than 40% could afford rent at that price.
One of the key concerns is how wages haven’t increased in recent years to compensate for inflation and rising housing costs.
“If we don’t address the supply shortage, reform zoning, and invest in housing at all income levels, we are facing a fundamental threat to the health and sustainability of our economy,” NHC President and Chief Executive Officer David Dworkin said.
The study included nearly 400 communities and jobs ranging from lawyers and dentists to mechanics and teachers.
The report used data from NHC’s Paycheck to Paycheck database, which is updated quarterly to track affordability changes based on occupation and city.
“These findings underscore the depth and breadth of the housing crisis, which is increasingly pricing out working families across the country—regardless of geography or profession,” Dworkin said.

Immigration arrests at federal courthouses have taken up most of the national attention since Donald Trump became president, but across California, U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement agents are showing up at state courts and arresting undocumented immigrants, CalMatters Nigel Duara reports. 
It happened this summer in Fresno: A judge reportedly congratulated a man for completing a one-year court-ordered program following a domestic violence conviction last year. ICE agents were waiting outside the courthouse and arrested him. He’s since been deported to Mexico, his sister told Duara.
The man’s story isn’t unique. ICE agents have arrested at least two dozen other people at state courts in Stanislaus, Glenn, Los Angeles and Fresno counties. 
This summer in Butte County, immigration enforcement agents conducted an operation inside the county’s Oroville courthouse. That’s a violation of a 2019 California law that forbids civil arrests “in a courthouse while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in the courthouse.”
Butte County’s court administrator is troubled by the courthouse arrests, since they discourage people fearful of being deported from attending routine court proceedings. 

Sharif Elmallah, Butte County Superior Court executive officer, in a statement: “The court is concerned by the potential chilling effect and other potential adverse impacts on participation in the legal system that may occur due to these enforcement actions being conducted in and around courthouses.”

Those who miss a mandatory court appearance in a criminal case can face additional charges. 
But much like the package of bills Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Saturday meant to keep immigration enforcement agents out of schools and hospitals, it’s unclear what California law enforcement can actually do to enforce the law keeping agents out of courthouses. 
An ICE spokesperson says agents have every right to arrest “a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Colleges and universities across California are about to feel the consequences of steep federal cuts to diversity programs, CalMatters’ Adam Echelman reports. 
The cuts come after the U.S. Department of Education said earlier this month that it was ending a grant program that supports “minority-serving institutions,” claiming that it illegally favors certain racial or ethnic groups.
That’s going to mean California schools will lose access to higher-education funding for tutoring, academic counseling and other support services aimed at helping Black, Latino, Asian and Native American students.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday signed Senate Bill 627, which would prohibit federal officers from wearing masks during their operations, but any critics of ICE tactics are wildly mistaken if they believe federal officers can be prosecuted for wearing masks.
The controversial tactics agents use to round up undocumented immigrants in Southern California are merely an expansion of the discriminatory stops and interrogations border communities have experienced for generations, writes commentary contributor Pedro Rios.

(Screenshot from video)Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita sent a six-page memo to all Indiana school superintendents and university administrators Monday night saying that schools are “wrong” for not disciplining or firing teachers who make comments about Charlie Kirk’s death.
“Some schools have responded to those calls for action with excuses and equivocation, claiming that the First Amendment prevents them from terminating or disciplining educators for celebrating or expressing controversial views about the killing of Charlie Kirk,” Rokita wrote. “In many if not most cases, those schools are wrong.”
He said additionally that, as a legal matter, schools have substantial authority to punish educators for divisive or controversial speech. The memo quotes numerous cases that are standing legal precedent on the matter.
“As a matter of good government and sound public policy, schools would be wise to remove from the classroom teachers who express support for or attempt to excuse political violence. And as a matter of morality, this moment demands decisive action from public officials to address noxious speech from government employees that undermines public confidence in our schools and corrodes public discourse.”
First Amendment and Teacher Speech
 
Since Kirk’s Sept. 10 assassination, Republicans have sought to punish those who “celebrated” the assassination. In Indiana, Gov. Mike Braun has threatened teaching licenses, arguing that “calls for political violence are not freedom of speech and should not be tolerated.”
Pushback against a Ball State University employee led to her firing and she filed suit against the university Monday. The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana is seeking an injunction on her behalf.
“Government employees don’t give up their First Amendment rights just to become employees of the government,” said Stevie Pactor, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU. “They, still, are entitled to their own personal opinions that they are free to express online or in other forums, so long as those are being made in their personal capacity.”
In Rokita’s document, his office provides a legal analysis about social media posts made by a U.S. history teacher at a high school in north central Indiana. He didn’t name Brett Maurer in the memo, but Rokita posted to social media about the teacher on Sept. 18 and urged Hoosiers to call or email the South Bend district to voice concerns.
In one post, the teacher wrote, “with all due disrespect Charlie Kirk can suck it. He became exactly what he said was ok and acceptable in order to have gun rights. I call that manifestation. I’m not saying it’s right, but I’m saying it’s only fitting.”
There were two other posts by the same teacher, as well, and Rokita said his office received 25 complaints.
The attorney general conceded that because the posts were made on the teacher’s personal social media page and concern a political figure and political topics, it is likely that a court would conclude that the teacher was “sp[eaking] as a citizen on a matter of public concern. Accordingly, whether the high school can discipline or terminate this teacher will depend on a balancing of the school’s interests as an employer and the teacher’s speech interest. An assessment of the posts and the context in which they were made shows clearly that this high school could legally terminate this teacher.”
Rokita alleges the posts were crass and vulgar, which weakens First Amendment protections.

“And there are very clear indications that the teacher’s posts and others like it have sparked severe backlash in Indiana communities that threaten to disrupt school operations …,” he wrote. “The backlash has evidently been so severe that the high school in this case felt impelled to release a public statement justifying its decision not to discipline the teacher, which it justified on the incorrect grounds that it could not terminate the teacher because of the First Amendment.”
Rokita further stated it’s reasonable that allowing divisive and cruel comments to stand creates concerns for parents about whether the teacher can be trusted.
“That loss of trust by the school, if left unaddressed, could have serious negative implications for the school for years to come and is reason enough to take action against the teacher,” he continued.
The memo concluded by saying the speech by Maurer “plainly caused disruption to school operations and is likely to cause further disruption in the days and weeks ahead. The school would thus be well within its authority to terminate the teacher, as would many schools if they chose to terminate teachers who have similarly contributed to the divisive and, for many, painful eruption of controversial discourse on social media and elsewhere concerning Charlie Kirk.”

A California law bans immigration enforcement at courthouses. ICE under the Trump administration is detaining people there, anyway, arguing it’s s safe place to apprehend someone.


Jennifer isn’t saying her brother is a saint. Far from it. He was convicted of domestic violence last year and entered a one-year intervention program. He graduated July 23 in a Fresno county courtroom where a judge told him he had done a good job.
Minutes later, while leaving the courthouse, five men and one woman in plain clothes approached him. 
“Someone came up to him, got in his face and said his name,” said Jennifer, who did not want CalMatters to use her last name because she was concerned about immigration enforcement agents targeting other relatives. “And they grabbed him, and I tried to get between them.”
Her brother, who is undocumented, didn’t provide them with an identification. 
“They shoved him in this car, which was a plain, beat-up van,” Jennifer said. “Then one of them asked if they should wait for ‘the other guy,’ and a different person said ‘we’re good with this one,’ like he was just part of their quota that day.”
Her brother is already back in Mexico. 
Social media is awash with videos of federal agents making arrests at immigration court hearings, which are on federal property, inside federal courthouses. 
What’s different about the detention of Jennifer’s brother is that it took place on the grounds of a state courthouse. Local media have reported the detention of at least two dozen other people on the grounds of California court buildings in Stanislaus, Glenn, Los Angeles and Fresno counties, and NPR reports federal immigration detentions in state courthouses across the country, from the Chicago suburbs to a county south of Boston. 
During the last Trump administration, California Democrats were so concerned about ICE making arrests at superior court buildings and potentially discouraging witnesses from testifying that they passed a law to forbid that kind of enforcement.
Picking people up at a courthouse can have a “potential chilling effect” on witnesses, victims and even suspects who are afraid to show up for court, California Supreme Court Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero said earlier this summer. 
“Making courthouses a focus of immigration enforcement hinders, rather than helps, the administration of justice by deterring witnesses and victims from coming forward and discouraging individuals from asserting their rights,” Guerrero said. 
By waiting outside the courthouse, immigration agents appear to be complying with California law, though it’s unclear whether the word “courthouse” in the law includes the grounds outside the courthouse. Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office wouldn’t provide what it a spokesperson called “legal analysis” of those actions when CalMatters asked about them.
But at least one immigration enforcement action was a clear violation of state law. 
In Butte County, immigration enforcement agents conducted an operation inside the county’s Oroville courthouse on July 28. State law forbids civil arrests “in a courthouse while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in the courthouse.”
“As far as the court is aware, ICE had not conducted enforcement actions inside one of its courthouses prior to Monday, July 28th,” Butte County Superior Court executive officer Sharif Elmallah said in a statement.
“The court is concerned by the potential chilling effect and other potential adverse impacts on participation in the legal system that may occur due to these enforcement actions being conducted in and around courthouses.”
As with the package of bills Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Saturday meant to keep immigration enforcement agents out of schools and hospitals, it’s unclear what California law enforcement can actually do to enforce the law forbidding immigration agents from making arrests inside courthouses. 
The state Justice Department’s guidance to state courthouses provides some latitude to immigration enforcement agents. They may make arrests inside a courthouse if the case involves a national security threat, someone’s life is in danger, evidence is in danger or agents are in “hot pursuit.” 
Failing all of that, under California law, immigration agents can enter a courthouse to detain someone whom they believe poses a danger to public safety if they can’t find an alternate location and they have the approval of a federal immigration enforcement supervisor. 
ICE defends courthouse arrests
Jennifer believes immigration agents ran her brother’s name through their own database when it was posted on the Fresno County Superior Court’s public online court docket, then waited for him to appear.
In response to questions from CalMatters, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded with a July quote from a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson which asserted the agency’s right to make arrests of “a lawbreaker where you find them.” The spokesperson also said the arrests are safer for immigration agents, since the people they’re arresting have been through security. 
Policies on courthouse arrests have seesawed through Democratic and Republican administrations.
The Obama administration in 2011 designated schools, hospitals and religious buildings as “sensitive locations” where immigration agents need permission to operate. ICE at the time said the list of sensitive locations was longer than those three types of places and urged agents to get permission from higher-ups before making arrests at any organization assisting “victims of crime.”
Trump undid that policy in 2018 with a directive instructing ICE agents to make arrests at state and local courthouses. They proceeded to do so, even in California. In 2021, the Biden administration reversed that guidance, putting courthouses mostly off-limits.In May, Wired reported that the new Trump administration went even further than its 2018 directive, explicitly removing instructions to agents that they should respect local laws that would prevent them from arresting people. 
Are immigrants avoiding court?
Jennifer said word has already gotten out among the immigrant community in Fresno to stop attending court. Family members even tried to discourage her brother from appearing on the day he was detained.
“In general, people are just avoiding going to the courthouse, even after meeting with groups who inform them that there’s consequences to not showing up,” said Nora Zaragoza-Yáñez, a program manager for the Valley Watch Network, an immigrant rights group.
A Fresno County Superior Court spokesperson said the court hasn’t seen a change in the number of people appearing, but noted that in a county of 1 million people, such shifts among a relatively small population would be hard to notice.
The state Department of Justice said it’s aware of the courthouse arrests. As a former member of the Assembly, Bonta, now the state attorney general, was a co-author of the law that was meant to deter immigration enforcement at California courthouses.
“We are very concerned with the Trump administration’s actions, which make our communities less safe by deterring victims or witnesses of crimes from coming forward out of fear of getting caught up in the President’s mass deportation dragnet,” the California Department of Justice said in an unsigned statement to CalMatters.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091825_Fresno-Courthouse_LV_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

Then just 15 years old, the San Diegan was apparently handcuffed on the streets of the Nestor border community, wrongly and racially profiled. 
Ramirez recalled the incident in a Facebook post recently after the Supreme Court broke with lower courts in a major immigration enforcement ruling stemming from this summer’s raids in Los Angeles. In a 6-3 decision, the highest court of the land gave federal immigration agents the green light to resume roving patrols as a means to indiscriminately stop and question people about their immigration status — based on how they look, the language they speak, the type of work they do or simply where they might be standing.
For Ramirez, now the political director for SEIU United Service Workers West, this is not new. He told me that the Border Patrol, the federal agency with a 101-year history of border enforcement, has always operated with impunity. Racial profiling “has always been the norm in the borderlands.”
Now the rest of California is getting the same treatment.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion rationalized profiling to an eye-opening level, writing that “those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction” and many “do not speak much English.”
Since a Kern County raid in January, videos of masked federal agents chasing predominantly Latino workers at Home Depots, car washes or parks — without regard for legal status or criminal history — have filled social media feeds across California. But for Justice Kavanaugh, “If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go.”
Kavanaugh’s wishful thinking or privileged ignorance would have you believe the encounters are mere inconveniences. On the contrary, they have been quite catastrophic.

Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a 38-year-old father of two, represents the latest casualty. Earlier this month in Chicago, an ICE agent shot and killed Villegas-Gonzalez during a traffic stop. In Ventura County in July, Jaime Alanís died from injuries he sustained in an attempt to flee agents raiding a legal pot farm.
What Ramirez experienced as a child — and countless others in southern San Diego County — is certainly not unique. The difference now is that it’s occurring far from the border.
Together with the American Friends Service Committee and Union del Barrio, I helped document roving patrols in San Diego for nearly a decade in the 2000s. Border Patrol agents surveilled buses and the San Diego trolley, harassing thousands of people based on appearance or if they spoke Spanish, and targeted working-class neighborhoods during busy commute times. We discovered that anyone could be a target, even if they’re seeking shelter during a natural disaster or taking transit to get to school.
In 2003, Border Patrol Sector Chief William Veal issued a memo ending roving patrols but was quickly overruled by Robert Bonner, then the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, who called it “overly broad and restrictive.”
When President Obama refreshed the federal policy restricting federal agencies from using racial profiling in 2014, his administration excluded CBP agents who could “consider race and ethnicity when stopping people at airports, border crossings and immigration checkpoints.”
At the height of California’s anti-immigrant movement in 1994, Border Patrol agents on bikes stopped me in Downtown San Diego and questioned me about my status. They insisted in broken Spanish that I had to show them my “papers.”
About 20 years ago, a plainclothes immigration agent detained my father outside a grocery store a block from his home in South San Diego. The agent similarly asked him if he had papers. 
My father always carried an old government ID issued to U.S. citizens to facilitate border crossings. The immigration agent didn’t know what to make of the antiquated document.
Racial profiling and its impact on my family goes back to the 1930s, when immigration agents violently rounded up and forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of people in violation of the U.S. Constitution, including U.S. citizens. Immigration agents sent my paternal grandparents to Mexico, even though they were born in Los Angeles.
Donald Trump’s radical vision for mass deportations has glamorized the cruelty of this historic period. He wants to surpass those numbers.

Norma Chavez-Peterson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of San Diego and Imperial Counties, was a co-counsel on a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security after the L.A. raids unfolded in June. In an email, she told me the Supreme Court’s decision “emboldens the Trump administration and enables their broader power grab to weaken the constitutional protections of all people. 
“Right now, the decision directly impacts immigrants and people of color in Los Angeles and surrounding regions — and it won’t stop there,” she continued. “When one person’s rights are stripped away, the thread that binds all our freedoms begins to fray.”
With the Supreme Court sanctioning racial profiling in how immigration agents can indiscriminately question people, the newly supercharged Homeland Security budget could lead to thousands more agents being unleashed on American streets, and disastrous for our understanding of how constitutional protections should apply.
In San Diego, elected officials held a press conference announcing a county-wide initiative to promote due process and public safety across San Diego County. 
“The Due Process and Dignity Ordinance,” said San Diego City Councilmember Sean Elo-Rivera, “responds by drawing clear, lawful boundaries around what can and cannot happen on city-controlled and funded property. It demands that everyone in San Diego — including those who were made less safe by the SCOTUS decision — is afforded due process and, in doing so, also provides all people the firmest ground possible to assert their constitutional rights.”
Ramirez, the SEIU official, believes “it’s going to take creating a movement beyond the halls of justice and legislative bodies to overturn racism codified by the Supreme Court.”  
He reminded me of a slogan borrowed from Puerto Rican students resisting U.S. troops in Vieques. It’s now used by community members in San Diego to demonstrate power: “La migra no se fue, el pueblo la sacó, and it will take all of us.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091725_Christian-Ramirez_AH_CM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

A new state law gives businesses a break by delaying a tax increase.,"In summary
California’s legal weed industry is still overshadowed by the larger black market. A new state law gives businesses a break by delaying a tax increase.



Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday signed a bill to roll back taxes on recreational weed in an effort to give some relief to an industry that has struggled to supersede its illicit counterpart since voters legalized marijuana almost 10 years ago.
The law will temporarily revert the cannabis excise tax to 15% until 2028, suspending an increase to 19% levied earlier this year. The law is meant to help dispensaries that proponents say are operating under slim margins due to being bogged down by years of overregulation.
“We’re rolling back this cannabis tax hike so the legal market can continue to grow, consumers can access safe products, and our local communities see the benefits,” Newsom said in a statement, and that reducing the tax will allow legal businesses to remain competitive and boost their long-term growth.
An excise tax is a levy imposed by the state before sales taxes are applied. It’s applied to the cannabis industry under a 2022 agreement between the state and marijuana companies. It replaced a different kind of fee that was supposed to raise revenue for social programs, such as child care assistance, in accordance with the 2016 ballot measure that legalized cannabis.
For years, the cannabis industry has lobbied against the tax, arguing that it hurts an industry overshadowed by a thriving illicit drug market.
“By stopping this misguided tax hike, the governor and Legislature chose smart policy that grows revenue by keeping the legal market viable instead of driving consumers back to dangerous, untested illicit products,” Amy O’Gorman, executive director of the California Cannabis Operators Association, said in a statement.
Since its legalization, the recreational weed industry has struggled to outpace the illegal market as farmers flooded the industry and prices began to drop. Taxable cannabis sales have slowly declined since their peak in the second quarter of 2021 of more than $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion four years later, according to data from the state Department of Tax and Fee Administration. Legal sales make up about 40% of all weed consumption, according to the state Department of Cannabis Control.
Several nonprofits that receive grants through the tax opposed the bill, arguing that it will threaten services for low-income children, substance abuse programs and environmental protections.
In the Emerald Triangle, where the heartland of the industry lies nestled in the northern corner of the state, conservation organizations said they were disappointed in the governor and that it was a step backwards for addressing environmental degradation caused by illegal growers in years past. 
“All this bill does is reduce the resources we have to remedy the harms of the illegal market,” said Alicia Hamann, executive director of Friends of the Eel River in Humboldt County.
Many nonprofits supported spiking other fees in agreement with lawmakers and industry groups that the excise tax would be increased three years later, Hamann said.
“It feels a little bit like a stab in the back,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/050820-Cannabis-Marijuana-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

Rooney and Brooke Thomson",,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/trump-administration-assault-on-offshore-wind-is-bad-for-business-and-our-economy/,"Offshore wind can deliver critical energy needs while supporting the region’s economic growth and job creation. These moves by the administration send a troubling signal to employers: after years of planning, layers of government oversight, and finalized permits that survived court scrutiny – suddenly, there is a government reversal.","WE WORK WITH the region’s companies, institutions, and small businesses every day, and we consistently hear about the frustrations and concerns of leading a business in New England as energy costs continue to rise. Our New England employers pay some of the highest costs in the nation to heat and run their facilities, and residents struggle with rising costs throughout the year.  
Despite these challenging energy circumstances, employers remain committed to creating meaningful jobs, spurring economic growth for the region and economic mobility in the workforce.  
For example, the business community stepped forward to champion two new sources of electricity in New England from offshore wind when the region needs it most. However, many of these projects have been put in serious jeopardy, including Revolution Wind off the Rhode Island coast, due to federal stop work orders that place innovation, competition, and job creation at a standstill. While we are pleased that Revolution Wind can resume construction, putting thousands back to work, after a US District Court judge in Washington on Monday granted a request for temporary injunction against the Trump administration move, we remain concerned about the onslaught of work stop orders.  
With these stop work orders, the success of our workers, families, businesses, and economy is at risk. The Department of the Interior should reconsider the stop work orders for these offshore energy facilities. There is a detrimental ripple effect that stops the billions of dollars in private investment, opportunities for thousands of workers across a multi-state supply chain, and valuable infrastructure improvements on our working waterfronts.  
Offshore wind can deliver critical energy needs while supporting the region’s economic growth and job creation. The fixed-price predictability of wind energy from Vineyard Wind, for example, is expected to save electric consumers $1.4 billion over the first 20 years of operation. The electric grid operator for New England, ISO-NE, responded to the Revolution Wind stop work order by warning about risks to grid reliability. “Beyond near-term impacts to reliability in the summer and winter peak periods, delays in the availability of new resources will adversely affect New England’s economy and industrial growth, including potential future data centers,” ISO-NE said.  
These moves by the administration send a troubling signal to employers: after years of planning, layers of government oversight, and finalized permits that survived court scrutiny – suddenly, there is a government reversal.  
Businesses want and need to trust federal policymakers and government leaders, and employers depend on that trust and certainty to make strategic investments and hiring decisions. A stop work order can paralyze a company that would otherwise be contributing significantly to the region’s economy. How can companies successfully grow our economy, hire thousands of people, and compete if they are abruptly stopped by the federal government?  
This is not only about the future electricity demand of our region, but also about the future of energy in our country. Our nation’s energy strategy should encourage innovation, investments, and a diverse mix of resources that will power New England’s growth and the country’s competitive edge.  
While offshore wind is just one part of our energy portfolio, the use of natural gas, new nuclear power, and other renewable technologies will promote long-term economic growth and provide opportunities for all residents and businesses. Attacking a new source of energy that is only months away from or already supplying power to the region will only increase electricity prices further, further dampening the state’s economy. Let’s not place additional obstacles on technologies we need to grow the economy now and in the future.

U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco on Monday gave both parties in a State Senate redistricting case two options to give voters a remedial map. (Eric Schultz for Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — A federal judge Monday laid out a contingent plan to implement a previous ruling that the Alabama State Senate map violated the Voting Rights Act.
The steps came after attorneys for Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, the defendant in the lawsuit, told U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco Monday that no decision had been made about calling a special session of the Legislature to redraw two Montgomery state senate districts Manasco ruled were in violation of the Voting Rights Act. 
“It’s our understanding, they continue to talk about this. They continue to be looking at the issues, trying to make a decision. They have not done so,” Assistant Attorney General Jim Davis told Manasco.

Manasco, appointed by President Donald Trump, said Monday that if the Legislature does not adopt a remedial map in a special session, she will appoint the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts in 2023: Richard Allen as the special master, David Ely as his cartographer, and Michael Scodro and his law firm, Mayer Brown LLP, as the special master’s legal counsel. 
Neither Allen nor the plaintiffs objected to the appointment. 
Davis said Monday that Oct. 1 would be the latest Ivey could call a special session to have a map adopted by Oct. 10. Manasco said she wants to put the special master to work on a contingent basis between Oct. 1 and 10 in order for a map to be fully implemented by Nov. 17. The roughly five weeks between would allow the plaintiffs and Allen to argue over the remedial map, Manasco said.
“I’m not inclined to say anything more at this time about what the Legislature would need to do to pass a remedial map, because I think the court’s previous order speaks for itself,” Manasco said. 
If the special master draws the map and the Legislature does not meet, the cost of the special master would fall to the plaintiffs, Manasco said. The court could not pay the fee, and Davis said the state could not pay the fee if the map was not drawn for the use of the Legislature in a special session. 
Davin Rosborough, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing the plaintiffs, said he expects the plaintiffs to be open to paying the fee. The special master billed the state $515,000 for the map he drew for the state’s congressional districts in 2023. 
“My inclination is to recommend that we proceed in that way, so long as there’s sufficient clarity in what the circumstances would be in which the plaintiffs would be responsible for the costs,” Rosborough said. 
Davis said he would research the legality of the state sharing the cost before Oct. 1. 
Manasco ruled in August that the Montgomery area needed a second majority-minority district, or something close to it, to give Black voters an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choosing. 
Should the ruling be upheld, it would be the second time in four years a federal court found Alabama’s 2021 congressional and legislative maps to be racially discriminatory. A three-judge panel that included Manasco ruled in 2022 that the state’s congressional map did not give Black voters a proper opportunity to choose their preferred leaders, eventually resulting in a new congressional map with a majority Black district in west Alabama and a near-majority Black district in the southern Black Belt.   
Allen has appealed the ruling citing that a similar case in Louisiana, Callais v. Louisiana, may not require such districts. 
“I have no idea what we are going to know, whether it’s more than we know today or the same things we know today, about what’s going to happen in Callais by that day,” Manasco said. “Many of these factors are beyond the control of not only this court, but everybody in the room.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AR-Election-Day-Huntsville-110524-13-1024x585.jpg,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A precipitous decline in new home sales in Southern Nevada is contributing, experts say, to a loss of construction jobs, which fell statewide by 4,400 in August, according to the Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation. Construction jobs are off 6.9% statewide for the year, according to David Schmidt, chief economist for DETR. 
The top three occupations filing unemployment claims in August, “without a doubt, were construction laborers, carpenters and electricians – the sorts of jobs that we see with home construction,” said Schmidt in an interview Monday. “As we’ve seen this slowdown in the housing market, I do think that is being reflected in both our unemployment claims data and the slides we’ve seen in construction employment so far this year.”
Nevada construction “contributed $20 billion (7.8%) of the state’s GDP of $260 billion” in 2024, reports the Associated General Contractors of America. That’s the second-highest rate in the nation behind Utah (8.5%), according to QI Research. 
The U.S. lost 7,000 construction jobs in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, meaning Nevada accounts for almost two-thirds. 
Driven by falling construction employment, Nevada lost 3,800 jobs in August

But Schmidt warns against placing value on initial reports, given that federal “monthly numbers get revised several times, because there’s a lot of uncertainty in the data.” The government’s margin of error, or “confidence interval,” projects the actual national number could go up or down by about 25,000 jobs.  
“It’s horrible,” Patricia Farley, owner of Southwest Specialties, a high-end contractor that installs pavers and other hardscapes, says of the lull in home construction. In busier times, Farley says her company worked on 35 to 45 homes per week. That dropped to 22 to 30 a week in the two years following COVID. In August, jobs plunged to 10 to 15 a week. 
“Homebuilders and subs are laying off,” she says, adding homeowners are not remodeling and commercial properties are not making tenant improvements. 
In January, homebuilders in Southern Nevada sold 974 homes. That’s steadily declined to 653 homes sold in August, according to data from Home Builders’ Research. 
Standing inventory of finished homes stood at 688 for the first week in September. 
“If a builder has $300,000 sunk in a home and they have 100 homes sitting in standing inventory, they have $30 million just sitting,” Farley said. “They pay interest on those homes every month, as well.” 
Farley contends new and existing homes are overpriced – a factor she says overshadows high interest rates. “If a $250,000 house is selling for $450,000, it doesn’t matter what the interest rates are.” 
New homes, she says, are shrinking in size while doubling in price. 
Lennar Homes, the second largest builder in the U.S., saw net earnings for June, July, and August fall from just under $1.2 billion last year to $591 million this year, an almost 50% drop. The builder is slashing prices by 22%, resulting in a spike in new orders.  
“New home builders want nothing more than to sell, build and deliver as many homes as they can for Nevadans,” says Tina Frias, CEO of the Southern Nevada Home Builders Association. 
Builders, she says, “continue to be creative in developing product across a range of price points, but their ability to reduce costs is difficult when considering the price of land, labor and materials.” 
Frias says there’s “no question that broader economic conditions, consumer confidence and the interest rate environment are contributing to the performance within the housing market. Sales volumes have slowed from post-pandemic highs when mortgage interest rates were low, but pricing has remained relatively stable – both in the new home and resale segments of the market.”
Las Vegas real estate agent Diane Varney agrees that prices of existing homes have fallen and remained stable for much of the last year. But seller expectations remain high, resulting in overpriced properties, at least on paper, where seller concessions for repairs, interest buydowns and more are not apparent.  
A glut of existing homes for sales in Southern Nevada has “flattened out a little bit,” says Varney 
“We had 5,500 homes for sale on the Multiple Listing Service in January. Now we’re close to 8,000, but it flattened out a little bit in August to mid-September. We didn’t see the inventory climbing by 100 homes a week like we were.” 
The median price of an existing home has held steady around $480,000 for much of the past year. 
Nationally, 25% of home sales are falling out of escrow, according to Varney, who says in Southern Nevada, the number is between 15% and 18%. Homes that are on the market for 50 to 60 days, she says, have a 30% chance of selling, according to tracking data. Buyers, exposed to a plethora of homes for sale, “don’t want a project. They want a turnkey home.” 
As for what to expect from the economy, Schmidt of DETR says he “doesn’t see a pullback,” adding wages and hours remain strong, which he says indicates an interest among employers to hire, despite uncertainty.  
“We’re just kind of flat,” he observes. “We’re kind of waiting to see where things will be going over the next six months.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2229115499-1024x749.jpg,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

Gavin Newsom signed a series of bills aimed at protecting California’s undocumented immigrants from aggressive raids by President Donald Trump’s immigration agents.
Senate Bill 627, which would prohibit federal officers from wearing masks during their operations, drew the heaviest media coverage and a dismissive response from administration officials.
“What are you afraid of?” Newsom asked of federal agents during the signing event in Los Angeles. “You’re going to go out and you’re going to do enforcement — provide an ID. Tell us which agency you represent. Provide us basic information that all local law enforcement is required to provide.”
“We don’t need to abide by this garbage,” Tricia McLaughlin, deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, posted on X.
The political saber rattling is merely theatrical symbolism. Newsom got another fix of national media attention to bolster his image as resistor-in-chief to the commander-in-chief, in apparent preparation for a 2028 presidential campaign.
By denouncing Newsom and the legislation, Trump administration officials reassured his political base he’s serious about cracking down on those who entered the country illegally.
Newsom and any other critics of ICE tactics are delusional if they believe federal officers will be arrested and prosecuted for wearing masks after SB 627 takes effect. State and local authorities have no power to arrest federal officers for official actions, no matter how questionable they may be, which was made clear by a U.S. Supreme Court decision involving a U.S. marshal fatally shooting a former California Supreme Court justice in 1889 and a 1972 shooting death of a suspected drug dealer in Humboldt County.
In 1859, former California Supreme Court Justice David Terry got into an argument with U.S. Sen. David Broderick over slavery and the two erstwhile friends settled it with a duel in San Francisco that left Broderick dead. Historians considered it the nation’s last noteworthy duel before the practice was outlawed.
Thirty years later, Terry was involved in another feud, this time with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Field and he made several threats on Field’s life. U.S. Marshal David Neagle was Field’s bodyguard as he toured the state, holding court in various communities. Terry confronted Field in a train station in Lathrop, near Stockton, and struck Field several times before Neagle fatally shot Terry.
The San Joaquin County sheriff arrested Neagle for homicide, but federal judges ordered his release. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declared that a federal officer cannot be prosecuted by state or local authorities while acting in the course of official duties.
That principle was tested again in California after Dirk Dickenson, a suspected drug dealer, was shot in the back by federal drug agent Lloyd Clifton during a raid on Dickenson’s rural Humboldt County home in 1972.
I played a minor role in the ensuing legal case because I was editor of the Humboldt Times-Standard at the time. One of my reporters accompanied officers on the raid and was an eyewitness to the shooting.
Some historians consider Dickenson to be the first casualty of the federal war on drugs. In an affidavit Clifton said, “At the time I thought it was necessary to prevent Dickenson from escaping.”
Local outrage at Dickenson’s death resulted in a grand jury murder indictment of Clifton, but before he could be tried, a federal judge blocked the proceedings based on the 19th century Supreme Court decision involving Marshal Neagle. A federal appellate court later agreed.
That’s why, no matter how much Californians might resent the ICE raids, state and local officials cannot tell federal agents not to wear masks.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060625_ICE-Raid-DTLA_JWBH_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

Kay Ivey and House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter added a new plaintiff last week to a lawsuit against the Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSAA) over transfer student-athlete eligibility.
The officials sued the AHSAA earlier this month, alleging that the AHSAA’s policy of requiring CHOOSE Act recipients to forgo a year of athletic eligibility violated the law. 
The plaintiff, Jaclyn Hall, filed on behalf of herself and her son, known as Z.H.2 in the complaint. The complaint alleges that the child cannot participate in his school’s football program due to receiving CHOOSE Act funds.

“[Z.H.2] trained with the team over the summer before being informed that the AHSAA deemed him ineligible to play this school year due to his participation in the CHOOSE Act,” the complaint said.
The CHOOSE Act allows qualifying families to claim up to $7,000 a year in tax credits for “noneducation expenses,” including private school tuition. AHSAA considered it a form of financial aid, and said the regulation was required to ensure fairness. 
A message seeking comment was left with the AHSAA Monday. 
In addition to the complaint, Ivey and Ledbetter also filed a motion for preliminary injunction to replace the temporary restraining order they were granted on Sept. 5.
“Plaintiffs recently have become aware of two AHSAA rules that severely undermine the court’s September 5, 2025 order,” the motion said. “These rules, called the ‘school restitution rule’ and the ‘student restitution rule,” penalize schools and students if a student whom the AHSAA deems ineligible participates in an AHSAA-sanctioned athletic event even if the student was participating at that time pursuant to a valid court order.” 
The school and student restitution rules are listed in AHSAA’s handbook and penalize any student who participates in athletics for an amount of time equal to the amount of time they played while ineligible. Schools that allow ineligible students to participate could be fined if a court order that allows the students to compete is lifted for any reason.
The motion for injunction also alleges that last December AHSAA threatened a student at Marbury High School with suspension for the first three games of the 2025 football season for playing while ineligible.
“According to this court, the AHSAA made that threat even though the student had played pursuant to the court’s order directing the AHSAA to ‘immediately grant [him] eligibility in all varsity sports,’” the motion said.
Ivey said in a press release Friday that AHSAA’s decision to penalize CHOOSE Act students and schools is disheartening.
“I remain steadfast in support of the CHOOSE Act and its promise of true school choice, even when it comes to participation in athletics,” the statement said. “I look forward to the court righting this wrong as soon as possible.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kay-Ivey-Feb-12-2025-02-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

(Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)After weeks of hype, it turns out the Oklahoma Department of Education’s new test that promises to weed out “woke” teachers doesn’t do any such thing.
In fact, it’s impossible to fail Superintendent Ryan Walters’ so-called “America First” test that he promises is “woke-proofing the classroom” and that he wants to require blue-state educators to take before they can teach here.
It turns out you can get every answer wrong and still receive a “Certificate of Completion” certifying that you have “successfully completed the Teacher Qualification Test.” I know because I purposely set out to get every question wrong by picking the stupidest answers in the 34-question multiple choice exam developed in conjunction with PragerU, a self-described conservative nonprofit, that includes a mix of random history, culture and gender-related biology questions.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The test, which is available to anyone to take, requires you to keep guessing until you pick the correct answer. As a result, there’s no true measure of if someone is too “woke” to teach in our schools or even if they actually understand our nation’s history.
I had been looking forward to pitting myself against the test to get a better grasp about how Walters and PragerU actually define “woke.” Walters, after all, is encouraging schools to use PragerU’s videos as instructional materials in our schools.
So I was disappointed, though perhaps not entirely surprised, to discover after weeks of promises, this test amounts to the latest harebrained antic dreamed up by a headline-thirsty public official.
The effort does little more than fearmonger against imaginary boogeyteachers who Walters seems to think want to consume Oklahoma children’s little souls with “liberal” lessons.
But this stunt is the biggest embarrassment yet for our Republican state superintendent, and that’s saying a lot given that he has proven time and again to be all show and little substance. He’s already created the do-nothing Office of Religious Liberty and Patriotism and once tried to require a video of himself attacking the “radical left” be shown to children.
I fear this latest effort will do little to help our state attract the quality teachers we desperately need and to bolster faith in the lessons being taught in our classrooms. We’re in the throes of a massive teacher shortage and have seen record numbers of emergency certified educators entering our classrooms. We’re behind the regional average in educator pay, and though Walters has implemented successful signing bonus programs aimed at helping recruit talented teachers, it hasn’t been enough to turn the tide.
Because it wasn’t the actual test questions themselves that were so insulting, though it is pretty bold to require an assessment that doesn’t actually do any assessing and to pass it off as a barometer to prove “your commitment to truth and integrity.”
What I found alarming was Walters’ seeming reckless disregard for protecting personal information. In order to take this dubious “assessment,” people are required to visit PragerU’s site and provide the California-based nonprofit with all sorts of personal information.
Why does PragerU need to know my mailing address, my phone number, my name, my email address and if I’m a parent or teacher in order to access this.
What’s next, a DNA sample?
And I also had to agree to give PragerU carte blanc permission to send me emails and “view, monitor and record” my activity on their site. And they have wasted no time in spamming me with unwanted emails like a sandwich shop rewards program.
We’re supposed to be able to trust Walters to act in the best interest of our children, and I fail to see how shilling for PragerU does that.
What I also found outrageous was the bizarre, 16-minute video conversation that Walters recorded with PragerU’s CEO Marissa Streit that introduces the test. The CEO lets loose and says the people who are critical of her group “are the same people who don’t care about children,” and “people who have been able to hold schools and our children hostage to their political agenda.”
She also said their group and Walters have the “same enemies.”
Rather than pushing back on that “woke” indoctrination and insulting inflammatory rhetoric, Walters responds: “That’s exactly right.”
“We’re not going to continue to sit back and watch the teacher’s unions use schools to force a left-wing ideology on kids,” Walters also says in the video.
Talk about a political agenda.
Anyone who registers to complete the test receives a welcome email from PragerU containing this gem: “Alarmingly, many young Americans haven’t been exposed to clear, conservative perspectives. PragerU fills that void by offering fact-based content that simplifies complex issues and champions foundational values like freedom and personal responsibility.”
Not surprisingly “conservative” indoctrination is OK in Walters’ eyes.
As a parent, I don’t want any sort of indoctrination going on in my schools.
And, to borrow one of Republicans’ favorite phrases, shouldn’t I have parental choice in terms of what my children are learning? Why would I want some random California nonprofit determining what’s right for my children or spouting hate about me – their mother – being an “enemy” simply because I’m a critic of PragerU’s efforts to oversimply our history and make fun of historically marginalized people?
As a particularly revolting example, PragerU has a cartoon on their site that features two time traveling children who go back to 1493 to speak with Christopher Columbus. They’re on a mission to determine whether the U.S. should honor him with a holiday or if that day should honor the Indigenous people of the Americas who lived here when he arrived. When asked about slavery, Columbus justifies it by saying it’s as old as time, and that “being taken as a slave is better than being killed.”
Wow.
Does saying slavery is wrong make someone “woke”? I’m not sure. But teaching children that it’s a better option than death is callous. And immoral.
Walters said he’s fine with allowing his children to learn from PragerU videos, and that’s a choice he gets to make. He’s in a position of power, even if he’s using it irresponsibly.
But if Walters truly embodies parental empowerment like he claims, he should not be associating in an official capacity with a group that is trying to assert their political beliefs in our schools.
Walters should be pushing back against all out-of-state actors, even conservative ones, who are trying to impose their views on our children. And he shouldn’t be allowing random groups to create “tests.”
Let’s leave that to the education experts.

We’re not working for our philosophies. And we’re not working for our political parties.” Matt Vasilogambros/StatelineThis article was originally published by Votebeat, a nonprofit news organization covering local election administration and voting access.
How much a poll worker earns in Michigan depends less on what they do and more on where they do it.
Across the state, pay for election inspectors — the workers who check in voters and keep precincts running — can range from less than $175 a day to more than $300. That means two people doing the same job just a few miles apart might take home dramatically different paychecks.
State law only requires that election officials “receive reasonable compensation,” leaving the exact amount up to local officials. But for poll workers, where they choose to do the job is almost entirely up to them.
Votebeat surveyed more than 60 communities to see what clerks offer their poll workers. The results show wide gaps not only in pay but also in benefits, from free meals to same-day paychecks — and reveal how those differences shape the pool of workers each community can attract and keep.
Clerks told Votebeat that wide pay disparities make recruiting poll workers harder. They’re not only competing with hourly jobs that offer steady pay, but also with neighboring jurisdictions that can afford to pay more. For election officials, who have to find, train, and employ poll workers — typically referred to as “election inspectors” at the base level of training and work — the challenge repeats every season.
 The grass is greener in Detroit

The pay divide is particularly stark in Wayne County, where a 20-minute drive could net a poll worker an additional $100 or more. In Detroit, poll workers start at $300 a day, compared with only $225 in neighboring Dearborn. In Livonia, a little farther west, that drops to $170 (although Lori Miller, Livonia City Clerk, recognizes the discrepancy and is working on boosting that).
Communities in smaller counties benefit from the work itself being less demanding.
Mary Hopkins, city clerk of Grand Blanc in Genesee County, said she recalled a worker choosing to go south to Oakland County. “I will say, they might have made more money, but they probably really had to earn it,” Hopkins said, “because our elections are usually relatively small and peaceful, which isn’t always true in those bigger cities.”
In Grand Blanc, a Flint suburb of 8,000 people, Hopkins starts her poll workers at $200 a day. That covers just over 14 hours of work, she said, because elections are generally small-scale. She can manage most of the prep work for the city’s two precincts, meaning election inspectors are able to show up just before polls open to be sworn in and don’t usually have to stay too late after polls close.
That rate, which works out to more than $14 an hour, is well above Michigan’s $12.48 minimum wage and enough to keep the pool of poll workers Hopkins has — which is largely made up of retirees looking to serve their community — pretty happy.
 The benefits: pizza, potlucks and same-day paychecks

Often, officials told Votebeat, it’s a matter of relying on the people in your community. Poll workers are typically retirees who enjoy socializing and the pride of serving the public. In many places, the same group comes back each election cycle. Most people don’t shop around for a better pay rate, clerks said. Additional perks certainly don’t hurt, though.
The perks take different forms. In Lansing, for instance, Election Supervisor Robin Stites told Votebeat that allowing workers to serve in shifts, rather than all day, has been helpful for both recruitment and retention. Not everyone offers that option — splitting a shift means finding, training, and managing payroll for up to twice as many people — but it is working for Stites.
In Pittsfield Charter Township, near Ann Arbor, Deputy Clerk Jill Mitchell offers election inspectors boxed lunches and snacks such as granola bars or crackers.
In Burton, near Flint, election officials have ordered pizza (including veggie options for the vegetarians) and sandwiches from local restaurants, Joy Roe, deputy clerk, told Votebeat. Some precincts host their own potluck.
It works because precincts tend to be staffed by the same people each election. They know what others like — desserts, veggie trays, duck stew brought by a poll worker who is an avid hunter, Roe said — and are happy to work together to make the day more enjoyable.
“I miss it sometimes,” Roe said. “I was a poll worker for 16 years before this job, and sometimes I want to sneak out, because I know where the good food is.”
David Elwell, clerk of Blackman Charter Township in Jackson County, has won people over by ensuring that they receive their check for the work before they walk out the door. Many communities make poll workers wait several weeks for checks to be processed through the local government payroll.
“I know the workers appreciate that,” he said.
It also helps that in a number of places around the state, officials have reduced the number of precincts they run. State law has recently changed to allow jurisdictions to change the maximum size of precincts from about 3,000 people to about 5,000 people. So for the first time in years, some clerks said, they expect to have more eligible workers than they may need.
 The other benefit: a chance to serve

For poll workers themselves, the benefit typically comes from supporting their community. Anything else is a bonus.
Robert Johncox, a Southfield resident who has served as a poll worker in the city for almost every election since 2018, said he’s never seriously considered leaving his own community because Southfield has a hard enough time finding people already.
“I don’t want to abandon them,” he said with a laugh.
Detroit is just across Eight Mile Road — the city and county line — from Southfield. Johncox could get a significant pay bump if he made the 20-minute drive from his house. As a precinct chairperson, the title for more senior poll workers who work closely with city clerks, he makes $275 in Southfield, compared with $230 for entry-level poll workers. Detroit, meanwhile, pays its base-level poll workers $300. Precinct chairs start at $600.
Johncox doesn’t want to drive, though. And while he certainly wouldn’t say no to free lunches, it’s ultimately the pride of serving his community that keeps him working where he lives.
“I’m retired. I had a good career as an engineer, so I’m really not doing it for the money,” he said. “I’m more there for the helping.”

The Nevada State Public Charter School Authority, the largest authorizers of charter schools in the state and functionally the second largest school district in the state, last month approved two new charter schools for the 2026-27 academic years: Somerset Academy of Carson City and Northern Nevada Wildflower Montessori.
Meanwhile, the City of Henderson approved what is expected to be its first city-sponsored charter school: Kesher Academy, a Hebrew-language immersion school.
The three charter schools plan to enroll 316 students combined when they open next year and scale up to 976 students over six years.
Somerset Academy Inc. is part of the Florida-based Academica network which has more than two dozen schools in the state, primarily in the Las Vegas metro area. Somerset Academy of Carson City will mark the organization’s debut school in the state capital.
Somerset Carson plans to open with 152 students in grades kindergarten through second grade, then scale up to 430 students and grade seven over six years.
Carson City School District, in feedback to the SPCSA, criticized the charter school authorization process, specifically the criteria used within the Academic and Demographic Needs Assessment.
“Needs are already being addressed,” read the district’s feedback. “The number of students considered at-risk of dropping out of school by the state definition is falling. Graduation rates are increasing. Chronic Absenteeism rates are falling.”
Families from other school districts seek inter-district variances for special education students in order to get them into Carson City SD “because our program is so well regarded,” the district continued. “We have the most inclusive and largest GATE program in the state (as % of enrollment)…”
In response to an SCPSA question asking whether any existing schools provide a similar educational model to the proposed charter school, the school district did not mince words: “There is nothing special about the model being proposed.”
The district’s response continued, “Every elementary school we have has a similar mission, goal set and work being done. I would argue that most elementary schools in America do.”
While some students transfer to charter schools from private schools or after being home schooled, charter schools typically draw most of their enrollment from families who otherwise would have sent their children to the traditional public school district they are zoned for.
That means Somerset could bring trouble for Carson City SD, which noted for the SPCSA that it is already “a declining enrollment area due to escalating property values and smaller family sizes.”
The Nevada Appeal reported Carson City SD’s enrollment has dropped below 7,000 students this year.
Official enrollment counts for the current academic year have not yet been released by the Nevada Department of Education, but early tallies reported by Carson City SD to its school board this month found 130 fewer students enrolled than in the previous year.
Schools receive per-pupil dollars from the state, meaning lower enrollment can lead to staff cuts or reduced resources.
Somerset was one of two schools approved by the SPCSA Board to open next year. The second, Northern Nevada Wildflower Montessori, was approved to open in the Reno/Sparks area next year.
It plans to enroll 29 kids in grades kindergarten through third grade to start, then scale up to 171 and sixth grade over six years.
Washoe County School District, in its feedback to the SPCSA, noted it is already “anticipating significant losses to student enrollments” because of Academica’s Mater Academy of Northern Nevada Golden Valley. When that school was approved in late 2024, the district warned it may result in the closure of existing schools in the area.
Earlier this year, the SPCSA overtook Washoe County SD as the second largest local education agency in the state. Enrollment growth within SPCSA has outpaced the district since at least 2016.
When responding to the question about whether the proposed charter school would meet the academic and demographic needs, Washoe County SD noted Wildflower listed an approximately 193-square-mile area that it hopes to serve.
“Because of the large range of academic needs in the identified area, it is unclear if Wildflower would meet the needs of the community,” their response read.
The district also questioned whether the Wildflower is bringing a new educational model to the area, citing the existence of Sierra Nevada Academy Charter School, a charter school sponsored by the district, and High Desert Montessori School, a state-sponsored charter school
Public feedback for Wildflower was largely in support, but at least one person expressed concern that the proposed school would hurt High Desert.
Washoe County SD also noted that the district offers open enrollment, so families have flexibility within the district.
The third new charter school recently approved to open next year will be overseen not by the SPCSA but by the City of Henderson, which opted to take advantage of legislation passed in 2023 that allows them to sponsor their own charter schools.
Kesher Academy, a Hebrew-language immersion school, plans to open with 125 students in grades kindergarten through second. By year six, it plans to enroll 375 students from kindergarten through seventh grade.
No feedback from Clark County School District was included as a part of Kesher’s application materials.
A look ahead to 2027
The SPCSA Board also approved Citizens of the World to open in the 2027-28 academic year. 
Citizens plans to open in east Las Vegas with 150 students in grades kindergarten through second, then scale up to seventh grade and 510 students over six years.
Clark County SD noted in its feedback form that, while the 12 middle and elementary schools in the proposed area are rated 1- or 2-star, only one is over its enrollment capacity.
Charter schools denied
Numerous charter school proposals did not survive this year’s application cycle.
The SPCSA Board denied Pahrump Valley Academy, which was hoping to become the first charter school in Nye County. The board also denied the application last year.
Pathways in Education, a proposed charter school in North Las Vegas, and Purpose Leadership Academy, a proposed charter that wants to focus on Black and Hispanic males, were also denied by the SPCSA Board.
Purpose Leadership Academy has been denied by the SPCSA Board in previous cycles, as well as by the City of Henderson this year.
Meanwhile, the City of North Las Vegas will not become an authorizer of charter schools next year, despite its council expressing clear support for doing so.
Two schools, Nevada Early College and Career Academy and Purpose Leadership Academy, applied with the city in June but were denied after staff determined their applications failed to meet standards set by the city.
Both schools at the time indicated they would resubmit their applications for reconsiderations. Those reconsideration votes came up at North Las Vegas City Council’s Aug. 20 meeting, but the staff recommendation remained to deny.
Councilmembers did not discuss the votes, which were included as part of the consent agenda.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bookclassroom-1024x702.jpg,,,2025-09-23 08:57:26.690325

Deb Krishnadasan, left, is running to keep a seat she was appointed to in the 26th Legislative District. Challenging her is Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier, right. (Photos courtesy of campaigns)Washington’s most competitive legislative contest this fall is shaping up as a referendum on how to change the direction that majority Democrats in the Legislature are steering the state.
And one of the two candidates calling for that change is a Democrat herself. 
Deb Krishnadasan, the state senator campaigning to retain her seat in November, says she is best positioned to influence her caucus colleagues who are passing fiscal policies that are hurting residents.
“I bring a balanced voice to the majority party. That is what we need right now,” she said at a forum this month in the Pierce County hamlet of Vaughn. “We need to bring a voice that will get the majority party to work for our people, to take the word ‘taxes’ off our most vulnerable. We need to change direction.”
Michelle Caldier, the six-term Republican state representative seeking to unseat Krishnadasan, argues the most effective means of redirecting Senate Democrats is by reducing their numbers. Today, Democrats hold a 30-19 advantage, allowing them to push through policies over all GOP objectors.
“Olympia is a mess. The makeup of the Legislature is so bad. The direction that we are going is absolutely ridiculous,” she said at the forum. “We need to change the balance of the Legislature … and turn around the direction of our state.”
This contest, to be decided in the Nov. 4 election, is playing out in the 26th Legislative District that encompasses parts of Pierce and Kitsap counties and includes Bremerton, Port Orchard, Purdy and Gig Harbor. It is one of the few swing districts where residents are represented by lawmakers from both parties.
Krishnadasan is facing voters for the first time as a lawmaker.  A former school board member, she was appointed to her seat after former state senator Emily Randall, a Democrat, was elected to Congress last year. 
Caldier won a seat in the House in 2014 and has been reelected five times, typically garnering votes from Democrats and independents who view her as one of her party’s more moderate voices.
Krishnadasan won the August primary by 1,158 votes. Most of the margin came in Kitsap County, as only 17 votes separated the two in the Pierce County portion.
The result surprised Caldier. She attributed it partly to Republicans not voting when they saw only two candidates on the ballot. She also said President Donald Trump has “ticked off” a lot of Democrats who may not know the senator but backed her because of her party.
The forum at the Key Peninsula Center in Vaughn marked the first time the two candidates appeared together in this election. They answered questions on rural development, the state gas tax, public safety and spending.

Both candidates sought to stress their public service credentials and desire to put the state on a different path.
Caldier opened by touting her 11 years representing the district, rattling off a few community projects for which she helped secure state funds.
Then she charged ahead, bringing up the oversized elephant in this race, Trump.
“I understand that many people in the room are unhappy with the president … and things going on at the federal level,” she said. “This Senate election has absolutely nothing to do with that.”
It is about whether voters want to end the Democrats’ supermajority and restore “balance back to our state,” she said.
Caldier said Democrats used their lopsided advantage in the House and Senate to pass “the largest tax hike in state history.” She was referring to the $9.4 billion package used to balance the budget earlier this year, plus the $3.2 billion transportation revenue measure anchored by the 6-cent increase in the state’s gas tax on July 1.
“I have consistently voted against the gas tax,” Caldier said. “It is one of the most regressive forms of tax in our state. You have to understand, a lot of the moderate Democrats are gone. The far-left Democrats have pushed them all out. As a result, you have a very polarized Olympia and they believe that gas and your usage of gas is a sin, and they believe in taxing it to the level of sin taxes.”
Krishnadasan didn’t play the Trump card that night. Nor did she plug major policy changes she helped her party pass, including a cap on rent increases, unemployment benefits for striking workers and requiring a state-issued permit to buy a gun. Caldier opposed those new laws.
Rather, Krishnadasan promoted her legislation to cut the state’s sales tax, which did not get a vote, and her ability to get Republican co-sponsors on some of her bills. She stressed a commitment to fiscal conservatism.
“As politics grow more and more polarized, we’re losing sight of the fact that our neighbors can’t afford life anymore. Groceries. Child care. This is what I want to focus on,” she said.
Krishnadasan did vote against her party’s major tax bills, the transportation revenue package that included the gas tax hike, and the two-year state budget.
“We are in an affordability crisis right now,” she said. “We need to continue to look at how we take taxes away from our working families and our seniors versus just, ‘where’s our revenue’.”
In the primary, business- and Republican-backed political committees poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into mailers, streaming ads and texts aimed at tying her to the tax and spending decisions of her caucus.
“You’re going to get more information over the coming weeks,” she cautioned audience members in Vaughn. “I want you, please, to remember that when there were tax increases on the table, I voted no. When there were DOGE-style cuts that were proposed, I voted no.”
The two candidates are scheduled to participate in additional forums before ballots for the Nov. 4 election are mailed out.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/primary-2025-krishnadasan-caldier-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-23 07:57:12.917499

Photo by Getty Images.As Washington Republicans’ attacks on renewable energy and voracious data center electricity demand threaten to push electricity prices higher, utility commissions in five red states are fighting a widely-supported effort to keep power bills in check. 
They’ve filed a complaint asking federal energy regulators to halt development of a $22 billion slate of proposed high-voltage electric transmission lines that would expand an existing network stretching from Kentucky to Minnesota and the Dakotas. They argue the Upper Midwest’s main power grid operator dramatically overstated the lines’ financial and environmental merits while improperly allocating their construction costs to states that say they don’t need them. 
On the other side is a motley coalition of electric utilities, tech companies, agribusinesses, environmental groups, a Republican governor and a couple potential 2028 Democratic presidential contenders who support the investment.
The new lines are expected to be in service by 2034, strengthening links between the windy, sunny Plains states and population centers further south and east.
The fight over the transmission lines highlights a key flashpoint in the energy sphere, as cheaper renewable energy runs headlong into a lack of transmission capacity and political hostility from Republican states. 
“These improvements will save customers billions by avoiding costly inefficiencies and diversifying the market of generation resources across the region,” Gov. Tim Walz, who’s running for a third term, said in a Sept. 16 letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker made similar arguments in letters earlier this month. Like Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois have statutory mandates for 100% carbon-free electricity — Michigan by 2040 and Illinois by 2050. Both governors are potential 2028 presidential candidates. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds of wind-rich and mandate-free Iowa also pushed back on the five utility commissions’ complaint in a Sept. 5 letter hailing her state’s “all-of-the-above energy strategy” and name-checking President Trump.
The new infrastructure “will ensure continued reliability and resilience of the electric grid not only in Iowa but also across the region,” she wrote. Killing the new transmission investments, she added, could in turn stall seven nuclear reactors’ worth of new power plants in her state “by months to even years.”
The Indiana-based nonprofit that operates the electric grid in Minnesota and parts or all of 14 other states asserts the proposed lines — collectively known as LRTP Tranche 2.1 — could pay for themselves more than three times over. 
That’s more than enough to qualify them as “multi-value projects” whose costs can be spread broadly across the territory of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator — known as MISO —including among ratepayers in Republican-controlled states without ambitious decarbonization goals. Stakeholders across the region had ample opportunity to weigh in on the proposed lines, a MISO spokesperson told the Reformer.
Before finalizing the tranche last year, MISO led “a collaborative process that included substantial stakeholder engagement as well as more than 300 meetings and feedback on the solutions and benefits,” MISO spokesman Brandon Morris said in an email.
Representing the public utility commissions of Montana, North Dakota, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, the complainants argued that the cost allocation effectively subsidizes the development of wind and solar farms far from population centers — and, by extension, Midwestern blue states’ clean energy goals. Instead of asking Montana and North Dakota to share the burden, they said states like Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois should build more clean energy and transmission within their own borders.
North Dakota’s GOP congressional delegation said much the same in a Sept. 11 letter urging regulators to grant the complaint and undo the cost allocation framework. 
“The current approach to cost allocation is a subsidy scheme that alleviates certain states of the costs of their most aggressive energy policies…while out-of-state ratepayers bear the costs,” U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak and Sens. Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven wrote.
Belying the complaint, Minnesota is building plenty of clean energy on home soil. Renewables supplied 33% of the state’s electricity in 2024, according to Clean Energy Economy Minnesota, and a state law that accelerates permitting for wind, solar and other energy infrastructure took effect in July. Solar power projects approved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission since then will supply nearly a nuclear reactor’s worth of energy as they come online over the next few years. 
But regardless of how it’s produced, experts say high-voltage transmission is needed to move electricity across longer distances. 
“One of the key concepts of a renewables-based system is you want the grid to be bigger than the weather,” said Mike Schowalter of Fresh Energy, a St. Paul-based clean energy nonprofit. 
Transmission lines built to deliver coal-fired power from North Dakota to Minnesota now catch a fair amount of wind, which supplies more than one-third of North Dakota’s electricity. North Dakota officials said during MISO’s stakeholder engagement process — before the utility commissioners’ July complaint — that they’d like to see more of that, Schowalter said. 
East of the Rockies, power generally moves from west to east, but the prevailing flow often reverses during winter storms and other extreme weather events, Schowalter explained. To ensure everyone has enough power under the circumstances, utilities can either build lots of transmission and some power plants or lots of power plants and some transmission.
“The latter is far more expensive,” Schowalter said. 
Building lots of new gas-fired power plants — something that’s already likely to happen as more AI data centers come online — could push up natural gas prices, Schowalter said. Because gas plants often set the local price of electricity, and fuel represents a significant fraction of their operating expenses, that means costlier power.
“The world that the complainants envision is one of more expensive electricity, and our AI industry is going to be at risk,” he said. “We are shooting ourselves in the foot.”
MISO appears to agree.
“The complaint jeopardizes the ability of MISO and its state partners to support the anticipated growth in electricity demand and would increase costs to customers within the MISO region by replacing an efficient, regional solution with a piecemeal one,” the grid operator said in a Sept. 9 filing that called the utility commissioners’ proposal “haphazard and unrealistic.”
Schowalter said a setback for Tranche 2.1 would mess with the delicate grid planning process and delay the arrival of new power plants that MISO, utilities and big customers were counting on. 
Ironically, those delays could slow deployment of the the very gas plants meant to stabilize the grid as AI data centers multiply. 
The Data Center Coalition, a tech industry trade group, made this point in a Sept. 9 filing. 
Though Schowalter said MISO allocated less than 2% of total Tranche 2.1 costs to North Dakota and Montana, their utility commissions’ complaints make sense: They don’t want to pay at all for investments they believe benefit others.
The other three commissions’ motivations are less obvious because federal energy regulators have prevented MISO from allocating Tranche 2.1 costs across its southern region.
Colby Cook of the Louisiana Public Service Commission told the Reformer that LPSC “has always supported the MISO regional transmission planning processes” but joined the complaint for two main reasons. 
The first was “the unreasonable underlying assumptions relied upon to justify these projects as (multi-value projects),” Cook said in an email. Beyond decarbonization benefits, the complaint objected to MISO’s estimates of how cost-effectively the new high-voltage lines could be built and the extent to which they would improve grid reliability and reduce the need for new power plants.
Second was the concern that Louisiana — though not currently required to pay the proposed new costs — could be on the hook later.
Legal representatives for the other four commissions did not respond to a Reformer request for comment.
Perhaps recognizing the need for a speedy resolution, the complainants themselves have asked federal regulators to expedite the complaint. It’s unclear whether the feds will agree. 
In the meantime, a key piece of the Midwest’s future power grid is in limbo. 
“If the complainants are successful, MISO would have to redo at least a year’s worth of work,” Schowalter said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tariffphoto2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 07:57:12.917499

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Just weeks before Roy Lee Ward’s scheduled execution, the Indiana Parole Board heard conflicting portrayals Monday of the man condemned for the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne.
The five-member panel will make a recommendation to Gov. Mike Braun, who has the sole authority to decide whether to grant clemency and commute Ward’s death sentence to life in prison. His execution is currently set to take place before sunrise Oct. 10 at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.

Ward declined to appear before the board or submit to a prison interview, however. 
In a sworn affidavit last week, Ward told the parole board that he preferred for his attorneys to be his “voice” during the clemency process.
“My decision rests in part on my desire that the victim’s family not be put in a position where they feel compelled to travel to Michigan City,” Ward wrote in the Sept. 17 affidavit obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
Defense attorneys Michelle Law and Larry Komp instead spent about 80 minutes before the parole board during Monday’s hearing in Indianapolis.
“Roy is not a psychopath,” Law said. “His own attorneys labeled him as such before … but Roy has feelings, and he himself has recognized that he has disabilities and issues that he wanted help for.”
But for Payne’s family, decades of anguish remain. 
“We will never hear her voice, never have the joy of watching her grow into the incredible woman she was meant to be. Grief doesn’t just break our hearts, it reshapes who we are, and we don’t get to go back,” Stacy’s mother, Julie Payne, said through tears. “We have to learn to exist in a world without Stacy.”
‘He showed Stacy no mercy’
Deputy Attorney General Tyler Banks urged the board to deny clemency, calling Ward “a murderer, a rapist, a predator and a manipulator.”
“Twenty-four conscripted Hoosiers from two different counties have seen who Roy Lee Ward is and what he did to Stacy Payne. And those Hoosiers made what was likely the toughest decision of their lives and decided that the death penalty was appropriate,” Banks said.
Ward pleaded guilty to rape and murder in 2022. He has twice been sentenced to death — first by a Spencer County jury in 2002, then by a Clay County jury in 2007, after the Indiana Supreme Court overturned the initial sentence. He remains the only person on Indiana’s death row to receive two death sentences from two separate juries, Banks noted.

“Granting clemency would not only negate the holdings of those state and federal courts and all the work done to litigate cases before those courts,” he continued. “Granting clemency would override the judgment of 24 Hoosiers for a person who committed the most horrific crime one could imagine, against a 15-year-old girl who was an honor student, cheerleader, member of her school’s student council and played in her school’s band.”
The state’s roughly 80-minute presentation included testimony from six witnesses: Dale Town Marshal Matt Keller, the first officer to respond to the scene and who took Ward into custody; Jane and Murray Stout, two Spencer County first responders who arrived shortly after and provided emergency medical care; Randy Cutrell and Rob Priest, both with the Indiana State Police, who worked on the case; and Julie, Stacy’s mother, flanked by her sister — Stacy’s aunt — Diane.
Banks detailed the attack, emphasizing how Ward bound Payne’s and “bludgeoned” her with a dumbbell, causing 18 blunt force injuries.
Ward raped the 15-year-old and cut open her abdomen and throat, “leaving her barely able to breathe and unable to talk.”
Keller, the first on scene, said he found Ward “standing in the threshold of the door,” holding a knife. 
“I told Stacy I was a police officer … that she was safe and that people were coming to help her. Stacy was unable to speak, but I knew that she understood, because she seemed to relax a little bit.”
“Ward is pure evil,” Keller continued. “He absolutely deserves no mercy.”
Jane Stout, who attended to Stacy at the scene and on the way to the hospital, said she had “never seen anything this brutal in my life.”
“The whole time we had her, she was conscious and alert. She would try to answer you, but with her throat being slit in half, she couldn’t communicate,” Stout described. “She had tears in her eyes. A 15-year-old girl, beautiful … and here she is laying in the back of an ambulance with her body cut in half and her throat slashed. … The whole community was hurt by this, and it was devastating to everybody.”
Julie Payne remembered her daughter as “happy and full of life, always lifting everyone up … an extraordinary girl.” 










We will never hear her voice, never have the joy of watching her grow into the incredible woman she was meant to be. Grief doesn't just break our hearts, it reshapes who we are, and we don't get to go back.


– Julie Payne, mother of Stacy Payne


“Now, our family gatherings are no longer whole,” she told the parole board. “Birthdays are sad reminders of what we lost, instead of celebrations of all the milestones that Stacy will never reach: graduations, a wedding, and children of her own. She didn’t even get her driver’s license.” 
The Payne family, she added, “has endured emotional devastation for 24 years and two months. That is 8,839 days.” Denying clemency, Julie said, would show that “Stacy’s life mattered, that justice will stand for the innocent, and that Ward’s heinous crime will not go unanswered.”
“There is a quote that says time heals all wounds. But that absolutely is not true in this case, where a child is brutally murdered and dies a horrific death because of evil,” she said. “You carry the pain every single day.”
Defense argues autism, remorse, false narrative at jury trial
In the morning session, Ward’s attorneys sought to dismantle the narrative of their client as a psychopath. 
“What we are here to tell you today is that is not true, that Roy is not a psychopath,” Law said. 
She cited Ward’s new autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. Law told the board that Ward’s language-processing impairments and social difficulties — now recognized as symptoms of autism — had been misunderstood for decades, leaving jurors with a distorted picture of who he was.
Story continues below.
Affidavit of Roy Lee Ward
 
Komp said Ward’s trial counsel “became advocates for a death penalty, telling the jury years ago that “Roy has no conscience, no empathy, no feelings.”
“That is not true,” Komp emphasized. “Psychopaths don’t feel guilty, and they don’t feel they should be punished. Roy wanted help in the worst way.”
Law and Komp returned to the affidavit Ward submitted to the parole board last week. 
In it, the death row inmate cited “concerns that due to my learning disability and language impairments, the messages I mean to convey are sometimes difficult for me to accurately express. My disability, specifically autism spectrum disorder, also affects the way I am perceived by others. I want to avoid any misinterpretation of my remorse.”
Pressed by Board Chair Gwen Horth on why Ward avoided an interview, Law said, “It’s not because he isn’t remorseful.”

“It’s because he has trouble expressing his remorse and finding the words,” she told Horth. “He just didn’t feel like he could use the word sorry — that the word sorry to him just sounded fake, and that it wouldn’t be believed.”
When asked what Ward would say to the Payne family, Komp told the board that Ward would say “that he realizes all the shame he brought to his own family — it’s 1,000 times worse for the Payne family.”
“He would hope he could live out his life, but … if the board does not grant clemency, he deserves to be punished,” Komp continued. 
Law, pitching in, said Ward would tell the Payne family “that he does deserve for (the execution) to be carried out. … And Roy’s preparing himself for that.”
Komp also described Ward’s faith on death row, but acknowledged that Ward’s expressions of faith are difficult to capture because of his difficulties with communication. Even so, he said Ward regularly prays, discusses scripture with spiritual advisors, and has “grown more” religious during his years on death row.
What happens next
Ward’s clemency filings submitted to the parole board additionally stressed his remorse. 
His defense counsel pointed to a letter to his first trial judge, in which he wrote: “I never did much for my life, but she was going to do a lot with hers. I’m terribly sorry for what I did. … I can’t ask for their forgiveness … I do ask for God’s forgiveness and can only hope he is willing to listen to me.”
The filings also outlined Ward’s history of mental health struggles, including treatment at Central State Hospital years before the crime.
Execution moves forward as questions linger around Indiana’s lethal injection drugs

Attorneys emphasized that Ward sought help even as a teenager, telling doctors, “I want to find out what is wrong with me.” Ward’s counsel argued that such statements reflect remorse and self-awareness inconsistent with the “psychopath” label used at his trial. 
The lawyers further highlighted Ward’s efforts to maintain relationships with family, fellow inmates and even a pet cat over the years as evidence of empathy and emotional capacity.
Ward’s clemency petition is one of the final steps available to avoid his death sentence.
The parole board hears arguments from attorneys, victims’ families and execution supporters before issuing a recommendation to the governor.
The governor alone has the power to commute a death sentence to life in prison, grant a reprieve or deny clemency altogether.
Earlier this year, the board followed the same process for another death row inmate, Benjamin Ritchie, ahead of his scheduled execution. But unlike Ward, Ritchie appeared before the panel at the state prison.
Following several hours of hearings, the parole board ultimately — unanimously — recommended against clemency for Ritchie, and the governor allowed his execution to proceed.
There is no timeline for the board’s recommendation. Deliberations happen behind closed doors.
In Ritchie’s case, the board issued a recommendation one day after the second and final hearing. Braun rejected the clemency plea the following day.
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976.
The most recent was in 2005, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels commuted the death sentence for Arthur Baird, who killed his pregnant wife and her parents in 1985. Although the parole board denied his petition for clemency, Daniels granted Baird clemency one day before the scheduled execution, citing questions about Baird’s sanity.

Anna Aho Rink, a physician assistant at Upper Great Lakes Family Health Center announced her campaign on Thursday, becoming the first Democrat in the district aiming to challenge state Rep. Karl Bohnak (R-Deerton).
For 17 years Rink worked as a physician assistant at the Planned Parenthood Marquette Health Center until the facility closed in April, with Planned Parenthood Michigan citing threats to federal funding from President Donald Trump’s administration. 
In a news release, Rink cited those cuts, alongside Bohnak’s vote in support of the Republican-led House’s budget, which would cut funding for rural healthcare in the Upper Peninsula as well as the State Police, as her motivation for running. 
“I’m running for state representative to fight for and protect this place that we love. Because the UP needs more access to health care, not less,” Rink said in a video announcing her campaign. “Our children need well-funded schools. We need jobs that are good paying and reliable. We need to work to preserve our beautiful lakes, forests and wildlife for generations to come. I’m running to protect our way of life.”
In 2024, Bohnak triumphed over then state Rep. Jenn Hill (D-Marquette), flipping the district red with just over 51% of the vote. With the House now split 58-52, Michigan Democrats are looking to reclaim the seat they lost in the last election cycle. 
The 109th House District covers Alger, Baraga and Marquette counties and part of Dickinson County.

Mikie Sherrill (D) said the state could seek to force them.","Jack Ciattarelli and Mikie Sherrill shake hands at the 2025 Gubernatorial Debate. Sept. 21, 2025. (Courtesy of Kevin Sanders for the New Jersey Globe)New Jersey’s gubernatorial candidates both want school districts to consolidate as a cost-saving maneuver, but they differ on whether the state should force districts to merge with their neighbors.
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, said during Sunday’s gubernatorial debate that she would first incentivize mergers but added that compulsory consolidation was an option.
“I’d start by offering the carrot to help the areas that want to consolidate, but when there are areas that are not putting enough money into students, into educators, into the buildings, and then they are taking a lot of money in property taxes and from the state level, then we’ll have to start to look at compulsory movements,” Sherrill said.
Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman, likewise said he would seek to boost incentives and assistance to municipalities and school districts seeking mergers, but he pledged not to force them.
“I do not believe that our state government should force consolidation. That’s up to the locals,” he said. “But I’ll tell you what, if you do consolidate or you do regionalize, Governor Ciattarelli will help incentivize that to make it easier.”
Sherrill and Ciattarelli are vying to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who cannot seek a third term in November.
Officials have long hailed school consolidation as a means of easing local property taxes by reducing duplicative administrative and facilities costs, but uptake has been slow.
New Jersey had 590 operating school districts during the 2024-2025 school year, according to state data, down from 599 in the 2020-2021 school year.
The number of non-operating districts — districts that have a board of education but send all their students to schools in outlying districts — fell from 17 to 16 over that same time period. Sherrill signaled those districts could be the first merged if she wins the governor’s race.
“We have some school districts who have the whole administrative cost, all of the buildings, and yet they’re not even running a K-12 school system, so we do need to merge some of these school districts,” she said.
Schools consume a majority of local property taxes — 52% of all those collected in 2024, according to property tax tables published by the Department of Community Affairs — and the more than $15.1 billion in school aid approved in the current state budget accounted for more than a quarter of all spending approved in the annual appropriations bill for the current July-to-June fiscal year. That total includes more than $4 billion in combined special education, transportation, and other categories of aid separate from the state’s school funding formula.
Ciattarelli suggested school vouchers — which allow property tax dollars to follow a student to a private school, a public school outside their district, or a charter school — could be a fix for ailing districts.
“When a school system is failing — and there’s some reasonable metrics that tell us whether or not a school system is failing — there’s got to be choice,” he said. “That choice comes in the form of vouchers. That choice comes in the form of charter schools.”
Because vouchers typically draw from school district funding, they could cause funding to decline at in-district public schools as students seek education elsewhere.
New Jersey lawmakers have considered compelling school district mergers or shared service agreements, but to date, such mergers have been entirely voluntary.
Murphy, who has generally favored school mergers, last year said he was “not wild about compulsory” consolidation, cautioning that home rule, a constitutional framework that gives local governments broad authority over the administration of school and other municipal services, could limit forced mergers.
A law he signed in 2022 created grants for districts to study whether consolidation was feasible, though only a handful of districts have explored such mergers since.
Cape May City Elementary School and West Cape May Elementary School are the latest to receive grants to explore a merger. Together, the two Cape May County schools have just 241 students.

(Photo courtesy of Megan Hufton)Megan Hufton’s two sons, AJ and Asher, both have been diagnosed with autism. Neither speaks.
But she doesn’t see autism as the “horrible, horrible crisis,” President Donald Trump described at a Washington, D.C., press conference Monday. 
Nor does she agree with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who said at an April press conference that “autism destroys families” and is an “individual tragedy as well.”
Hufton said Monday that the message she hears in such statements is that “it’s going to be a horrible, horrible tragedy” if a family member is autistic. “It’s not the way I describe our family or our lives at all.”
People with autism, their family members and advocates said the messages coming from the Trump administration are harmful and wrong. 
”People with autism are being identified as [a] population of people whose existence the government seeks to prevent or change into people who are more ‘normal,’” said Beth Swedeen, executive director of the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities (BPDD), in a statement Monday. “Autistic Americans have the same unalienable rights as all Americans, the right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. We all find different ways to achieve these things, and it is the individual, not the government, who decides our own worth.”
“People with autism have always existed,” said BPDD Chair Sydney Badeau. “We are part of what humanity looks like, and we are amazing.”
In interviews, four Wisconsin residents with autistic family members and an adult autistic self-advocate expressed similar views.
After years in which attitudes towards autism and understanding of people with autism have been improving, “this is taking everything back,” said Heather Murray, a Waunakee child care provider whose 20-year-old son has grown up with autism.
“It’s frustrating to hear it still being called a disease,” Murray said. Autism encompasses a broad spectrum of behaviors that might come with mild or severe disabilities for some people, she said, but it’s not a disease that can be cured.
“It is a way of being,” Murray said. “It is who they are. You can’t take the autism away from them.”
Jenny Price of Madison has a 16-year-old son who is autistic. An active volunteer in advocating for Wisconsin parents whose children have disabilities, Price said she’s been paying attention to how Kennedy has talked about autism since he took office at HHS.
Kennedy has said “that autism is something to be feared, it is epidemic, it steals our children, it ruins families — which are all things we know are not true and I just find it pretty unhelpful,” Price said.
At the Monday press conference Trump and Kennedy focused on claims that linked the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy to autism. Medical experts said the evidence does not support those claims.
“Current research shows an association, but it is limited and inconclusive,” said Rechelle Chaffee, executive director of Autism United of Wisconsin, based in the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa. “Autism we know is not caused by a  single factor. It’s caused by multiple variables.”
In addition to being the parent of two autistic teens, Hufton is the education and training specialist for the Autism Society of South Central Wisconsin.
“Some of the strongest scientific evidence that we’ve seen shows that there is no causal link” between acetaminophen and autism, Hufton said. “We support scientific based research, but also we want to make sure that research is grounded in science, it’s grounded in compassion and respect for these individuals, and really just making sure that we’re promoting inclusion.”
Trump also made references to debunked claims linking vaccines to autism.
“We’ve studied vaccines,” Hufton said. “They’ve been studied for decades and the research doesn’t support this claim. So it definitely makes us concerned about this messaging that is once again just kind of implying that there’s this single cause of autism and the fear behind it.”
Chaffee said that while $418 million was spent in 2020 on autism research, just 8% of that went to research on improving the quality of support and services for people with autism and their families.
“That’s not a significant amount of money going to improve the lives of people,” she said. “That is a missed opportunity to say the least.”
Price doesn’t expect that to improve in the current administration.
“Are they doing research into what supports or what types of programs make the lives of people with autism better? It’s pretty clear they’re not,” Price said. “Are they going to look for ways to support kids with autism or other learning disabilities in school? No, they’re going to remove anything with the word inclusion from the Department of Education grants.”
Erin Miller, 40, is a resident of Milwaukee’s south suburbs and has lived with autism her whole life. 
“I’m really growing weary of all of the speculation around what causes it.” Miller said.
She wants to see more research on how to help people who have autism and are trying to live full lives now. Those include research on subjects that range from accommodations for autistic women in nursing homes, to research on sleep to improving education services and employment practices that recognize the needs of autistic people.
“I would like to see more practical services that improve our life today,” Miller said.

Although the state government loathes the Forest Service regulation, many residents value the wild lands and wildlife it protects.
The post Wyomingites with deep conservation roots oppose axing Forest Service Roadless Rule appeared first on WyoFile .","Conservation groups, hunters, hikers and Wyomingites carrying on family conservation legacies are resisting the Trump administration’s plan to eliminate the 2001 Forest Service Roadless Rule. 
At the close of the 21-day comment period Friday, the U.S. Forest Service received 625,737 responses to the rollback plan. Opponents also wrote Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, who oversees the agency, advocating for roadless landscapes that nurture wildlife, clean air and water.
“We see firsthand how roads are the single greatest threat to wildlife,” Jackson Hole resident Kathryn Turner, a wildlife artist and valley native wrote in response to the proposed rollback. “They fragment habitat, block migration corridors, and increase collisions,” she wrote.
Turner’s father, John, led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from 1989-1993. Kathryn Turner is the fourth generation to be raised at the Triangle X Ranch in Grand Teton National Park and serves on the Jackson Hole Wildlife Foundation board.
“Tourists do not come to look at clear cuts and strip mines.” Lee Ann Inberg-Schuff
Lee Ann Inberg-Schuff carried the conservation torch for her late brother, Kirk Inberg, a Wyoming Game and Fish warden who died in 1991 in a plane crash in the Teton Wilderness while tracking radio-collared grizzly bears.
“Tourists do not come to look at clear cuts and strip mines,” Inberg-Schuff wrote. “Recreation and tourism can be easily quantified and in Wyoming alone, is a $4.9 billion industry.
“Extractive industries are boom/bust at best and so very shortsighted,” she wrote. “Keeping Roadless areas makes the most financial sense.”
Citizens want protection
Considered by Sierra Club “one of the most important conservation wins,” the Roadless Rule rankled Wyoming government from the get-go. The state sued to overturn the protection of 3.2 million Forest Service acres — land owned by all Americans — located in Wyoming. The state’s campaign ended unsuccessfully in 2021 when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up an appeal.
The roadless rule generally prohibits roadbuilding and logging across 44.7 million acres nationwide, not counting national forests in Colorado and Idaho, which have their own roadless regulations. The Roadless Rule does not prohibit motorized travel and, by definition, is not a program to close existing roads.
Expanded road access is necessary, the Department of Agriculture said in a notice proposing an environmental impact statement authorizing elimination of the Roadless Rule, because “insect and disease and wildfire activity, especially within the [wildland-urban interface] affects important resources, neighboring infrastructure, and communities.” 
Whether roadless areas are at increased danger of wildfire and its most serious effects is widely debated. Instead of scrapping the rule, the Department of Agriculture and the Forest Service should instead alter it slightly to address fires, one former Forest Service official opined.
“The Trump administration could update the rule to permit temporary roads in roadless areas that are near neighborhoods along the wildland-urban interface to allow for forest thinning or other ecological restoration,” Robert Bonnie, a former high-ranking Agriculture Department official, wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times.
In Wyoming, there’s also disagreement over whether logging is sustainable in the state’s semi-arid climate or more akin to “timber mining” than harvesting.
Many Wyoming agencies, however, fell in line with the Trump administration’s plan. Many citizens did not.

“The public lands around the Wind River Range are the driving force of our [business] and we need them to stay protected,” wrote Jake Dickerson, co-owner of Wild Iris Mountain Sports in Lander. Repealing the rule, “would have a negative impact on the entire economy of our town and the many thousands like it across the west.”
Roadless areas are “[t]he last best places to hunt in Wyoming, and probably the West,” said Lander resident Nathan Maxon.
“Roadless areas are where source populations exist that produce [wildlife] migrants into the surrounding landscape where we can encounter them,” wrote Merav Ben-David, a professor of Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wyoming. Based on decades of experience and study, she said eliminating the roadless rule “will only harm those of us who rely on wildlife for our livelihood and enjoyment.”
Some commenters did not sign their submissions. One 81-year-old said he started visiting national forest lands as soon as he was old enough to drive. He said there are enough roads in national forests already, 370,000 miles of them, “enough to circle the Earth nearly 15 times.”
Another unsigned comment read that once Wyoming land is developed, “it will never return to its natural state.”
Owners of a 56-year family sporting goods business near Wyoming’s Bighorn National Forest said the rollback “will do nothing but negatively impact the Tourism and Recreation sector without any guarantee of significant gain in economic activity.”
A member of a “small rural community in Wyoming” said it was difficult for his fellow villagers to speak up.
“Most residents do not have the ability or knowledge to find this obscure website to make public comment,” the anonymous writer said. “For every person in my community that comments, there are hundreds more who feel the same way and are adamantly against irresponsible policies like this proposal.
“However,” he wrote, “we will all vote.”
State agencies align
Wyoming State Forestry Division’s comments were typical of those made by Equality State agencies. “We are supportive and fully endorse the current proposal to return management discretion of [inventoried] roadless areas to local land managers,” officials at the division said.
Wyoming’s Department of Environmental Quality said it would continue to enforce pollution guidelines in roadless areas. “The proposed rule recission still requires [that] site-specific impacts comply with applicable state and federal regulations,” an agency official wrote.
“Wyoming State Parks aligns with other Wyoming agencies to support the rescission of the Roadless Rule,” wrote Chris Floyd, deputy director of the Division of State Parks, Historic Sites & Trails and the Office of Outdoor Recreation, all part of the agency Wyoming State Parks and Cultural Resources.
The Saratoga-Encampment-Rawlins Conservation District wants the rescission’s environmental impact statement to include more than two options — no action and rollback. It called for the ability for Wyoming and other states to forge their own roadless conservation rules.
In Converse County, commissioners support “reconsideration of [the Forest Service’s] current and misguided nationally driven planning strategy and urges the agency to instead empower local forests with greater authority.”
Teton County has supported protection of roadless areas since 2018 and reiterated its position in a letter opposing rescission of the rule.
Conservation groups and scientists
Wyoming and national conservation groups and scientists filed extensive comments.
“In Wyoming, when things aren’t working quite right, we fix them — we don’t throw them away,” the Wyoming Wildlife Federation wrote. The group likened rescission to “the sticker shock of buying a brand-new truck when all you really need is a repair.”
In contrast to the just-expired 21-day comment period, the 2001 rule was forged after 430 meetings and 1.6 million public comments, the group said. Trout Unlimited, the Wyoming Wild Sheep Foundation and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership signed on to the comment.
An analysis of early submissions showed that 99% of commenters oppose rolling back the Roadless Rule. The Center for Western Priorities, a Colorado nonprofit, made that analysis based on 5,000 randomly selected comments submitted by Friday’s deadline morning.
Protection for wildlife was a major theme of comments. Fully 70% of Wyoming’s roadless areas provide spring, summer and fall range for elk, Nat Paterson, policy director for the Wyoming Wildlife Federation, wrote.
“In Wyoming, 60% of our roadless areas provide irreplaceable habitat for native trout.”Samantha Beard
The 70% figure “comes from our partners at Trout Unlimited who did an analysis of GIS layers looking at Wyoming Game and Fish Department data of elk seasonal range and inventoried roadless areas in Wyoming,” federation Executive Director Craig Benjamin wrote in an email.
The existing rule protects 11,337 climbing routes and boulder problems, more than 1,000 whitewater paddling runs, 43,826 miles of trail, including parts of the Continental Divide Trail, another Wyoming coalition wrote. Wyoming Wilderness Association, Greater Yellowstone Coalition, Teton County Backcountry Horsemen, Wyoming Outdoor Council, National Outdoor Leadership School and the Council for the Bighorn Range also said the rule protects 20,298 mountain biking routes.
“In Wyoming, 60% of our roadless areas provide irreplaceable habitat for native trout,” Wyoming Trout Unlimited Council chair Samantha Beard wrote.
Backcountry Hunters and Anglers said the rule protects “strongholds that hunters and anglers rely on for healthy fish and wildlife habitat, unparalleled opportunities in the field, and clean water.” It called for adopting a permanent safeguard — a measure stronger than the existing administrative rule — through the proposed Roadless Area Conservation Act.
The Natural Resources Defense Council had about 100 cosigners to its exhaustive comments.
A rollback would “dramatically harm wildlife areas … negatively impact the forested areas … and allow for corporations to have unchecked access to protected wildlife areas,” the Society for Conservation Biology wrote. It referenced a rare study of the effectiveness of the Roadless Rule.
“Many [roadless areas] are among the most wild, undeveloped areas both in the nation and within their respective states,” according to the study “Conservation value of national forest roadless areas,” which included about 15 pages of references to science papers. Roadless areas “protect drinking water for hundreds of thousands of people [and] add significantly to the total carbon captured by existing protected areas.”
The Forest Service will analyze the comments, favoring those that are constructive, information-rich and that clearly communicate and support their claims. It will use those to inform an environmental impact statement on the proposed rescission. The final rule, EIS, and record of decision are expected to be released in late 2026, the agency said.

Industry leaders, tax groups and conservationists have different takes on the first federal lease sale under new rates.
The post How will the Big Beautiful Bill’s reduced oil-and-gas royalty rates impact Wyoming? appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal oil and natural gas lease sale in Wyoming this month netted $8.5 million for 32 parcels spanning 39,225 acres, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. 
The “bonus bid” proceeds are paid up front and split between the U.S. Treasury and the state. Companies also pay federal mineral royalties as they produce the petrol. 
But the sale — the BLM’s third competitive oil and gas lease auction in Wyoming so far this year — and any resulting royalty payments will ultimately generate less revenue for American taxpayers than sales in the past, conservation groups and one taxpayer advocacy organization say.
The One Big Beautiful Bill, passed in July, reduced the royalty rate for federal oil and gas from 16.67% to 12.5%. If all 32 parcels in this month’s sale are fully developed, then the lesser royalty rate will reap an estimated $22 million less than under the previous royalty rate, according to calculations by Taxpayers for Common Sense. That would put Wyoming’s loss at $11 million.
Advocacy groups have also noted that a similar royalty rate reduction for federal coal will cost Wyoming about $50 million annually — a revenue loss that many state lawmakers want to rectify.
“Competitive, market-rate royalty rates do not affect industry interest or production decisions — lowering rates only shortchanges taxpayers by reducing future royalty revenue,” Taxpayers for Common Sense wrote.

The BLM, under the Trump administration, doesn’t see it that way. 
Instead, the reduced royalty rate “is expected to spur additional leasing and drilling activity, which in turn supports increased domestic energy production and strengthens U.S. energy security,” according to a BLM statement regarding the Wyoming lease sale.
Oil and gas industry officials in Wyoming agree.
“It simply isn’t true to claim that higher royalty rates always result in more revenue for the federal government,” Petroleum Association of Wyoming President Pete Obermueller told WyoFile.
The Inflation Reduction Act increased the federal oil and gas royalty rate from 12.5% to 16.67% in 2022, Obermueller noted. “Total royalties paid by Wyoming’s industry decreased by 17% from 2022 to 2023,” he said. “In 2024, while still under the IRA-mandated higher royalty rate, federal royalties decreased again, this time falling by a whopping 30%.”
Compounding the issue, conservation groups contend the industry is nominating and acquiring federal oil and gas lease parcels beyond the typical “speculation” required to suss out the potential productivity of new areas. The type of speculation alleged by some conservation groups is to simply hold some areas open to future development, where they fear environmental restrictions in the future might keep them out.
The industry holds a vast amount of federal oil and gas leases that it has not acted on, they note.
One piece of evidence the taxpayer advocacy group points to is what they say is an uncommonly low average dollar-per-acre among successful bids in this month’s lease sale in Wyoming. 
“More than 90% of acres [in Fremont and Natrona counties] were leased for less than $40 per acre,” Taxpayers for Common Sense said. In contrast, some of the highest winning bids were for parcels in Converse and Campbell counties — a highly active oil play — fetching more than $1,000 per acre, including one in Campbell County for $4,612 per acre, based on BLM reports.
The accusation of speculation, or buying federal oil and gas leases to fend off future environmental limitations to development, “is an odd concept,” and doesn’t hold water, according to Obermueller.
“Every single lease ever offered is, at one point, speculative,” he said. “People forget that oil and natural gas must first be found before it can be produced.”
Oil and gas companies that bought federal leases in the Jonah Field in the late 1990s or early 2000s, for example, were considered by some within the industry to be risky, at best, Obermueller suggested. “They paid off quite handsomely for Wyoming.
“Wyoming,” Obermueller continued, “is exciting to oil and gas operators precisely because we are still exploring for resources and testing the horizontal and vertical bounds of oil and natural gas basins. If so-called ‘speculative’ leasing were not allowed, then there would no longer be a mechanism for exploring in Wyoming.”
The BLM’s lease sale this month is the first to “fully” implement myriad new policies under the Trump administration, Lander-based Wyoming Outdoor Council Conservation Director Alec Underwood told WyoFile. The concern laid out by Taxpayers for Common Sense — that the average per-acre bid price suggests overt speculation — he said, holds some merit.
“Only a very small percentage of acres purchased in the sale, 7%, accounted for more than 80% of auction revenue. This points to many of the parcels being leased through speculation,” Underwood said. “Rather than offering a fire sale of leases in important habitat such as crucial winter range for ungulates, we should be prioritizing leasing in areas that are likely for production and adjacent to existing development.”  
The BLM’s next quarterly oil and gas lease sale in Wyoming will take place in December. Go to this BLM webpage for more information.

On Sept. 10, Idaho Transportation Department Director L. Scott Stokes submitted Idaho’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, plans to the Federal Highway Administration and requested Idaho’s share of funding for fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2026. 
The NEVI program was created to develop a connected network of EV charging stations located every 50 miles along designated interstates and highways. 
A working group in Idaho had already gathered public feedback, conducted a study and narrowed down a list of potential sites for charging stations, including potential sites along highway corridors near Bliss, Lewiston and Pocatello.

However, all work on the program was halted in February after Federal Highway Administration officials sent state transportation directors a letter rescinding all previous guidance for the program and suspending approval of state plans, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Federal Highway Administration officials sent the letter halting the project just weeks after President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, telling state highway officials to await further guidance from the feds.
That guidance arrived in August, state officials said, and Idaho Transportation Department officials resubmitted Idaho’s plans Sept. 10. 
Idaho officials did not make any big changes to their previous plans, which were updated in 2023 and 2024. But they did submit a siting, feasibility and access study from 2024 and point out the locations in the plans that address the latest guidance the federal government gave states in August.
“These four plans provide compliance with all NEVI statutory and regulatory requirements as stated in the (Federal Highway Administration) guidance referenced above,” Stokes wrote in Idaho’s letter. 
In an interview Friday, Idaho Transportation Department Communication Manager John Tomlinson said Idaho highlighted how it plans to use NEVI program funds each year, included a community engagement report as requested and provided a description of physical and cybersecurity strategies. 
“The immediate next step is we are waiting for approval,” Tomlinson said. 
If Idaho’s plans are approved, Tomlinson said the NEVI working group would reconvene and spend several months assessing how to implement the plan.

The good news, columnist Kerry Drake opines, is that the vast majority of Wyomingites value these lands, so MAGA forces trying to exploit them are outnumbered. 
The post Assault on Wyoming’s embattled public lands is just getting started appeared first on WyoFile .","If you’re worried about the ongoing assault on our public lands by President Donald Trump and Congress, be prepared for a long, ugly fight. It’s only just begun.

Opinion

Public land advocates scored an impressive victory in June, when their protests forced the removal of Utah Sen. Mike Lee’s provision to sell more than one million acres in the West to private interests from the obnoxiously named “One Big Beautiful Bill.” 
But MAGA-backed officials will stop at nothing until they can sell public lands that belong to all Americans to the highest bidders so corporations can build roads through pristine wilderness areas, allow the mineral industry to “drill, baby, drill,” and let the timber industry run wild in our national forests.
The good guys — the public, our environment and wildlife — won’t win until voters decide they’re fed up with elected officials who want to exploit public lands and vote them out of office. That’s a great goal but one that can’t be easily or speedily accomplished in a state as bright red as Wyoming.
These federal rules and actions that protect the environment are currently in jeopardy:

U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins wants to rescind the U.S. Forest Service’s Roadless Rule that protects 59 million roadless acres considered vital to wildlife.


The U.S. House passed a controversial resolution that states the Bureau of Land Management’s plan in Montana that restricted coal leasing has “no force or effect.” It’s now in the hands of the U.S. Senate.


The BLM has opened public comment on a plan to roll back its Public Lands Rule that gave conservation an equal footing with industrial uses of property owned by all Americans.


Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued an order restricting use of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which was created more than 60 years ago to buy and preserve recreation lands.

In June, hundreds of Wyomingites gathered in Cheyenne to tell the delegation how deeply opposed they are to public land sales in the state, but none of our federal lawmakers accepted invitations to attend. 
State Rep. Karlee Provenza, a Democrat from Laramie, one of the event’s organizers, saw an opportunity to call each official’s office and have the crowd leave a loud message of outrage about Lee’s provision.


I wanted my voice to be heard too, so I gave a full-throated yell to every scripted call-and-response direction from Provenza. It was a diverse, united and fired-up bipartisan crowd. I’ve covered a lot of protests in front of the Capitol, and joined a few when my days as a pawn in the corporate journalism world were over, and I’ve rarely seen one with this much energy.
Which is good, because it’s going to take enthusiastic work to preserve the sacred environment we have in Wyoming against the visions of greedy  extremists who want to privatize it. 
“Sacred” is the right word, because people use it to describe the joy nature holds when we want places to relax, recreate, regenerate our spirits, seek solitude and solace, and connect with this part of the Earth and all of its treasures.
People who want to protect public lands do it for their families, future generations and fellow Americans who are also co-owners of the public land we are lucky to live nearby. We all have a responsibility to care for wildlife by protecting their habitats and promoting conservation efforts.
The direct attacks on public lands, including Lee’s renewed attempt to win support for public land sales, are growing. Rep. Harriet Hageman, the most anti-environmental Wyoming congressperson in my lifetime, is gung-ho to keep up the fight to privatize public lands.
“We never, ever, ever talk about ever disposing of any federal lands under any circumstance whatsoever,” a frustrated Hageman said at a town hall meeting in Cody. “That absolutely makes no sense whatsoever in a growing country.”
When asked why Republicans are in such a rush to sell public lands, Hageman said it’s so the private sector can build more affordable housing. 
Of course, in the middle of nowhere with no infrastructure is obviously the perfect place to build houses the average person can afford. Just keep them far out of sight of the ultra-rich who will build second mega-mansions in Wyoming on their newly acquired former public land.
All four MAGA plans to weaken public lands protections must be defeated. “Unnecessary road development would ruin the value of these public lands for people and wildlife who appreciate them as they are,” long-time outfitter Meredith Taylor told WyoFile.
Amy Lindholm, a spokesperson for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, warned it’s not easy to understand what the changes the far-right is advocating will do. She said Burgum’s order curtailing the Land and Water Conservation Fund “may fly under the radar, but it could be as serious as selling off pieces of federal public land.”
Center for Western Priorities Deputy Director Aaron Weiss said in a statement that using the Congressional Review Act to throw out the BLM’s Montana plan for Powder River Basin coal risks unleashing “legal and regulatory chaos across the West.” 
If courts interpret the act broadly, Weiss added, management plans written in the past 30 years could potentially invalidate oil and gas leases, grazing permits, and threaten public access to trails and campgrounds.
I hope at least the BLM’s Public Lands Rule that says conservation must be considered on equal footing with other public land uses, including mining, will withstand the far right’s revocation efforts.
Alison Flint, senior legal director at The Wilderness Society, nailed how odious this move is: “The administration is saying that public lands should be managed primarily for the good of powerful drilling, mining and development interests, [but] public lands’ role in providing Americans the freedom to enjoy the outdoors, and conserve beloved places … is a second-class consideration.”
Americans have long cherished public lands, so the MAGA movement is outnumbered on this issue. Advocates need to spread the word about how close the West is to losing its public lands if we don’t fight. “Wyoming: Where public land is not for sale” should be the Equality State’s new battlecry. 
It could be a good tourist slogan, too. It shows what we value here.

Amid Suicide Prevention Month in September, three Idaho nonprofits are bringing professional skier, ultrarunner and mental health advocate Drew Petersen to the city for a screening of his film “Feel it All” and a keynote speech. 
In 2023, Idaho had the fourth highest suicide rate in the nation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s most recently available data show.  
Boise-based nonprofits, The Speedy Foundation, Connection is the Cure, and Youth Mental Wellness Alliance, known as You.Me.We.All, are hosting the screening on at 7 p.m. Thursday at the Egyptian Theatre, according to a press release. Doors open at 6 p.m., and tickets are $15 for adults and $10 for students.
“Deaths from despair impact every corner of our community, but together, we can create a culture where people feel seen, supported, and hopeful,” Speedy Foundation Executive Director Co-Founder Shannon Decker said in the press release. “Bringing Drew to Boise during Suicide Prevention Month is a powerful opportunity to keep building momentum for change. His story is a reminder that even when life might feel unbearable and problems seem impossible to solve, opening up to someone we trust can help us get through it; it gets better.”
Petersen grew up in Colorado and became a sponsored, professional backcountry skier at a young age. He enjoyed success in competitions and getting featured in skiing films, but told The Guardian his mental health struggles began at a young age, and they were exacerbated by numerous concussions. He eventually was diagnosed with type 2 bipolar disorder, which is characterized by periods of hypomania — lots of energy, low sleeping, partying and very focused — and then periods of depression that can last months.  
In 2017, Petersen was hit on the head by a falling rock on a ski trip. After the nearly lethal injury, his suicidal ideation became mores serious, he told the Guardian, and he reached out for help. 
The film “Feel It All,” which Petersen directed, depicts his experiences with mental health and suicidal ideation, which he will connect with the “urgent realities facing Idaho and the Mountain West,” the release said. 
“The communities I’ve been fortunate to connect with have shown me that we don’t just need these conversations around mental health, but that the people want these conversations of mental health and suicide prevention elevated,” Petersen said in the press release. “I consistently receive messages that Feel It All has saved lives and given people the courage to ask for help for the first time or finally follow through. That’s the power in talking about all of this and it’s why this series of in-person events will bring that impact to the Boise community.”
Youth Mental Wellness Alliance is a nonprofit founded by Boise School District parents looking for community solutions to meet the growing need for youth mental health support. 
Connection is the Cure is an organization provides connections through workshops, training, service projects, and other activities to those who’ve been affected by suicide, mental health, and addiction. 
The Speedy Foundation is a nonprofit named for Boise-native and three-time Olympic skier Jeret “Speedy” Peterson, who died by suicide in 2011. The organization originated in Idaho and Utah but has since expanded to other states.

All 99 Assembly seats will be up for election in 2026 and it will be the second time that legislative maps adopted in 2024 will be used. Under those maps, Democrats were able to gain 10 seats in 2024, bringing their numbers up to 45.
Jessica Seawright announced her campaign for the Assembly on Monday. (Photo courtesy of campaign)
Their goal for 2026 is to hold all of their seats and gain at least five more in order to flip the chamber. Republicans have held the Assembly for the last 15 years.
Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek) currently holds the 21st seat located in Milwaukee County, including Oak Creek and a portion of the city of Milwaukee near the Mitchell International Airport. She was first elected in a special election in November 2013, and has won reelection six times. Since 2021 she has also been a member of the powerful Joint Finance Committee, which is responsible for writing the state budget every two years. 
Under the new maps, Rodriguez won another term in 2024 with 51% of the vote against her Democratic challenger. According to an analysis by John Johnson, a research fellow at Marquette University, the district leaned Democratic by 4 percentage points in the presidential election and 7 percentage points in the U.S. Senate race. Rodriguez has not yet  announced her reelection campaign.
Seawright said the new legislative maps provide the opportunity to ask for more from representatives. 
“I wanted more — more understanding, more presence and I decided that it was time to step up,” Seawright said. 
Seawright was joined at her launch event Monday by state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) and Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee). The Oak Creek venue where she made her announcement was previously part of Sinicki’s districts, before the maps changed.
Seawright said she sees the 21st as a 50-50 district.
“It’s really close, and not everyone is going to agree with me,” Seawright said. “The strength that I believe that I bring is decades of training, listening to people, understanding their perspective, understanding the impact of coming off extremely partisan, and what that does to stifle coordination, collaboration and participation of the voters of their residents in a community.” 
Seawright said her family has lived in Wisconsin since 2018, first in Racine and now in the Garden District community in Milwaukee. They moved from Utah because they had family in the state who would help with caregiving and respite for her 10-year-old son. 
“We have a fantastic neighborhood. I love it,” Seawright said. “We have community support. We have some great work happening in our parks,” including projects to make the spaces more accessible. 
Seawright said she has been working to build a coalition over the last six months leading up to her launch and she is launching over a year out from next year’s general election in November so she has time to get to know the district. 
“I want to be out there. I want to have open-ended conversations that aren’t pressured by me asking for folks’ vote before I earn it,” Seawright said. “I want to show up. I’ll be out in the community… I have the opportunity starting early to do the work that it will require to run for this office.” 
Her 10-year-old son, who has complex medical needs due to a genetic condition, is the major reason she became an advocate. She joined U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin to speak out against cuts to Medicaid and told the story of her son qualifying for and receiving services through the Katie Beckett program, which helps children with disabilities access Medicaid coverage while living at home instead of being in an institution. Her son also received a waiver for children’s long term support through Medicaid. Seawright worked with the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities and serves on the state’s Council for Children with Long-Term Support Needs. 
“I began to have the opportunity to spend time with adult self-advocates, and that was so powerful and inspiring, and it’s motivating,” Seawright said. “You want to step up. You want to be there to make sure that your friends feel heard.”
Seawright said that she wants to work for an expansion of Badgercare — Wisconsin’s Medicaid program — even as federal changes to Medicaid by the Trump administration caused Gov. Tony Evers’ administration to declare that it is “fiscally and operationally unfeasible” to expand it due to changes in Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act.
“I look forward to exploring the options that make it feasible, because right now, we’re looking at folks on the marketplace having premiums increase so high that they’re going to lose access,” Seawright said. 
Seawright said that fully funding public education is another of her top priorities, especially increasing the special education reimbursement that public schools receive from the state. 
The special education reimbursement rate was raised to 45% under the most recent state budget passed by the Republican-led Legislature and signed into law by Evers. It is the highest rate in years, but fell below what Democrats and public education advocates had called for — a 60% or even a 90% rate.
“Kids like my son, who do need various services in order to access public school, have costs that are mandated by federal protections… I’ve heard from school boards and other school leadership, teachers that it is often pulled from the general fund, and it is making it very difficult to create the inclusive educational environment that I dream of for my son,” Seawright said. “I’d really like to continue and come back to special education reimbursement.”
She said she is flexible about the size of the increase to the reimbursement.
“I look forward to building connections with local leaders, with school boards, within the state Assembly, and talking about a pathway forward that moves us up every year, that moves us on a trajectory where Wisconsin regains its prowess around supporting our kids,” Seawright said. 
Her background as a social worker and her research on criminal justice inform her focus on improving community safety through treatment, prevention and alternatives to incarceration. 
“I am grateful for the work of first responders, for police officers, and I’ve worked alongside correctional professionals at the juvenile and adult level, and that’s kind of where I’m coming from,” Seawright said. “I am seeing what first responders are being asked to do… My mom is an emergency room nurse, and I see what folks are going through in terms of what comes into the emergency room, and I’m dismayed by any changes moving us away from prevention services being funded.”

The state’s arguments mirror those of federal immigration officials who have contended that agents with Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, or ICE, need to conceal their identities to protect themselves and their families from retaliation as they carry out mass enforcement responsibilities. 
The arguments came as the state defended itself in a public records lawsuit filed in Davidson County Chancery Court by the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition. 
The nonprofit filed suit last month against the Tennessee Highway Patrol, or THP, and the state’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security, alleging the agencies had failed to meaningfully respond to a request for records and video footage it was seeking to shed light on mass immigration sweeps in Nashville earlier this year. 
Immigrant group sues for records, footage of Nashville immigration sweeps

Hundreds of drivers were stopped in a neighborhood with a large population of immigrants as part of the so-called Operation Flood the Zone, a joint operation between the THP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE; 196 immigrants were ultimately arrested, according to data subsequently released by ICE. The activity occurred before the THP had formally entered into an agreement with ICE to conduct immigration enforcement.
The state delayed providing video of the stops and other documents, and heavily redacted the reports it did provide to exclude a host of identifying information that “made it hard to understand what police did and why they did it,” attorneys for the nonprofit argued, citing the example of one redacted line that read, “Queried [license number] on behalf of XX.” 
Zachary Barker, senior assistant attorney general, said the state had removed trooper names, badge numbers, car numbers and other identifying information from dispatch reports to “protect troopers who protect us every day.” 
Barker, citing state law he said has applied only to undercover officers in the past, also argued that redacting information such as patrol car numbers was appropriate because “a radical political extremist could take that information…listen to the police scanner and learn where and when an officer will be.”
And, he argued, that redacted THP “unit numbers” are used as part of the process to log into the agency’s computer system, posing a threat to operations if exposed.
Michael Holley, an attorney for the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition, called the scenarios Barker described “just far-fetched.”
Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency continues traffic stops, arrests in Nashville

“There’s no basis that this has ever happened,” he said. “Frankly it’s absurd this is the state’s position.”
Holley noted that THP officers wear name tags and badge numbers in public. How, he asked, could “the information that’s used in public…become confidential when someone asks for it.”
The identities of law enforcement officers participating in arrests and traffic stops is public information, said Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government.
Fisher said she knew of no other instance when a state trooper’s name was redacted from traffic stop records in Tennessee.
The practice, Fisher said, could undermine public trust in law enforcement.
“We have to maintain public trust in the police, and the officer’s name is part of that public trust,” she said.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement “dragnet” in Nashville results in detentions

“If there’s a safety reason, we need to know. The public needs to know what kind of threats have been made or what kinds of actions taken,” she said. “Tennesseans don’t want people threatening our officers, but they also don’t want secret police.”
In legal filings state attorneys cited national statistics that said 13.5% of sworn officers were assaulted in the line of duty in 2004, a total of 85,730 assaults that year. 
Troopers engaged in immigration enforcement face even greater risks, they said.
“While troopers face danger every day as they protect Tennesseans, connecting a specific trooper’s identity to an operation involving highly politicized immigration enforcement increased the danger to that trooper,” the state’s legal filings said. 
A legislative effort is also underway to shield the identities of Tennessee law enforcement participating in immigration enforcement.
A bill filed by Sen. Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican, which would make confidential the name of any federal state or local officer or official participating in immigration enforcement activities in Tennessee, will be considered when the legislature reconvenes in January. The bill’s language also calls for officers’ personal information, including addresses and phone numbers, to remain confidential. Tennessee law already protects officers’ private information from public dissemination.
Chancellor Russell Perkins, who presided over Monday’s public records hearing, said he would rule “as quickly as I can” on the petition by the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition to force the state to promptly turn over all requested records.

At the time Facebook was young but rapidly expanding, Twitter was just starting to catch on, and Instagram hadn’t yet launched. I recall being asked in interviews: “This is all pretty alarming — somebody fired for what they write in a blog — but does it really ever happen beyond isolated examples?” I replied that it’s uncommon but surmised that expanding social media makes it plausible we’ll see more of it. 
In the years since, we have indeed run across plenty more examples , but the blizzard in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s death takes it to a whole new level. What in recent years might amount to an occasional news item about someone’s occupationally perilous expressive choice has this month morphed into a mass right-wing parade of zealotry (with the vice president as grand marshal) marching to trample on the reputations and livelihoods of anyone who is disinclined to venerate Charlie Kirk as a cross between Martin Luther King and Jesus Christ, and willing to share that reluctance publicly. 
Let’s be clear up front that freedom of speech does not entitle you to keep your job no matter what nugget of genius you choose to broadcast in your off hours. Ken Paulson, who heads Middle Tennessee State University’s Free Speech Center, puts it aptly and succinctly: “The First Amendment is not always on your side when you are raging at the world.” 
If you’re an at-will employee in the private sector, your work-related free speech protections are near nil (though some things like labor organizing and whistleblowing have protections). Your boss may be an idiot when you are fired for righteous declarations that you like the Mets and hate the Yankees but not a legally imperiled idiot. In public sector work, on the other hand, you are entitled to speak out on matters of public concern without fearing for your job — unless your employer can make a legitimate claim (read: persuade a jury, if it comes to that) that your speech compromises workplace harmony or operational efficiency. 










The First Amendment is not always on your side when you are raging at the world.


– Ken Paulson, Middle Tennessee State University Free Speech Center


Importantly, compromising harmony or efficiency does not —and should not — equate to offending the boss’s political or parochial sensibilities. Workers should not be canned merely because in their off hours they have provocative or controversial things to say on social media or in other public settings. Freedom of speech means the freedom to be not just provocative but also the freedom to be stupid, insensitive, distasteful, callous, disagreeable, unsympathetic, remorseless and even hateful on your own time and on your own dime. 
Are there cases where an employer can credibly claim that awful speech aired in public does make it impossible for the person to do their job or the workplace to function? Sure, but as a court decision in a Memphis case a few years ago involving a public utility worker’s racist social media reminded us, mere speculation of virality or social backlash without proof isn’t enough.
Even in the private sector employers would do well to choose restraint over impulse. And they would do extra well to remind themselves that they own part of their employees’ days, not the whole of their corporeal existence. Amid reports of multiple suspended workers for Kirk-related remarks on social media, Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastion reminded employees that “we all represent Delta, at all times, in any forum.” Sorry, Ed, but no, they don’t. He continued: “It’s essential that we act in ways that uphold our shared values and the human connection that defines us.” No, it’s not, except maybe during work hours. 
None of this is helped by the legal cluelessness of the person who is supposed to be the nation’s chief law enforcement officer. Asserting that “there’s free speech and then there’s hate speech,” Attorney General Pam Bondi promises “we will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.” Only if you want to violate the constitution, as even conservative Associate Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito knows full well (p. 25, first paragraph). 
It is troublesome that university academics are being targeted (and not just because that’s my day job) and that Tennessee elected officials including Gov. Bill Lee and Sen. Marsha Blackburn seem to be taking particular pleasure in hounding university leaders to take action. Of course Bill and Marsha have the right to be as outraged as they like at whatever they like — free speech lives! — but they might want to temper their glee with a little remedial consideration of the dark and sordid modern history of academic censorship. 
Sorting through the various posts for which free-speaking Kirk antagonists have been shipped off to unemployment lines, one finds some that are certifiably hideous, but others are merely disagreeable, and some essentially inoffensive, amounting to little more than pointed critique.
As always when free speech is on the table, the hard part is drawing the borders between these categories. What makes America’s First Amendment brand of free speech unique and wonderful is that for the most part we don’t try. Now is not the time to start.

Justin Taylor/The Current GA/CatchLight LocalThis story was done in collaboration with The Current GA and is part of an ongoing series examining Georgia’s school voucher program. 
Georgia’s new program to subsidize private education has helped more than 8,000 children move from public schools with low test score averages to educational organizations predominantly affiliated with Christian churches, data from the Georgia Education Savings Authority shows. 
About $5.4 million of the $7.1 million distributed by the state authority at the start of the fall school semester went to 286 private schools serving 85 counties and nine cities, according to a data investigation by The Current GA and Georgia Recorder. 
The remaining cash — $1.7 million — went to 153 companies, including giant retailer Amazon, that sell school supplies such as computers, tablets and books, records show.
As many as 8,600 private students make up the first cohort receiving the Georgia Promise Scholarship, the program approved in spring 2024 by the Republican-led state legislature and Gov. Brian Kemp. Eligible children must live in areas served by the lowest-performing 25% of the state’s public schools.
Under the program’s guidelines, families receive $6,500 per year for each child to pay for the switch to a private school or homeschool or other educational supports. Parents receive the money through an online state portal, where they then allocate the dollars to an approved private school or to a company to purchase educational materials or services. 
The new state agency overseeing the voucher program spent more than a year finalizing rules, setting up an application portal and reviewing applications from schools, students and vendors. According to GESA, nearly 15,300 families applied, yet thousands were determined ineligible.
It will take at least 15 months before Georgians will have metrics from GESA’s first review to evaluate whether the promise of the sweeping policy — better quality education and more competition for public schooling — is fulfilled.  
Companies are leading beneficiaries
For now, however, data from the first dispersal of funds in July show dozens of private companies are the leading beneficiaries of the fledgling voucher system. 
Amazon received the largest amount from the voucher funds, with $302,000 in sales. The next three largest recipients of funding were electronics vendors headquartered outside of Georgia.
The private school with the largest amount of funds from the voucher program was Newton County’s Covington Academy with $120,701. It is the only school to have received more than $100,000. Tuition there runs $5,500, plus fees.
In Coastal Georgia, the state authority ruled that some students from Liberty and Chatham Counties were eligible for the vouchers due to zoned public schools’ low rankings. Hinesville’s First Preparatory Christian Academy, where tuition ranges from $6,500 to $7,900, plus fees, has received the most money among private schools in the coastal counties from the program. 

Vouchers failed for years 
Georgia, unlike many other Republican-led states, has been slow to adopt school vouchers, one of the main educational policies championed by the Trump administration, although proponents of such vouchers have been pushing them for decades. 
Back in the 1950s, the then, all-white Georgia General Assembly set up a vote on what its own supporters called “the segregation amendment,” which allowed the state to give educational money directly to residents instead of providing them with a school. That disappeared by the time of a 1983 rewrite of the state constitution. 
In 2007, voucher supporters succeeded in passing a limited program called Georgia Special Needs Scholarship, which focuses on students needing special education. The state annually publishes data on that program, which is still active. 
Conservatives have long sought to widen access to that program, but opponents from both parties have stood in their way. 
In 2018, Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle’s ambitions for governor were scuttled, in part over a policy that supporters say lets Georgians direct a portion of their tax dollars to private schools of their choice. On a secret recording that a political opponent made public, Cagle called it “bad public policy” but said he endorsed it to prevent the Walton Foundation from spending $3 million on behalf of his GOP rival, Hunter Hill.
“It ain’t about public policy,” Cagle said on the recording. “It’s about (expletive) politics. There’s a group that was getting ready to put $3 million behind Hunter Hill. Mr. Pro-Choice. I mean, Mr. Pro-Charters, Vouchers.”  


Sen. Greg Dolezal applauds the passage of his school voucher bill in 2024. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
In 2023, rural Republicans joined most Democrats in the state House of Representatives to defeat a first draft of the school voucher bill sponsored by state Sen. Greg Dolezal, a Republican whose suburban district north of Atlanta has only one school on the list of poorest performers. The first version of his bill would have covered all Georgia public school students.
Those Republicans who stood against the policy worried that vouchers would drain money from public schools in their rural counties, generally the only local educational option in their areas. Democrats, meanwhile, feared that vouchers would simply be a discount for wealthier families already inclined to send their kids to private school. 
But by 2024, Gov. Brian Kemp put the weight of his office behind the issue and declared it time to support families in making the best choice for their children — whether that is public, private, homeschool, or a charter school. 
Enough Republican holdouts signed on to help give the bill the minimum 91 votes necessary to pass the state House. Then-Democratic state Rep. Mesha Mainor of Atlanta also voted to support it, which later prompted her to switch political parties before her re-election bid. She lost.
How does the program work? 
Eligibility for the voucher program depends on the elementary, middle or high school that students would attend, based on their address. If the performance of any one of those three schools is ranked in the bottom quarter of state performance, the student can apply for funds to transition to private education. But there is  no statewide list of students with all three zones they inhabit, so there is no official estimate of how many students are eligible, either.
About one in four of the first students in the program come from families that earn more than four times the federal poverty income level. That number varies with family size but for a family of four, it means about $129,000. About 52% of the students are Black; most of the rest are white. 
Public schools are ranked by the average of their last two overall scores on the annual College and Career Ready Performance Index — a measure of student progress and mastery of reading, math and science.
Schools’ CCRPI scores can swing up or down by more than 30 points a year on the hundred-point scale. The School of Humanities at Juliette Gordon Low in Savannah went from a 53.2 in 2023 to 69.7 in 2024. That gave it an average score of 61.45, low enough to land in the bottom quarter of schools.
Statewide, the biggest swing came at Atlanta’s M.A. Jones Elementary. Its 2023 CCRPI was 75.7; the next year it scored 40.9.  Atlanta is considering consolidating the school with another.
A school can rise out of the bottom quarter quickly, but once a child is in Georgia Promise, they have priority to stay, regardless of any improvement in their public school. The state is set to update its school rankings by Dec. 1.
For eligibility verification, GESA requires families to submit paperwork showing their own address and the kids’ public school transcript or other official school materials. There’s an exception for rising kindergarteners who don’t have any records with a public school — about 32% off the first cohort.
Grading the schools
Public school performance is measured by hundreds of metrics published online.
The law requires private schools to give voucher recipients a standardized test — either a state one for the student’s grade level or some other national test GESA might approve. And private schools will also need to report on voucher students’ attendance, course completion and graduation rates. 
GESA must make its first report to the legislature and the public on student performance, demographics and parent satisfaction in December 2026, once it has the benefit of a full school year’s worth of data. 
But it is undecided yet whether that report will include school-by-school data. Some private schools will have so few students that detailed reporting could compromise student privacy. A GESA spokesperson said it would be premature to comment on the level of detail to be expected in next year’s report. 
And the law does not specify whether poor rates can lead to the expulsion of a private school or vendor from the program. It gives GESA the power to take “corrective, remedial or preventative actions” to protect its interests, the public interest and student interests. 
A state committee of parents with children in the system is set to adjudicate any family, school or vendor who feels wrongly excluded. However, that committee will not start work until after the close of the September student application period. 
Asked how that committee would be chosen and whether its meetings would be public, the agency spokesperson responded, “It would be premature to comment on committee governance prior to their adopting rules and regulations.”
What’s next
Dolezal, the sponsor of the 2024 law, plans to ask his colleagues to amend the legislation when the Georgia General Assembly convenes again in January. One significant change he is seeking: a requirement that unaccredited private schools provide documentation from accreditation bodies confirming that the institution is making a good faith effort to complete the complex multiyear process.   
Dolezal still hopes that school vouchers could be an option to all 1.7 million Georgia K-12 students. 

That “is where I’m at ideologically and philosophically, and I would like to see Georgia get there,” Dolezal said in an interview earlier this month. “I don’t think we have — I don’t think we get there next year. So I wouldn’t be bringing a bill necessarily for that.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250725SCCPSS-104-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 06:57:47.976764

(Getty Images)I grew up in Meridian, Idaho, back when it was still a rural town. I became a math teacher, then a social worker, and, for the last 20 years, I’ve worked for nonprofit organizations serving Idaho kids and families. I love this state. But after decades in this work, I can tell you plainly: too many of our children are falling through what few safety nets exist. 
In Idaho, we pride ourselves on strong communities. Neighbors step up in times of need, and families rally to create a brighter future for our kids. Yet today, too many children are waiting for something they cannot afford to wait for: mental health care. 
Idaho ranks among the top third of states with adverse childhood experiences. Too many kids live in homes with mental illness, with over 11 percent experiencing anxiety or depression themselves. The entire state is considered a mental health care desert, where existing providers can meet only 25 percent of the current need. The result is a predictable crisis: families struggle to find timely care, and children’s challenges deepen. This affects classrooms, workplaces, and entire communities. 
I’ve seen the reality behind these statistics. They are not abstract. These are our neighbors, our students, our kids’ teammates. Without access to care, their struggles too often go unaddressed, setting off impacts that last a lifetime. 
There is reason for hope. Kids who once felt lost can find their way back with the right support. At Idaho Youth Ranch, I’ve seen students who had withdrawn from school for years re-engage, graduate, and thrive when given access to quality care. These stories prove that change is possible when communities come together. Research shows that every dollar invested in depression care delivers a seven-to-one return. That return is measured in stronger families, safer neighborhoods, healthier communities, and in lives reclaimed. 
That is why three of Idaho’s most trusted nonprofits — the Women’s and Children’s Alliance, Children’s Home Society, and Idaho Youth Ranch — have come together to collaborate as organizations and share what we can all do to support our kids. With nearly 200 years of combined service to Idaho families, we know this is a solvable problem with focus, action, and a united effort. We’ve already identified one urgent goal: recruit and retain the clinical professionals our children need. 
This is not simply about expanding programs. It is about fixing a workforce crisis that has persisted for more than a decade. Unless we do something now, Idaho will remain near the bottom in national rankings for youth mental health access. And the cost of inaction is steep: more children suffering in silence, more families breaking under pressure, and more futures cut short. 
Our collaboration is an Idaho solution to an Idaho problem. What comes next is action. Together, our three nonprofits are launching a united effort to expand access, strengthen systems of care, and lift up the voices of Idaho’s kids. But it will take all of us. Policymakers who advance legislation. Funders who invest in solutions that work. And community members who show up for the kids in their lives. 
This coalition is aiming for real change — and we need everyone at the table. Each of our nonprofits are here as a great resource, so keep an eye out for more from us, especially ways to get involved and help our kids. 
The time to act is now. Idaho’s kids can’t wait.

Lawmakers are proposing state support for a plant that would turn wood debris into aviation fuel. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)Lawmakers from northern and north-central Wisconsin are circulating a bill supporting Johnson Timber Corp. in Hayward to build a processing plant for aviation fuel made from logging debris to establish a processing plant in Wisconsin.
The legislation would reward the company with a $60 million tax credit and access to $150 million in borrowing through Wisconsin’s bonding authority.
Republican lawmakers wrote in a memo circulated Monday seeking cosponsors that the proposal would create 150 jobs and generate $1.2 billion a year in income after three years of operation.
The processing plant in Hayward would be built by Johnson Timber Corp., in partnership with a German company, Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said at a press conference in the state Capitol Monday morning. The German partner is Synthec Fuels, according to Felzkowski’s office.
Wisconsin along with Michigan and Minnesota are all vying for the project, Felzkowski said, “and the state that helps will be the first state” to get the facility and probably the headquarters for the overall processing operation.
She said the process of converting logging waste into aviation fuel was comparable to how corn is grown for and converted into ethanol.
“We will be taking that wood product and turning it into a carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation,” Felzkowski said.
As drafted, the bill would authorize the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. (WEDC) to create a manufacturing zone for aviation biofuel derived from wood matter and to issue up to $60 million in tax credits for a business operating in the zone.
The bill requires the business to source 80% or more of the wood used from Wisconsin and invest at least $1.5 billion in the project.
The bill also provides for the business to borrow up to $150 million for the project using Wisconsin’s tax-free bonding authority.
At the press conference, lawmakers, Sawyer County officials and a timber industry representative billed legislation as a “forestry revitalization” measure.
Paper and pulp plants in Wisconsin Rapids, Park Falls and Duluth, Minnesota, have all gone out of business in the last five years, accounting for about 30% of the pulp produced by Wisconsin’s timber industry, said Henry Sheinebeck, executive director of the Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association.
“We’re growing at a minimum two times more [timber] than we’re harvesting,” Sheinebeck said.  Enabling the timber industry to cut down and make use of more trees would preserve and improve the health of forests in the state, he said.

(Photo by Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator) Louisiana officials are denying reports from over the weekend that immigrant detainees at the state penitentiary in Angola are conducting a hunger strike.
The National Immigration Project and the Southeast Dignity Not Detention Coalition issued a statement Saturday that said 19 people detained at the state prison were four days into a hunger strike. Their demands include medical care, prescription medication, toilet paper, hygiene products and ample clean water. 
The detainees also want access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to address their complaints about conditions at the prison facility.
Earlier this month, Gov. Jeff Landry turned over a section of Louisiana State Penitentiary for ICE to hold what the governor termed as “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.” 
The four-building complex, formerly known as Camp J, was renovated under an emergency declaration from Landry. Once referred to as “The Dungeon,” it was shut down in 2018 after inmates were able to bypass security measures once its cell locks malfunctioned. Dozens of weapons were discovered after its closure, and more than 80 correctional personnel quit, retired or were fired over misconduct allegations.
“Governor Landry declared a so-called ‘state of emergency’ in order to reopen yet another inhumane detention center on Louisiana taxpayers’ dime. But the real emergency is what’s happening inside: people are being denied life-saving medication, and some may die as a result,” the coalition’s news release said.
The Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections responded to the groups’ claims Monday, calling them “misleading.”
Corrections Secretary Gary Wescott said no hunger strikes were reported at what officials now call “Louisiana Lockup.” The department said officials learned Sunday that “17 ICE detainees had refused their meals. This action appears to have been sparked by false narratives in the media that put the idea in the detainees heads.”
Only three out of the 17 people continue to refuse their meals, according to the corrections department’s news release.
State officials called claims about personal hygiene and medical treatment “false.” All of the detainees received “prompt medical attention upon intake and as needed throughout their detention.”
The corrections department also reported there were no plumbing issues inside Louisiana Lockup, although the advocacy group made no such claims. Officials said one inmate intentionally flooded his cell Sunday morning, but the pipe was quickly unclogged.
The statement from the corrections department did not address the groups’ claims about detainees not having access to a law library and religious services, citing ICE requirements under its Performance-Based National Detention Standards.
The organizations have called for the conditions at the facility to be immediately addressed, the release of those detained and no future ICE transfers to Angola.
The first transfer of ICE detainees to Angola included 51 individuals. Landry had said the number would increase to 200 by mid-September, though state officials have not provided an update on the number people being held since first opening the site.
The complex can hold 416 detainees, in addition to the more than 4,000 inmates housed in other sections of the state penitentiary.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state budget writers have another tough year of spending cuts ahead of them amid rising program costs and a slowing economy.
The state could be about $841 million in the hole next year in a budget scenario that accounts for the budget obligations currently in statute and certain transfers requested by Gov. Jared Polis, according to nonpartisan legislative staff. The Legislature’s bipartisan Joint Budget Committee heard the quarterly economic forecast from Legislative Council Staff and the governor’s office on Monday.
At the same time, those state economists expect the state to collect 7.4% more in revenue in the next fiscal year. That will get eaten up by increased Medicaid costs and other programs.
“We’re no strangers to difficult budget decisions here in Colorado,” JBC Chair Sen. Jeff Bridges, an Arapahoe County Democrat, said in a statement. “Years of thoughtful, bipartisan budgeting puts us on solid financial footing, but with the devastating impacts of H.R.1 along with tariffs continuing to create uncertainty and raise prices for Colorado families, more tough budget decisions are most certainly ahead.”

H.R.1 refers to the federal tax cut and spending bill that Congress passed earlier this year. The measure reduced income tax revenue in Colorado and will eventually put massive new administrative pressures on safety net programs like Medicaid and nutrition assistance.
State economists from the Legislature and the governor’s office both estimated a decrease in state general fund revenue in the current fiscal year when compared to a June economic forecast. The Governor’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting revised its estimate down by about $756 million to $17 billion.
Mark Ferrandino, who heads OSPB, told lawmakers that Medicaid cost increases drive “a significant portion of the structural deficit” and that the federal law will make it worse as the state absorbs more cost. He said Medicaid spending has been growing at about 9% over the past year, while growth in the amount the state can spend under the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights has grown at about 4.5%. TABOR is a state constitutional amendment that limits the amount of revenue the state can retain and spend. 
“A growth rate of greater than the entire TABOR amount of growth rate in Medicaid is not something we can sustain, and so we will be coming forward with options, and look forward to working with you on that,” Ferrandino said.
Without a big policy change, Medicaid could take up the whole state budget within 15 years and leave no room for education and other expenses, he said.
“There’s got to be conversations of how we change that — not that we’re going down in funding, but that we’re growing at a slower rate more in line with either general fund growth or with the TABOR spending cap,” he said.
Those soaring Medicaid costs drove lawmakers to cut about $1.2 billion in the budget for the current fiscal year, which began on July 1.
Polis, a Democrat, called lawmakers into a special session in August to raise more tax revenue to soften the blow of H.R.1’s impact. He also ordered midyear spending cuts and dipped into the state’s reserve funds to help fill the gap. Democrats passed a series of bills during the special session to end tax breaks for some businesses and create a tax credit sale scheme. Legislative staff said Monday those policies will bring in about $252 million this fiscal year, $164 million during the next one and $226 million in the 2027-2028 fiscal year.
Both legislative staff and the governor’s team agree that revenue will not fall above the TABOR cap for this fiscal year, eliminating mandated refunds to taxpayers. There could be modest TABOR surpluses in upcoming years.
Economists worry about a near-term recession driven by high household borrowing, a weakening labor market and impacts from tariffs imposed by the federal government. LCS did not put a probability on a recession, but the governor’s office estimates a 50% chance.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) A Shelby County lawmaker who voted in favor of the governor’s education voucher program is questioning the state’s refusal to disclose the number of private-school students using the funds.
“I don’t understand why it’s not available … because it’s my understanding that the private schools do communicate with the public school districts whenever they receive transfers from public to private,” said Republican Rep. Kevin Vaughan of Collierville.
A former member of the Collierville School Board, Vaughan voted against the governor’s first plan in 2019 to provide funds for low-income students in Shelby and Davidson counties to spend on private schools. In a special legislative session this year, he voted for the statewide proposal that is providing $7,300 each for 20,000 students to pay for private school costs.
Some 10,000 of the students come from families with no income limit, and the other 10,000 have an income limit at 300% of federal poverty guidelines, about $173,000 for a family of four.
Democratic state Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville called it “absurd” to withhold information on student enrollment for a new “entitlement” program that drew interest from about 100,000 students already enrolled in private schools.

“It just means we have no idea how this program works or whether it’s effective,” Yarbro said. “Simply getting one out of five of those families to accept an additional $7,000 in their lives is not anything to brag about.” 
Several lawmakers who voted for the bill early this year said they wanted the money to go to low-income, single women to help take their children out of a “failing” school.
Vaughan couched his statement somewhat, saying his constituents who are using the new voucher program “all seem very happy with it.” He wasn’t certain whether those were public school transfers.
The Tennessee Department of Education, which said previously it is not required to release a breakdown on private-school students receiving the money, sent out a statement last week announcing “remarkable results” in the program’s first year.
The release said all 20,000 available seats for the program are “reserved,” after the state received 42,000 applications. It also said students from 86 of the state’s 95 counties received the funds, and that 220 of 241 eligible schools statewide enrolled students.
An Education Department spokesperson did not respond Monday to numerous email questions from the Lookout.
A financial analysis on the bill that passed this year estimated that 66% of the students would be enrolled in private schools already, leading critics of the legislation to call the program a private-school subsidy.
The Department of Education said it reviewed applications in the order they were received, and Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds lauded the launch, saying she’s “thrilled with the success and demand demonstrated in the first year.”
Prior enrollment in a public school isn’t required under the new program as it was with the Education Savings Account program enacted in 2019. But rules for the new private-school voucher program and state Board of Education include a provision specifying priorities for applicants after the first year in case the number of applications exceeds the number of vouchers available.
The department is to revise the application process to meet those requirements, a Department of Education spokesperson told the Lookout in June.











It just means we have no idea how this program works or whether it’s effective. Simply getting one out of five of those families to accept an additional $7,000 in their lives is not anything to brag about.


– Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville 



Legislative Democrats, nearly all of whom opposed the private-school voucher bill, are raising questions about its rollout.
Democrats say they aren’t surprised the state withheld a breakdown on the number of vouchers going to private-school students and those at upper-income levels.
Similarly, they say the state is likely holding back information on enrollment by county because it could show the money is going mainly to the state’s wealthiest counties.
“Fifty percent of the benefit of this program goes to the top 5% of families by income,” Yarbro said. “It’s hard to think of any other program Tennessee has rolled out where that’s the case.”
The program’s total cost is projected to be $1.1 billion in its first year: $146 million for vouchers; $198 million for $2,000 teacher bonuses; $3.3 million to pay districts that lose students; and $2.7 million for administration.
Yarbro believes the cost of the voucher program will increase dramatically because students receiving the funding will need it annually to pay for tuition, as more students apply for the money.

Nonprofits serving North Dakota’s homeless were recently awarded an unprecedented $5 million from the state — a move advocates welcomed, though some cautioned that the need for assistance in their communities is still acute. 
The money supports services including emergency shelters and transitional housing, as well as homelessness prevention programs like rent and utility assistance.
“It’s a positive step in the right direction,” said Michelle Erickson, executive director of the Abused Adult Resource Center in Bismarck, which received two grants totaling $125,000. “But it’s not gonna solve the issue.”
Erickson said that most of the Abused Adult Resource Center’s grant funding will go toward covering operational costs. 
“We operate on very much a shoestring budget,” she said.
The awards, announced in late July by the North Dakota Housing Finance Agency, come from two different programs: the North Dakota Homeless Grant and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Emergency Solutions Grant. 
A total of 18 organizations got $4.2 million from the North Dakota Homeless Grant while seven groups got another $731,980 from the federal Emergency Solutions Grant, according to a memo from the Housing Finance Agency to the North Dakota Industrial Commission.
By comparison, social service organizations last year received a combined $1.8 million from the grants.
Community Action Partnership of North Dakota this year got $2 million from the North Dakota Homeless Grant, the largest award of any recipient. 
The money will be distributed across Community Action Partnership’s partner organizations, which serve all 53 counties in North Dakota. 
About $1.2 million of the award will go to help homeless people find housing services and another $821,000 will be used for homelessness prevention, the Housing Finance Agency’s memo states.
Andrea Olson, executive director of Community Action Partnership of North Dakota, said the organization offers financial support for expenses including rent and utilities, deposits and moving costs, as well as a range of other services like help with housing and job searches, financial planning and more.
The hope is that Community Action Partnership will use the grant to do more in underserved areas including Williston, Dickinson and Devils Lake, said Jennifer Henderson, the Housing Finance Agency’s community housing and grants management director.

The Housing Finance Agency’s awards increased significantly this funding cycle because the North Dakota Homeless Grant recently quadrupled in size.
The Legislature approved $9.85 million for the grant for the 2025-2027 biennium, compared to the $2.5 million set aside for the 2023-2025 budget.
“I really applaud the legislature for doing that,” Olson said. “They heard a lot of testimony, they did a lot of homework and research and realized that there was a need for increased financial support.”
Henderson said another combined $5 million will be awarded from the North Dakota Homeless Grant and the Emergency Solutions Grant next year.
The amount applicants sought from the grants this year still far exceeded the amount of money available. Applicants requested a total of $7.5 million from the North Dakota Homeless Grant and $2.4 million from the Emergency Solutions Grant, according to the Housing Finance Agency.
While the 2025 Legislature set aside about $10 million for the North Dakota Homeless Grant this biennium, it rejected other homelessness-related proposals brought by state agencies and advocates.
This included $1 million for a liaison for students who are homeless or at risk of homelessness  in public schools and another $50,000 to fund a homelessness study. The same policy package, forwarded by the interim Government Services Committee, also proposed putting $200 million into the Housing Incentive Fund to create affordable housing across the state over the next four years. The bill failed in the Senate.
Additionally, the Legislature approved $150,000 for a homelessness liaison to Native communities, though Gov. Kelly Armstrong later line-item vetoed the sum. Armstrong said he objected to the one-time funds and instead prefers comprehensive and sustainable solutions to homelessness.
A total of $25 million will be transferred to the Housing Incentive Fund for affordable housing projects over the 2025-2027 biennium, according to a September memo by Legislative Council. 
Last week, organizations that serve the homeless held their annual resource fair in Bismarck. The event, Project Service Connect, offered free haircuts, food, toiletries, vaccinations and shared information about services in the community.
One attendee, Hunter Short Bear, said he appreciated the opportunity to have a meal and stock up on supplies. He said he wished more state leaders cared about what homeless people go through instead of judging their situation.
Homelessness increases in North Dakota as population, housing costs also rise

State data indicates homelessness has increased in North Dakota over the last few years.
Data from North Dakota’s Homeless Management Information System shows that 3,824 received services for homelessness in 2024, a slight increase from 2023. In 2021, this figure was 3,325, according to the database. Organizations that serve the homeless and those facing housing instability use the system to track the people they help.
The Housing Finance Agency’s 2024 Housing Needs Assessment, published in February 2025, likewise found that demand for housing across North Dakota outpaces the supply. This is especially true among low- and middle-income households, according to the report.
Erickson said she doesn’t expect increases in federal funding for homelessness services anytime soon.
“It’s not gonna go up,” she said. “If anything, we’re gonna lose funding.”
Federal programs created to keep people housed during the COVID-19 pandemic are coming to a close, the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services noted in a March press release.
President Donald Trump’s administration has signaled a desire to roll back support for homeless services, including by proposing major cuts to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s housing programs, though Congress has yet to finalize a budget.

Attendees were not hopeful that general relativity or a mathematical proof might provide the key to reinvigorating a shrinking workforce or to cutting the months-long wait patients face for new appointments. Instead, they referenced a quote often attributed to Einstein: “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” 
Stephen Martin, a physician and UMass Chan Medical School professor, invoked the famous – and likely apocryphal – quote to urge his counterparts to take big swings in their work. 
“The arrangements we have going forward, if they are not different from what we have now, we should expect failure, just as Einstein said many, many years ago,” Martin said at a meeting of the state’s primary care task force earlier this month. “If there’s not a delta in what we eventually come to, we should be wary of any constructive results.” 
Some policymakers and advocates have spent years trying, and failing, to convince legislative leaders the state should force new investments in primary care. Former Gov. Charlie Baker twice filed bills that would have required providers and insurers to boost their spending on primary and behavioral health care. Those provisions never earned a vote in the House or Senate, and Baker reflected shortly before he left office that his effort to overhaul the payment model “freaked everybody out.” 
But as conditions on the ground worsen for patients and burnt-out providers, supporters say they sense growing momentum for a primary care spending goal that would steer more money toward the system’s front lines. 
“I would be surprised if by the end of this legislative session, there was not major primary care legislation that included a primary care spending benchmark,” Wayne Altman, a physician and founder of the Massachusetts Primary Care Alliance for Patients, told CommonWealth Beacon.  
Massachusetts already has a benchmark in place for total health care spending, designed to set a goal for keeping cost growth limited. It’s had limited success: Total health care expenditures per capita increased 8.6 percent in 2023, more than twice the 3.6 percent benchmark. 
Some advocates and lawmakers have been clamoring to add a primary care-specific spending target to state law, a metric that would dictate how much more providers and insurers need to spend or what share of their health care dollars need to go toward primary care. 
While many industry leaders and elected officials tout the value of primary care, only a small fraction of health care dollars actually flow its way. In 2023, the most recent year with state data available, MassHealth spent about $35 per member per month on primary care services, or 7.5 percent of its total health care expenses. The share of spending on primary care was even lower for commercial health plans (6.7 percent) and Medicare Advantage (4.2 percent). 
Significantly more money goes to other areas of spending. In 2021, commercial health plans spent about $2,108 per person per year on hospital outpatient care, such as surgeries and drug infusions, according to Health Policy Commission data. They spent less than one-quarter as much – $500 per person per year – on primary care. 
A hospital oversight law Gov. Maura Healey signed in January created the 25-member task force and assigned it with crafting recommendations on how the state should define and track primary care services, strengthen the workforce pipeline to bring new providers into the field, and set a specific spending target for primary care. 
Asked if the governor would support codifying a primary care spending target, a Healey spokesperson on Monday did not answer directly and said only that the governor “will review the recommendations of the task force.” 
The panel faces a mid-December deadline to report its findings on primary care spending targets. At a September 17 meeting, several members voiced support for the idea of requiring a certain share of health care expenses to go toward primary care. 
HPC Executive Director David Seltz floated one possible approach to tee off debate: setting a target that 15 percent of total medical spending in Massachusetts would be allocated for primary care by 2034, phased in over an eight-year span with an increase of one percentage point per year. 
Seltz said that would increase spending on primary care by a bit more than 10 percent each year. 
The spending target would be only one reform among many others, and Seltz mentioned changes to payment and care delivery systems as important complements. But he called a specific threshold written into statute “a bold message as a state to say, ‘This is what we’re working towards, and we’re all working towards this together.’” 
Both Altman and David Gilchrist, executive chair of primary care for Atrius Health and Reliant Medical Group, countered during the task force discussion that they feel an eight-year ramp is “way too long.” Instead, they suggested more than doubling the share of spending over a four-year period instead. 
“The struggle with primary care is like a tug of war. The Massachusetts state Legislature just put 25 people on our side of the rope to try and help with this tug of war to fix primary care, except we keep losing. Even though there’s 25 more of us on this side of the rope, we’re going backwards,” Altman said. “We don’t have eight years. Our patients don’t have eight years to wait to fix this.” 
But one key detail could fuel a fight ahead: Supporters want to increase the share of spending on primary care without accelerating overall health care spending growth, which is already careening past cost-control targets. 
Growing one slice while keeping the pie about the same size would mean less money for other areas, like specialty care and pharmaceuticals. Those segments of the industry are not pushing back yet – at least not in public – and opposition could arise as the debate unfolds. 
“We haven’t heard anyone really loudly opposing this idea yet, but I think as it builds more momentum, we’ll probably start to hear from more of those players,” said Suzanne Curry, director of policy initiatives at Health Care for All. 
Lora Pellegrini, who leads the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, said insurers would back a primary care spending benchmark if it did not result in overall expense growth. 
“So long as we’re not adding new dollars to the system and we’re working within the benchmark of existing expenditures, the plans are very supportive of enhancing primary care practices and transforming them so that they can really invest in wellness models of care and keeping people out of the hospital and out of the emergency room,” she said. 
Supporters say deploying a greater share of funds to primary care can pay economic dividends in the long term by catching problems early or preventing them altogether, thereby avoiding costlier emergency care. 
While the task force’s recommendations continue to crystallize, there’s no shortage of urgency.  
The HPC issued a stern warning about the outlook for primary care in January with a report – titled “A Dire Diagnosis” – that found an aging workforce, a sluggish pipeline of new physicians entering the field, and long wait times for appointments. 
Valerie Fleishman, chief innovation officer for the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association that represents hospitals and health systems, said the industry group is “especially alarmed by the workforce trends” in that report. 
“Even while Massachusetts outpaces much of the nation in primary care spending and access, the gaps have become too big for too many,” Fleishman said, pointing to research from the Milbank Memorial Fund that identified significant primary care problems across the country. 
“We look forward to seeing how the [task force’s] recommendations can help align our system’s primary care strategy, build up this essential profession, and address the financial limitations that providers are facing,” she added. 
The growing shortage of primary care providers spells major headaches for patients. 
One in four Massachusetts residents surveyed in 2023 reported they were unable to get an appointment with their doctor’s office or clinic as soon as they needed it, according to the HPC. Two in three sought care in the emergency department for a nonemergency condition because they could not get an appointment.  
A CommonWealth Beacon poll published this month found 24% of Bay Staters waited between three weeks and two months to see their primary care provider. Another 20% waited longer than two months.  
Patients in the Boston area face some of the longest waits in the country to book routine check-ups. 
Researchers at AMN Healthcare, an industry staffing company, earlier this year contacted physician offices in 15 major metropolitan areas to schedule new patient appointments and recorded how long someone would need to wait. 
A patient in the Boston area faced an average wait of 69 days when booking a physical with a new provider, by far the longest of all 15 cities surveyed and nearly three times the average from the full sample, which also included New York City, Seattle, and Philadelphia, according to a report published in June. (The average wait in Boston was even longer for some specialty care such as cardiology or obstetrics and gynecology, AMN found.) 
“The primary care crisis is ever-deepening as we’ve been meeting,” Health and Human Services Secretary Kiame Mahaniah noted at the task force meeting. 
Some entities are pursuing new approaches in the meantime. Mass General Brigham and CVS proposed an affiliation in which MGB patients could receive in-network primary care at MinuteClinics operated by the pharmacy giant across the state. 
The HPC voted to subject that proposal – which drew skepticism from some physicians – to a more extensive cost and market impact review, which will analyze its expected impact on health care spending. 
Early in the 2025-2026 legislative session, Healey and Senate President Karen Spilka both signaled interest in supercharging primary care, but both stopped short of supporting a specific primary care spending benchmark. Neither have put forth specific policy recommendations. 
Healey used her State of the Commonwealth address in January to pledge to “shift health care resources to the front lines.” 
“I want a whole army of primary care providers out there, so when you call for an appointment, you’ll get one,” she said. “You’ll get the affordable care you need, where and when you need it.” 
In her own inaugural remarks two weeks before Healey’s, Spilka said she planned to examine “comprehensive health care reform, including taking a close look at primary care delivery.”  
One top Spilka deputy, Sen. Cindy Friedman, is one of Beacon Hill’s biggest proponents of enshrining a primary care spending target. Friedman again filed legislation this term that would gradually impose a requirement for 12 percent of total medical spending to go toward primary care, among a suite of other reforms to payment models and behavioral health coverage. 
In an interview, Friedman said she expects that some kind of primary care legislation is “in the mix” this term, especially as federal funding cuts squeeze the state’s broader health care system. 
“Maybe people will be more attentive because we are going to be losing lots of federal dollars, and we’ve got to take some of the pressure off of our hospitals and our hospital systems,” Friedman, one of the Legislature’s representatives on the primary care task force, said. “People without insurance are going to show up in emergency rooms – which is incredibly expensive, right? – so if we can’t figure out a way to get up front of this problem, get at the front door, which is primary care, then we are going to just exacerbate a very, very bad situation.” 
The outlook in the House is less clear. In January, after Healey’s annual speech, House Speaker Ron Mariano called primary care “an interesting challenge.” 
“I’ve been doing health care since 2006. We’ve had a couple of initiatives to create additional primary care. We’ve put incentives to medical schools, tuition rate for primary care. It’s very difficult to get doctors to enter into a primary care practice,” he said at the time, according to State House News Service. “I’ll listen to what [Healey and Spilka] have to say, but I know there are certain barriers that are hard to get over if you want to create primary care.” 
Past attempts to force an increase in primary care funding have gone nowhere in the Legislature. 
Baker filed bills in 2019 and 2022 that sought to force providers and insurers to boost spending on primary care and behavioral health services. 
His plans took a different approach than the legislation currently pending on Beacon Hill.: Instead of requiring a specific share of total health care spending to go toward primary care, Baker’s bills would have called on insurers to boost primary care spending 30 percent over three years without increasing the state’s overall benchmark for health care cost growth. 
Neither proposal advanced beyond the Health Care Financing Committee, which Friedman has co-chaired since 2019. 
Friedman said policymakers and stakeholders struggled with Baker’s bill to figure out how to track whether additional dollars would flow toward primary care. The task force’s work should help address those issues, she said. 
“The other piece … that makes it really challenging is we don’t want to spend more money. We just want to spend money differently,” she added. “A hospital will say, ‘Hey, yeah, sure, let’s spend more money on primary care, but don’t take it away from filling beds, [or] don’t take it away from the specialists that we have.’” 
Curry, of Health Care for All, recalled that Baker was one of the first to make a concrete push for increased primary care investment. At the time, she said, “there wasn’t really as much of a groundswell from other folks outside of government as there is now.” 
Asked why the idea has been so hard to get over the finish line, Friedman said “the devil’s in the details.” 
“In any change, somebody has less of something when somebody has more of something,” she said. “Different stakeholders see that, and they get anxious. In this environment, where health care is just being attacked so constantly by the federal government, people just are even more anxious. It’s human nature, when you get scared to pull back, to fight or flight, and entities do the same thing, when it really behooves us, what we really should be doing is sitting down together and figuring out how we can do the least harm while we’re taking care of such an important and critical issue for our residents.” 
So what gives backers any confidence the latest advocacy push will be any different? 
Part of it, Altman said, is the existence of the task force, which will put concrete ideas into writing in response to a legislative request. The other key factor is just how bad the situation has gotten since the first bill was filed years ago. 
“The problem is worse, the crisis is deeper than it’s ever been,” he said. “Usually, when there are crises that affect poor people, they tend not to get too much traction. When crises affect people of all socioeconomic strata, they tend to get traction, and this primary care access crisis is affecting everybody.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/thumbnail_IMG_3205.jpg?fit=1024%2C592&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-23 06:57:47.976764

Robert C. Byrd in this undated photo from the 1960s. (West Virginia State Archives)Hulett C. Smith, who served as the governor of West Virginia from 1965 to 1969, is still admired for his progressive policies and significant contributions to the state. In my mind he was the best governor ever to occupy that office, and none that have followed him have even come close to the high standard he established. 
During his tenure, he championed civil rights, environmental protection, modernizing state government and educational reform. Smith’s administration saw the passage of landmark legislation, including the state’s first, comprehensive strip-mining laws and the establishment of the West Virginia Human Rights Commission. His commitment to improving the quality of life for all West Virginians and his forward-thinking approach to governance have left a legacy, making him one of the most respected figures in the state’s political history.  
One of Smith’s greatest accomplishments, if not the greatest, occurred early in his administration.  On March 18, 1965, two months after taking office, he signed Senate Bill 517 into law ending capital punishment in West Virginia. Introduced by Dels. Robert Holliday of Oak Hill and Jesse Barker of Charleston, the bill represented a monumental step forward in progressive thinking. Today, all West Virginians should justifiably be proud that the state is one of only 23 without a death penalty. 
Education was one of his top priorities from the beginning, but addressing environmental problems and developing West Virginia’s recreational potential received much of Smith’s attention throughout his four years in office.
Smith’s high importance on education demonstrated that he kept the faith with what he termed the most important West Virginia citizen — “the 6-year-old child entering the first grade next fall.”  His $32.5 million ($325.69 million today), 3-year education package, dubbed “Decision ‘65,” gave $1,300 dollars in teacher pay raises over the period and provided additional budgetary support for administrative, custodial and secretarial employees and matching funds for Head Start, a federal program designed for preschool children from low-income families. With participation in all 55 counties, West Virginia, under his leadership, could boast of the most complete coverage in the nation at the time.
Perhaps his greatest strides though were in the realm of conservation. The passage of a strong strip mining bill ranks as one of his most monumental achievements.  The bill was soon tested when Department of Natural Resources Director T. R. “Pete” Samsell denied a permit to strip mine across the New River from Grandview State Park near Beckley. Samsell denied the permit based upon the grounds that it would ruin the aesthetic value of the park’s main overlook.  The Supreme Court later upheld his decision.
Another feature of the bill was that it kept an already existing special reclamation fund and imposed a $30 per acre fee to reclaim older, abandoned strip mines. In 1968, his last year in office, 20,000 acres of denuded lands were reclaimed in compliance with the new law. Unfortunately, subsequent administrations have greatly weakened the provisions of the law.
During the prior administration of Gov. Wallace “Wally” Barron, then Department of Natural Resources Director Warden Lane entered into a contract with House of Delegates Speaker Harry Pauley to mine coal underneath Panther State Forest in McDowell County. In doing so, Lane illegally bypassed the statutory authority of the Public Land Corporation and exposed this valuable, state-owned land to the detrimental effects of mining. At one point, there were as many as 120 mine openings throughout the forest; and trout stocking in Panther Creek, which bisected the area, had to be discontinued.  With Smith’s blessing, DNR aggressively pursued the cancellation of the lease in court and was ultimately successful in halting all mining activity. 
During the presidency of John F. Kennedy, West Virginia was awarded $24 million in federal funds to greatly expand its state park system. Despite some initial hiccups, the program was rolling along smoothly at the end of Smith’s term. New state parks were added at Pipestem, Twin Falls and Cannan Valley and additional recreational facilities were constructed at several others.  A strong air pollution control law was enacted during his administration and a stream pollution control measure also passed.
Space doesn’t permit listing all his accomplishments nor does it allow discussion of some mistakes he made — most notably retaining several members of the previous Barron administration who were later indicted. Federal officials made clear, however, that Smith was not implicated nor did any of the illegal activity occur under his watch.  
West Virginia won’t see the likes of him in the governor’s office again. His remarkable four years will never be duplicated given today’s average voter. With some exceptions, since his time in office, the brightest and best educated individuals have continued to leave the state. What remains is an undereducated, ill-informed conservative population that lacks the knowledge and understanding of the key role the government should play in our lives to create positive changes for all.

(Photo by Sarah Ladd).Kentucky doctors say the best way people can navigate confusion about COVID-19 vaccines this fall is to talk to their primary care providers.  
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has narrowed eligibility for the COVID-19 shots more than four years after the vaccines were approved for emergency use, leaving patients and even some providers unclear on who should get the shots. 
On Friday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) narrowly voted down a proposal to require prescriptions for COVID-19 shots. The committee members voted in favor of recommending vaccines for those 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions like cancer, dementia, heart conditions and more. The committee recommended younger people discuss the vaccine with their medical provider in a “shared clinical decision-making” process. 
Infectious disease expert Dr. Mark Burns, an associate professor at the University of Louisville and a medical doctor with UofL Health, said getting a vaccine without meeting those criteria “will not hurt” a person. 
“What should be recommended is to talk with your primary care provider,” Burns said. “Between the patient (and) the primary care provider, they can look at what’s called ‘risk-benefit’ of getting the vaccine, and then the decision can be made between the patient and their provider whether they should have the vaccine or not.”  
Misinformation ‘recipes’ 
Unclear and inconsistent messages about vaccines are “recipes” for more anti-vaccine sentiment, Burns said. 
“Anytime you have inconsistency, there are a lot of issues that can arise,” Burns said. “When there’s nothing in black and white…worst thing, vaccine hesitancy can occur. And also, there could potentially be proliferation of misinformation.” 
Dr. Elizabeth Hawse, the immunization representative for Kentucky’s chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics and a Lexington pediatrician, said she sees misinformation in her patient population about COVID-19 vaccines and other issues.
“Medical misinformation, whether it be vaccines or otherwise — it can be for lots of other things — is just out there,” Hawse said. 
It’s key for people to get “your information from a credible source,” she said. The nuance of science and medicine can’t be adequately explained in a short social media video or post, she said. And, she said, some people may fit into the “high risk” list without realizing it. Any disability that hinders daily life, mood disorders like depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), being considered overweight, physical inactivity and more all qualify a person as “high risk.” 
“We all want to believe our kids are low risk. A lot of people are…shocked that their child is high risk,” Hawse said. “It’s best to go in and just have a conversation (with their doctor) about: ‘what should our family be doing?’” 
For now, vaccines are generally covered by insurance, and many children in Kentucky get theirs covered through the Vaccines for Children program, Hawse said. She is carefully monitoring any changes to that coverage, though, as the COVID-19 vaccine is expensive (she buys doses for around $200 each). 
“If you have three kids and two adults in a family, you’re to $1,000 pretty quickly,” she said. “So the insurances paying for that vaccine is important.”  
Fall and winter spread 
Meanwhile, Hawse has some concern about the spread of the virus this fall and winter. Vaccines don’t enter the body and immediately give a person full protection, she said. 
“It does take a couple of weeks to fully respond to a vaccine,” she said. “You’d like to get that in before it’s cold and we’re all sitting inside together and not really able to do as many outside activities.” 
The school year began last month and Monday marked the first day of fall. COVID-19 hospitalizations and emergency room visits have consistently been higher in the colder months in Kentucky, according to data from the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. 
COVID spreads through droplets that are released in the air while an infected person breathes and can be inhaled or land on someone else, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lending itself to easier spread when people are in tight, indoor spaces. 
“Things that spread in the schools tend to spread to the community, because those children don’t go to school in a vacuum,” Hawse said. “Those children have parents. They have family members.” 
Vaccination is the “first and foremost” way to keep the spread of COVID-19 low going into the fall and winter, Burns said. 
“People can also utilize the public health mitigating measures that we’ve used before, such as hand washing, social distancing and, if you’re at risk, even wearing an N95 mask indoors,” Burns said. “If you’re at risk, those things can certainly help decrease the spread.”

(Photo: NCGA videostream)If the North Carolina justice and mental health systems had a dollar for every time a conservative politician vowed to “get tough on crime,” or attempted to blame a terrible incident on “soft on crime” policies, both might actually have long ago garnered enough funding to fulfill their duties.
As, however, has been repeatedly made clear down through the decades (and as even a casual glance in the present moment confirms), neither system comes close to being adequately resourced.
This sad reality has been brought front and center again in recent days in the aftermath of a horrific murder in Charlotte and the subsequent and familiar call from opportunistic politicians to “crack down” on crime (and make political hay) through the enactment of “tough” new laws.
The brutal and seemingly random killing of Iryna Zarutska (a refugee from Russia’s war on Ukraine) allegedly committed by Decarlos Brown, Jr. with a long criminal record and history of mental health problems — captured in a gruesome Charlotte transit system security video — has spurred leaders at the North Carolina legislature to advance a bill they’re dubbing “Iryna’s Law” that they say will help prevent such incidents.
Under the legislation, which the Senate unveiled and passed Monday, state law governing the pre-trial release of people accused of certain crimes would be made more difficult and powers of magistrates would be altered.
The News & Observer reported that Brown, who had previously served a five-year state prison term for armed robbery, was arrested twice in 2024 and once in January of this year for misusing the 911 system to “ask police to investigate a ‘man-made’ material he said controlled when he ate, walked, and talked.”
Sponsors of the bill say the magistrate in front of whom Brown appeared after his most recent arrest should not have released him because of his previous record. The bill would make such releases more difficult — especially for poor defendants who lack the resources to put up money for bail.
Though not likely to be terribly controversial (or impactful), one obvious downside to making pre-trial release more difficult is that many people accused of crimes are innocent. As journalists Jeffrey Billman and Michael Hewlett explained in a Sept. 21 article in The Assembly, Brown himself was acquitted during a 2024 trial in which he was prosecuted for misusing the 911 system.
But more to the point, of course is the obvious and largely unaddressed fact of Brown’s mental illness. As Billman and Hewlett detailed, Brown’s story is a tragic and sadly familiar one of a person with serious mental health problems that have ebbed and flowed and who bounced in and out of treatment and left his family grasping for solutions.
And despite this fact, and the fact that the state’s jails, prisons, courts and mental health facilities have long been overcrowded and understaffed with grossly underpaid employees, the bill sponsors are proposing no new funding to improve these systems (or, God forbid, strengthening state laws to target the tool used in the overwhelming majority of North Carolina homicides: easy-to-access firearms.)
Instead, as NC Newsline reported, they’re advancing provisions to keep people merely accused of crimes in jail longer, proposing to jumpstart the state’s long dormant death penalty (as if the threat of that could somehow have deterred a person as disturbed as Brown), using the murder to boost the U.S. Senate campaign of Trump minion Michael Whatley with demonstrably false accusations against former Gov. Roy Cooper, and perhaps most disturbingly, invoking a tool from President Donald Trump’s race card playbook.
Just a few days after Zarutska’s killing, state Senate Republican leader Phil Berger and Whatley appeared at a press conference to, among other things, all but blame the murder on Cooper’s establishment of a task force in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd charged with addressing racial inequities in the justice system. Attempting to link the task force’s work to the decision of the magistrate’s action in Brown’s case, Berger made the absurd claim that Zarutska’s murder was the result of “atrocious policies pushed by out of touch politicians and court officials” that prioritize a “perverted vision” of equity and social justice.
In other words, Berger, Whatley and company are adhering to the longstanding GOP strategy on crime (occasionally mimicked by cynical Democrats) that traces back to Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan of stoking fears of suburban and rural white voters by making bogus connections to “soft” (i.e. urban, Black and liberal) officials and policies rather than tackling real solutions like dramatically improving our justice, social safety net and mental health systems. Never mind that, as The Assembly article documents, the murder rates in Berger’s overwhelming white, rural conservative home county of Rockingham (and 30 others) exceed that in Mecklenburg.
The likely results: little meaningful change of any kind — except for a handful of poor criminal defendants who will likely find it harder avail themselves of the constitutional presumption of innocence, and new confirmation that in a state whose official motto is “to be rather than to seem,” when it comes to crime, it’s clearly the top priority of conservative political leaders to do the precise opposite.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/berger-whatley-hall-copy.jpg,,,2025-09-23 05:57:12.155442

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Early voting in Virginia began just last week, but the first wave of ballots already shows Republican-leaning House of Delegates districts pulling ahead of their Democratic counterparts.
Virginia’s early voting season begins Friday, ushering in pivotal election

Of the 20 districts with the highest number of ballots cast so far, 11 are strongly Republican or lean Republican, five are strongly Democratic, and four are competitive, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project.
In total, 35,224 votes had been cast statewide as of Monday, nearly all of them in person. Fewer than 1,000 ballots were cast by mail. And while Virginia does not register voters by party, the early figures could be a sign of stronger Republican enthusiasm heading into a pivotal election year.
Republican leaders said the numbers reflect a deliberate strategy to make early voting a priority, a reversal from 2020 when skepticism of the practice pervaded the party.
“It’s definitely a Republican strategy, and I would say it goes back several years,” said Mark Peake, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia. 
“Actually, Donald Trump did not like early voting in 2020 when we think the Democrats used mail-in ballots to go harvest a lot of votes, but since that time, it’s been widely acknowledged by the RNC, the RPV, and Republicans, in general in Virginia, that we can’t wait. We can’t wait until Election Day and give the Democrats 45 days of early voting, and we just show up on Election Day.”
Peake said the party has made “a concerted effort to get out there,” describing it as a “huge part of RPV strategy to contact less likely voters and to get them motivated, to get them out early and to get all Republican voters out early.” 
The early results, he argued, show that “our strategy is paying off.”
The largest number of early ballots has come from House District 71, a politically competitive stretch of James City and New Kent counties that also includes Williamsburg. 
The district has seen a changing electorate in recent years: Former Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly won the district in 2024 with 51.5%, and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., defeated Republican Hung Cao there last year, 52.3 to 47.5%. But Gov. Glenn Youngkin won the same area in 2021 by nearly eight points, and Republicans have often run strong here.
Del. Amanda Batten, R-James City, is seeking reelection in the district, which she has represented since 2019. Batten chairs the House Republican Caucus and also leads the so-called “Purple Caucus,” an informal group of GOP members from politically vulnerable districts. She previously worked for Republican leaders in the General Assembly.

Her Democratic challenger, Jessica Anderson of Newport News, has a background in education and has raised slightly more campaign money than the incumbent so far: $356,915 to Batten’s $305,863.
Peake said the early voting surge in Batten’s district is “a great sign” for her. 
“I think Amanda’s going to win that seat, we feel very confident about her winning,” he said. “She’s going to win that seat. And then we’re going to win back at least two more to take over the House.”
But political analysts urged caution in reading too much into the early numbers.
“The results from the first day of voting are interesting, albeit it is very much just a snapshot,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg.
“Several things struck me, the biggest was a strong turnout in Republican lean districts, and the lower turnout in Democratic strongholds,” Richards added. “One can read this in several ways — Republicans are getting their base out early to vote, and it is showing up in GOP-led areas. On the other hand, Democrats in GOP strongholds may be extra motivated to get out early to make sure they cast their ballot.”
But Richards also said the data could signal “trouble for the Democrats if their base is not feeling as motivated to vote, or feels that they will win easily, and so voting is not essential.”
Early voting has become a centerpiece of Virginia’s elections since lawmakers expanded access in 2020. The state now allows any registered voter to cast a ballot in person up to 45 days before Election Day without providing a reason. Absentee voting by mail is also widely available.
This year, early voting began on Friday, Sept. 19 and will continue through Nov. 1, two days before Election Day. Voters can also request and return mail-in ballots, though the share of votes cast that way remains relatively small.
Peake credited part of the GOP’s turnout edge to Youngkin’s “Secure the Vote” campaign, launched through an executive order earlier this month. The initiative directs state agencies to encourage participation in early voting while promoting ballot security.
“This also ties in with Gov. Youngkin’s campaign,” Peake said. “He has been advertising that. And the RPV in conjunction with him has been advertising to secure your vote, which is encouraging Republicans to get out and vote from now until Election Day, and it is working.”
Youngkin has said the program is about giving Virginians confidence in the election process. 
“We must ensure that every legal vote is counted and that voters know their voices will be heard,” the governor said in announcing the effort. “Secure the Vote will help give voters the confidence to cast their ballots early, securely, and without hesitation.”
Youngkin signed his order just as the U.S. Department of Justice was confirmed to be sharing state voter roll information with the Department of Homeland Security in a search for noncitizens, as reported by Stateline.
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

His directive instructs the Virginia Department of Elections and its commissioner to cooperate with federal agencies to identify noncitizens on the state’s voter list using tools like the SAVE (Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements) database.
Lamont Bagby, chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, pushed back on the idea that Republicans are running ahead. He said in a phone interview Monday that the available numbers “appear to be incomplete because not everyone has reported,” but emphasized that “every indication that I’m getting is that Democrats have outperformed 2021.” 
Bagby added that what he has seen so far suggests a roughly “2 to 1” margin of Democrats to Republicans in early votes. “I’m thrilled about the excitement I’m seeing when I go to the polls,” he said, while cautioning that “we have a ton of work to do over the next 45 days.”
Democrats have historically leaned on mobilizing voters closer to Election Day, often through labor unions, grassroots networks and get-out-the-vote drives in urban centers. But some strategists worry that the GOP’s embrace of early voting could erode what has traditionally been a Democratic edge in absentee and early ballots.
With more than a month of early voting still ahead, both parties will have opportunities to shape turnout. Republicans see the early surge as vindication of their outreach, while Democrats insist their base will show up in large numbers as the election nears.
For now, analysts say the safest conclusion is that Virginians are taking advantage of their expanded voting options — and that both parties are recalibrating how they approach an election season that increasingly stretches across nearly two months.
“What will be really interesting to see is if the pattern holds over the next six weeks and how early voting in general plays out,” Richards said. “A strong first day might mean a record turnout for an off-off-year election.”

The credits will expire at the end of the year unless Congress renews them.
About 400,000 Virginians purchase health insurance through the state’s exchange, and some of those people qualify for Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, which were established in 2021, extended in 2022 and apply to people that earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. About 100,000 Virginians are expected to lose marketplace coverage, the state exchange’s director said.
Aetna has already pulled out of the marketplace and other insurers’ rates are expected to rise. Those who don’t have employer-provided insurance will renew or shop for new health plans this fall. 
Alexandria resident and cancer survivor Laura Packard, who joined lawmakers on the call Monday, explained how her status as a small business owner means ACA marketplace is how she  keeps her health care covered. It also saved her life when getting treatment to put her cancer in remission. 
Packard noted that she is among those waiting to learn how much their premiums will rise. And while healthy people might choose to forgo health care in the interim if the price is too high, her status as a cancer survivor means she can’t exercise that option. 
“Millions of people are going through this right now,” she said.
Congress has until the end of this month to pass spending legislation and formally fund the government for the 2026 fiscal year and avoid a government shutdown. Democrats are hoping to ensure the tax credits are extended permanently as Republicans present a spectrum of views on the matter. 
With the GOP in control of Congress, addressing the credits could have been handled when passing the reconciliation bill they dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, but it wasn’t included in the measure.
In lieu of cancelling the credits altogether, some Republicans, like U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, are pushing for a one-year extension of the credits. But Kiggans told Politico that she won’t force a government shutdown over the matter.

Democrats introduced a proposal at the start of the year to permanently extend the credits. 
“Obviously, a one year extension is better than nothing,” U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, said on the press call. 
Scott said that Kiggans’ idea is a way to buy political cover ahead of next year’s congressional midterm elections — which will be shaped in part by the controversial health care changes that stem from the OBBBA. 
Those health care-related adjustments include changes to hospital funding mechanisms and Medicaid processes. Hospital systems and health care advocates have emphasized that thousands of people are expected to lose that form of health coverage and place some hospitals in the vulnerable position of reducing services or closures. The strain is expected to eventually pass onto private insurers who will raise rates. 
“It just protects people from the immediate aftermath of inflicting this damage on the American people,” Scott said. “The problem was created by the failure to include (tax credit extensions) in the ‘One, Big Ugly Bill.’”
As rural and Republican-represented districts often include large portions of Medicaid recipients, Democrats have warned throughout the summer that their constituents may be among the hardest hit by negative impacts. 
Six hospitals in Virginia are suspected to be most vulnerable to closures or service cuts while three health clinics in Shenandoah Valley closed recently with their owners, Augusta Health, citing the reconciliation bill as a factor. 
In reframing the OBBBA as the “Working Families Tax Cut Act,” President Donald Trump’s administration announced applications for the Rural Health
Virginia, other states can now tap into $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Fund

Transformation Fund last week. The fund emerged amid debates about the reconciliation bill this summer and is expected to give a boost to rural areas.
“We think we have an opportunity not just to plug a few of the holes, but to transform in a lasting way the rural health care system in this country,” Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Mehmet Oz said last week of the fund, which comprises a $50 billion dollar investment over the next five years. 
If their applications are accepted, states can direct funding towards things like workforce investment or upgrades to information technology, Oz mentioned on that call.
But former Health Resources and Services Administration head Carole Johnson called that fund a “band-aid” for larger problems that was used as a “political solution” to get the reconciliation bill through.
Meanwhile, both parties in Congress have put forth failed continuing resolutions to avoid a government shutdown while they resolve their differences. 
When Democrats on Monday’s call were asked if they were willing to let the government shut down in the weeks ahead, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, reiterated that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. 
“We are not in charge. … We stand ready to work,” she said. “(Republicans) want to say if there’s a shutdown, ‘it’s Democrats’ fault,’ but the blame lays squarely at their feet.”

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)On September 27th, 2024, floodwaters from Hurricane Helene that had already devastated North Carolina rushed through the hills and hollers of Southwest Virginia, uprooting timber, agriculture land, homes and businesses. The impact on the region’s natural resources can still be seen today.
“It was a storm to the level that nobody really alive had ever seen before. I think the last time that there had been a flood, particularly of the New River, of this magnitude was in 1940,” said Kevin Spurlin, an agriculture and natural resource agent with the Virginia Cooperative Extension.
Spurlin serves the Grayson County region that was hit hard by floodwaters and winds that took down trees and carried debris into smaller streams from the New River – which reached 31 feet in some places. The fierce flooding changed the flow of some of the streams in the area, Spurlin said, which impacted how infrastructure like bridges had to be engineered and rebuilt.
“Especially where there were curves or bends in the river, it would just kind of wash straight across and cut a whole new channel that kind of went straight down and almost isolated those curves,” Spurlin said.
Virginia farms were estimated to have $159 million in damage from the storm. Spurlin said many farmers saw forestland they considered their road to retirement washed away or razed in the wind. Some farmers have struggled to even access more remote parts of their land to clear away the debris, a year later.

Extensive recovery efforts have already taken place in some parts of Grayson and surveying the county now, it could be difficult to tell that Helene ravaged the area only a year ago. But some spots remain permanently altered by the floodwaters.
“There’s areas that will never be back the way they were. There might have been 10 to15 feet of stream bank or river bank that’s just gone,” Spurlin said.
Fencing erected as part of voluntary conservation programs used to keep cattle out of waterways incurred some of the worst storm damage in the county. The fences would act as a net for debris coming down the streams but worsened flooding in some spots. Spurlin said new methods are being explored to help prevent that from being an issue in future storms.
“We’re actually looking at exploring the use of virtual fencing, being able to use GPS collars on livestock instead of having a physical structure along a stream bank,” Spurlin said. 
To the west of Grayson County is the town of Damascus,  is a key destination for many hikers and bikers who travel to the region. 
The popular Virginia Creeper Trail that stretches from White Top to Abingdon draws hundreds of bicyclists to Damascus to ride part of the trail. The most popular portion is the ride from White Top to Damascus – that was almost completely washed out in the storm. It is estimated that it will be at least another year before the trail is rebuilt. Route 58 was totally washed out from the Laurel Creek flooding in the town.
“It’s hard to believe on this beautiful afternoon that last year I was fishing, not on the creek behind me, but literally scooping fish off the asphalt of Route 58.” Damascus town manager Chris Bell said.
The Virginia Creeper Trail’s rebuild will cost an estimated $200-300 million and is projected to be completed in October 2026. Companies are bidding now for the chance to helm the project.

Damascus city leaders are using grant funding to create a flood mitigation plan to prevent future  devastation. Bell said there was some work done along the Laurel Creek after a major flood in the 70s but not much was done for other vulnerable points along the water’s edge.
“Looking at bridge design, water flow, when they rebuild the Creeper Trail, when they’re rebuilding the bridge on Orchard Hill Road, those are the things the engineers are considering to allow water to flow and the water needs to flow,” Bell said.
In Damascus, 140 structures were damaged or destroyed – bringing an estimated $12 million in damages to residential properties, businesses and public facilities. Virginia endured an estimated $4 billion in damage and hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of debris were strewn across the region. Three people in Virginia died as a result of the storm, as well as over 250 people in other states.
The flooding in Damascus was, in part, due to debris building up on bridges and trestles that crossed the creeks. Once the weight was too much, the trestle or bridge would break, sending the onslaught of water and debris down stream. Bell said there is work being done to design new trestles that will allow better water flow,since they no longer have to support the weight of trains crossing over them.
The U.S. The Department of Agriculture is working with localities in the region to help restore the waterways that were impacted by the flooding.
“Several waterways near the Town of Damascus suffered major impairments. They ranged from complete waterway blockages due to cobble and woody debris to significant stream bank erosion. Following the storm, NRCS is working with 11 local governments, providing a total of $20 million in assistance through the Emergency Watershed Protection program,” said USDA spokesman Jefferey Blakly.
While Virginia did not see the level of mudslides that drastically changed its mountainsides, which did occur in North Carolina, there are still many changes on the local level that will require ingenuity, from rebuilding bridges to redesigning popular trails. Farmers are continuing repairs to their land and seeking new technology to better prepare for major storms on the horizon.

The company is also welcoming the return of the Amtrak Step-Up Program, offering additional travel options. 
The Long Bridge Project, once completed by 2030, will enable more freight and passenger rail service by separating the lines between Washington, D.C. and Virginia. The current two-track system, widely regarded as a bottleneck, has negatively impacted travel times.
The estimated cost of the entire Long Bridge Project is $2.3 billion.

“The Long Bridge Project is one of the largest railroad construction projects undertaken in the commonwealth in years,” the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority said in a statement to the Mercury. “This new two-track railroad bridge is currently under construction and will increase rail capacity across the Potomac River. Its completion will mean generational changes in passenger rail for Virginians.” 
Beginning in January, the four VRE trains to terminate at Alexandria will be the last four morning trains, two on the Manassas line and two on the Fredericksburg line. Travelers can also transfer to using Metro’s rail service in Alexandria.
No VRE trains will be eliminated, according to the commuter rail service, adding that planners may refine service adjustments over the 2026-2030 project period.
Amtrak Virginia will also implement temporary service changes, expanding its list of combined roundtrips on train and bus in Virginia from five to six. The list of daily round-trip trains includes four trains to Norfolk and Newport News, and two daily express buses to and from Hampton Roads, providing Newport News with an additional connection to Washington, D.C.
Travelers should expect slight changes in departure and arrival times.
VPRA is working to create a new service plan that accommodates current Amtrak Virginia passenger rail service and construction plans for the new Long Bridge “while remaining on time and on budget,” the authority said.
During the construction planning process, Amtrak Virginia is also reinstating its Amtrak Step-Up Program, providing VRE multi-ride ticketholders with more options to travel in and out of Union Station as early as next month. The commuter rail service suspended the program in 2020 due to how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted ridership. 
The Step-Up program will allow VRE 10-trip or monthly ticket holders to select an additional $4 “step-up” ticket through the VRE Mobile app. Riders can then hop on an Amtrak train traveling in the VRE service area instead of on a VRE train, at any time, seven days a week. Within the VRE Mobile app, riders can view the upcoming Amtrak trains and the number of available seats.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)When President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month threatening to withhold federal funding from states and localities that have adopted “cashless bail” policies, he escalated a national fight over how courts decide who should remain behind bars before trial.
The move has already rippled into state capitols. In North Carolina, Republican lawmakers are considering legislation this week that would tighten pretrial release rules after a high-profile fatal stabbing on a commuter train last month.
The bill, which was first introduced in March and altered earlier this week with the title “Iryna’s Law,” would require people to post money bail for certain offenses and would restrict judicial discretion for violent and repeat offenders. The bill also would add a new category of violent offenses that require specific pretrial conditions, such as electronic monitoring. It passed its first committee hearing Monday.
“When we were looking at drafting this bill, a lot of it was looking at the situation that happened in Charlotte,” said state Sen. Danny Britt, a Republican and criminal defense attorney, to WRAL-TV.
In New York, Republican lawmakers are pushing to advance legislation that would further limit pretrial release and allow judges to weigh a defendant’s “dangerousness” in setting conditions. New York ended bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies in 2019, but has since scaled back the law at least three times to allow judges more discretion.
And in Texas — where legislators passed new bail restrictions earlier this summer — voters in November will consider a constitutional amendment banning bail altogether in certain cases for violent offenses such as murder, aggravated assault and indecency with a child.
Trump signed the cashless bail order three days after Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, was killed in a seemingly random stabbing in Charlotte, North Carolina. The suspect, who has a lengthy criminal record, had been released without bond last winter after being charged with misusing the 911 system.
Trump’s order directs U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to identify which jurisdictions have “substantially eliminated cash bail,” though it does not define what that means — leaving its scope and enforcement unclear. Some legal experts say they expect challenges in court, as has happened with previous efforts to tie federal funding to state or local policies.
Trump issued the directive alongside another order aimed at Washington, D.C., where he declared a “crime emergency” and sought to roll back the city’s decades-old bail law. The district did not fully eliminate cash bail when it passed its Bail Reform Act in 1992, but judges are required to consider nonfinancial conditions — such as electronic monitoring, curfews or check-ins — before setting a monetary bond.
Trump’s orders are part of his broader crackdown on crime and public safety, which has also included deploying the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee; Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.
Same charge, different outcomes
Cash bail is a guarantee to show up to court: A defendant pays money and is allowed to go home. At the end of their case, they may get the money back. A judge or magistrate may set the amount based on the severity of the charge and whether the defendant is considered a flight or safety risk.
But someone unable to pay the bail, even after being charged with a low-level misdemeanor, may remain in jail for days, weeks or months. Defendants by law are presumed innocent, but stuck behind bars, they can lose jobs or housing and be unable to care for their family.
Bail clampdowns don’t match what research says about suspects, experts say

Dozens of jurisdictions, including some states, have taken steps to change their bail systems, but there is no single definition of what constitutes “bail reform” or how such changes are applied.
Some states, counties and cities have moved toward fully or nearly eliminating, cash bail. Under these “cashless bail” systems, people may be released before trial without paying money unless a judge determines they pose a public safety risk or are unlikely to return to court. These decisions, experts say, are made intentionally, based on the facts of the case — including the charges involved — rather than on a defendant’s ability to pay.
The policies can affect a large share of the people in the justice system. About 5 million felony cases and 13 million misdemeanor cases are resolved in state courts each year, according to the National Center for State Courts. Since misdemeanors make up the bulk of cases, state and local bail policies can shape outcomes for millions of people charged with lower-level offenses.
Some opponents of cashless bail policies argue that lenient policies may result in the release of defendants who could reoffend or fail to appear. Supporters counter that keeping people in jail simply because they cannot afford bail is unfair and disproportionately affects Black, Latino and low-income defendants.
The ongoing debate has fueled misconceptions, partly because some news coverage repeats unproven claims that cashless bail policies cause upticks in crime.
Trump has frequently drawn that connection himself. In a July post on Truth Social, he wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Supporters of cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, some research suggests that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime. Some research also suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety.
How the bail system works
Washington, D.C., the immediate target of Trump’s executive orders, largely eliminated the use of cash bail in 1992. Judges are required to first consider nonfinancial conditions, such as check-ins or curfews, though cash bail may still be used in serious cases.
Several states also have adopted major changes. Alaska, California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York have passed laws scaling back or fully eliminating cash bail, though some of those laws have since been revised. New Mexico voters in 2016 also overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment to eliminate cash bail.
 In 2023, Illinois became the first state to fully abolish cash bail through the Pretrial Fairness Act, which also guarantees defendants legal representation at pretrial hearings.
 “Those early decisions about someone’s liberty are much more deliberative,” said Don Steman, a professor and co-director of the Center for Criminal Justice at Loyola University Chicago. The center’s team has been evaluating the implementation and impact of the Pretrial Fairness Act. “It’s about, ‘Is this person a threat to public safety or a threat to willful flight?’”
In Houston, a 2019 settlement and consent decree resolved a lawsuit challenging Harris County’s misdemeanor bail practices as unconstitutional, requiring the county to release most people charged with misdemeanors on a personal promise to return to court.
In the latest independent monitoring report, from 2024, observers wrote that the changes “have saved Harris County and residents many millions of dollars, improved the lives of tens of thousands of persons,” and resulted in “no increase in new offenses by persons arrested for misdemeanors.”
In August, just a day after Trump issued his executive order, Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton asked a federal court to vacate the consent decree.
He argued that the order conflicts with a Texas law passed in 2021 and another state bail law that took effect this month. Those laws require people charged with violent crimes in Texas to post cash bail in order to be released from jail, and expand the list of offenses for which defendants must post a cash bond, respectively.
Bail policies and crime
Reports of violent crime nationwide have been decreasing since 2022 both in jurisdictions that have adopted cashless bail and in those that have not, though some communities continue to face higher rates of certain offenses, including homicide.
Pretrial crime accounts for only a small share of overall crime. And experts say most crime data is too unreliable to link changes in crime rates to any single policy.
“It’s just so difficult to say this policy equals this result when crime is going up and down so dramatically as it has over the last decade,” said Jeff Clayton, the executive director of the American Bail Coalition, a bail industry lobbying group.
Even so, some research has provided insight.
In Illinois, which eliminate cash bail entirely in 2023, reported crime across the state fell 11% in the first six months after the law took effect compared with the same period a year earlier, according to data compiled by the Loyola University Chicago’s Center for Criminal Justice. Violent crime dropped 7%, while property crime fell 14%, according to the center’s report.
The declines were seen in both rural counties and in Cook County, though not in every part of the state. Researchers cautioned that the drop in crime cannot be directly tied to the law, but noted in the report that the data shows there was no immediate surge in crime after cash bail ended in the state.
A 2024 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law, found “no statistically significant relationship” between bail policies and crime rates. The report, which is not peer-reviewed, analyzed data from 33 U.S. cities between 2015 and 2021, 22 of which had made changes to their bail systems.
Similarly, a 2023 peer-reviewed research paper published in the American Economic Journal found no evidence in a review of cases in Philadelphia that cash bail improves court appearance rates or reduces crime among people released before trial.
Cash bail policies are under fresh scrutiny

The White House pointed to a 2022 report from the district attorney’s office in Yolo County, California, to support Trump’s claims, the Associated Press reported.
The report examined how a temporary “zero bail” system, put in place statewide during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce crowding in jails, affected recidivism. It found that out of 595 people released between April 2020 and May 2021, about 71% were arrested again, and more than half were rearrested multiple times.
A follow-up review, released in early 2023, compared recidivism over an 18-month period in Yolo County for two groups: 100 people released on bail in 2018-2019 and 100 people released under the zero bail policy in 2020-2021. The tally found higher rearrest rates among the zero-bail group.
Some experts, however, say those district attorney reports have serious limitations. They compared groups of defendants charged with different types of offenses. And the zero bail releases during COVID-19 were emergency measures to ease jail crowding: People were released without conditions and without any risk assessment, unlike under typical cashless bail systems.
What comes next
With his executive orders, Trump has taken the unprecedented step of attempting to condition federal funding on how states and cities handle bail.
Some legal experts say the orders are likely to face challenges in court, though it is not yet clear how or when those challenges will arise. It is also unclear which federal grants could be affected, or how the federal justice department will define cashless bail and determine which jurisdictions are covered.
Some legal experts also say the orders raise two major constitutional issues. First, they conflict with principles of federalism, which give states and local governments broad authority to design their own criminal justice systems, as long as they comply with constitutional requirements. Second, they argue the orders may violate the Tenth Amendment, which says that powers not granted to the federal government are reserved for the states or the people.
Another concern is that the orders may exceed the president’s authority by encroaching on Congress’s spending power. Only Congress can decide how federal money is spent and attach conditions to that funding, and there is no law currently that allows states to lose federal funds because of their bail policies.
“The president doesn’t have the authority to say, ‘I’m going to impose that condition because I think that’s what the law should be,’” said David Gans, the director of the human rights, civil rights and citizenship program at the Constitutional Accountability Center. “The president is kind of trying to take those decisions away from states.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)One of the main ways President Donald Trump’s signature law will save billions in the Medicaid program is through new work requirements. An analysis released Thursday said they will put a big dent in Ohio hospital revenues while increasing the cost of caring for newly uninsured patients.
The analysis, by the Commonwealth Fund, said that across the country, rural hospitals and those that care for a large share of the poor will be hardest hit.
Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act cuts nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending — including about $33 billion in Ohio — over the next 10 years. It also cuts $230 billion in federal food assistance over the same period. 
At the same time, the law gives $1 trillion in tax cuts to the richest 1%. It also balloons the deficit by $3.4 trillion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
One of the biggest ways the Trump law will cut Medicaid spending is through work mandates, which will take effect just after next year’s midterm elections. 
The work requirements are being imposed even though 92% of non-disabled Medicaid recipients under 65 are either working, or couldn’t work due to caregiving responsibilities, or were ill, or were in school.

When work requirements were tried in Arkansas, they didn’t achieve their goal — if it truly was to get able-bodied recipients off of Medicaid and into jobs. 
A quarter of the population subject to the requirement lost coverage, as the state saw “an increase in the percentage of adults who were uninsured, and no significant change in employment—as nearly everyone targeted by the policy met the requirements already or qualified for an exemption,” KFF reported.
As new Medicaid requirements loom, one Ohio recipient warns the complicated system will get worse

That might have happened because Medicaid recipients say they’re already subject to lots of confusing rules, and the Arkansas experiment simply hassled many eligible residents off of the system.
Hardest hit by the work requirement will be the 40 states — including Ohio — that expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act to cover low-income adults, the Commonwealth Fund report said.
“Hospitals in Medicaid expansion states could see operating margins reduced by an average of 11.7 percent to 13.3 percent,” the report said.
Rural hospitals and those with a big share of poor patients are already struggling due to insufficient Medicaid reimbursements, having to care for a high mix of uninsured patients and increasing costs. 
The Commonwealth Fund report said they’ll be particularly hard hit by the new work requirements.
“Between 5.1 million and 5.8 million people could lose their Medicaid coverage and become uninsured as a result of the federal work requirements,” the report said.
 “The 2027 implementation date means that states may not have sufficient time to modify their systems to automatically verify whether people are employed or exempt at the same rates seen previously in Arkansas and New Hampshire. Without this infrastructure, many Medicaid expansion enrollees will be forced to manually verify their community engagement activity or exemption status, increasing the likelihood that eligible people will lose coverage because of the reporting process.”
Ohio’s rural hospitals seem particularly vulnerable. 
The Ohio Hospital Association in May told the legislature that half of Ohio hospitals and 72% of rural hospitals have reported operating losses since 2022.
The Commonwealth Fund report said that under the new Medicaid work requirements, rural hospitals’ operating margins will decline by 28.8% to 32.8%. 
In addition, the state’s safety-net hospitals will lose between 7.4% and 8.4% in Medicaid revenue under the law, the report said.
Ohio Hospital Association praises senators, won’t say if their vote cost hospitals billions

The Ohio Hospital Association has declined to say whether the state’s hospitals will gain or lose money under the provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. It didn’t immediately respond to questions for this story.
The Commonwealth Fund report estimates that the great majority of those who lose Medicaid coverage will become uninsured. 
Emergency rooms are required by law to treat people, regardless of their ability to pay. So as the number of uninsured patients goes up, so does the cost of uncompensated care hospitals have to provide.
Rural hospitals in Ohio will see uncompensated-care costs increase between 19.2% and 21.7%, the report said. 
Safety-net hospitals in the state will see a corresponding increase of 16% to 18.1%, it said.
The organization representing Ohio emergency doctors has warned that the losses in revenue and increased costs will affect all patients. 
Hospitals will have to make cuts elsewhere, resulting in longer wait times, increased prices and decreased services, it said.
The Commonwealth Fund said the effects will radiate into the broader community.
“Alongside impacting hospital and Medicaid enrollees, the work requirement policy also will affect each hospital’s surrounding community, particularly hospitals in poor or rural areas,” it said. 
“The combined effects of Medicaid work requirements on safety net hospitals and community health centers could leave communities with little to no access to primary, specialty, or emergency care, significantly increasing travel times for routine and emergency health needs.”

The median household income has doubled since 1998, hovering at just under $100,000 today. But home prices have jumped at a much faster rate. 
Back in 1998, the median New Hampshire home was 2.8 times more expensive than the median income could afford, according to an analysis by New Hampshire Housing, a state-supported housing organization. Today, that same median home is 5.5 times more expensive.
The result is a yawning gap in affordability that appears to only be increasing. It’s a divide that dominated a discussion on the future of housing hosted by the New Hampshire Business Review Thursday. 
“The gap between what households earn and what homes cost in New Hampshire has never been wider,” said Heather McCann, managing director of engagement, policy, and communications at New Hampshire Housing. 
Economists generally advise households to spend no more than 30% of their gross income on housing. But the prices in New Hampshire make that advice difficult for all but a few in the state to follow.
For instance, in order to afford New Hampshire’s median house price by paying no more than 5% in a down payment and no more than 30% of income a year on a mortgage, a New Hampshire family would need to make $182,000 a year, McCann said. For one person with a full-time job, that averages out to about $88 an hour.
But in reality, the median household in New Hampshire makes $95,628, not $182,000. That means only about 15% of New Hampshire residents could comfortably afford that median home price, according to New Hampshire Housing. 
And while the incomes have steadily risen in the last two decades, they have hardly kept pace with housing costs.
Analysts in New Hampshire have struggled to paint a clear picture about where the New Hampshire housing market is going this year. But one underlying factor has stubbornly persisted: low supply.

Rents are continuing to rise after climbing about 35% in the last five years, McCann noted. And because home prices are still high, many individuals and families are staying in rental units, unable to leave, even while the rents rise, she said.
The climbing prices has become a vicious circle for young people in the state, forcing some to leave, McCann said. But retirees are facing increasingly difficult conditions, too. With Social Security paying an average of $2,000 per month, many older residents are paying for too high a portion of that toward their housing.
Rents tend to crowd out other priorities such as food, transportation, and health care, she said.
New Hampshire’s post-pandemic boom may have slowed, but it has not stopped. In August, the median sales price hit $550,000 in the state. That was a massive increase from just years earlier; the median price was just over $300,000 in 2019. But that increase was not followed by a similar increase in income for Granite Staters.
The price increases have been slowing: While year-to-year growth in the year following the COVID-19 pandemic saw home prices climbing by around 20% a year, this year, they are higher than last year by only about 2%, McCann said. But the current price levels are still far above what most Granite Staters can afford.
One key metric to assess the housing market is the average time homes stay on the market before they are sold. A short time period indicates a continued buying frenzy, which means prices are liable to rise or stay high.
At the current rate, the total number of New Hampshire’s listed homes could be sold in 2½ months. That is nowhere near the six-month timeframe that housing economists say would indicate a healthy market. 
Meanwhile, the houses that are selling more slowly are more likely to be newly constructed. It would take 4.4 months to sell New Hampshire’s inventory of new homes, compared to 1.9 months to sell its inventory of existing homes. That suggests the new homes are more likely to be expensive, McCann said. 
The sales prices bear that out: The median price of a newly constructed home is $750,000. That price has jumped 75% compared to new home prices in 2020, driven by a combination of supply constraints, inflation, and tariffs.

The bottom line, analysts say: While housing supply may be increasing somewhat, it is not doing so quickly enough. And the housing that is being constructed is still out of reach for many buyers. Until the market cools further and prices fall, that dynamic will continue.
“Even as new homes are added to the market, they tend to be larger homes at a higher price point, and they’re just not easing the affordability pressures for the average New Hampshire household,” McCann said.
That dynamic applies to rental housing, too; while affordable housing projects are being built, many new units are luxury units. More supply — even via more expensive housing — can eventually help lower prices overall, but it is slow. In the meantime, those at the lowest end of the income spectrum continue to suffer the most, she said.
“It’s not bringing up enough units for folks to be able to afford. Prices are still going up,” she said.
Efforts toward affordability
This year, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed a slew of bills meant to reduce regulatory hurdles to building housing at the state and local level. 
One, House Bill 577, would expand the rights of homeowners to build accessory dwelling units on their properties and allow for “detached” units. Another, Senate Bill 284, would prevent cities and towns from imposing requirements of more than one parking space per unit for new developments. House Bill 631 requires cities and towns to allow developers to build housing in upper floors of buildings in commercial zones, with some exceptions. And another, Senate Bill 153, would require state agencies such as the Department of Environmental Services to turn around applications for permits for new housing developments within 60 days. 
“This is quite a few very important laws that are definitely going to make a difference, and I’m very much looking forward to seeing how they’re implemented,” Ayotte said at a ceremonial signing ceremony in August. 
Any new construction assisted by the new laws will take time. A more immediate fix for struggling home buyers or renters are vouchers that are targeted to lower incomes, McCann and others say. But those vouchers cover only so many people, and go only so far. If prices increase, their usefulness is diminished.
For developers of affordable housing, the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program has proved helpful, said Greg Chakmakas, a shareholder at the law firm Sheehan Phinney, which is involved in housing development deals. 
That program allows developers of affordable housing to receive federal tax credits to offset upfront construction costs. Developers will sell the credits to investors in exchange for early funding to allow the housing construction to move ahead. In order to qualify for the tax credits, the developers must include and agree to covenants that keep the rent at an affordable level for at least 30 years. 
This year, state lawmakers passed legislation to give developers who receive those federal tax credits additional local state tax relief. Senate Bill 173 mandates that — for local property tax purposes — those properties be assessed at a value of 10% of the annual rental income for 10 years. That law will help lower the annual costs for developers of low-income housing, allowing them to set the rents lower, Chakmakas said. 
The effects of the new legal changes will take time to show. But just as the dynamic of insufficient housing supply has persisted, the unwillingness of some communities to embrace more housing has also continued, analysts note.
“There’s a lot of communities who should be commended for being welcoming to affordable housing, and they’re making a lot of strides on that front,” Chakmakas said. “And then there are other communities who want to put up a moat around their town and see nothing changed. And I think a lot of that is kind of based in fear and misconception.”
Those towns that have allowed affordable housing to be built have been happy in the end, Chakmakas argued. 
McCann said New Hampshire Housing is aware of continuing resistance and has an advocacy team that seeks to convince local leaders and residents that housing could be a boon for their town.
“Affordable homes just aren’t about individual households,” she said. “They’re about the health of an entire community and state. So when people can find housing that they can afford, local businesses can attract and keep workers, schools and services remain strong, older residents can stay in the communities that they helped build.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NH-Housing-stats-1-1024x569.png,,,2025-09-23 05:57:12.155442

(Photo by Aaron Marco for KFF Health News)Every day for nearly 18 years, Alessandra Fabrello has been a medical caregiver for her son, on top of being his mom.
“It is almost impossible to explain what it takes to keep a child alive who should be dead,” said Fabrello, whose son, Ysadore Maklakoff, experienced a rare brain condition called acute necrotizing encephalopathy at 9 months old.
Through North Carolina’s Medicaid program, Maklakoff qualifies for a large slate of medical care in the family’s home in Chapel Hill. Fabrello said she works with staffing agencies to arrange services. She also learned to give the care ordinarily performed by a doctor, skilled nurse, or highly trained therapist because she often can’t get help.
Now, broad cuts to North Carolina Medicaid will make finding and paying for care even more difficult.
Nationwide, states are scrambling to close budget shortfalls and are eyeing Medicaid, generally one of a state’s biggest costs — even before President Donald Trump’s hulking tax-and-spending law decreases federal spending on Medicaid by about $1 trillion over the next decade.
North Carolina and Idaho have already announced plans to cut Medicaid payments to health care providers, including hospitals, doctors, and caregivers.
In Michigan and Pennsylvania — where lawmakers have yet to pass budgets this year — spending on Medicaid is part of those debates. In Washington state, lawmakers approved cuts to the program that will not affect who is eligible, said Hayden Mackley, a spokesperson for the state’s Office of Financial Management.
Medicaid is government health insurance for people with low incomes or disabilities and both state and federal dollars pay for the program.
North Carolina’s Medicaid agency announced it will institute on Oct. 1 a minimum 3% reduction in pay for all providers who treat Medicaid patients. Primary care doctors face an 8% cut and specialty doctors a 10% drop in payments, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
Fabrello said her son’s dentist already called to say the office will not accept Medicaid patients come November. Fabrello fears dental work will become another service her son qualifies for but can’t get because there aren’t enough providers who accept Medicaid coverage.
Occupational and speech therapy, nursing care, and respite care are all difficult or impossible to get, she said. In a good week, her son will get 50 hours of skilled nursing care out of the 112 hours he qualifies for.
“When you say, ‘We’re just cutting provider rates,’ you’re actually cutting access for him for all his needs,” Fabrello said.
Shannon Dowler, former chief medical officer for North Carolina Medicaid, said that reduced payments to dentists and other providers will lower the number of providers in the state’s Medicaid network and result in “an immediate loss of access to care, worse outcomes, and cause higher downstream costs.”
The imminent cuts in North Carolina “don’t have anything to do” with the new federal law that cuts Medicaid funding, Dowler said.
“This is like the layers of the onion,” she said. “We are hurting ourselves in North Carolina way ahead of the game, way before we need to do this.” North Carolina alone is projected to lose about $23 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over the next decade.
More than 3 million North Carolinians are enrolled in Medicaid. Deadlocked state lawmakers agreed to a mini budget in July to continue funding state programs that gave the Medicaid agency $319 million less than it requested. Lawmakers can choose to reinstate funding for Medicaid this fiscal year, Dowler said.
“We all hope it changes,” Dowler said, adding that if it does not, “you’re going to see practices dropping coverage of Medicaid members.”

Each year since at least 2019, North Carolina’s Medicaid agency has asked for more money than it received from the state legislature. A variety of federal resources, including money provided to states during the covid-19 pandemic, helped bridge the gap.
But those funds are gone this year, leaving the agency with a choice: Eliminate some optional parts of the program or force every provider that accepts the public insurance to take a pay cut. The state opted mostly for the latter.
“It’s a difficult moment for North Carolina,” said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid. The cut in the budget is “absolutely the opposite direction of where we really want to go, need to go, have been headed as a state.”
For Anita Case, who leads a small group of health clinics in North Carolina, the cuts make it harder to take care of the “most vulnerable in our community.”
Western North Carolina Community Health Services’ three clinics serve about 15,000 patients in and around Asheville, including many non-English-speaking tourism workers. Case said she will look at staffing, services, and contracts to find places to trim.
Idaho has about 350,000 people enrolled in Medicaid. This month, state leaders there responded to an $80 million state budget shortfall by cutting Medicaid pay rates 4% across the board.
The broad cuts have raised backlash from nursing home operators and patient advocacy groups. Leaders of one nursing home company wrote in a recent op-ed in the Idaho Statesman newspaper that 75% to 100% of the funding at their facilities comes from Medicaid and the cuts will force them to “to reduce staff or accept fewer residents.”
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said the state faced tough choices. It forecasted 19% growth in Medicaid spending this year.

The Idaho Hospital Association’s Toni Lawson said the financial strain will be greatest at about two dozen small hospitals — ones with 25 or fewer beds — that dot the state. Lawson, the organization’s chief advocacy officer, said one hospital leader reported they had less than two days’ cash on hand to make payroll. Others reported 30 days’ cash or less, she said.
“Hopefully, none of them will close,” Lawson said, adding that she expects labor and delivery and behavioral health units, which often lose money, to be the first to go because of this latest state reduction in payments. Several hospitals in mostly rural areas of the state closed their labor and delivery units last year, she said.
Nationwide, Medicaid makes up an average of 19% of a state’s general fund spending, second only to K-12 spending, said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies for the National Association of State Budget Officers.
States generally had strong revenue growth in 2021 and 2022 because of economic growth, which included federal aid to stimulate the economy. Revenue growth has since slowed, and some states have cut income and property taxes.
Meanwhile, spending on Medicaid, housing, education, and disaster response has increased, Sigritz said.
In North Carolina, Fabrello has been unable to work outside of caring for her son. Her savings are almost exhausted, Fabrello said, and she was on the brink of financial ruin until North Carolina began allowing parents to be compensated for caregiving duties. She’s received that income for about a year, she said. Without it, she worried about losing her home.
Now, if the state reductions go through, she faces a salary cut.
“As parents, we are indispensable lifelines to our children, and we are struggling to fight for our own survival on top of it,” Fabrello said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-23 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Does the Connecticut Sun help the local economy? It’s complicated,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/23/connecticut-sun-economic-development-hartford-wnba/,Some want the WNBA's CT Sun to play in Hartford's newly refurbished arena. But the potential economic benefits are unclear.,"For weeks, discussions of sports in Connecticut have largely revolved around one question: Will the Connecticut Sun, the state’s foremost major league team, stay in the state? 
The news last month that the WNBA team, which has been owned by the Mohegan Tribe since 2003, might be sold to Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca for $325 million sparked a flood of concern and an equally intense flurry of activity. 
That concern turned into outrage as the proposed Boston sale and a separate counteroffer, which would keep the team in state but move it to Hartford, were both  ignored by the WNBA as it considers sending the team elsewhere. U.S. Senator, and former state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal went so far as to raise antitrust concerns.
State officials swiftly launched a campaign calling for the Sun to stay in Connecticut and urging residents to sign a petition to help make the case to the league. 
Connecticut officials are also considering a plan that would see the state use pension funds to purchase a minority stake in the Sun in order to keep the team. While the proposal has received support from Gov. Ned Lamont, the possible use of pension funds has drawn criticism from both legislative Republicans and unions; Both argue there are better uses for the money. 
“There needs to be structure and fiscal responsibility and a level of respect for taxpayer money and for public employees’ money,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said at a press conference last week. 
So far everything is still in the air. The WNBA has not made a decision, and much of the public debate is based on potential situations rather than any agreed upon plan. There is no clear timetable for when a decision on the Sun’s fate will be made.  
But the discussion has raised questions, not just around the team’s future, but also around its value to Connecticut and the power of the team as a catalyst for economic development in the state. With two options on the table that could see the Sun playing home games in Hartford, there’s also a question of how much the city and surrounding region would gain. 
It’s a complicated thing to consider, requiring an understanding of the WNBA’s recent growth, as well as how sports and local economies feed off of one another. And much like the broader discussions of the Sun to this point, experts say finding an exact answer is somewhat murky.
The WNBA has exploded in popularity. Team valuations reflect that
One thing that’s clearer is the rise of the WNBA as a major sports league. Professional women’s basketball has come a long way from the early 2000s, when the Mohegan Tribe first purchased the then-Orlando Miracle for just $10 million. 
In recent years, the league has grown considerably, expanding the number of teams and seeing an explosion of popularity as players draw attention on and off the court. That’s spurred increased merchandise sales, higher TV ratings and larger audiences. In 2025, women’s basketball is expected to generate some $1 billion in revenue, up from the $710 million it generated in 2024. 
That success has had a notable impact on the economics of the WNBA, especially around player wages and team valuations. A recent study from Sportico, a digital content company, found that team valuations have increased an average of 180% over the last year. 
“Valuations are incredibly high,” said Ceyda Mumcu, an expert in sports marketing and fan behavior at the University of New Haven. “And there are certainly individuals looking at women’s sports franchises as investment options.”
The Sun has benefited from this growth. As recently as 2022, the team’s attendance was in the top half of the league, averaging roughly 5,712 visitors per game. In 2025, that number soared to an average of roughly 8,653 attendees per game, though the attendance figures now — at the close of a lackluster season — place the Sun closer to the bottom of the league rankings. 
The Sun also successfully sold out TD Garden in Boston, when the team played single games there in 2024 and 2025, adding support to the proposed move to Boston and demonstrating the strength of the regional New England audience for women’s basketball. According to Sportico’s analysis, the team is now worth 18 times what the Mohegan Tribe paid in 2003. And it could sell for nearly twice that.
Sports economists say that some of this success is to be expected. “The WNBA has gone through exactly the same stages of development that the NBA went through,” said David Berri, an economics professor at Southern Utah University and co-author of “Slaying the Trolls! Why the Trolls Are Very, Very Wrong about Women and Sports.”
“It usually takes three or four decades for a professional sports league made up of teams to gain an audience,” Berri added. “That was true of the NBA, that was true of the NFL, that was true of Major League Baseball, and now it’s true of the WNBA.”
Hartford shoots its shot
Even if the league’s growing popularity is part of why its leaders might be interested in moving the Sun to a larger market, supporters of keeping the team in Connecticut say the WNBA’s push is difficult to accept. 
The frustrations are perhaps even more compounded for fans in Hartford, who could benefit from the two proposals to keep the Sun in state — particularly the counteroffer deal backed by former Milwaukee Bucks owner Mike Lasry, which reportedly would include a new practice facility in the area. 
Local economic development experts noted that the city has had a decades-long drought of major league sports team activity in the wake of the Hartford Whalers exit in 1997. Previous efforts to attract an established sports franchise, including a doomed bid for the New England Patriots in 1999, have not worked out.
Dustin Nord, director of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association’s Foundation for Economic Growth and Opportunity, said even now people tell him that “the worst thing to happen to Connecticut was when the Whalers left — and this is 30 years after the fact.”
“I think it’s very clear that these types of decisions have ripple effects well into the future for generations of people,” Nord said.
In August, Nord wrote a blog post supporting the idea of moving the Connecticut Sun to Hartford, arguing that “Connecticut needs sports, and the squads that decide to come here do so with resounding success.” 
In an interview earlier this month, Nord further explained how a major league team could fit into the city, noting that Hartford already supports multiple UConn basketball games and that minor league sports have had an impact.

UConn athletics alone have had some effect in the regional economy. According to its annual athletic impact report for 2022-23, UConn’s sports teams supported 333 jobs in Hartford County and 1,500 jobs throughout the state. Visitor and fan spending as a result of UConn athletics generated $32.3 million in statewide economic output and $8.3 million in Hartford County as the result of “direct, indirect, and induced activities,” the report found.
Connecticut’s reputation as a hot spot for women’s college basketball — a position the state has emphasized as officials make their case to the WNBA — also makes the Sun a good fit in Hartford, Nord argued. 
“We don’t have a pro sports team outside of minor league sports in Hartford or in the area,” he said. “When you compare it to a lot of other places, you could put a professional sports team, a major league, professional sports team, [and access] two and a half million people without any real competition. That’s a pretty compelling case.”
The WNBA discussions are also taking shape as downtown Hartford’s recently renamed PeoplesBank Arena nears the end of a $145 million renovation that will update the facility’s amenities and infrastructure.
Michael Freimuth, executive director of the Capital Regional Development Authority, which is overseeing the renovation effort, said if a deal is reached to bring the Sun to town, the arena will be ready. 
“Generally between late May to early September is a slow period for the arena. The WNBA fits right into that slot,” Freimuth said. “So it’s a bonus activity…it brings in additional events to the building that play out across the downtown neighborhood. It drives business in the hotels. It drives business in the restaurants. It drives business in parking garages.” 
The economic impact of sports isn’t as clear cut 
But while the prospect of moving the Sun to Hartford has drawn the support and cautious optimism of some local development experts — as well as the backing of Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam — a major economic boon to the city isn’t guaranteed. 
In the mid-2010s the city placed a bet on the Hartford Yard Goats baseball team, arguing that the team — and the roughly $60 million the city was spending on constructing a new downtown ballpark — would help spur new development in the area, including a mixed-use project with housing, a supermarket and restaurants.
By the time the park was completed, the city’s portion of the cost had ballooned to more than $70 million, in part due to delays from the initial developers tasked with the project, who later sued after being fired. The park was later finished by a different company.
Dunkin’ Park opened to significant fanfare and accolades in 2017, and has continued to see its attendance grow, with the Yard Goats drawing in hundreds of thousands of attendees last year and winning the title of Minor League Baseball’s 2024 Organization of the Year. Officials have pointed to the ballpark as a source of hope and potential boost for other development initiatives in the city, adding that the increased traffic downtown could encourage more business owners to consider moving in.
But the ballpark project didn’t immediately make money. In 2017 and 2018, the city was losing more than $3 million a year on the facility. Sports economists say this isn’t all that unusual, adding that despite the money poured into them, sports stadiums and related local sports initiatives rarely generate much impact on their own.
When it comes to sports teams and stadiums, “the economic footprint of these things is very, very small, and it’s very, very limited in terms of the calendar,” said Michael Leeds, a sports economist and professor of economics at Temple University. “Imagine yourself building a mall, building a shopping center that is going to be operational one month out of the year.”
“Those economic ripples die down very, very quickly,” he added.
An oft-cited 2007 paper from researchers at Lake Forest College and College of the Holy Cross reached a similar conclusion. In a study looking at the economic impact generated from college home football and men’s basketball games played by the University of Florida and Florida State University on the cities of Gainesville and Tallahassee respectively, researchers found fairly small economic impacts from football and no impact from college basketball. 
“The economic footprint of these things is very, very small, and it’s very, very limited in terms of the calendar.”Michael Leeds, Temple University
“The loud roars inside the stadium are only quiet blips in the economic data,” the researchers argued. 
A more recent comprehensive survey published in 2022 by a trio of researchers from Kennesaw State University, the University of Maryland Baltimore County and West Virginia University noted that research looking at the economic impacts of sports teams has produced “near-universal consensus evidence that sports venues do not generate large positive effects on local economies.” 
This is largely due to the fact that while sporting events generate a burst of spending, when it comes from locals it’s often money that was already going to be spent in the same area on a different non-sporting activity. And when nonlocals come into town for an event, the money they spend — even if significant — is a temporary, often one-time increase.
That isn’t to say there’s no benefit to a sports team at all. The aforementioned research survey acknowledged that the presence of a local sports team in a city “may also generate intangible nonpecuniary amenity benefits that raise the welfare of local residents, even if they are not directly enriched by it.”  
In other words, a sports team may help spur other important factors, like local pride and community engagement, that have a positive effect in an area.  
Even as they tout possible economic benefits, that latter focus is what Connecticut officials have truly emphasized as they continue the fight to keep the Sun. Supporters say the impact of the team is about more than money. 
That’s doubly true in Hartford, which is looking to transform its downtown economy following the pandemic recession. 
“Downtown has to be more of a neighborhood than it has been,” Freimuth said. “It has to have a niche in the region, and its niche is going to be entertainment.” Moving the Sun could be one way to help the city down an entertainment-oriented path as it embarks on that goal. 
But supporters say there’s an even more foundational reason to keep the Sun: The team has woven itself into Connecticut’s state image, becoming a longstanding part of the sports ecosystem at a time when Connecticut and the WNBA needed each other. 
“It hurts our pride a little bit if we lose that,” Nord said of the team. “That’s one less brand that we could point to as a state…this great thing that we can all point to and have a lot of pride in that it’s part of our community.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP22210060142984-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-23 05:57:12.155442

Existing Ohio House bills limiting property tax increases across the board to the rate of inflation and freezing taxes for low-income seniors both got a thumbs up.
Previously vetoed
Budget provisions previously vetoed by DeWine came back with significant tweaks.
State lawmakers wanted to punish school districts for carrying a cash balance greater than 40% of their operating budget year to year.

The working group would put the carry over limit at 100% and apply it to all taxing authorities.
“What’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,” Seitz said. “Some of the worst examples in some people’s minds of large, large carryovers are not from schools. They’re from other special levies and saving for a rainy day that would rival Noah and the ark.”
Similarly, the working group put guardrails on a proposal empowering County Budget Commissions, made up of the local auditor, treasurer, and prosecutor, to roll back levies the commission deems excessive.
DeWine bristled at the idea of county officials negating a measure the voters just approved.
The working group determined there should be a five-year safe harbor for new levies and two years for renewals.
State lawmakers also wanted to restrict the kinds of levies school districts can propose — including the removal of fixed-sum emergency and substitute emergency levies.
The working group wants to allow emergency levies, but only if the auditor has placed the district in fiscal caution, watch, or emergency.
Their proposal would also limit emergency levies to five years without any renewal.
During the discussion, Pickaway County Commissioner Gary Scherer asked: with all those changes, what’s the difference between an emergency levy and ordinary operating levy?
“You can use the word emergency.” Seitz said. “I mean, if it’s truly an emergency, the voters need to know it’s an emergency.”
Still wrestling
The working group is still working through out a handful of ideas, though.
A proposal for presenting levies as a percentage on the ballot is still waiting on draft language.
But the working group spent much more of its time debating interest.
When voters approve a levy, the collection and administration of that money is typically handled by the county. While it’s in the county’s hands, that money earns interest — which the county keeps.
Co-Chair Pat Tiberi doesn’t like that arrangement.
He sits on Delaware County’s Board of Health, and explained they delayed going to voters with a new levy for as long as possible.
When they eventually did, he said they were “100% shocked” to learn that they don’t get the interest on that tax revenue.
“Someone pointed out to us that Pickaway County’s Health Board gets to keep their interest,” he said, “and In Delaware County, the interest the previous year was $350,000. Derived from our levy — just one year. It was in the millions of dollars over the term of the levy.”
If that interest got plowed back into the Health Board he argued, they could’ve put off going to the voters.
Allen County Treasurer Krista Bohn and Warren County Auditor Matt Nolan tried to warn him off.
Nolan praised Tiberi’s intention but worried about how it would work in practice.
“It’s not wrong, I don’t disagree with that at all,” he said. “I’m just worried about the amount of work that it takes.”
Bohn explained that interest revenue is paying for offices like hers to manage their books — not to mention cover the agency’s rent.
If you start splitting the funds up, she added, there’s less opportunity for meaningful returns.
“To keep it completely separate, as you’re asking,” she said, “the cost and the administrative, the staffing, everything to Matt (Nolan)’s point, would increase significantly, and the interest would decrease,” she said.
They were quick to add that when interest rates are low, county officials are effectively subsidizing their agencies
Tiberi pushed back, noting that if some places like Pickaway County already do it, why can’t they be a model?
Scherer, who serves as a Pickaway County Commissioner, chimed in that his county’s arrangement isn’t so much that the agencies get to keep the interest on their levies, as it is that the agencies and the county make a deal to share it.
Scherer promised to share the formula.

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)Amid federal efforts to scale-back clean energy incentives, utility regulators in Maine approved five new renewable energy projects.
On Sept. 16, the Maine Public Utilities Commission approved a four-megawatt hydroelectric facility and four solar projects totaling more than 250 megawatts through a procurement process that prioritized the reuse of contaminated land for economic development. 
In July, the commission asked for proposals to develop energy projects that used eligible renewable resources, which could include solar, wind, hydroelectric and biomass. Priority was given to projects that would be placed on agricultural land contaminated with per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS or forever chemicals.
Although that approach is intended to help communities turn environmental challenges into economic opportunities, Commission Chair Philip Bartlett said it was difficult to assess the benefits of these projects because of the current market and federal policy changes. 
The Inflation Reduction Act offered developers a 30% tax credit into the 2030s for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. However, President Donald Trump signed a policy measure on July 4 that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
States fast-track wind, solar permits and contracts to beat Trump’s deadline

Some states, including Maine, have tried to fast-track clean energy projects in light of that change, but these particular projects were the result of legislation Gov. Janet Mills signed into law in June 2025 that called for expedited procurements for cost-effective renewable energy projects. 
“Assessing benefits based on assumptions and forecasts is particularly challenging at this moment,” Bartlett said. “We’ve seen significant changes in federal policy that will make renewable projects more expensive going forward, and there is increasing uncertainty and potential volatility in our [renewable energy credit], energy, and capacity markets.”
Bartlett added that all three commissioners agreed the new projects have “a reasonably strong chance of achieving benefits and will also provide a hedge against market volatility in the years ahead.”
The leader of the Governor’s Energy Office, which is expected to transition to the cabinet-level Maine Department of Energy Resources this fall, expressed support for the projects selected. . 
“This procurement, expedited by bipartisan legislation, will result in new clean energy generation for Maine that should be able to take advantage of expiring federal tax credits and deliver affordable energy to ratepayers,” Director Dan Burgess said.
In the future, the new Department of Energy Resources will conduct competition procurements for clean energy projects that are approved by the Public Utilities Commission. Mills also signed LD 1868 into law earlier this year to codify the state’s goal of using 100% clean energy by 2040. 
More details about the projects, including the name of the bidder, will be announced in the coming weeks after contracts are finalized, the commission said.

(Sam Bailey/Kansas Reflector)From 2001 to 2011, I worked as a Child Protective Services social worker in Kansas, growing disillusioned with the effect of foster care on families.
In 2013, I was investigated by CPS and the police for child abuse, and their incompetence wrecked my life for six years. I currently work as a therapist in a psychiatric residential treatment facility in Kansas, and many of my clients have been — or currently are — in foster care. My experience on both sides gives me a perspective that few others share, enabling me to be both fair and compassionate in how I view the system.
In our quest to reduce foster care placement, we often overlook a central driver of CPS decision-making: fear.
A wild pendulum swing has long existed in child welfare. Children like Adrian Jones are killed by their parents, and we are justifiably outraged. Lawsuits are filed, CPS is excoriated in the news, and we rage-tweet from our armchairs about who should be fired.
CPS responds by swinging the other way and removing children from their families so they don’t repeat their sin of not removing kids like Adrian. Children are then removed unnecessarily by an overzealous system, and families are needlessly destroyed. Lawsuits are filed, and then we swing back the other way and leave children with abusive families to avoid being punitive.
In the middle of this chaos are the caseworkers. Nobody wants to be the person who makes the wrong decision that results in a child’s death or continued maltreatment. I made mistakes as a CPS worker, and many mistakes were made by the professionals investigating me. When we talk about fixing these mistakes, we talk a lot about oversight. The Legislature considers a bill limiting which children can enter foster care. Oversight committee meetings occur so people can testify about being wronged by the system. Advocate and author Richard Wexler suggests we provide families with high-quality defense teams.
These solutions are important, but they occur after the fact. We don’t often talk about improving the work product of the caseworkers from the outset. When I knocked on doors to investigate families, I didn’t take the task forces, the oversight committees, or the lawyers with me. I went by myself, and it was my initial assessment of the family that shaped everything that came after. The sad reality of the child welfare system is that once the narrative is created by the state, it’s incredibly hard to get officials to reverse course even if families have quality attorneys.
Anybody who has ever tried to fight the system knows this to be true. I am one of those people.
There are core issues in child welfare that cause a lot of problems, and they aren’t racism or poverty. They are confirmation bias, echo chambers and toxic groupthink, a complete lack of critical thinking skills, arrogance and ego, and a refusal to take accountability and make amends.
If caseworkers are trained to overcome these things, then their decision-making will be less fear-based. They’ll keep more families together regardless of race or socioeconomic status because they will think through problems effectively using facts and not feelings, have a greater understanding of human behavior, and find creative solutions not centered in a hyper-reactive, emotional response. This was my experience as a social worker for the state of Kansas for 10 years.
CPS is an entry-level position most often held by recent college graduates and is viewed as a pit stop on your way to something better. We have paired our most vulnerable families with inexperienced caseworkers who don’t quite know what they’re doing yet. We expect caseworkers to make high-stakes decisions within the constraints of difficult societal issues with no room for error. And when they inevitably make mistakes, we just can’t seem to understand where it all went wrong.
Do you want to improve child welfare outcomes? Let’s focus on supporting caseworkers with quality training and worker development. Families benefit the most when caseworkers succeed, and that’s a win for all of us.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)It takes an astonishing lack of awareness about the volatile present tense, amid rising political violence in a country awash in firearms, to propose legislation that would let politicians carry concealed guns into the Ohio Statehouse.
But the Republican co-sponsors of Ohio House Bill 460, state Reps. Thad Claggett of Newark and Bernard Willis of Springfield, seem oblivious to the potential lethal ramifications of mixing explosive politics with easy access to handguns.
Ohio House Bill 460, introduced only a week after the murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, is the latest measure spearheaded by GOP lawmakers in the General Assembly to relax state gun restrictions in public buildings in a nod to gun rights absolutists. 
But promotion of this particular bill, in the red-hot fallout of the Kirk shooting, which included vehement calls on the right for avenging his death with all-out war on the left, was strikingly tone-deaf in a frightening juncture of political unrest made worse by reckless posturing.
In contrast, responsible, bipartisan leadership in the legislature recognized that a tinderbox of violent escalation required immediate deescalation of knee-jerk politics that spark hostile reaction and provoke alarm — like a proposal to arm warring partisans in the state capital with hidden weapons.
 Instead, top legislative officials expressed their common values in the wake of a tragedy.
A joint statement from Republican Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, Republican Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, Democratic Minority House Leader Dani Isaacsohn, and Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio stressed that a free democracy “depends on the open and peaceful exchange of ideas.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But they warned “political violence destroys the bedrock upon which that freedom of expression is built” because when there is fear that political viewpoints “might lead to political violence, we are no longer able to speak our minds or advocate for our priorities.” 
Consider that fear quotient going through the roof during an especially contentious policy fight between polar opposite factions verbally duking it out in a legislative chamber where agitated ideologues have concealed Glocks at the ready as emotions fray.     
Bizarrely, Claggett, the Licking County Republican behind the concealed carry bill for members of the legislature, (as well as statewide elected officials and judges) appeared to suggest more handguns were somehow an antidote to the fraught nature of polarized politics, a necessary protection for elected officials “in places where people can get heated.”
But what happens if some of those heated people with guns lose control in the passion of the moment? What happens when a feud between armed political rivals gets personal in the Statehouse? 
Two other Ohio House Republicans, state Reps. Justin Pizzulli and Adams Mathews, also co-sponsored legislation to loosen Ohio’s concealed carry laws earlier this year. 
They want to allow firearms in some government buildings that have a courtroom.
Ohio bill allowing guns in some government buildings may have significant loophole

Ohio House Bill 68, a reintroduction of a measure from the previous General Assembly, would mostly affect smaller municipalities in Ohio that have multi-use public buildings that may, for example, house city council chambers and city offices as well as a magistrate court. 
Under the proposed bill, a gun owner could bring a concealed weapon into a municipal center with a courtroom except when court is in session. 
You could conceivably go to your local city hall or municipal office to pay a utility bill or get a zoning permit and not know whether the individual next to you has a loaded Smith and Wesson in a shielded holster. 
But what if a judicial proceeding is scheduled in that public building after someone brings a concealed handgun into the facility perhaps posing a threat before court even gavels into business? 
It wouldn’t be the first time an aggrieved litigant plotted an armed confrontation to settle a dispute or silence an accuser.
What if a disgruntled public employee with perceived workplace grievances and a concealed weapon comes to the job prepared to reconcile conflict with violence? 
It has certainly happened in the past with current or former government employees, including the high-profile mass shooting tragedy at the municipal building in Virginia Beach, Va. in 2019.  
Pizzulli insists his “common-sense” legislation “empowers local control and strengthens our concealed carry framework.” 
But what does House Bill 68 do to protect residents at a city council meeting where the presence of intimidating firearms might create a tense atmosphere and potentially push a shouting match into threats of gun violence? 
How does allowing concealed weapons in public buildings — in a state with a permitless concealed carry law that removed important safety measures like comprehensive background checks, fingerprinting, and firearm training requirements — minimize the threat of everyday clashes escalating into deadly situations with potentially dangerous or untrained individuals able to conceal carry in fiery public hearings or heavily trafficked public spaces?
Ultimately, why change gun-free zones in government buildings, with or without courtrooms, if the safety benefits to the people who visit or work in those buildings outweigh the risks of carrying hidden weapons in public venues? 
Nobody, outside of gun rights absolutists and the oblivious politicians they own, is clamoring for more loaded firearms at their local city hall. 
Seriously. Why would anyone deliberately tempt fate in a country reeling from horrific political killings and the pervasive, numbing, uniquely American scourge of daily gun slaughter?

Keedrick Palmer, Director of Youth United, a United Way of the Capital Area program, has a mission that can be summed up in one powerful line: “Preparing next generation’s leaders today.” Motivated by his own experience growing up without strong guidance, Keedrick has been committed to positively shaping young lives since junior high. Now completing his first year leading the Mississippi program, his personal motto, “aspire to inspire,” fuels a passion for empowering students across his home state. Youth United currently operates in schools located in Hinds, Madison, and Rankin County, a two-year commitment for high school juniors who serve as ambassadors through their senior year.

At the center of Youth United and Keedrick Palmer’s approach are three pillars: community service and visible engagement in local neighborhoods; etiquette and professional presence, including in-person behavior and responsible social media use; and college and career preparation, which covers admissions navigation, scholarship searches, ACT guidance, and interview readiness. Recruitment is promoted through the website, social media, and radio. Students apply on their own, complete a formal application, and attend an in-person interview in professional dress, where they are evaluated on punctuality, preparedness, and communication. High school campus advisors serve as logistical partners for passes and school coordination, but the program emphasizes that selection is rooted in student self-advocacy.
Students say the program is already shaping their outlook. Seneca Kelly, a junior at Terry High School, said, “The program influences my passion for advocacy by giving me more opportunities to meet new people and experience stories from others’ points of view. I plan on using these skills by explaining to others that there is more than one way to look at things and sometimes you have to flip the page to see what you are looking for.”

Monthly training takes place through the “Ambassador Bootcamp,” where community leaders, college representatives, legislative trainers, health professionals, and corporate partners offer presentations. Training sessions focus on building public speaking, networking, event planning, advocacy, and collaboration skills. Ambassadors are expected to bring what they learn back to their schools and communities, leading projects that align with United Way’s pillars of Health & Wellness, Education, and Economic Mobility. Students plan and execute engagement, schedule meetings, cultivate partnerships, and run events with minimal adult oversight.
For Ridgeland High School senior Kashvi Sukhadia, the program has changed how she views her community. “Before being a part of it, I often overlooked the challenges of my community, but as I worked on projects, I started to understand how deeply they affect people’s daily lives and why even small problems matter. One project that stood out to me was the Love Yours Health Symposium, a health awareness program that promoted different fields of health. By working on this project, I understood the importance of teamwork while seeing how I could make an impact on people my age by being active and contributing. I not only volunteered but also collaborated with students, guest speakers, and organizations all working side by side. This experience showed me that making an impact on others can be both meaningful to me and helpful to others.”

Community engagement efforts have included United Way Day at the Capitol, where students meet state legislators to raise issues they see locally; mental health symposiums; college and career fairs; school cleanups and “adopt a hallway” initiatives; mentoring and reading at elementary schools; and visits to nursing homes with snacks, crafts, and companionship. Students research local problems, identify resources, and design events as practical solutions.
Clinton High School junior Kerri West said the Ambassadors Program has helped her build essential leadership skills and collaborate with a network of like-minded peers and mentors. “A moment that made me feel proud was coming up with ideas and working with my peers on ways we could help different areas in our community,” she said.

The program measures success in terms of students reached, service events completed, and attendance figures. Other measures include pre- and post-program self-assessments, surveys, and visible growth in confidence and leadership behavior. Participation, punctuality, follow-through on projects, and, when possible, college acceptances and scholarships are also tracked. 
Keedrick acknowledges there are challenges. However, he remains optimistic about the program’s future. Plans include prioritizing fundraising to strengthen school-based events around college, careers, and mental health, and eventually creating an ambassador leadership retreat in Washington, D.C.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/17121512/IMG_2928.jpg,,,2025-09-23 02:56:31.593095

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)After a recent series of audits critical of his executive agencies, Gov. Wes Moore (D) promised during remarks Monday in Randallstown to address the issues, though he asserted that problems at the relevant agencies began before his tenure.
“We believe in accountability, we believe in getting to the bottom of it and we believe in making sure that we have systems that are actually serving the people of our state,” Moore said.
The most recent such audit found that the Maryland Department of Human Services failed to adequately vet homes for foster children, and cited seven homes with registered sex offenders that were also housing foster children as of August 2024. In addition, an individual working for a group foster home had been convicted of a sexual assault of a minor, and another vendor had an employee who had been convictef of murder in 1990, although it could not be dcetermined if that employee had access to children.
The social services audit covered a period from 2020 to 2024, so it included the end of Gov. Larry Hogan’s (R) administration as well as the beginning of Moore’s athough the audit did cite problems that preceded Moore.
Other recent audits have faulted Moore’s administration for “knowingly” overspending on transportation projects with federal grants, potentially forcing the state to pick up the tab, and for costly leases for state office buildings.
“While these problems might have happened before our administration came on board, we are committed to making sure that we are there to address them,” Moore said Monday.

Ellis, a Baltimore resident who announced his bid for governor in January, made it official Monday when he filed his paperwork with the Maryland State Board of Elections in Annapolis. In a statement announcing the filing, Ellis said Owen Silverman Andrews would seek the lieutenant governor’s post as a Green.
Ellis ran for one of three seats in the House of Delegates from District 45 in Baltimore in 2018. He picked up 3,735 votes and finished fifth behind Glenn L. Ross, another Green Party candidate, in a field of eight candidates.
As a third party, the Green party will select its candidate in a meeting next year rather than at the ballot box during the primary election for Democrats and Republicans.
Ellis joins a growing field of announced, filed, and unfiled candidates including Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, Republican John Myrick, and recently minted Republican Ed Hale.

The Maryland Democratic Party is calling on Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan to denounce some social media posts produced by a shadowy group that has spent the last year targeting Gov. Wes Moore.
The demand by state party officials follows an online report in which the executive director of Maryland Democratic Party and a lawmaker criticized some posts produced by NoMoore.org as racist.
“Larry Hogan must make it clear to the people of Maryland whether or not he or his allies are behind this dark money campaign that’s spreading lies about Governor Moore,” said Joe Francaviglia, deputy executive director of the Maryland Democratic Party. “Hogan wants people to believe that he rises above the partisan squabble, well it’s time to prove it.”
The Monday statement is the party’s latest challenge to the anti-Moore group. In February, the party filed a complaint with the Maryland State Board of Elections. The organization registered in August with the Federal Election Commission as a political action committee. It has not declared support for any candidate, but many Democrats believe it is a front for Hogan and a possible 2026 run for governor.

— No Moore (@NoMooreMD) September 2, 2025


The organization — the members of which remain unknown — uses AI-generated content to lampoon Moore. Earlier this month, it produced such a post showing Moore with actor George Clooney, after the release of photos showing Moore and his wife vacationing in Italy reportedly at Clooney’s villa.
Other posts feature Moore in a rainbow clown wig and nose — a theme repeated in a post about Carter Elliott, a Moore spokesperson who has moved to the campaign — or as the Cowardly Lion from “The Wizard of Oz.”
Last week, Maryland Democratic Party Executive Director Karen Darkes and Del. Jeffrie E. Long Jr. (D-Calvert and Prince George’s) denounced the memes in an article published by The Grio, calling the posts racist and “reminiscent of how Black Americans were depicted in minstrel shows.”
A Hogan spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. But in an unsigned statement, a spokesperson for NoMoore.org defended the efforts.
“Maryland Democrats can’t defend Moore’s record on spending and taxes, so they’re screaming ‘racism’ and inventing conspiracies instead. They’ll do anything to distract from his failed leadership,” the organization wrote. “The truth is simple: NoMoore.org is a grassroots movement of Marylanders fed up with a governor who torched a $5.5B surplus, left families paying more for everything, and spends more time chasing the presidency than managing our state.”
The group rejected criticism that the social media posts are racist.
“It’s outrageous that the Maryland Democratic Party has resorted to playing the race card,” the statement said. “This isn’t about race. It’s about results. We deserve fiscal responsibility and leadership that tells the truth. That’s what we’ll continue to focus on.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-23 04:02:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT cannot afford Trump’s cancellation of offshore wind,"Nine CT environmental, labor, faith and business leaders",,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/23/ct-cannot-afford-trumps-cancellation-of-offshore-wind/,President Trump’s stop-work order on the Revolution Wind farm is a senseless and heartless attack on Connecticut workers and businesses.,"Driven by an overreliance on fossil fuels, Connecticut has for years been stuck on a gas-powered roller coaster of high energy bills and polluting energy generation. Our communities are shouldering the burden of poor air quality, high asthma rates, and sky-rocketing, unmanageable bill increases.
As representatives of health, faith, labor, business and environmental groups in Connecticut, we advocate for cleaner, more affordable energy that addresses the gas-reliant root of these problems and moves us toward a sustainable future for our state. Offshore wind is a solution, ready to save local families money, reduce pollution from our energy sources, and create good paying jobs.
Now, we stand united against the efforts of the federal administration to disrupt Connecticut’s first offshore wind project. Despite having secured all required federal and state permits, Revolution Wind was ordered to stop work with no notice or clear rationale. The project is already 80 percent complete. Forty-five constructed wind turbines – capable of harnessing clean, local, affordable energy – now stand idle off our coast.
On the job front, Revolution Wind has already created more than 1,000 good paying local jobs, with hundreds more workers slated to begin work later this year. Construction of offshore wind farms has given new life to the State Pier in New London, and engaged more than 50 Connecticut companies in the project supply chain. Trump’s stop-work order is a senseless and heartless attack on Connecticut workers and businesses.
The strong and constantly blowing wind off our coast is a treasure trove of homegrown energy. Once construction is completed, Revolution Wind will power over 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Prior to the stop work order, the project was anticipated to go online in late 2026. Our power grid operator, ISO-New England, is already expecting offshore wind to supply the power our region needs and has warned of disruptions to grid reliability in the absence of offshore wind power. Derailing the development of Revolution Wind is unnecessary and dangerous.
While natural gas prices are on the rise and expected to increase further, resulting in higher energy bills, offshore wind is a route to affordability. According to a 2024 Sierra Club Report, plugging in 9 GWs of offshore wind by 2030 would save New England an average of $630 million annually on electricity costs, with net savings in some years surpassing $1.3 billion. A July 2025 report by Daymark Energy Advisors determined that if the 3.5 GW of offshore wind currently under development in New England had been operational last winter it would have saved ratepayers $400 million on their bills by offsetting high natural gas prices.
The air we breathe and our climate are also in dire need of the environmental benefits that offshore wind brings. The gas industry has made Connecticut a hub of dirty power, and our communities are left to bear the health and climate harming pollution that comes with it. Just last week, Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) reported that emissions from power plants increased in 2023. With 9 GWs of offshore wind, the New England states could cut 42 percent of annual CO2 emissions from the New England power sector and provide $362 million in annual public health benefits by avoiding 3,700 short tons of NOX emissions, 824 tons of SO2 emissions, and 641 tons of PM2.5 emissions annually.
For all these reasons, we stand behind Attorney General William Tong and Gov. Ned Lamont in fighting this stop work order, and we stand together in defense of offshore wind and the right of Connecticut residents to a sustainable, breathable, and affordable energy future.

First, let’s talk about the Keystone XL Pipeline. President Biden shut it down on his very first day in office. That project would have provided thousands of good-paying jobs, strengthened U.S. energy independence, and delivered a reliable supply of affordable energy to Americans. Instead, Biden caved to environmental extremists and cut off a lifeline that would have stabilized energy markets. So before anyone accuses President Trump of destroying jobs, let’s remember who actually canceled them.

Second, New England’s energy future cannot be built on slogans alone. Wind and solar have their place, but they are intermittent sources — the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow. Pretending otherwise is reckless. That’s why President Trump is right to insist on a balanced, reliable energy mix that includes natural gas, nuclear power, and advanced renewables. Nuclear, in particular, offers clean, carbon-free, always-on electricity. If we’re serious about reducing emissions without sacrificing reliability, nuclear must be part of the conversation.
Third, the idea that offshore wind projects like Revolution Wind are some sort of cure-all ignores their very real detriments:
Skyrocketing costs – Offshore wind is among the most expensive forms of electricity. Ratepayers end up footing the bill through subsidies and higher electric rates.
Taxpayer handouts – Billions of federal and state tax dollars are funneled into wind power projects that cannot stand on their own. Families struggling to pay grocery bills shouldn’t be forced to bankroll failed experiments.
Unreliability – When the wind doesn’t blow, the grid still needs backup from fossil fuels or imports. That means double-paying for both wind and dependable baseload power.
Environmental harm – Large turbines disrupt marine ecosystems and pose risks to fisheries, particularly during construction.
Industrialization of coastlines – Massive turbine farms change the character of coastal communities, spoil viewsheds, and impact tourism.
Short lifespan and decommissioning costs – Offshore turbines last 20–25 years at best, leaving behind expensive removal projects that taxpayers will eventually shoulder.
Battery hazards – To “store” unreliable wind power, enormous lithium battery banks are needed. These are prone to fires that burn so hot they cannot be extinguished with water — endangering first responders and nearby communities.
These aren’t minor issues — they’re why many investors and European countries that went all-in on offshore wind are now facing financial losses and energy instability.
Finally, halting a half-baked offshore wind project is not “destroying jobs.” It’s about protecting taxpayers and ratepayers from being forced into subsidizing projects that are rushed, unreliable, dangerous, and not viable long-term.
President Trump’s energy policy is simple: all-of-the-above, America-first, affordable, and reliable. That means unleashing oil and gas production, finally investing in nuclear, and responsibly developing renewables where they make sense — without killing pipelines, without handcuffing industry, and without driving up costs for working families.
New Englanders deserve real solutions, not green pipe dreams. President Trump understands that. Joe Biden and Ned Lamont do not.

Owned by the Housatonic Railroad Company, this track is called the Maybrook Line, and it is to most residents of the community a mere curio of a bygone age. Yet this forgotten track is not just some useless anachronism, but an opportunity. By reviving it for passenger service and pairing it with smart zoning reforms, we can tackle Connecticut’s housing crisis, ease traffic congestion, and lay the tracks for a more sustainable future.
To understand the potential of the Maybrook Line, we must examine broader challenges facing the Nutmeg State. Connecticut faces a cost-of-living crisis driven by a housing shortage. With demand far outpacing supply, home prices have soared, putting the American Dream out of reach for many residents. Restrictive zoning laws lie at the heart of this crisis, as they artificially limit the supply of housing. The Maybrook Line passes through towns where zoning codes largely restrict housing to single-family homes on large lots. In addition, these local regulations strictly delineate commercial and residential zones. This kind of rigid, top-down government control of land use artificially chokes housing construction and entrenches automobile dependency.
As a result of these zoning rules, daily life in these communities is dictated by the car. This government-enforced automobile dependence leads to clogged roads, poisonous carbon emissions, and overburdened taxpayers, stuck with the bill for endless maintenance projects. Nowhere are the negative results of these planning choices more apparent than I-84 at rush hour.
What if there was another way? What if you could walk from your home to a station, and sip coffee as you glide past the honking steel glacier of I-84? Instead of mind-numbing bumper-to-bumper traffic, you could arrive at work refreshed and return home in a better mood for your family. When we already live with high taxes, pollution, and inconvenience, why not explore alternatives?
This is where the Maybrook Line comes in. While it currently lacks the capacity for passenger service, it forms a link between Metro-North’s Danbury and Waterbury branches. By retrofitting the Maybrook Line for passenger service and constructing new stations along its route, Connecticut could connect three underutilized railroad branches into a wider rail network, improving transportation options for thousands of commuters and daytrippers. However, for the service to be financially self-sustaining, reforms to stimulate transit-oriented development along its route would be essential.
Transit-oriented development refers to community planning that centers access to public transportation. For a revitalized Maybrook Line to financially support its own operation, areas around newly constructed stations could be rezoned for greater density to provide a sufficient ridership base. In this way, Connecticut can tackle its housing shortage while providing alternatives to car-centered development. 
Let’s say a town along the Maybrook route adopts a zoning ordinance for an area within 800 meters of a planned station. Within this zone, new regulations could allow for mixed-use construction, a sensible easing of height and setback restrictions, and reductions in minimum lot and unit sizes. To preserve community character, prohibitions should remain on structures like drive-thrus, industrial sites, and self-storage facilities. These kinds of common-sense zoning adjustments can create vibrant, pedestrian-friendly hubs where the Maybrook Line becomes a natural part of daily life, elevating the community rather than obliterating it.
Local residents may recoil to hear of this proposal. Many are jealously protective of the character of their hometown and see zoning as a means through which they can keep property values high and the riff-raff out. But rezoning around constructed stations wouldn’t just make the Maybrook Line viable for commuters; it would directly benefit existing town residents. Greater density means a lower tax burden for residents, because mixed-use and moderate-density development expands the tax base, spreading costs across more people and businesses.
The CT Department of Transportation should conduct a feasibility study on reactivating passenger service along the Maybrook Line. If the study confirms its viability, the state can begin upgrading the physical infrastructure while collaborating with local communities to address concerns about the project’s impact. Concurrently, zoning councils can enact targeted zoning reforms adjacent to planned stations to support ridership, ensuring that the investment in this rail line delivers substantial returns.
I realize that some may dismiss this as too ambitious, too complicated, too old-fashioned, even. After all, am I really suggesting that Connecticut revive a transportation system that peaked in the late 19th century? Yes, I am. To unlock its future, Connecticut can look to its past. 
By revitalizing forgotten infrastructure and embracing common-sense transit and zoning policies, we can build a state that is more affordable, connected, and sustainable.

Sept. 22, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Members of a new commission set to review and offer long-term solutions to how Nebraska funds its 245 public school districts hope to create more stability and predictability.
But the path there, and a major hurdle evident during the commission’s second meeting Monday and likely to persist, is how fast and deeply the commission should dive into policy writing, if at all.
“To reach clear towards … the policy conversation that would be all-inclusive of state voices, I think there’d be a number of voices missing at the table,” said Liz Standish, an associate superintendent with Lincoln Public Schools.

Standish described the group as “really a TEEOSA study group,” referring to the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunity Support Act that passed in 1990 and spells out how Nebraska distributes state funding for public K-12 schools. A major component of the formula is “equalization aid,” which, in broad strokes, is the sum of 18 “needs” minus six “resources.”
Today, all school districts receive $1,500 for each K-12 student and $900 for 4- or 5-year-old pre-K students in “foundation aid,” a change enacted in 2023 along with a major bump in state funding for special education.
‘Any little bit can help’
Current and former lawmakers told Standish and other school leaders that they recognize the commission will need to carefully “thread the needle” on how to offer guidance to the Legislature without being able to pass policy on its own.
“Any little bit can help,” said State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, vice chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee and the lawmaker who led the bill to create the commission this spring.
Work begins to review how Nebraska funds its 245 K-12 school districts, with possible tweaks

Former State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area agreed with Hughes that the Legislature is “starved” for information, partly due to term limits and time constraints on how much lawmakers can delve into specific issues. Linehan served on the Education Committee and chaired the Revenue Committee for six of her eight years in office before being term-limited this January.
State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln said the Legislature is welcome to take or leave any of the group’s recommendations. He said he doesn’t think anyone is “under the illusion that this commission is able to create statutes on its own.”
On including more voices at the table, Bostar said that’s the purpose of the legislative process.
“I think I lean more toward the side of venturing into the space of what this commission would imagine its preferred policy solutions to be, understanding that this commission cannot create those policies,” Bostar said Monday.
A preliminary path forward
While the commission took no specific votes on goals or next steps, Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher, the commission chair, offered a preliminary guide for a way forward.
Maher’s draft document on goals for the group divide the commission’s work into three categories — short-term, to be done by the time the first report is due to the Legislature by Dec. 1; mid-term, to be done in 2026 before the second report on Nov. 1, 2026; and long-term, for annual reports due each November after.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward. Sept. 22, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Under Hughes’ law, the new commission has no expiration date.
Maher’s short-term plan, which he built off of the commissioners’ stated goals from the group’s August meeting, would dedicate the next couple of months to “Nebraska school funding facts,” such as:

Identifying the percentages of local, state and federal funding for the years 2022-23 compared to now.
Identifying a group of school districts to compare in funding, such as funding distribution percentages and other factors, including property tax rates.
Reviewing other states’ school funding models and formulas.
Establishing a state funding distribution target.

According to data the Nebraska Department of Education shared Monday, public schools accounted for about $5.3 billion in estimated spending in the 2024-25 fiscal year. 
Changes in the timing of when state-funded tax credits arrive that offset local school property taxes — which now directly offset property tax bills rather than requiring Nebraskans to file for optional income tax credits later on — has shifted the percentage of local school spending covered by the state.
The state now carries the majority of school funding, at 52.6%, while local and county spending on schools has fallen to about 38%, a reversal from the previous five years, when local property taxes accounted for the majority of revenue.
Early goals
Setting a target for what the balance should be between state and local funding is one of the commission’s earliest goals, but some commissioners said they hope to go further than Maher’s preliminary proposal.

Hughes, for example, hopes to dive more into property tax rates in a long-term goal of bringing school tax levies down and closer together. Linehan said she wants to know more, such as which districts would be “winners” and “losers.”
The Nebraska Department of Revenue has collected local valuation changes for next year, but the Education Department won’t have school property tax rates collected until next month. 
Sarah Scott, Nebraska’s property tax administrator, said it might be possible to marry the valuations with property tax rates early for commissioners to review.
Former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul, a former State Board of Education member, wants to look into option enrollment — the program that allows a family to apply to enroll their student into a school district they don’t reside in, which may lead to net revenue for a receiving school district. State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil said he hopes to look more into valuations and how much of the valuations are factored into property taxes.
Millard Public Schools Superintendent John Schwartz, vice chair of the commission, said the commission’s fact-finding mission is vital for framing future debates. He thanked Maher for summarizing the commission’s “more granular objectives” with a target to work toward.
“I think those dispositional characteristics are things that we’re really striving for,” Schwartz said.
‘Need some goals’
The Nebraska School Financing Review Commission includes 18 members, the majority are school administrators and current or former state legislators. This was the first meeting with all seats filled. Gov. Jim Pillen recently appointed a teacher: Shawna Koger of Arlington Public Schools.

Of the membership, all but four are Pillen appointees.  Three current lawmakers appointed by the Legislature are nonvoting members. Maher serves because of his role as the education commissioner.
The commission plans to next meet at 8 a.m. on Oct. 31 at the Education Department in Lincoln.
Maher told the Nebraska Examiner that he hopes to have another meeting a week before Thanksgiving in November. Either way, he said the commission will meet its Dec. 1 deadline for a first set of recommendations.
“I think we’re going to need some goals to shoot toward as a commission,” Maher told the commission. “Otherwise, I think we’re going to do a lot of talking and maybe not get anywhere.”



School Financing Review Commission long-term goals
Members of the new Nebraska School Financing Review Commission outlined these long-term ambitions during an initial Aug. 12 meeting, as summarized by Education Commissioner Brian Maher:

Increase the stability, predictability and sustainability of year-to-year school funding.
Prevent the structure of school finance from eroding other intended property tax relief.
Increase confidence and trust in Nebraska school funding and related policymaking, with a collaborative process to manage the existing model predictably and annually with data.
Create a basis for ongoing management of the school aid funding formula to address the changing needs of students and schools and evolving policy objectives.
Increase the balance of sustainable funding from the state to schools to lower property taxes.
Strive to find balance in the funding formula between “simple enough” to understand by many to “complex enough” to meet diverse needs.
Strive to bring school property tax levies closer together.
Use the School Financing Review Commission to regularly provide factual information on the status of school finance.

The Trump administration has proposed closing it in the coming years. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)State, local and federal Democrats continued to push back Monday against a Trump administration proposal to shutter the Beltsville Agriculture Research Center and scatter its staff across the country, saying the center should stay at its current Prince George’s County home.
The lawmakers gathered Monday at the Beltsville center to highlight some of the research conducted there and argue that the current location is ideal for such studies.
“We call Maryland ‘America in Miniature.’ This BARC Ag facility is able to test many different types of crops on many different kinds of climate conditions,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told reporters Monday. “They’ve been doing studies, some have gone on for over 10 years, on the land here at BARC. You can’t just uproot that and take it to another part of the country.”
The news conference is the latest attempt by Maryland Democrats to counter a U.S. Department of Agriculture “reorganization” plan that the administration says will “achieve improved effectiveness and accountability, enhanced services, reduced bureaucracy and cost savings for the American people.”
Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a memo announcing the changes in July that several USDA agencies in and around Washington, D.C., would be moved to other parts of the country to be “located closer to the people it serves while achieving savings to the American taxpayer.”

Part of that plan calls for closing the 6,500-acre Beltsville center. The plan also calls for moving thousands of the USDA workers based in and around Washington to one of five regional hubs to reduce salary costs. Closing the Beltsville center would occur “over multiple years to avoid disruption of critical USDA research activities,” according to Rollins’ memo.
But Van Hollen and his colleagues — Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Reps. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), Glenn Ivey (D-4th) and Jamie Raskin (D-8th) — argued Monday that the loss of the Beltsville center could disrupt decades of research and even be more costly in the long run. Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th) also attended but had to leave before the news conference.
The press conference was held outside the USDAs National Agricultural Library, across U.S. Route 1 from the Beltsville research center. After a tour of the research center, the lawmakers acknowledged that 115-year-old facility needs repairs, but insisted that moving locations would be more expensive than investing in the center where it is.
Ivey called the USDA’s plan “terrible stewardship of the American tax dollar” and said moving the facility would waste millions on recent upgrades and repairs that have already been made to the Beltsville facility.
“There’s been a multimillion-dollar investment in this space, and if you just pick it up and move it, you’re squandering that money,” Ivey said. “It’s expensive to move, and you’d have to build new facilities wherever you go. And you’re going to lose the human capital.”
Also in attendance were Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D), County Councilmember Thomas E. Dernoga (D), state Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George’s) and Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel).
Van Hollen highlighted the many agricultural research breakthroughs that have come from the Beltsville facility, from crop disease resistance to a recent development on the causes of bee colony collapse.
“Grass seed that you use in your backyard. The mosquito repellent you put on when you go for a hike. Roma tomatoes. Turkeys that you eat at Thanksgiving,” Van Hollen said. “Those are all brought to you by research here at BARC – and that’s just here on the consumer side. For farmers, it is especially important that BARC continue to do it’s work.”
Alsobrooks said that moving the facility and its workers would be illegal without congressional approval and would likely disrupt long-term research programs.
Maryland officials vow to fight Trump plans to relocate FBI to another site in D.C.

“Decades upon decades of important research literally would not survive the move and would be lost,” she said.
Losing the Beltsville facility would be just the latest blow to Prince George’s County by the federal government.
In January, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing announced that it was canceling plans to move its printing operations from its current plant in Washington to a new facility planned for ag center property in Beltsville, a move that would have brought about 1,400 jobs to the county. And in July, the FBI reversed more than a decade of study and planning and said it would not be building its new headquarters in Greenbelt, but would remain downtown instead in new quarters in the Ronald Reagan Building.
Hoyer argued that keeping BARC in Maryland is “not about politics,” but rather about “rationally organizing our agricultural community so that they can succeed and be the best at what they do in the world.”
“It’s a big campus – it is mostly ground and trees and vegetables and livestock,” he said. “There are buildings here as well, some that need repair – but what doesn’t need repair are the people who work here. It’s not the brick and mortar. It’s the people, the extraordinary talent that has been aggregated here.”

(Naomi Delkamiller/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — A voting advocacy group has sued to block Nebraska’s secretary of state from sharing voter registration data with the U.S. Department of Justice. 
The lawsuit from Common Cause Nebraska seeks an injunction to stop Secretary of State Bob Evnen from providing data to the DOJ. Federal officials have asked states for names, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of voters’ Social Security numbers, saying they want the information to ensure accurate voter registration rolls. 
Common Cause asked a Lancaster County District Court to find that the DOJ request violates Nebraska law protecting data privacy. It aims to prohibit the Secretary of State from providing the voter data to the DOJ or to limit the types of data shared. 
Some GOP states have declined or are pushing back against federal efforts to gather the data over privacy concerns. Critics have questioned the safety of letting any administration consolidate such voter data in one place. The federal government has sued two Democratic-run states for the data, the first legal challenge the department has brought against states to obtain the registration records.

The Justice Department sent a letter to Nebraska’s secretary of state Sept. 8 with a Sept. 22 deadline to provide the data. The Secretary of State’s Office told the Examiner it hasn’t provided the data to the DOJ because of the lawsuit. 
“This push for voter data is part of the Trump administration’s broader playbook—using government power to target communities instead of protecting them,” said Omar Noureldin, Common Cause’s senior vice president for policy and litigation.
The Trump administration made a similar request to then-Secretary of State John Gale in 2017. Gale declined to turn over Nebraska’s full voter information because it wouldn’t comply with state law, and he had concerns about data privacy. A public and more limited version of Nebraska’s voter file, including names and addresses, is available for a fee. Registered voters can request to withhold their phone numbers and email addresses.
The DOJ last month said it plans to seek voting and election information from all 50 states. 
The latest DOJ move is another issue for Evnen to balance as he seeks reelection in 2026. He is trying to defend the state’s elections that his office administers and respond to the concerns of some Republicans and President Donald Trump over election integrity since the 2020 presidential election, a national framing that some election experts have warned could undermine public trust in elections.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process underway this week is already heating up, with Democrats and some concerned Utahns frustrated that legislators still aren’t following the spirit of a voter-approved law that created an independent redistricting process. 
The Utah Legislature’s newly convened Legislative Redistricting Committee held its first public hearing on Monday to consider a slate of five proposed congressional maps to choose from to submit to 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson by their deadline of Oct. 6. 
Gibson will ultimately decide by Nov. 10 which new map — whether it’s drawn by lawmakers or the plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit — will replace the 2021 boundaries that she voided in a ruling last month, deeming them a byproduct of an unconstitutional process. 
All of the maps being considered would be relatively more competitive for Democrats when compared to the 2021 map that’s since been tossed out by the courts, but most of them would continue to mix rural and urban communities. Two, however, would take more of a “doughnut hole” approach and carve districts concentrated around the state’s urban core in and around Salt Lake City. 
The Legislative Redistricting Committee did not take action on any map — not expected to publish its preferred choice until Thursday, ahead of a special session expected on Oct. 6 for the full Legislature to take a vote on the map. The committee is scheduled to meet again Wednesday at 11 a.m. to continue weighing next steps.

One of the committee’s co-chairs, Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, emphasized in the first minutes of Monday’s hearing that lawmakers were meeting mid-decade due to court orders — “under protest” because the Legislature’s Republican supermajority disagreed with the judge’s ruling tossing out the 2021 map. 
“We want to make sure that you understand that we are doing this in compliance with the court orders, and under protest,” Sandall said. “But we want to make sure we maintain our constitutional duty to produce a map, so we are going to proceed in that direction.” 
Several Utahns who spoke during the meeting’s public comment period bristled at Sandall’s “under protest” comment.
“Prop 4 is the will of the people. … This is what we want. We want good faith representation and a good faith effort,” said Magdeleine Bradford-Butcher, of Provo. “We are here to do something that is fair for all citizens. Nobody should be protesting that.”

In addition to reviewing those proposed maps, lawmakers also weighed a bill that would again impose changes to Better Boundaries’ 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 that sought to create an independent redistricting commission. 
The courts have since determined that Proposition 4, as passed by a slim majority in 2018, is now law. But a draft bill, proposed by Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, would add a new requirement into Proposition 4’s redistricting criteria that would specify that future maps would need to pass a specific statistical “partisan bias test” that ensures “partisan symmetry.” 
Proposition 4’s language already says maps “may not divide districts in a manner that purposefully or unduly favors or disfavors any incumbent elected official, candidate or prospective candidate for elective office or any party.” It also already requires the Legislature and the Independent Redistricting Commission to use “the best available data and scientific and statistical methods, including measures of partisan symmetry” when drawing maps that conform to Proposition 4’s criteria.

Brammer’s bill would specify, however, that a map that is “symmetrical under the partisan bias test” would not “unduly favor or disfavor.” And it would require any judge’s review of a new congressional map, including Gibson’s, to use the “partisan bias test” as the only tool to determine a map’s fairness. 
The “partisan bias test” defined in Brammer’s bill would use the average margin of past statewide elections (for president, governor, attorney general, treasurer and auditor) to calculate a formula for “partisan symmetry.” A map would pass the test as long as the same statewide vote percentage would translate to the same percentage of seats for either party. The test, would set an acceptable margin based on the average of past statewide elections, which typically have a wide spread between GOP and Democratic voters — with Republicans consistently winning by more than 20 points in statewide races. 
Critics, however, including Democrats on the Legislative Redistricting Committee, argued that requiring the “partisan bias test” as defined in Brammer’s bill would be problematic for a state like Utah that has only four congressional districts and is dominated statewide by the sheer number of registered Republicans compared to Democrats.  
“You’re now trying to codify partisan bias as the only test you use, and that to me is a gigantic red flag,” Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, said. “We should have more tests and have them all run in a blind way … so we’re defeating the entire purpose of (Prop 4’s) intent.” 
Rep. Doug Owens, D-Millcreek, argued Brammer’s bill shouldn’t be lawmakers’ first move after the court ordered the Legislature to comply with Proposition 4.
“Are you concerned about the optics of that?” Owens asked Brammer during Monday’s hearing. “The court says follow Prop 4 and the first thing out of the chute is we’re narrowing Prop 4?”

Brammer said he’s not concerned about that, because he’s looking to clarify the law to define a “workable” legal test. While making the case for his bill, Brammer pointed to a sentence in Gibson’s August ruling that specified “the legislature retains discretion in determining” what tools should be used when evaluating maps. He said that was an “invitation” from the courts to lawmakers to define the parameters. 
“The fact that we exercise discretion does not mean that you’re undermining a bill,” Brammer said. “What it means is that you’re actually trying to create a workable methodology for parties to use when proposing maps. And so that’s what we’re working towards.” 
Owens, however, argued that Brammer’s bill sets a rigid definition of “partisan symmetry” that not all experts would agree on. 
“Are you aware that in the academic literature there is more than one definition of partisan symmetry?” Owens challenged. 
Brammer said Proposition 4 “could have very easily defined partisan symmetry” and stated “which tests they were going to use.” He indicated he would be open to debating having more than one method, but he resisted “keeping it wide open and undefined and subject to everyone arguing.” 
“This is simply so that we don’t have a food fight between experts as to the statistical analysis of partisan symmetry,” Brammer said.
What’s next for Utah redistricting – and which lawmakers were picked to draw the new map

Owens continued to push back.
“I think the committee deserves to know that this is a hotly debated issue in the academic literature and in the courts,” Owens said. 
He argued “there is no real world scenario” where the minority party in Utah (Democrats) would win using a map approved under the partisan bias test. 
“This has been specifically criticized as a valid measure of gerrymandering when it’s applied in a lopsided state,” Owens said. “In the real world, the dominant party is going to win every one of those four seats.” 
The Utah Legislature’s redistricting expert
The author of the proposed maps being considered by the Legislative Redistricting Commission is Sean Trende, a senior elections analyst for RealClearPolitics and a nonresident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. 
Trende, whom legislative leaders had also retained as an expert witness in the state’s redistricting litigation, was separately contracted with the Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel to conduct map analysis submitted by legislators, according to legislative researchers who spoke during Monday’s hearing. 
Trende has been retained as an expert witness in dozens of redistricting cases across the country. He was appointed by the Supreme Court of Virginia as one of the co-masters that drew Virginia’s maps after the state’s redistricting commission deadlocked. 
Trende testified during Monday’s hearing on a remote call, from Delaware, Ohio. He walked through all of the proposed maps, explaining that they were drawn using his computer models and the “partisan bias test” while ensuring they factor in Proposition 4’s requirements and evenly distribute populations as constitutionally required. 
Because Salt Lake County’s population would be too big to form a single district, it has to be split at least once. 
Trende said two of the maps being considered were “simulation maps” made to conform to equal population requirements, while two others were “based on” the 2021 congressional map, but “made to bring it into conformance” with Proposition 4’s requirements. 
“So I did draw them, in a way, but not with a free hand,” Trende said. 
When Owens asked whether he always testifies in favor for one party in redistricting cases, Trende pushed back, saying he helped a Democratic caucus in Michigan to come up with a remedial map, and “there are times where I tell Republicans, ‘I’m sorry, I can’t say your map’s not a gerrymander.’”
Judge orders Utah Legislature to draw new congressional maps

When Owens pressed on Brammer’s proposed “partisan bias test” requirement, Trende said he’s never seen a state specifically require partisan symmetry as a standard in an independent redistricting process, “but by doing it, I think one of the consequences is that partisan bias is a test that has to be considered.” 
“The only test that really tests partisan symmetry is partisan bias,” Trende said. “In my view, it’s not an option, since (Prop 4) specifically says to include tests (for) partisan symmetry. I don’t think there’s an option to not include a partisan bias test.” 
When the committee’s co-chair Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, asked Trende whether any of the 2021 maps that were proposed — including those recommended by the independent redistricting commission at the time — would be fair under Proposition 4’s standards today, Trende said they likely wouldn’t. 
“I think they would all have problems,” he said. 
While the 2021 congressional map that lawmakers enacted split Salt Lake County four ways, Trende said all of the independent redistricting commission maps would “fail the partisan bias test.” 
“They show indications of maps being drawn with partisan intent,” he said. “So I don’t think any of those maps are live options under Prop 4.” 
When Owens pressed Trende on whether his computer models’ partisan symmetry tests “allow a district that had a Democrat majority,” Trende said “probably.” 
Owens, however, expressed skepticism. 
“So it’s baked in the cake if we adopt this test that there will never be, and cannot be, and it’s impossible to have, a Democratic majority district,” Owens said. He challenged Trende to produce a map “that shows a Democratic majority and applies his symmetry test, just to see if it’s possible, because I don’t think it is.” 
Utahns urge lawmakers to preserve ‘intent’ of Prop 4
More than a dozen Utahns — both in person and remotely — spoke during Monday’s public hearing, urging lawmakers to adhere to Proposition 4’s intent while also expressing concern that Brammer’s bill, and the proposed maps under consideration, don’t bode well. 
Tiffany Smith, a retired attorney who lives in Millcreek, said she’s a registered Republican who comes from “a long line of family who have served on both sides of the aisle” in both legislative and judicial roles.

“As a lawyer, I want to commend you for trying to convince anyone watching today that the partisan bias test is the only test that is the best test. Wow. You did a great job,” she said. “However, those arguments are not germane to the complete language of Proposition 4. And they distract from the intent in the language of the law.” 
Smith countered that lawmakers are tasked with adhering to Proposition 4, “the neutral criteria and the ban on partisan gerrymandering.” 
“Please respect the will of the voters and not ignore us,” she said. “We are ‘we the people.’ You are accountable to us. Please keep communities together, and if that means that we have an independent or Democratic (representative) … wouldn’t it be refreshing to be the state that actually represents its people fully and set an example of representative democracy?” 
She also emphasized that Proposition 4 encouraged the redistricting process to use statistical methods — plural — and not just one test. 
“Cherry picking a test reverse engineered to say that partisan gerrymandering is fair is improper and undermines the purpose of Proposition 4,” she said.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)The organization that manages the electric grid for Pennsylvania and 12 other states has moved too slowly in response to skyrocketing energy demand and consumers are paying for it, Gov. Josh Shapiro said Monday.
Speaking at a conference of energy industry leaders and regulators in Philadelphia, Shapiro said PJM Interconnection must make changes, including giving states a bigger role in its governance, or the commonwealth could leave the consortium.
“We need to be thinking about consumers and their costs, something that PJM, I think, doesn’t really spend a whole lot of time focused on,” Shapiro told reporters Monday after delivering opening remarks at the event.
He said governors from each PJM state share concerns about the Valley Forge-based organization’s backlog of new energy projects awaiting approval while peak energy consumption is expected to increase by 20% in the next decade, according to PJM’s forecast. Much of that demand will come from data centers that house the computing power for artificial intelligence.

“We need to move more quickly on these energy-producing projects. We’ve got to hold down costs. If PJM cannot do that, then Pennsylvania will look to go it alone,” Shapiro said.
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who spoke via video, said overhauling the state’s power policy was among his first calls for action after taking office in 2022. Youngkin, a Republican, said his administration predicted demand would grow faster than PJM’s forecast.
“Indeed, instead of unlocking investment and fast tracking critical projects, PJM has instead been responsible for bottlenecks and delays that crush jobs, drive up utility bills and leave families and businesses hurting,” he said. “This is a crisis of not having enough power, and it is a crisis in confidence.”
Youngkin said Virginia lawmakers are working on legislation that would allow the state to reassess whether its utilities should remain part of PJM.
“This doesn’t mean that we are walking away, but it does mean that collectively, we recognize we need to represent and protect our ratepayers, and that means sending a clear, unified signal that PJM must modernize,” he said.
PJM was founded in Philadelphia nearly a century ago when three electricity utilities connected their independent grids to share resources and improve reliability. With more than 1,000 stakeholder members, it now ensures the flow of power to utilities in all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois and the New York border to North Carolina.

It is overseen by a board of governors through a consensus-based issue resolution process in which member organizations and stakeholders have weighted votes on issues that will go before the board. These include state consumer advocate organizations, like Pennsylvania’s Public Utilities Commission, but the states themselves have no direct input.
The board’s decisions are ultimately subject to approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
While PJM’s stakeholder process and meetings are open to the public with agendas and minutes posted on its website, but members of the public are required to register for an account to watch meetings virtually. And while the outcome of votes is public, critics have compared it to a black box because how stakeholders vote on questions is secret. 
Lawmakers in several states have proposed laws requiring PJM members to report thier votes to state regulators. They include a bill introduced by Pennsylvania state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia), which passed in the House in July and awaits action in the Senate.
“Utility companies operating in our regional power grid that determine the electric bills, environmental and public health of 65 million people should never be allowed to vote in secret,” Rabb said. “Such decisions must be publicly disclosed. End of story.”

PJM CEO Manu Asthana, who is set to step down at the end of this year, said he’s proud of the reliability that PJM has provided through a series of unusual events during his tenure, including record peak demands, a pandemic, geomagnetic storms and the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which threatened a major transmission line.
Asthana said criticism of PJM’s interconnection queue, in which 63,000 megawatts of power projects await review for permission to connect to the grid, is not warranted. 
“There’s a lot of mythology and a lot of things that are said about our interconnection queue,” he said, noting that number is down from 200,000 megawatts when the organization implemented reforms in 2023. PJM also notes that it has cleared tens of thousands of megawatts worth of projects that have failed to come online for reasons outside of its control, including site acquisition, permitting and supply chain problems.
PJM has also worked proactively with members to prioritize important projects, such as restarting Constellation Energy’s former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, and redeveloping Homer City, one of the nation’s largest coal power plants, into the nation’s largest natural gas-burning power stations. Both projects will power data centers.  
Experts who spoke during panels at the conference agreed with Shapiro, Youngkin and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who also spoke via video, that PJM is not serving consumers well.
“You’ve got 67 million people who are very concerned, and again, consumers are called voters, and that makes the politicians concerned,” said former FERC Chairman Mark Christie. Christie and former FERC Commissioner Allison Clements were recommended by a bipartisan panel of PJM-state governors to fill vacancies on the board, but neither was ultimately nominated.
“PJM should be reimagined in the governance sense,” Christie said, adding that he wouldn’t interfere with the technical aspects of operating the grid. “The policy making things that PJM does in their political policy, if it’s going to be a regional government for the grid, people who are elected will have a much bigger role in that.”
Vincent Duane, a former senior vice president and general counsel at PJM, said changes need to go deeper than simply giving elected officials a bigger role.
“​​I’m going to be blunt and unpopular when I say that PJM has become ungovernable,” Duane said “Adding seats to an already crowded banquet table with 1,000 parliamentarians with vastly different interests, I think, is going to ultimately leave states feeling disappointed with the outcomes.”
What’s missing is more purposeful and deliberate decision making from a strong executive branch in the organization that is accountable to state utility regulators, he said.

Duane later added that as general counsel, PJM board members often asked him to whom they had a fiduciary responsibility. He said he had trouble answering the question. To say the responsibility was to the marketplace or membership was unsatisfactory.
“Until we can get a good answer to that question, it’s premature to start talking about process and voting structures,” Duane said.
Maryland State Delegate Lorig Charkoudian said the question of fiduciary duty is an important one for the success of policies that elected officials create. 
“The vast majority of the stakeholders know who their fiduciary duty is to, and it is to their shareholders,” Charkoudian said, adding that for ratepayers that amounts to a wealth transfer to the market participants who are writing the rules.
“You could go example after example after example, where that is the case,” she said. “And that is why it’s untenable to continue at this moment with this governance structure.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5474-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-22 21:57:30.331825

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Maryland lawmakers want you to read your utility bill particularly closely this month.
A roughly $40 rebate on electricity bills, approved by the General Assembly in April, is finally heading out to customers, with a second round expected in early 2026.
Legislators took $200 million from a state fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs to send the refund directly to all residential ratepayers, in hopes of easing the burden of recent rate hikes.
State Democrats touted the refund at a news conference Monday in Randallstown, during which Gov. Wes Moore (D) turned the focus to PJM Interconnection, the operator of the 13-state electric grid that includes Maryland. Moore argued that “outdated processes” at PJM have led to the dramatic bill increases, and renewed his calls for the states to gain a voice on the governing board.
“We demand a seat at the table with PJM, because no longer can they make decisions about us when we’re not at the table in the first place,” Moore said.
In remarks at a PJM summit in Philadelphia on Monday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) was even more direct, floating the possibility that his state, the largest energy generator in the grid, could leave PJM if systematic reforms don’t take place in “months, not years.”
“If PJM refuses to change, we will be forced to go in a different direction, and that will have a significant impact here in this region and across the country,” Shapiro said. “To be clear, that is not a path that I am eager to chart. But I am not willing to stand idly by and let PJM dictate our future.”
Energy bills likely to tick up again in 2026 after electricity auction clears at maximum price

Republicans fire back
Maryland Democrats, alongside affordability advocates like the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, have thrown barbs at PJM as bills skyrocket, arguing that the grid has not moved quickly enough to allow new energy projects to come online, as projected power demand jumps thanks to artificial intelligence and data centers.
Republicans, a minority in both the Maryland House and Senate, have taken a different tack, arguing that the state’s efforts to promote renewable energy projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions have increased energy costs.
“The Democratic majority has placed the blame on energy companies and on PJM, as if they have no culpability in the skyrocketing energy costs that have our communities in a chokehold,” House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said in a statement Monday.
The fund that legislators tapped to pay for the electricity bill refund, called the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, is made up largely of proceeds from a carbon dioxide allowance auction and alternative compliance payments from electricity suppliers that do not meet renewable energy requirements. The fund has ballooned in recent years due to an increase in compliance payments.
“Governor Moore isn’t giving out relief — he’s just recycling ratepayer money Maryland families already paid on their utility bills,” said a statement Monday from Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R- Upper Shore).
PJM, meanwhile, argues that some reforms are already underway, including a fast-track process for “shovel-ready” energy projects to get through the queue and connect to the grid. The grid operator also set a cap on a key energy auction that increased prices for PJM customers, at the urging of Shapiro, Moore and other governors in the region.
The refund rollout
Some energy customers in Maryland may have already received the credit on their electric bills. Others might still be waiting. It all depends on the utility and the billing cycle, officials say.
The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel said the state’s three Exelon utilities — Baltimore Gas and Electric, Pepco and Delmarva Power and Light — began issuing refunds in August, but the process extended into September. Potomac Edison expected to issue its refunds in September. The Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, on the other hand, got it done in August.

According to its website, BGE issued the payment by placing its residential customers into one of four tiers based on their average monthly energy usage, with the smallest users receiving a credit of $30.50 and the largest users receiving a credit of $66.
Speaking in her district at the Randallstown Community Center, House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D- Baltimore County) said she has seen the strain of inflation and higher power bills in her community.
“I see people working harder than ever to make ends meet. I see people tightening their budgets. And yes, I see people struggling with rising energy costs,” Jones said.
The refund was one small part of a sprawling energy package passed by the General Assembly and signed by Moore. The main bill, called the Next Generation Energy Act, also aimed to increase in-state power generation, including by creating a fast-track for certain eligible projects at the Maryland Public Service Commission, and to curtail utility infrastructure spending and multiyear rate increase plans.
“We may not be able to make energy costs fall overnight, but together, by combining relief with reform, we can make Maryland a more resilient and a more affordable state for everyone,” Jones said.
The refund comes as Maryland consumers are just beginning to see higher bills resulting from an energy auction held by PJM in 2024, which cleared at a historically high price.
The People’s Counsel estimated that, if the costs were spread out over 12 months, customers could expect to see an average increase of about $13 per month on their bills. Baltimore Gas and Electric customers were expected to see one of the larger increases, at $16 per month.
But regulators stepped in, requiring the utility to suspend the cost increases in the summer and winter, when bills are higher because customers are using more energy to heat and cool their homes.
As a result though, typical BGE customers will see an estimated monthly bill increase of $30 this fall and spring, according to the Office of People’s Counsel.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC06073-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-22 20:57:33.115614

(Courtesy Louder than Guns)After a high profile string of deadly shootings, Democratic lawmakers in the state House are moving to tighten Pennsylvania’s firearm laws.
The House Judiciary committee passed four bills on Monday. One would institute red flag laws, which allow law enforcement to temporarily seize people’s firearms if a judge rules them a likely danger to themself or others. 
The others would ban devices that convert semi-automatic guns to automatic fire, require background checks for long gun purchases, and ban weapons that can avoid magnetometer detection, like 3D printed “ghost guns.”
The hearing followed the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event on the Utah Valley University Campus in Utah earlier this month. That same day, a gunman killed one student and injured two others at a high school outside Denver, Colorado. And last week, three law enforcement officers were killed during a shootout in York County while investigating a reported stalker.

While all four bills advanced along party lines, the hearing was, at times, contentious.  
One Republican lawmaker, Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Clinton), said they amount to “an attempt by the left to try to disarm the opposition.”
“None of the bills today will ever single save a single innocent life, because criminals don’t obey laws, and everyone knows that,” she added. “If we wanted to save innocent lives, they would work to put God and the Bible back into our schools, and restore the nuclear family.”
Republicans, in the minority on the committee, broadly characterized the bills as infringements on the Second Amendment and, in some cases, redundant given existing laws. Most made efforts to respectfully engage their Democratic colleagues.
“I do not question the passion or the motive of either side,” Rep. Tim Bonner (R-Mercer) said. “As legislators elected by the people, we take our oath to enforce the Constitution and to enforce the laws that have been adopted.”

The Second Amendment, he said, is “sacred in our Constitution.” 
Democrats framed the measures as a public safety-oriented approach that square with the Constitution.
“The [Second Amendment] does not grant the ability to possess any weapon whatsoever, in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose,” said Rep. Emily Kinkead (D-Allegheny), citing a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that set precedent for subsequent  Second Amendment cases.
Kinkead also invoked the First Amendment. While all Americans have the right to free speech, there are still laws around slander, libel, terroristic threats, intellectual property and more, she said.
“No right under the Constitution is unlimited,” she said.
To become law, the bills would have to pass a vote on the full House floor, where Democrats have a single-vote majority, then pass the Republican-controlled Senate.
“Lives are lost every day to guns across the commonwealth,” said Adam Garber, executive director of the group Ceasefire PA. “So we’re hoping the House moves quickly for a vote and the Senate … puts people’s lives first.” 
A ‘Red flag’ law
House Bill 1859 would temporarily prohibit someone from possessing firearms if they’re determined to be at risk of physically harming themselves or others as demonstrated by the person threatening or attempting suicide or violence, or recklessly brandishing a firearm, within the past year. Other factors the court would consider include substance use, recent gun purchases and animal cruelty. 
The measure mirrors red flag laws enacted in Washington, D.C., and more than a dozen states. They include Connecticut and Indiana, where provisions took effect more than two decades ago.
In Pennsylvania, the current proposal matches one from last session, which built on legislation from 2021, to establish extreme risk protection orders (ERPO’s) in the commonwealth.
Attendees with Ceasefire PA hold signs at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Sept. 22, 2025 (Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)
It would allow an ERPO to be pursued by police, a relative or household member of the person thought to be at risk of harming themselves or others. The court would schedule a hearing within three to 10 days and, in the meantime, could issue a temporary order prohibiting the respondent from possessing firearms. In that case, the judge would simultaneously issue a search warrant for – and seize – any firearms and concealed carry permits.
At the hearing, the court could extend the seizure to three to 12 months. Law enforcement or a licensed dealer would keep the firearms; the defendant also could appeal.
Anyone who tries to leverage the process improperly – such as making false reports – would face a third-degree felony along with having to pay restitution plus the target’s legal and incurred costs.
Borowicz objected to the bill, saying it would violate due process.
“The police show up, you lose all of your firearms, and then you have a trial?” she said. “That’s not how it works in America.”
Rep. Robert Leadbeter (R-Columbia), who recently introduced a bill designed to prevent red flag laws in Pennsylvania, said he’s opposing the measure because of potential costs for defendants, constitutional rights violations and the “unacceptable” 10-day waiting period.
He also said it’s unnecessary because of laws already on the books for stalking, terroristic threats and involuntary mental health commitment.
“[Pennsylvania’s involuntary mental health commitment law] does not go far enough when it comes to addressing people who would commit harm,” countered Kinkead. “To say that 302 is sufficient, is to say that the only people who use guns to harm other people in this way are people who have severe mental illness.”
The measure also aims to prevent suicide, Kinkead noted.
Sponsor Jennifer O’Mara (D-Delaware) has cited her father’s suicide in her appeals for support of the legislation and its predecessor from last session. 
A Pew Research Center analysis showed in 2023, neary six in 10 gun-related deaths in the country were suicides (27,300).

Critics and supporters of establishing red flag laws in Pennsylvania have cited conflicting research on their effectiveness in states that already have them. Committee Chairman Tim Briggs (D-Montgomery) previously pointed to research from the University of Indianapolis tying them to a drop in suicide rates, while minority chair Rep. Rob Kauffman (R-Franklin) on Monday raised a RAND corporation research review citing weaknesses with studies of ERPO laws’ impacts.
A 2024 study linked ERPO laws with a decline in homicide rates. 
Banning Glock switches and ‘undetectable’ guns
A bill introduced by Rep. Mandy Steele (D-Allegheny) would ban  Machine Gun Conversion Devices, firearm modifications intended to make semi-automatic weapons fire at the same rate as automatic ones. 
Steele said the bill was sponsored in honor of former Brackenridge Police Chief Justin McIntyre, who was shot and killed on the line of duty in Allegheny County in 2023.
“His surviving family wants these senseless, Lego-sized gun conversion devices, which can turn a Glock into a machine gun, off the streets,” Steele said. “So does every police chief that I represent, and I represent a lot of police chiefs. Our police will be safer and their jobs will be easier.”
Generally, the term refers to Glock switches or autosears, small firearm accessories that can turn semi-automatic weapons into automatic ones.
Those are already illegal under federal law. Still, municipalities around Pennsylvania — as well as states run by both Democrats and Republicans — have passed laws to ban them.
A display of ‘ghost guns’ displayed by Attorney General Josh Shapiro’s office during a Capitol news conference on Monday, Dec. 16, 2019 (Photo by Pennsylvania Capital-Star).
That’s in part because the devices are illegal under the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms’ interpretation of the National Firearms Act – not  explicit congressional action. With presidential administrations taking drastically different approaches to firearms law enforcement, the laws insulate states from changing interpretation or enforcement. They also make it easier for state and local law enforcement to bring charges against those who violate the law.
A memo seeking co-sponsors for the bill says it would also ban bump stocks, a device used in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, the deadliest in modern American history. The devices can increase a firearm’s rate of fire by allowing the shooter to fire using the impact of recoil. They do not, however, turn a semiautomatic gun into an automatic one. 
Following the Las Vegas shooting, President Donald Trump, in his first term, moved to ban bump stocks. The move received pushback from hardline Second Amendment supporters  and eventually was ruled illegal by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Still, several states and municipalities have banned the devices themselves. Last month, a Court of Common Pleas judge in Philadelphia upheld the city’s own ban on the devices. Delaware County and the city of York also have enacted bans. 
Opposing the bill, Kauffman noted that bump stocks and other firearm accessories that increase their rate of fire are intended to make shooting easier for disabled people.
Leadbeter also spoke in opposition of the bill, calling the conversion device ban redundant in the face of federal law.
“Possession of these devices are already prohibited, with only a very limited exception,” he said. “Making these devices triply illegal? I can’t see the intent beyond virtue signaling.”
Kinkead, however, noted that lawmakers often pass laws that mirror federal regulations.
“This is my fifth year in office, and we have created so many crimes and passed so many laws that have mirrored or copied other statutes at the federal level,” she said. “Yet, these arguments were never made about how, under those laws, we couldn’t possibly pass those because criminals wouldn’t listen.”
Another measure would ban firearms made entirely of non-metal materials, or not containing at least one major component made entirely of metal. The number of “ghost guns” — homemade, unserialized firearms — recovered at crime scenes has spiked since 2017.  In recent years, they’ve become much more accessible with increased availability of 3D printers. If made without metal, the guns can avoid detection by magnetometers.
Like Machine Gun Conversion Devices, ghost guns have already been banned by numerous local governments across Pennsylvania. The state House also passed another bill earlier this year to ban the sale of ghost gun kits, which contain parts that can be assembled into a firearm at home. 
A fourth bill, from Rep. Perry Warren (D-Bucks), would require background checks for the sale and transfer of long guns, which is not currently required.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Loudeer-than-guns-Pistols-for-sale-at-a-gun-shop-in-KY-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-22 20:57:33.115614

(Photo by Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Republicans in North Carolina’s legislature began advancing a package of changes to the state’s criminal justice system Monday, moving to streamline the state’s death penalty process and tighten pre-trial release requirements after a killing on Charlotte’s light rail last month sparked national attention.
The bill, titled “Iryna’s Law,” serves as lawmakers’ response to the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska in late August. Security video of the killing, released earlier this month, immediately garnered headlines and scrutiny — from local and state leaders up to President Donald Trump.
Senators approved the bill Monday evening, 28-8. All eight votes against the measure were Democrats; several others were not present for the vote. The bill now heads to the House, where it is expected to earn majority approval.
The plan is broadly informed by the circumstances of Zarutska’s case: Decarlos Brown, who has been charged with her murder, was homeless, reportedly suffered from untreated mental illness, served six years for armed robbery and had been arrested multiple times.
“North Carolinians deserve to live in safe communities without fear of violent criminals being cycled in and out of the justice system,” House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) said in a news release Sunday.
House Bill 307 would eliminate cashless bail in some circumstances. And it changes pre-trial options for defendants accused of “violent offenses” and repeat offenders, requiring either secured bond or house arrest with GPS monitoring. “Written promises” to appear in court for a hearing would be eliminated under the bill.
Repeat offenders who have previously been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital would also face an exam to decide whether they should be re-committed. Arresting officers would “immediately transport” those offenders to a hospital for that exam. (The North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association said Monday they supported the legislation.)
Magistrates who oversee preliminary court hearings would also see additional layers of scrutiny. They would be specifically judged on “timeliness and conflicts of interests,” and would be subject to suspension by Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Newby.
Bill pursues new path to resume executions
The bill also aims to streamline aspects of the state’s capital punishment process, putting stricter rules on defendants’ ability to appeal and allowing courts to consider public transit as a potential “aggravating factor” when sentencing for violent crimes. And cases in which the death penalty is being sought would proceed in their county of conviction, rather than solely in Wake County.
Sen. Danny Britt (R-Hoke) said cases were “going on too long without a family ever seeing justice for their loved ones.”
“This is an effort to try and speed these up,” Britt said.
Executions have been on pause for almost two decades in North Carolina, amid continuing legal and regulatory challenges. But language inserted into the bill by Senate President Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) on Monday evening would allow the state to continue pursuing executions.

Lethal injection would remain the state’s default method of execution under the bill. But if a court finds the method to be unconstitutional, the Department of Adult Corrections would be required to adopt another method, one already adopted by other states. That could include the electric chair or a firing squad.
“We’ve allowed bureaucracy and arguments unrelated to the case, and challenges over equipment and professionals and chemicals, to take back ultimate justice out of our society,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell) said.
Department officials would have about four months to update their guidelines on executions following that court ruling. After those rules are established, defendants’ executions would be set within two months.
Sen. Graig Meyer (D-Orange) said Berger’s amendment sets up “arbitrary timelines and shot clocks on judicial action” that “makes it more likely that we will execute innocent people.”
In response, Sen. Carl Ford (R-Rowan) said that “when someone has committed a heinous crime, and there’s proof of it without a shadow of a doubt, you can sign me up to pull the trigger.”
Sen. Mujtaba Mohammed (D-Mecklenburg), who met with Zarutska’s family after her death, said he had previously intended to vote for the bill. But Berger’s changes to the death penalty lost his support.
“Shame on each and every one of us,” he said.
Democrats: Bill should fund public defenders, mental health
The Republicans’ plan orders a study on mental health and its intersection with the justice system. But it does not appropriate money or make any specific directives on mental health initiatives and treatment — which opponents say is a critical flaw, along with a shortage of public defenders.
“Investing in prosecutors is absolutely what we need to do, but we also need to invest in public defenders’ offices,” Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said. “If we’re sitting here trying to figure out how to best keep our communities safe, it’s also going to come with more investment.”
Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, has said he supports more accountability for magistrates and to examine defendants facing mental health crises.
Britt acknowledged Monday that there was “more work to do” on mental health treatment. He called the bill “a start, but not a finish.”
Senate Democrats also voiced wide-ranging concerns on other parts of the bill, including its changes to capital punishment.
“I cannot support a bill that expedites the death penalty in our state,” said Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham). “I wish we would consider those solutions that are both efficient and compassionate.”
And Liz Barber, with the ACLU of North Carolina, warned that the bill’s changes could extend already significant wait times at psychiatric facilities.
“Unless the mental health care system is fully funded, then the involuntary commitment process is a road to nowhere,” Barber said.
Democrats sought to amend the bill Monday to include additional mental health funding, without success.

Mohammed proposed spending $5 million to train magistrates on mental health law and other topics. And Sen. Terence Everitt (D-Granville) requested additional money to train law enforcement. Both measures were overruled by Republicans.
Mohammed also proposed banning the use of crime victims’ names, images and likenesses in political advertising. Zarutska’s death appears likely to surface as a campaign issue in the ongoing U.S. Senate contest; Michael Whatley, the Republican candidate, appeared alongside Hall and Berger in a news conference about the legislation last week.
That amendment, along with others proposed by Democrats, were overruled by Republicans and discarded without votes.
The crime bill is at the center of this week’s session at Jones Street, but the General Assembly is also considering several spending bills funding specific parts of the budget. House and Senate leaders remain at an impasse on the broader annual budget.

(Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)
New Mexico’s National Guard Adjutant General announced Monday that guardsmen will soon be deployed to Española, a town of roughly 10,000 people in Northern New Mexico whose leaders recently asked for state help dealing with a crime, drug and housing crisis. 
Española will be the second New Mexico city to receive National Guard troops. Albuquerque, the state’s biggest city, has seen a monthslong troop deployment in support of the Albuquerque Police Department. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham authorized the deployments to both cities in emergency orders that cite rising crime and short-staffed law enforcement agencies. The governor’s Aug. 13 emergency order for the Española area authorized National Guard deployments, along with funding for emergency housing or healthcare help. Her office stressed at the time that there were no imminent plans to deploy National Guard troops to Española.
According to the executive order, police calls in the Española area have doubled in the last two years, and police dispatches to businesses have quadrupled in that same period. She also cited Rio Arriba County’s high overdose death rate, “with residents struggling with addiction to fentanyl and other illicit substances.” Lujan Grisham’s order also authorized $750,000 in emergency spending. Last week, the state health department reported Rio Arriba County is one of three in Northern New Mexico with surging overdose deaths and overdose emergency room visits.

While the decision has now been made to send them, the number of troops, as well as their assignment, is still being determined, Miguel Aguilar told Source New Mexico on Monday after presenting in Albuquerque  to the interim Courts, Corrections and Criminal Justice committee of the Legislature. 
“We don’t even know what the number is going to be,” Aguilar told Source. “It’s just a matter of what the scope is.”
Aguilar and Española Police Chief Mizel Garcia presented to the committee to answer questions about the role the guard could play in Española and elsewhere, and to address swirling controversy about President Donald Trump’s use of the National Guard in American cities, including Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. 
Aguilar said his troops’ presence in Albuquerque since April has freed up Albuquerque police to make more arrests. The National Guard has taken some administrative tasks off police officers’ hands, including compiling case files for prosecutors, directing traffic and monitoring surveillance cameras. 
Garcia said the guard will be useful in his town, assisting an under-staffed police department in some form. But he acknowledged that their deployment could face public opposition.

“My biggest concern right now is fear,” he said. “Because of the cultural background that we have in Espanola, there’s always been a fear of the National Guard coming in.”
He said he and his staff had multiple community meetings in recent weeks, in which they sought to reassure the community that police and the guard are working together “as a team.” 
Garcia said the troops’ arrival could occur as soon as early October.
Several lawmakers said they were concerned about the prospect of an expanded military presence in New Mexico communities, especially given Trump’s use of the guard.
Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) said defining a mission for the guard’s deployment in Española is vital, as is more clarity about who is in charge and who is accountable. 
“I’m currently not understanding the strategy, even looking to Albuquerque as a way in which I can try to understand what’s going to happen in Española,” she said. 
The committee invited Naureen Shah, an expert and attorney for the national American Civil Liberties Union, to lay out her concerns about civil rights for civilians who are increasingly interacting with domestic military forces. 
She said that, while she does not pretend to understand all the local forces that might be used to justify the guard’s presence in New Mexico, deploying the guard here gives Trump cover.
“This administration wants to be able to deploy the military at the president’s whim as a tool against his political opponents,” she said. “And the more that happens at a state level, the more it normalizes it for the Trump administration.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0998-e1758586979607-1024x764.jpg,,,2025-09-22 20:57:33.115614

After the Wyoming senator told a reporter last week her feelings had changed about the First Amendment, Lummis says her position hasn’t shifted at all. 
The post Where does Sen. Lummis stand on freedom of speech? appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis has made national headlines for reportedly changing the way she feels about freedom of speech, but her office disputes that characterization.
“Under normal times, in normal circumstances, I tend to think that the First Amendment should always be sort of the ultimate right. And that there should be almost no checks and balances on it. I don’t feel that way anymore,” Lummis told Semafor, a digital news site, last week. 
The senator’s comments followed the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s TV show after the late-night comedian commented on Charlie Kirk’s accused assassin. Disney, ABC’s parent company, removed Kimmel from the air after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr publicly threatened investigations and regulatory action. 
Ahead of ABC’s Monday announcement that Kimmel would return to the air this week, Lummis weighed in, telling Semafor that “an FCC license, it’s not a right. It really is a privilege.”
Like many members of the GOP, Lummis has often championed free speech. 
“There are no ifs, ands or buts about the First Amendment and it is time for @POTUS and unelected bureaucrats in D.C. to abide by the Constitution,” Lummis posted on X on July 25, 2023. 
At the time, she and Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky introduced the Free Speech Protection Act, “to prohibit federal employees and contractors from directing platforms to censor any speech that is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,” according to the bill text. 
The legislation was in response to a lawsuit brought by attorneys general in Louisiana and Missouri against the Biden administration. The federal government carried out a far-reaching censorship campaign, according to the complaint, in its efforts to convince social media companies to address postings related to COVID-19. In 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the case. 
“I take the protection of the privacy and individual liberties of the people of Wyoming extremely serious,” Lummis wrote in a July 21, 2023 press release. “If we let the Biden administration restrict our freedom of speech, there is no telling what other sacred freedoms they will come for next.” 
Circumstances have changed, Lummis told Semafor last week. 
“I feel like something’s changed culturally. And I think that there needs to be some cognizance that things have changed,” Lummis said. “We just can’t let people call each other those kinds of insane things and then be surprised when politicians get shot and the death threats they are receiving and then trying to get extra money for security.” 
Asked to provide more of an explanation as to what caused Lummis to change her position on the First Amendment, Joe Jackson, a spokesman for the senator, asked WyoFile to print the following statement in full. 
“Senator Lummis’s position hasn’t shifted at all. She remains among Congress’ most vocal First Amendment champions. The First Amendment applies to federal and state governments and does not prevent private companies from firing employees who endorse and cheer political assassinations. The Left enthusiastically supported Biden’s censorship regime and stayed quiet when Democrats branded their rivals as Nazis. But when Senator Lummis criticizes Democrats for their inflammatory rhetoric that promotes violence, they suddenly act like they care about free speech. This double standard is precisely why nobody believes them,” the statement read. 
In a follow-up, WyoFile asked if Lummis could clarify what she meant by “I don’t feel that way anymore” in her comments to Semafor. “Her point was we can’t normalize speech that incites this level of violence,” Jackson responded.
The “insane things” people say and call each other are protected by the First Amendment, Jackson wrote. 
“However, we must recognize the drastic consequences and violence from the Left its resulting in. In this case, the murder of a young husband and father,” Jackson wrote. “The media is working overtime to try and mischaracterize her comments instead of focusing on the real issue: leftwing political violence.”
Some GOP senators, however, have raised concerns about FCC pressure on ABC, including Sen. Paul, the co-sponsor with Lummis on the Free Speech Protection Act. He told Meet the Press on Sunday that Carr had “no business weighing in on this.”
While people could get fired for making “despicable comments,” Paul said, the government should not pressure companies to take action. 
“The government’s got no business in it. And the FCC was wrong to weigh in. And I’ll fight any attempt by the government to get involved with speech,” Paul said. 
On his podcast Friday, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said he was “thrilled” to see Kimmel’s show taken off the air, but called Carr’s actions “dangerous as hell.”
Cruz, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, which has oversight authority over the FCC, said it “will end up bad for conservatives.”
“They will silence us,” he said. “They will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly.”

Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who resigned. (courtesy of Daniel Bass) OMAHA — Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts launched his reelection bid last weekend at R&R Realty Group and kicked off a three-day tour of the state.
Ricketts looks to win his first full six-year term after winning a special election in 2024 to finish the final two years of former Nebraska U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who resigned. Ricketts faces a populist challenger in a race already garnering national attention. 
“Conservative leadership matters,” Ricketts said. “Conservative leadership delivers.”
As expected, President Donald Trump joined prominent Republicans in endorsing Ricketts, a former two-term governor and political force in the state. In his campaign kickoff, Ricketts highlighted working with the Legislature as governor to deliver $12.7 billion in tax relief. 
Ricketts also touted his Senate votes for Trump’s budget and tax bill this summer, saying “it delivers the largest tax cut in American history.” He highlighted its new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less and how it boosted funding for immigration enforcement. 
The law makes tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for high earners, starts funding Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defense program and accomplishes other goals from Trump’s domestic agenda.
Ricketts said he is fighting to keep the same conservative leadership in Washington, D.C., that he said has delivered results for Nebraska and for America.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen appointed Ricketts to the Senate in 2023, when he replaced Sasse after Sasse resigned to become president of the University of Florida. Ricketts easily defeated Preston Love Jr. in 2024. But Ricketts has acknowledged his race against former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn will be “tough.” 
Osborn, like Ricketts, has been holding listening sessions around the state, and he ran a closer-than-expected race in 2024 against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, who defeated him by six percentage points.

“I need your help because I’m kicking off my reelection here, and it’s going to be a tough one,” Ricketts told the Omaha crowd. “He says he’s an independent, but he voted against Trump. He says He’s independent, but … 95% of his money came from outside the state of Nebraska.” 
Ricketts called Osborn a “fake” independent. Osborn quickly responded by telling Omaha NBC affiliate WOWT, “If you want to talk about fake, how about buying your way into the Senate with your dad’s money … so I would say he’s a fake senator.”
The latest spat is a hint of how much different the race will be compared to Osborn’s bid against Fischer, who largely ignored him until the last few months.
Ricketts and his political team have said they won’t let Osborn fly under the radar. Some regional and national Republican strategists have said the GOP will work to “expose” him.
Omaha was the first stop for Ricketts’ statewide tour. He also planned stops at Kearney, North Platte, Scottsbluff, Norfolk and Beatrice.

Michelle Lujan Grisham said she’s been “disappointed” that thus far Senate leadership in her own party has declined to include interstate medical compacts on the agenda.","The New Mexico state Capitol. Lawmakers will reconvene for a special session on Oct. 1 (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)With just a week left before a special New Mexico legislative session begins, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she’s been “disappointed” that thus far Senate leadership in her own party has declined to include interstate medical compacts on the agenda.
Such compacts would allow health care workers licensed in other states to work in New Mexico, which advocates say would address the state’s shortage of medical professionals. New Mexico is a member of just one interstate compact agreement — for nurses — and is one of only four states that participate in one or fewer compacts. Earlier this year, lawmakers passed seven compact agreements out of the state House, but all stalled in the state Senate.
Earlier this month, the governor said the special session would primarily focus on federal cuts to programs such as Medicaid. She has also indicated the agenda was set in negotiations with lawmakers in the majority party, as previous special sessions without prior agreements have tended to fall apart.
However, on Friday, policy group Think New Mexico —which has advocated for interstate compacts —warned the state could lose out on millions of federal dollars for rural hospitals if lawmakers don’t move to approve agreements before a November deadline. The governor in turn urged lawmakers to reconsider including the issue when lawmakers convene on Oct. 1.
“I’m going to keep pushing, and frankly, at this point, fingers crossed,” Lujan Grisham said.
Lujan Grisham still has not released the official proclamation that sets the topics and timing for the session, but is likely to do so shortly before lawmakers convene, much like the special session last year.
Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) told Source NM in a statement Monday he remains opposed to adding medical compacts to the special session agenda. “Healthcare policy should not be held hostage to short-term grant deadlines,” Wirth said. “Making permanent changes to professional licensing standards based on temporary funding availability and an ever-changing set of rules coming from the federal government sets a dangerous precedent.”
Wirth also argued in his statement that lawmakers “need the time” between now and next year’s January session “to examine how interstate compacts would interact with New Mexico’s existing laws and ensure that any changes truly serve the long-term interests of providers and patients.”
While Senate Democrats may not be persuaded, Republican lawmakers  are already on board and pushed for inclusion of health worker compacts as part of the special session agenda last week in a letter to the governor’s office.
“Failing to address interstate medical compacts is going to make the special session far less special for New Mexicans seeking results,” Senate Floor Minority Leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) told Source NM in a statement.
In comments to reporters Monday, Lujan Grisham noted that Republicans don’t have the votes to circumvent the Democratic majority.
“I know the Republicans are anxious and disappointed, and some of them are a bit angry about this. They don’t have the votes. If they can show me a path where they can get something on the floor, and they can get Democratic votes, well, that maybe that would entertain a different response,” she said.
Compacts aside, Lujan Grisham said she remains committed to using the special session to address shortfalls from the federal budget bill.
“I need to do everything in my power to make sure that we stabilize health care coverage for the Mexicans and food security,” Lujan Grisham said.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Andrea Chamblee thinks her late husband, John McNamara, would be “humbled and kind of flabbergasted” to see the highway marker in his honor.
But she also thinks the sign dedicating Annapolis’ Rowe Boulevard to “The Capital Gazette Five” is an important reminder.
The sign, dedicated Monday, is in memory of the five employees of the Capital Gazette newspaper who lost their lives on June 28, 2018, when a gunman opened fire in the newsroom. Besides McNamara, the victims were Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, Rebecca Smith and Wendi Winters.
“I want them [motorists] to think about the environment where it’s still dangerous to be a journalist,” Chamblee said during a brief interview. “It’s dangerous to tell the truth. These people told the truth with transparency and kindness. I hope this sign reminds people to not take that for granted.”
Family, friends and colleagues attended Monday’s unveiling. The highway marker is the city’s second memorial to the Capital Gazette victims, after the dedication of the Guardians of the First Amendment Memorial at Newman Street Park in 2021.
But speakers Monday said the memorials are about more than just the shootings.

“Today’s marker is more than recognizing them in that tragic moment. It’s to remind all of us of something that’s very important: The First Amendment is the most important amendment that we have in this Constitution,” said Carl Snowden, convener of the Council of African American Leaders, which advocated for the highway marker.
“When we unveil this marker, we want to say it loud and clear to all who are here, the media is not the enemy of the people,” he said.
The marker sits just down the street from the State House, where it will be seen by lawmakers and people coming to make their voices heard. That includes Chamblee, a member of the Howard County Board of Education who became active with the Maryland chapter of Moms Demand Action, which seeks to end gun violence and engage in suicide prevention, after her husband’s killing.
Justin Towles, chair of the Maryland Transportation Commission, said his group debated “pretty vigorously” to determine whether the marker met the charge to recognize individuals of significance to the state.
“Our commission was not comfortable moving forward unless we knew that we could look at every single one of these individuals and be comfortable that it was not this tragedy that made them significant, but it was the life that they lived,” said Towles, who grew up in Anne Arundel County and knew a few of the victims
“We decided that this dedication, while for the Capital Gazette Five, it is not honoring the tragedy that happened,” he said. “It is honoring those five individuals for each being a Marylander of significance and we’re comfortable doing that.”
Winters Larca, daughter of Wendi Winters, said she appreciates the gesture to honor her mother and the other Capital Gazette employees.
“I’m happy that there is a permanent memorial dedicated to them and that it’s something as significant as part of Rowe Boulevard, which is the critical junction into the city,” she said during a brief interview. “Obviously it doesn’t bring them back, but it’s nice to know other people are thinking about them too, even all these years later.”

This story by John Lippman was first published by the Valley News on Sept. 21.
NORWICH — The mystery of a car that was stolen in the dead of the night from a farm in Norwich and then vanished has been solved. Now the car’s owner has invited the thief to a dessert party because of the bond they share.
The safe and happy outcome on Thursday began with an unsettling scene caught by surveillance cameras early the previous Sunday morning. Footage showed an older man in pajamas shuffling about Sweetland Farm before driving off in a red 2017 Honda HR-V, which had been parked behind the farm store and belonged to one of the farm’s employees.
Shelagh Harvard, a Sweetland Farm employee who lives in a house behind the farm store, said she happened to be awake reading in bed in the early Sunday morning hours when she heard “revving in the driveway” from outside her window.
She said it was not unusual for her to leave the keys in her car. “It’s a farm, you know,” Harvard said.
At first, Harvard told the Valley News in an interview Thursday morning, she thought the motor sound might be coming from a vehicle belonging to guests who had been attending a wedding party down the road and were using Sweetland Farm’s store lot for parking.
“But then I thought a few minutes later, OK, what if it’s not and I got up to look out and my car was gone,” Harvard said. Although it was past 3 a.m., she immediately called 911 to report that her car had just been stolen.
Harvard, who has managed Sweetland Farm’s farm store for three years, has only owned the bright red 2017 Honda H-RV for a few months.
The farm store has outdoor surveillance cameras, and when Harvard and police reviewed the video footage, it showed images of an older man dressed in what appeared to be pajamas and carrying what looked like a blanket or clothing in one arm and wandering about the property.
Camera footage also captured the man struggling to maneuver Harvard’s vehicle with him “reversing the wrong way … he had a heck of a time just getting out of my driveway, like five minutes just to get to the road” before heading south on Route 132 and vanishing out of the camera’s range, Harvard related.Vermont State Police, in a news release asking for the public’s help in locating Harvard’s stolen vehicle, said it was last observed “traveling into Hanover.”Hanover Police Capt. Michael Schibuola said police had received a “be on the lookout” alert for the red Honda H-RV and a “possible vehicle matching the description was seen on a camera going south” on South Main Street toward Lebanon. The information was passed along to Lebanon and Hartford police.After that, Harvard’s car appeared to vanish into thin air with no further sightings.
But Harvard said what she saw on the surveillance video did not strike her as a typical car theft. For one, the video showed that the trespasser was on the property for about two hours, opening the doors of other vehicles parked in the lot and seeming not to be in any hurry.
“You wouldn’t take a couple hours to do that,” Harvard said. A real thief “would be in-and-out.”

Harvard said what she saw on the surveillance appeared to be the behavior of person who might be suffering from something of which she is familiar — dementia.
Harvard is the niece of Andy Harvard, a world-class mountaineer who ran the Dartmouth Outing Club. He died at age 69 in 2019 after being diagnosed with early onset of Alzheimer’s 10 years earlier.
In 2008, claiming performance issues, Dartmouth fired Andy Harvard, an alum, from his post as director of the outdoors program. Nine months later, he was diagnosed with the uncommon form of dementia that strikes people younger than 65.
He and his wife, Kathy Harvard, battled Dartmouth for years to get the college to recognize that his disease was at the root of the reasons for his dismissal, but they were not able to reach a settlement.
“My fear was that it was an elderly man who lives alone and nobody’s reported missing and therefore he is not missed and is in trouble,” Shelagh Harvard said.
Shelagh Harvard contacted Norwich Community Nurse Mary Stevens to ask whether she knew anyone who fit the description of the man in the surveillance video.
She also posted notices on the Hanover, Thetford and Stafford Listservs, asking people to “please help find my car” and noting camera footage shows “an individual that police say may be an elderly male allegedly involved in the theft.”
Stevens said when she watched the video of the shadowy figure shuffling about her reaction “knowing what I know about what people with dementia look like” was that it depicted “someone who was confused and looking for something.”
Stevens in turn shared the video with the community nursing group’s board chair, the town’s former community nurse and Norwich’s fire chief to ask if the man in the video could be anyone they might be familiar with.
“None of them recognized him,” Stevens said, which only increased worries that the man “must be somebody who lives alone. Where did he go? It’s concerning.”
Stevens said she even took it upon herself to drive roads nearby Sweetland Farm, such as Academy Road and Kerwin Hill Road, to look for a red Honda H-RV perhaps parked in a driveway.
But without any trace of Shelagh Harvard’s car, the unidentified man “could have driven it into the river for all we know,” Stevens said.
Shelagh Harvard’s decision to post a plea on online bulletin boards turned out to be a smart move.
On Thursday afternoon, Shelagh Harvard said she was contacted by a woman who lives near Sweetland Farm to report that Harvard’s car was at her ex-husband’s apartment at his senior living residence in West Lebanon.The woman said her 81-year-old former husband, for whom she has been caring while his dementia worsens, was staying at her Norwich residence on Saturday and unknown to her had wandered off in the middle of the night. The next day the woman received a call from people at her former husband’s senior living complex reporting that he was walking around and “appeared confused,” Shelagh Harvard said the woman told her.
Shelagh Harvard said she does not know how the woman realized that her former husband had driven back to his residence with her car. But in any case the woman made the connection to Shelagh Harvard’s car and the red Honda H-RV at her former husband’s residence when she read a post on one of the online bulletin boards.
“She was apologizing a bunch and I said, ‘You know what? I totally understand and I’m so glad he’s OK and nobody else is hurt,’” Shelagh Harvard said, telling the caller that she is very familiar with dementia due to the experience of her uncle, Andy Harvard.
By happenstance, Shelagh Harvard added, she informed the caller that on Oct. 4 she plans to host her Third Annual Dessert Night Alzheimer’s Walk Benefit at her aunt, Kathy Harvard’s, home in Hanover.
Shelagh Harvard organizes the dessert party annually to raise awareness and funds for dementia research in advance of the Oct. 26 Alzheimer’s walk in Hanover.
“She said, ‘That would so wonderful. This is so isolating. It would just be so nice to be with people who understand what I’m going through,” Shelagh Harvard said.
On Friday afternoon, after Shelagh Harvard had gone to West Lebanon to retrieve her car, she confirmed that the woman would be attending the Oct. 4 dessert party for Alzheimer’s research with a plus one: her former husband.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)With time running short,  the state Senate approved additional money for Medicaid insurance to avoid threatened payment reductions to a broad range of health care providers, which legislators warned could result in sick people losing their medical care. 
The Senate added $90 million to $600 million already approved to cover Medicaid cost increases from inflation, changes in the types of care delivered, and other factors, and added $83.6 million for Medicaid administration. 
The hitch is that Senate wrapped $103.5 million for a children’s hospital into the bill, which House Republicans have said they don’t want included. If  the General Assembly doesn’t approve more Medicaid money soon, the state Department of Health and Human Services has said it will cut health care provider payment rates.
The medical funding bill was one of eight directing spending to discrete areas of state government that the Senate approved Monday. Republicans in the state House and Senate have not been able to agree on a comprehensive spending plan for the budget year that began July 1. Legislators are debating mini-budgets instead.
The legislature allocated $600 million to cover changes in the state’s Medicaid program in a stopgap budget approved in July, but that was short of the $819 million DHHS  said is needed. In response, DHHS announced it would reduce payments to a wide range of health care providers beginning Oct. 1. 
Looming over the debate over House bill 562 was the prospect of patients losing health care and medical workers losing their jobs if the House does not agree to a medical funding bill that includes the children’s hospital. 
Democrats in the House and Senate asked for a “clean” bill dealing only with the additional money for Medicaid, fearing an impasse between House and Senate Republicans will trigger reduced payments to providers who will then cut medical services. 
“People with disabilities are in a blind panic over this,” Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) said in the Senate budget committee. Grafstein said she supports the children’s hospital, but if the House rejects the Senate budget proposal, the hospital doesn’t get its money and the health care is cut. 
“Somebody with a disability who relies on Medicaid day after day after day, they may lose their provider,” she said. “Little providers are going to go out of business. These cuts are going to hit them hard.”
Sen. Michael Lee (R-New Hanover) said the legislature agreed in 2023 to fund the children’s hospital, and the Senate proposal makes good on the final installment. The money is coming from the 2021 federal COVID-19 relief fund, called the American Rescue Plan Act, he said. “There are people relying on it, they’ve been relying on it, they’ve made plans on it, and we need to do it.”
The Senate approved the bill unanimously, despite Democrats’ warnings that it may die in the House.
At a press conference Monday, a group of House Democrats also pushed for a bill that excludes any provisions that might derail the additional Medicaid funding.

An impasse will result in people losing lifesaving services, said Rep. Julia Greenfield (D-Mecklenburg). 
“They are playing with our lives,” she said. “Your health should never, ever  be a bargaining chip.”
Speakers at a rally Monday morning outside the Legislative Building spoke about the importance of passing a comprehensive budget and fully funding Medicaid.
Patrick Dunnagan of Raleigh talked about how massive kidney failure transformed his life at age 25, and how Medicaid was crucial to his treatment.
Dunnagan said he went from enjoying outdoor adventures to losing his health, his job, his independence, and the ability to stay alive on his own.
“As kidney disease began to reshape my life, Medicaid was there to help make sure I had access to emergency treatments and surgeries,” he said.
Among the other bills the Senate considered would provide raises to law enforcement officers, fund construction projects and support economic development plans.
 Senate Republicans block Planned Parenthood from Medicaid dollars 
The Senate approved House bill 192,  which would prohibit Planned Parenthood from participating in Medicaid.
North Carolina Republicans have worked to curtail Planned Parenthood in recent years, but the organization could still receive $830,000 through Medicaid, said Sen. Amy Galey (R-Alamance).
Witnesses spoke against the measure in committee.
Senator Amy Galey (R-Alamance Co.)
Paige Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said the bill is about playing politics.
“It is about taking health care away from the people who need it,” she said.
If the bill becomes law, North Carolinians would lose access to birth control, cancer screenings, and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, Johnson said.
Michaela Barnes, a 14th generation North Carolinian, said her family has been in the area since 1660. Her ancestors fought in the Revolutionary and Civil Wars.
“I am going through a divorce right now in a domestic violence situation where the only option that I had was Planned Parenthood,” Barnes said. “Medicaid is used to give life saving health care to those who cannot afford it.”
Another speaker, Morgan Pixa, said the organization helped him with an urgent medical issue when he was not able to receive care from his primary provider.
Galey said she does not support Planned Parenthood providing services because she thinks “they indoctrinate.” Upon questioning from another committee member, she clarified she does not have a medical objection.
“I think that Planned Parenthood is not a good faith organization,” Galey said.
Late in the day, the Senate  passed a bill allocating funds to recovery from Tropical Storm Chantal and other disasters.
The State Emergency Response and Disaster Relief Fund provides $65.5 million in nonrecurring funds for the 2025-2026 fiscal year.
Of this amount, $55 million goes to the Department of Public Safety’s Division of Emergency Management (NCEM) for the State Match Fund and $6 million to NCEM in the form of grants to individuals and families.
The sum also allows $1.5 million to Warren Wilson College and $1 million to the Board of Governors for the University of North Carolina at Asheville, for the purpose of repairing and renovating buildings damaged by Hurricane Helene.
For transportation, the measure appropriates $750,000 to the RDU Airport Authority for costs with expanding direct flights to Dublin, Ireland. Additionally, there will be $3.6 million for hangar improvements at the Tri-County Airport and $10.4 million recurring to the Coastal Carolina Regional Airport Authority for infrastructure needs and site clearing.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4750-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-22 19:57:32.751152

UCLA and University of California leaders are fighting Trump’s demands for a $1.2 billion settlement over a litany of accusations, including that the campus permits antisemitism.


A federal judge in California today ordered the Trump administration to restore 500 National Institutes of Health grants that it suspended at UCLA in July over accusations the campus tolerates antisemitism.
Judge Rita Lin’s decision provides researchers at the university a major respite as UCLA and University of California leaders contend with Trump’s demands for a $1.2 billion settlement over a litany of accusations, including that the campus permits antisemitism. It’s a claim that more than 600 Jewish members of the University of California community in a public letter say is “misguided and punitive.” Meanwhile, UCLA’s leadership highlighted its efforts to combat antisemitism days before Trump’s settlement demands.“Cutting off hundreds of millions of research funds will do nothing to make UCLA safer for Jews nor diminish antisemitism in the world,” the public letter signed by UC Jewish professors, students, staff and alumni says. 
Last week several UC faculty groups and unions sued to halt the administration from pursuing its settlement demands, describing them as an “unlawful threat of federal funding cuts” to “illegally coerce the UC into suppressing free speech and academic freedom rights.” 
Lin’s decision follows her string of orders since June that have restored hundreds of other UC research grants from multiple agencies. Her injunction is preliminary; the trial is ongoing. Today’s action restores virtually all of the 800 UCLA science grants the government froze in July — a value of more than $500 million. Lin’s order today of restoring 500 National Institutes of Health grants follows her decision last month that 300 National Science Foundation grants suspended in July be restored. The federal government complied with her August order by reversing the freezes.
The science grants pay for research into life-saving drugs, dementia, heart disease in rural areas, robotics education and a whole gamut of science inquiries across the country. They help fuel the country’s research enterprise and are the top source of federal research grants at the UC. The UC system has battled the Trump administration over various efforts to slash its funding since President Donald Trump’s second term began. The science funding is also a key source of income and training for graduate students, who are the next generation of publicly funded academics. 
Lin’s latest order also restores three Department of Transportation grants and an unknown number of Department of Defense grants that the Trump administration terminated this year.Lin gave lawyers for the Trump administration until Sept. 29 to submit a report confirming that they complied with her orders to restore the grants.
How we got here
In June, Lin issued a preliminary injunction, later upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, that ordered the Trump administration to restore 114 National Science Foundation grants and several dozen other grants from the Environmental Protection Agency and National Endowment for the Humanities at all UC campuses. 
Then in August, Lin sided with the lawyers for the researchers in undoing the funding freezes for the 300 National Science Foundation grants. The lawyers argued that the Trump administration’s surprising decision in late July to suspend those grants violated Lin’s June injunction.Lin’s latest order similarly says that the federal government violated her June preliminary injunction when it suspended the 500 National Institutes of Health grants at UCLA, also in late July. Core to her rationale is that the science agencies terminated UC grants en masse, in violation of a law, the Administrative Procedure Act, that requires federal agencies to explain in individual detail why the grants were terminated. Her rationale echoes other federal district court rulings about grant terminations.
How this relates to recent Supreme Court decision
Lin’s decision also creates a potential opening for other researchers seeking to challenge their grant terminations after an August U.S. Supreme Court decision seemingly made that process harder. In that decision, the high court said the right venue to sue to get a defunded grant restored is the little-known Court of Federal Claims, not a traditional district court. A slim majority of justices said that plaintiffs need to argue in the Court of Federal Claims to get their money back while they argue in a traditional district court to challenge the policy that led to the grant’s termination in the first place.But Lin concluded that that Supreme Court decision can’t apply to the UC researchers because of a quirk in who can file suit in the Court of Federal Claims. Because research grants are contracts between a university and the federal government, only universities have “standing” to bring a suit to the Court of Federal Claims. The Supreme Court decision didn’t take on the issue of individuals, Lin wrote, but the high court justices still believed plaintiffs should have some way to argue that their funding should be restored.
Here’s how Lin’s order creates an opening: Lawyers for the federal government argued to Lin that because the plaintiffs are individual UC researchers and not the UC campuses themselves, they can’t sue at all to restore their grant funding. But Lin balked at that rationale at the Thursday hearing and in her written order today.“The district courts are the only forum where the UC researchers could defend their constitutional and statutory rights, and the Ninth Circuit has already determined that they may bring their claims here. This Court will not shut its doors to them,” Lin wrote today.She added in her written order that the lawyers for the federal government presented an “extreme” view that the researchers couldn’t sue anywhere, even in the hypothetical scenario in which the federal government terminated “the federal funding of all Black researchers, or every researcher with an Asian last name — and the researchers would have nowhere to sue to undo those wrongs, unless their universities decided to sue in the Court of Federal Claims.”
What the Trump administration has argued
In justifying the grant suspensions in July, the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health each sent UCLA letters accusing the university of using race-based admissions, allowing transgender women to compete in women’s sports and not doing enough to address antisemitism on its campus.But California barred public campuses from admitting students based on race in 1996 when voters through a ballot measure ended the practice. Representatives from the two science agencies wrote in July that though UCLA maintains it doesn’t use affirmative action, its “holistic review” admissions process is de-facto race-based admissions.The letter from the National Science Foundation said the agency believes that “UCLA’s ‘holistic review’ admissions process, which considers factors such as an applicant’s neighborhood/zip code, family income, and school profile — and invites the disclosure of an applicant’s race via personal statements — is a transparent attempt to engage in race-based admissions in all but name.” The letter from the National Institutes of Health was virtually identical.While the Supreme Court in 2023 overturned the use of race in college admissions in a 6-3 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that students are free to discuss their identities and how they overcame hardships in admissions essays.“Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise,” Roberts wrote.All three criticisms in the agencies’ July letters match the policies Trump is pursuing through executive actions to reshape higher education and the federal government. They also mirror the policy playbook fleshed out in Project 2025, a conservative publication that has shaped Trump’s current term in office.
UCLA addresses antisemitism
The UCLA grant suspensions followed a federal Department of Justice report in July that accused the campus of not doing enough to address antisemitism, particularly related to events during last year’s pro-Palestine protests and encampment. The report came months after UCLA commissioned a task force to investigate antisemitism on campus and come up with recommendations that UCLA leaders said they’d implement.
Students and faculty protesting Israel’s war in Gaza have themselves accused UCLA of bias against them, including Arab, Muslim and Jewish UCLA community members.
Trump’s settlement demand “does not make Jewish students safer,” the Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California said in a statement last month. The advocacy group is composed of 39 organizations that offer family services, political advocacy, immigration legal aid and other services.  
The Jewish public affairs committee acknowledged several strides UC and UCLA made to curtail antisemitism and promote safer campuses. “Meaningful progress is already underway in California,” the group wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/040825_UCLA-Funding-Cuts_JH_CM_26.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-22 19:57:32.751152

Little signed an executive order creating the Idaho Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force while he was attending the Western Governors’ Association’s Energy Superabundance conference at Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. 
“The world is changing rapidly,” Little said Monday. “Energy demand is expected to increase by an unprecedented 30% in the near future. We cannot do that with our legacy energy. We are going to have to have scalable, safe nuclear energy.”
“States and nations are all searching for energy solutions,” Little added. “Advanced nuclear technology holds enormous promise to meet those needs. We are uniquely positioned here in Idaho with the lab. We are the home of the lab nation’s flagship nuclear research facility, and a global leader in innovation.”
 New task force will modernize Idaho’s LINE Commission, governor says

Little said the newly created nuclear energy task force replaces and modernizes the Leadership In Idaho Nuclear Energy Commission, or LINE Commission, which his predecessor, former Idaho Gov. Butch Otter, created. 
Little said the new task force will build off the LINE Commission’s legacy and piggyback on a series of nuclear energy executive orders President Donald Trump issued earlier this year. 
Given a spike in projected energy demand, Little said the United States is in a race with other countries to win the energy war – and the stakes are high.
“We are in a race with our enemies about what country is going to win this,” Little said.

The Energy Superabundance conference and Little’s executive order are coinciding with what Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner describes as a nuclear renaissance or resurgence in the United States. 
Idaho National Laboratory, which includes an 890-square mile research complex located in the desert outside of Idaho Falls, is considered the country’s lead nuclear energy national laboratory. While it operates four nuclear reactors today, Idaho National Laboratory is in the process of permitting and building new nuclear reactors for the first time in 50 years.  
Wagner told conference participants that a combination of massive growth in projected energy demand, fueled in part by AI data centers, support from the federal government and an infusion of money from private businesses are all contributing to the nuclear renaissance.
For example, shortly before Monday’s conference began, a company called Oklo held a groundbreaking ceremony outside Idaho Falls for its small modular reactor. Billionaire Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, served as chairman of Oklo’s board until April. 
“This is not new reactors coming in, being demonstrated 10 years from now,” Wagner said Monday, speaking generally about the overall nuclear renaissance. “This is multiple new reactors being demonstrated in the next few years.”

In addition to Little, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and Nuclear Regulatory Commission Commissioner Bradley Crowell also spoke and took questions at the Energy Superabundance conference. 
Cox attended the entire conference on Monday, and he and Wagner were available for interviews with news reporters. 
However, Little returned to Boise shortly after signing the executive order Monday afternoon and efforts to interview Little on Monday were unsuccessful. 
“We have to significantly increase the amount of energy that we are producing,” Cox said during the conference. “We have to move very, very, very quickly. We cannot move at the speed of government and at the speed with which we have been moving in the past. We really have to hyper scale.”
 What will Idaho’s new nuclear energy task force do?

The new task force will include Idaho elected officials, the director of Idaho National Laboratory or a designee, private sector representatives from the nuclear industry, college and university representatives, an official with an Idaho electric utility, officials from the Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and more. 
According to the executive order Little signed, the new nuclear energy task force will advise him on topics including spent nuclear fuel, energy resilience and security, regulatory and legislative reforms and policy recommendations.
The new task force will also explore workforce development strategies and issue a report on its findings to the governor every year.

Transit officials late last month renewed their decade-old effort to require the borough to repay $5.8 million of the $12.3 million in grants spent between 2002 and 2008 to fund infrastructure for the defunct M/V Susitna ferry, including a ferry terminal at Port MacKenzie.
If they do not return the funds, the borough could face fines and the withholding of current federal grant payments, according to an Aug. 28 debt letter sent to borough officials from the Federal Transit Administration. The remaining $6.5 million was forgiven because the money was used for design work on the project, the debt notice states.
A borough appeal sent to transit officials on Wednesday on behalf of the Mat-Su Borough requests that the debt be further reduced to as little as $1.5 million, according to the letter.
The nearly $80 million Susitna ferry, which never operated or carried passengers, was given to the borough in 2010 through a series of federal earmarks.
Billed as the world’s first ice-breaking passenger catamaran and designed by the U.S. Navy, it was intended to transport passengers between Point MacKenzie and downtown Anchorage. But the project stalled in 2011 as funding to finish its infrastructure and the political will to select and build a dock site in Anchorage dried up.
The borough stored the ferry near Ketchikan and ultimately sold it to the Philippine Red Cross in 2015 for about $1.8 million. The Red Cross resold it to the Philippine Coast Guard earlier this year.
All told, the borough spent about $15 million in local funding on the project.
The new borough debt appeal asks transit officials to either settle the debt by accepting the net proceeds from the ferry’s sale – about $1.5 million – or reduce the bill to factor in the depreciated value of the Port MacKenzie ferry terminal, constructed with grant funds.
The debt should be lowered because the borough did not willfully misuse the funds, but instead was forced to abandon the project due to issues outside its control, including struggles to select an Anchorage landing location, the letter states.
“While MSB believes that all costs, other than the net proceeds from the sale of the ferry, should be permitted and forgiven since they were properly incurred during the term of the grants and not the result of willful misuse, it also seeks resolution of this matter,” the letter states. “As a result, (Mat-Su Borough) has proposed several options, some more appropriate and equitable than others, for FTA’s review and consideration.”
Proposed payback amounts included in the letter range from the $1.5 million ferry resale price to $3.7 million, depending on depreciation calculations and whether the repayment factors in about $295,000 worth of ferry outfitting and furnishing costs.
“At a minimum, (Mat-Su Borough) should be able to deduct eight and half years of depreciation, or 42.5%,” the letter states.
The letter is signed by Dismas N. Locaria, an attorney with the borough-contracted law firm Venable LLP, based in Washington, D.C. It was sent to transit officials following an approximately 35-minute closed-door session with the Mat-Su Assembly during a regular meeting Tuesday.
The Aug. 26 transit debt letter is the first communication from federal officials about the matter since the borough last filed an appeal in early 2017, Borough Attorney Nick Spiropoulos said in an email.
There is no set timeline for their next response, he said.

,DC,2025-09-22 23:15:54+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump ties autism to Tylenol use in pregnancy despite inconclusive scientific evidence,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-ties-autism-tylenol-use-pregnancy-despite-inconclusive-scientific-evidence,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced Monday that his administration believes it’s found one contributing factor of autism and a possible treatment, though experts have said such claims are inconclusive and not backed by scientific evidence.Trump and officials from his administration said during a press conference the Food and Drug Administration will move to update the label on Tylenol, also called acetaminophen, to reflect their concerns that it could potentially be one of the environmental causes of autism. Numerous medical organizations and the manufacturer say there is no proven link.The FDA will also publish a notice in the Federal Register to change the label on leucovorin, a pharmaceutical intended to counteract the negative effects of certain cancer medications, so that doctors can prescribe it as a potential treatment for autism. “They are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary,” Trump said. “That's, for instance, in cases of extremely high fever that you feel you can't tough it out. You can't do it. I guess there's that.”Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the FDA “is responding to clinical and laboratory studies that suggest a potential association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, including later diagnosis for ADHD and autism.”Kennedy noted, however, that the FDA recognizes that Tylenol “is often the only tool for fevers and pain in pregnancy, as other alternatives have well documented adverse effects. “HHS wants, therefore, to encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in the use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration and only when treatment is required.”Kennedy, an environmental lawyer with no medical or research training, said in April the department will shift its research into autism toward potential environmental causes, and pledged to have “some of the answers by September.”‘Not a single reputable study’Trump and Kennedy’s announcement was met with deep skepticism. Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, wrote in a statement released Monday that she's ""unsure why this announcement came today and how the conclusions were drawn.""“No new data or scientific studies were presented or shared. No new studies have been published in the literature. No new presentations on this topic were made at scientific or medical conferences,” Singer wrote. “Instead, President Trump talked about what he thinks and feels without offering scientific evidence. He said 'tough it out,' meaning don’t take tylenol or give it to your child. It took me straight back to when moms were blamed for autism. If you can’t take the pain or deal with a fever, then it’s your fault if your child has autism. That was shocking. Simply shocking.”American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists President Dr. Steven J. Fleischman wrote in a statement the Trump administration’s claim about Tylenol is “not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children.”“In more than two decades of research on the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, not a single reputable study has successfully concluded that the use of acetaminophen in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children,” Fleischman wrote. “In fact, the two highest-quality studies on this subject—one of which was published in JAMA last year—found no significant associations between use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and children’s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability.”ACOG writes on its website that women who experience headaches during pregnancy can use over-the-counter medications like Advil, also called ibuprofen, and Aleve, also known as naproxen, “for migraines that don’t get better with acetaminophen, but only in the second trimester and only for 48 hours or less at a time. It’s not clear if NSAIDs are safe for a fetus during the first trimester. Taking NSAIDs during the third trimester may lead to birth defects.""Oz wants state Medicaid programs to cover prescriptionsAt the press conference, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said leucovorin could possibly help alleviate low folate levels, which may be one potential factor in autism. ""Autism may also be due to an autoimmune reaction to a folate receptor on the brain not allowing that important vitamin to get into the brain cells,” Makary said. “We have a duty to let doctors and the public know we are going to change the label to make it available. Hundreds of thousands of kids, in my opinion, will benefit.”Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Dr. Mehmet Oz said the agency will try to ensure anyone on a government health program can have a prescription for leucovorin covered. “Over half of American children are covered by Medicaid and CHIP,” Oz said. “Upon this label change, state Medicaid programs in partnership with CMS will cover prescription leucovorin around the country. It's yours, but you have to go to a doctor to get a prescription, because they know your child, they know you and they know the medication.”Oz said he believed that “private insurance companies will rapidly follow our lead if they have not already done so.”CMS, he said, is also contacting state governments to aid the Trump administration in studying the use of leucovorin as a possible treatment for autism. “Collecting real-world data, which is what many of you have been asking us to do in the community, is fast, it is life-saving and we'll get answers based on what happens over the next few months with this approach,” Oz said. NIH research projects pickedDirector of the National Institutes of Health Jay Bhattacharya said his agency has selected 13 projects to receive a share of $50 million to look for autism’s root causes and therapies. “The studies feature a new kind of science called exposomics, where scientists consider environmental and medical factors, nutrition, events during pregnancy in combination with biology and genetics to answer vital questions about autism,” Bhattacharya said.Bhattacharya also gave a brief description of autism spectrum disorder, noting it “encompasses a very wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild difficulties in social interactions to profoundly autistic children who experience severe disabilities in speech and behavior.“Given this wide range of symptoms across the spectrum, it seems certain that there will be a wide range of biological contributors to explaining the cause.”‘Findings are not entirely consistent’The Autism Science Foundation wrote in a statement released earlier this month that “low maternal folate levels during early pregnancy have been linked in several studies to an increased risk of autism in children, though findings are not entirely consistent.”“Data suggesting that leucovorin may be effective come from four small randomized controlled trials, all using different doses and different outcomes, and in one case, reliant on a specific genetic variant,” the Autism Science Foundation notes. “This science is still in very early stages, and more studies are necessary before a definitive conclusion can be reached.”As for Tylenol, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine released a statement earlier this month that it “continues to advise physicians and patients that acetaminophen is an appropriate medication to treat pain and fever during pregnancy.”“At this time, the weight of scientific evidence that acetaminophen use during pregnancy causes an increased risk for autism or ADHD is simply inconclusive,” SMFM President Sindhu K. Srinivas wrote in the statement. “In maternal-fetal medicine, as in all of medicine, our recommendations are based on an evaluation of rigorous research and data, clinical expertise, and our patients’ values and preferences.” The statement goes on to say that “untreated fever and pain during pregnancy carry significant maternal and infant health risks. Untreated fever, particularly in the first trimester, increases the risk of miscarriage, birth defects, and premature birth, and untreated pain can lead to maternal depression, anxiety, and high blood pressure.” Former Chief Medical Officer at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Debra Houry, who resigned from the agency earlier this year, said on a call with reporters before the announcement that she was concerned the conclusions will be premature and not based on solid science. “As of three weeks ago, we hadn't seen evidence that acetaminophen was linked with autism, so it's curious to know how quickly that was developed,” Houry said. Tylenol has information on its website rebutting the assertion that its product has been conclusively linked as a contributor to autism diagnoses. “Credible, independent scientific data continues to show no proven link between taking acetaminophen and autism,” its website states. The company adds that the best advice is for people to talk “to your healthcare professional before taking or administering acetaminophen.”",,,,2025-09-22 19:57:32.751152

The Arkansas Legislative Council’s Hospital, Medicaid and Developmental Disabilities Study subcommittee voted with no dissent to advance the contract to the council’s executive subcommittee. If approved by the executive subcommittee Thursday and the full council Friday, the contract goes into effect immediately.
A 2025 law requires the Hospital, Medicaid and Developmental Disabilities Study panel to propose draft legislation on potential changes to public assistance and workforce development programs by Oct. 1, 2026 in preparation for the 2027 legislative session.
The agreement with the Georgia Center for Opportunity (GCO) will expire Jan. 26, with the option for a six-month extension, according to the contract.

Exhibit F2- GCO Scope of Services and Fees 
The center will analyze information from several state agencies, including the Department of Education, the Department of Human Services and the Department of Commerce’s Division of Workforce Services.
Rachel Barkley, the initiative’s project manager and executive director of GCO’s Alliance for Opportunity, described the organization as “a multi-state coalition working on reforming social services and workforce services to help people rise from poverty into work.”
Some questions to ask in the review of Arkansas’ programs include how many offices exist for the same types of services and how administrative costs compare to the costs of the programs themselves, Barkley said.
GCO has done similar work with Louisiana, in which the organization recommended that the state allow people to sign up for Medicaid and food assistance in the same offices, Barkley said.
“This is really relevant to the One Big Beautiful Bill work requirements, that data being in the same place [is] important,” she said, referring to the federal budget reconciliation law that will institute cuts to Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in November.
The largest source of Medicaid savings will come from the law’s work requirements, which will reduce the number of insured low-income Americans, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects.
Arkansas implemented a Medicaid work requirement in 2018 that a federal judge struck down the following year after it caused 18,000 Arkansans to lose coverage. Earlier this year, the state requested a waiver to require adults in the Medicaid expansion program to work, volunteer, attend school or be caregivers in order to receive the full slate of benefits. The Path to Prosperity program would not include the reporting requirements that the 2018 policy did.
Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville (Arkansas Secretary of State)
Rep. Mary Bentley, a Perryville Republican and the subcommittee’s House chair, praised Arkansas’ SNAP and Medicaid work requirements and the proposed GCO study on Monday.
“We’re spending millions of dollars, but we have actually no idea what our return on investment is and why people are still not working,” Bentley said.
It costs Arkansas more than $2.2 billion annually to support the roughly 220,000 “able-bodied, working-age adults” in the Medicaid expansion program, an estimated 90,000 of whom are unemployed, according to the January letter to the federal government seeking a waiver to implement Path to Prosperity.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medicaid-scaled-2-1536x1024-1-1024x6831745922858-1.jpg,,,2025-09-22 19:57:32.751152

PSC Vice President Jennifer Fielder said Monday the idea to amend a policy to require just three commission votes instead of four to request the governor suspend a commissioner would make […],"Montana Public Service Commission (via PSC Twitter account). The Montana Public Service Commission vice president wants to make it easier for the PSC to ask the governor to remove an elected commissioner.
PSC Vice President Jennifer Fielder said Monday the idea to amend a policy to require just three commission votes instead of four to request the governor suspend a commissioner would make it easier for the commission to “gain control of actions at the agency.”
If adopted, another proposed policy change to remove a commissioner as a PSC officer also would require just three votes instead of four.
The PSC is made up of five commissioners elected by district and currently all Republican.
Montana law gives the governor the authority to suspend a commissioner if a complaint is made “and good cause shown.” The governor also may appoint a replacement during the suspension if he believes one is necessary.
The proposed policy changes come in the midst of a political fight with PSC President Brad Molnar that has spilled beyond the agency to the Governor’s Office and the court.
Molnar is under investigation at the PSC for allegations of unprofessional conduct.
He has acknowledged making politically insensitive statements but has characterized the investigation — and hiring of outside legal counsel and a communications and management firm by the agency — as a costly overreaction.
The dispute made its way to the Governor’s Office when Fielder, on behalf of an internal “response team” handling complaints against Molnar, asked the governor to suspend Molnar so the team could do its work without alleged interference or retaliation.
Molnar has denied interfering with the investigation but has said he used free speech rights to publicly defend himself.
The fight landed in Lewis and Clark County District Court when Molnar’s lawyer argued the complaint to Gov. Greg Gianforte failed to follow PSC policy.
On behalf of Molnar, lawyer Matthew Monforton requested the court bar the governor from suspending Molnar to protect the democratic process.
District Court Judge Mike Menahan granted a temporary prohibition on suspension because the request didn’t come with four “yes” votes by the commission as required by PSC policy.
The request came from the internal “response team,” and a separate proposed policy change would allow the team itself to request the governor suspend a commissioner if it finds the commissioner is interfering with its work.
But the judge also said Gianforte could take up a complaint he received that was “properly filed” under the PSC policy in the future.
Monday, Fielder said she did not have any intentions “right now” to refile a complaint with Gianforte if the PSC modified its policies.
However, she said she is focused on working through the current issues before the PSC and cooperating with the court process.
“I’m certainly not whipping votes of commissioners to take any specific actions,” Fielder said.
She also said she herself had not communicated with Gianforte about the matter.
She said she was not at liberty to discuss whether any members of the internal “response team” had communicated with the governor or a representative of his office.
However, Molnar said he believes the report into his alleged misconduct is complete — and that it may have been complete even as his opponents argued to a judge that it couldn’t be finished due to his interference.
“They asked for an injunction to be lifted because they can’t complete the report unless I am stymied,” Molnar said.
Last Tuesday, the parties argued in court over whether the judge should continue to maintain the prohibition on blocking the governor from suspending Molnar. A decision is pending.
Molnar said he learned last Wednesday the report was already finished, and he believes it might have been done one day earlier — when his opponents were arguing the judge needed to stop him from getting in the way of completing it.
“The report is done. They lied to the judge,” Molnar said.
In an email last Wednesday obtained by the Daily Montanan, Commissioner Randy Pinocci said he also was concerned the report was complete but the “response team” was stalling its release to commissioners.
“I’m thinking there’s a possibility this report is done or simply needs a few touchups and then will be released after President Molnar is forced to step aside temporarily,” Pinocci said. “If we are purposely sitting on this report waiting for President Molnar to step aside, I do not believe this is proper.”
Pinocci could not be reached by phone for additional comment. He was the only vote at a Sept. 3 meeting in support of Molnar’s unsuccessful bid to recall the complaint to the Governor’s Office.
Fielder said Monday she could not comment on whether the report was complete as it was part of the proceedings of the “response team.” However, she said the team still has work to do.
“We are attempting to complete the work that’s assigned, but the work is not finished yet because of so many attempts at disruptions,” Fielder said.
Molnar said he is concerned he may not see the report at all, and a policy change could mean he loses elected office despite the will of the voters in his district.
“Of course, the governor can relieve an appointed person,” Molnar said. “It’s a lot different when it’s an elected person.”
He said the action would effectively mean he’s fired.
“(But) you can’t fire an elected official. You can only suspend them without pay, and then they’re simply gone,” Molnar said.
The “response team” has commissioner members and staff members, and Molnar said he doesn’t believe staff should be able to ask the governor to suspend a commissioner.
He said he also doesn’t believe the governor should get to appoint a new commissioner with a 3-2 vote of the PSC.
Fielder said she would comment further on the proposed policy changes at a yet-to-be-scheduled public meeting.
In general, she said the PSC code of conduct has been effective in some cases, but not all.
“It’s also become time consuming and expensive to deal with this complaint — or series of complaints — with our current president,” Fielder said.
She said the bar for disciplining a commissioner is high and needs to be high, but she also said a majority of a quorum can make a decision on most major regulatory matters — or two out of the five commissioners.
“Some (policy) adjustments I think would be helpful to make the policy actually work more effectively for the agency and the public we serve,” Fielder said.
She said the proposed policy change would require at least 10 days of public notice before the PSC takes action.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/600x200-PSC.jpg,,,2025-09-22 19:57:32.751152

(Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder)ATLANTA —  A key vaccine advisory panel at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has indefinitely postponed a controversial change to guidelines on administering hepatitis B vaccines to newborn babies, and altered long-standing recommendations around COVID-19 vaccine access for children and adults, though a proposal to require prescriptions for all individuals seeking the shot narrowly failed.
The panel also voted to reverse a decision they made only Thursday that would have prevented updated guidelines on the MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, from applying to children enrolled in the Vaccines for Children program.
CDC vaccine panel votes to limit use of a childhood vaccine as COVID, hepatitis B decisions loom

Vaccines for Children is a federal program which covers the cost of vaccines for more than half of American children. The decision to implement different standards for children enrolled in VFC caused confusion among top health officials as well as some committee members when it was introduced Thursday.
Jason Goldman, the president of the American College of Physicians who also serves as a liaison to the committee, criticized Thursday’s vote, arguing that the changes were not backed by scientific evidence.
“Would you consider that the second vote actually revealed the truth, that you do not have the data or evidence to challenge the current standing and that there is no associated harm?” Goldman asked the committee.
The committee’s reversal on Friday standardizes the updated MMRV vaccine recommendations for all children. If ACIP’s recommendations are approved by CDC officials, doctors will be advised to administer separate MMR and varicella vaccines for all children under 4 years of age.
 ACIP tables a rule delaying Hepatitis B vaccine for newborns

In what appeared to be another reversal, the panel shelved a resolution that sought to alter current CDC recommendations around hepatitis B vaccines for newborn children.
The current three-dose series for hepatitis B, an incurable viral infection that attacks the liver, includes one vaccine administered to infants within 24 hours of birth, and subsequent booster shots given a month and six months after the initial dose. ACIP has been recommending a hepatitis B vaccine for all newborn babies since 1991, which resulted in a 99% drop in serious infections between 1990 and 2019.
CDC panel opts against requiring COVID shot prescription, but wants greater emphasis on its risks

If ACIP members choose to implement the changes at a later meeting, official CDC guidelines will recommend that pediatricians delay administering the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until 30 days after birth for all children whose mothers test negative for the disease.
The panel did not provide any evidence indicating that delaying the vaccine improved children’s health, or that there were any widespread or serious instances of harm caused by administering hepatitis B vaccines to newborns. However, some ACIP members also cast doubt on the accuracy of data showing the shot is safe.
“I think that there are gaps in what we know and understand about the effects of hepatitis B, particularly on very young infants,” said Vicky Pebsworth, a committee member who is a registered nurse and who sits on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, which advocates for vaccine exemptions. “I think that the conclusion that we know that it is safe is, perhaps, premature.”
Dr. Adam Langer, who serves as the principal deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention, urged the panel to reconsider narrowing the recommendations.
“One of the primary reasons for recommending universal birth dose in the U.S. is to serve as a safety net for infants born to mothers with unknown test results,” Langer said during his presentation to the committee on Thursday.
“To date, no country in the world has reverted from universal to selective birth dose recommendations,” he added.
The meeting, which was held at the CDC’s Chamblee campus, also inspired a demonstration organized by a group of former CDC workers, who dressed up as preventable diseases and waved signs to the passing cars while the meeting was underway.
Cindy Weinbaum, who retired from the CDC in 2021, said Friday that it was commendable that the committee skipped a vote that would have recommended babies not be vaccinated for hepatitis B within a day after being born, which is the current standard. (Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder)
Cindy Weinbaum, who spent about a decade of her career at the CDC in the division of viral hepatitis, said she commended the committee for deciding to table a vote that would have changed the recommendations for hepatitis B vaccinations.
“I think it’s really commendable, actually, that they delayed this vote because they do not know the implications of not recommending a birth dose of hepatitis B,” Weinbaum said.
“So that was a nod to their lack of understanding of vaccine programs, vaccine science and the importance of certain vaccinations for kids,” she added.
Weinbaum said the proposal’s appearance on the committee’s agenda reflects the “vaccine nihilism that the current administration is supporting.” She said the shot given to newborns within the first day of their life has found itself in the “cross hairs of the anti-vax movement.”
“It’s because here’s this newborn baby and you’re very vulnerable, and sticking it with a needle is kind of a scary thing,” she said. “They just don’t understand that it’s even more scary to get liver cancer, and that’s really what we want to prevent.”
 ACIP moves to center vaccine harm

Though the committee did not implement some of its more controversial proposals, ACIP’s new members have signaled that they would like to place a greater focus on examples of vaccine harm and adverse outcomes in future policy proposals.
They have also rejected widely embraced data on vaccine safety, choosing instead to focus on isolated cases and dubious studies, including one paper claiming that rats exposed to the COVID-19 vaccine exhibited “autism-like behaviors” that was eventually retracted by the journal that published it.
Some ACIP members, including Robert Malone, also pushed back against guidelines that advise vaccinating young children and pregnant women, arguing that there is a lack of data proving definitively that vaccines are safe.
“The default should be the assumption that there is no intervention in the infant and the pregnant woman with the vaccine unless there is definitive evidence of safety,” Malone said.
But Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at Dartmouth College who has served as a past committee member, pushed back against the argument that any medical intervention should be entirely risk-free.
“I just want to point out that it’s very, very difficult to prove the absence of harm, it’s simply not a practical objective,” Meissner said.
“I think it’s important for everyone to understand that no vaccine is 100% safe and no vaccine is 100% effective,” he added. “What’s important for the provider before administering a vaccine is to think about that particular patient and does the benefit of protection exceed any possible side effect from the vaccine.”

But in a conversation with reporters after the meeting, Retsef Levi, an ACIP member and professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, signaled that the committee could revisit other vaccine recommendations in future meetings.
“I think we need to review vaccines, in general, from time to time,” Levi said. “It’s part of a good process. I don’t think that I need now to single out one vaccine or another. I think that, in general, it’s actually in the mission of ACIP. . . to actually review every vaccine.”

Peter Welch said in an interview with VTDigger. “And it would come at a time when we in Vermont are absolutely overwhelmed with the price spikes in the cost of health care. It couldn’t come at a worse time.”
In Washington, Welch is sounding the alarm on the end of these credits: As he and his fellow Senate Democrats negotiate over a bill that would continue to fund the federal government past Sept. 30, the potential extension of the tax credits has taken a central role. Republicans need seven additional ‘yes’ votes to push the budget measure through and avert a government shutdown. Welch and his fellow Senate Democrats have positioned a permanent extension of expiring federal tax credits for health insurance as a central bargaining chip in these negotiations. Its passage could preserve access to health insurance for thousands of Vermonters. 
Understanding the Tax Credits
When the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, it included tax credits to subsidize the costs for people who earn up to 400% of the federal poverty limit, when they purchased individual health insurance plans on the health care marketplace. In Vermont, that’s Vermont Health Connect, where Blue Cross Blue Shield and MVP sell plans. 
In 2021, as part of the American Rescue Plan, Congress expanded these tax credits. The so-called enhanced credits both increased the amount subsidized for people already eligible and also expanded the population of people eligible to those making more than 400% of the federal poverty line. Under that expansion, the purpose was to cap a household’s health care premium expense at 8.5% of its income. Both expansions of the tax credits were extended as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. 
Now, these enhanced tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025. 
More than 24 million people across the U.S. are enrolled in the marketplace, a participation that exploded from the 11.4 million participants in 2020 after the enhanced credits’ passage. Nearly all of those 24.3 million participants (92%) receive some amount of premium tax credit. 
Vermont is no exception to those trends: The broadened credits made marketplace insurance affordable for thousands more Vermonters, and led to a boom in enrollment in the plans. As of this January, 95% of Vermonters who buy their insurance on the marketplace receive federal premium tax credits, according to data from the Department of Vermont Health Access.
Consultants working for the department estimated that expanded subsidies equaled roughly $65 million in support for Vermont individuals and families, according to a 2024 report submitted to the Legislature. The amount that households in the state receive in enhanced subsidies is roughly one-fifth of the overall amount received through the federal Affordable Care Act premium tax credits. 
Open enrollment for 2026 health insurance plans begins on Nov. 1, which is when all of the purchasers who have been benefiting from the enhanced tax credits will face the prospect of higher out-of-pocket premiums next year for the same coverage they’ve been receiving. 
On average, that net premium for the entire subsidized population will more than double, said Adaline Strumolo, the department’s deputy commissioner overseeing Vermont Health Connect. 
Estimating the impact
Beyond an average, it’s hard to generalize the impact of the enhanced tax credits’ end, since each subsidy is individualized, based on household size and income. Households making less than 200% of the federal poverty level and those making more than 400% will see the biggest impact from the loss of the credits; they can expect to see the largest percentage of their income go toward their insurance.  
KFF, a nonprofit that provides health policy analysis and news, has created a calculator to help people determine how much they can expect their premiums to increase. VTDigger tried out some scenarios that illustrate what the loss might look like for Vermont families who buy insurance on the marketplace:
A single person in Windsor County who makes 150% the federal poverty limit ($23,475 annually) would go from paying nothing for a silver plan each month to $82 a month, or $984 per year. 
A family of four who earn $112,525 a year — 350% above the federal poverty limit — would go from paying $680 per month in premiums for all four members to get insurance on the marketplace, to $934 each month in premiums. That’s an increase of $3,048 for the year.
But the people who stand to lose the most support are those whose income is just above the line of 400% of the federal poverty limit — that is the population who will lose eligibility for the federal subsidies entirely, when the enhanced tax credits end. A single person making $63,000 a year (403% above the federal poverty line) would go from paying $446 a month for a silver plan’s premium on the marketplace to $1,277 a month; for a bronze plan, they would go from paying nothing each month to $808. For either plan, the expense totals almost an additional $10,000 annually.

For a family plan, the change becomes even more extreme: a household with two parents and two children earning 403% of the federal poverty limit would go from paying $918 a month to  $3,587 a month in premiums for the silver plan. That is an increase from $11,013 per year in cost to $43,045 a year. That $32,000 increase amounts to a shift from 8.5% of their income to 33.2%. 
There are about 6,000 Vermonters who make above 400% of the federal poverty limit and receive these enhanced ACA subsidies, according to Strumolo. This population can expect to see the most drastic loss of federal support in total dollars. 
“There is a practical reality that the price pressure is going to cause some people to go without coverage. That’s the thing we’re really concerned about,” she said. 
When people forgo health insurance entirely, it’s usually younger, healthier people, who make the financial gamble that being uninsured represents. When that happens, insurers generally raise premium prices for those remaining in the insurance pool — who are generally older or less healthy. In August, Vermont’s state regulator approved low premium increases for plans sold on the individual and small group marketplaces in the coming year, which included a price increase to account for the anticipated shift in behavior.
Strumolo stressed that while the end of the enhanced tax credits stands to be a massive loss for all those who benefit from it, the original subsidies will still exist for those making less than 400% of the federal poverty level — albeit in smaller amounts. She expects that the loss of the enhanced credits may also mean many people opt for a lower-tier plan.
“For the people who are still under 400%, there are a lot of options that are quite affordable at the bronze level, but even at the gold level,” she said. 
‘No state can cover the full gap’
The state also has its own version of its own tax credits called Vermont Premium Assistance, which is available to households making 300% of the poverty level or less. Right now, around 11,000 people rely on both subsidies, but many do not even need to dip into the state assistance, since the federal credits cover the entire cost of their plans. Strumolo says that she expects the end of the enhanced subsidies to mean that more people will need the state subsidy. As of January 2025, the state premium assistance totaled around $4.3 million of support annually. 
Still, it’s nowhere near enough: The state does not have the $65 million it would take to use Vermont Premium Assistance to fill the entire gap left by the enhanced federal tax credits, Strumolo said, citing her department’s 2024 legislative report. 
“That is not something we’re able to do on the state level. No state can cover the full gap,” Strumolo said. “That value is not one that a state budget can typically backfill.” 
If the federal credits do expire at the end of the year, she expects that her department will look for “creative solutions” in the state budget during the coming legislative session, to try to soften the drop-off for those right over 400% of the poverty line. Still, those changes would not likely come before people start to enroll in 2026 marketplace plans.

Yet Strumolo has not totally lost hope that the federal government could pull through with an extension of the subsidies. 
Senate Democrats are currently planning to withhold the votes needed to pass a bill to avert a shutdown of the federal government. A permanent extension of the enhanced tax credits is one of their primary requirements for their support. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders also said he is prepared to vote on a federal budget if Republicans agree to expand these tax credits as part of the resolution. “When you talk about raising the premiums for people on the Affordable Care Act very very high, which means that people simply aren’t going to be able to go to the doctor, that ain’t making America healthy,” he told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.  
The continuing resolution that is currently funding the federal government ends at midnight on Sept. 30. 
Strumolo hopes that at least people will know whether they will be able to rely on the enhanced tax credits before open enrollment begins. But if not, and an extension of the enhanced subsidies occurs after enrollment opens on Nov. 1, “a lot of damage will be done,” she said. “People will see what they’re facing for 2026 and make coverage decisions” that they might then want to rethink if subsidies are extended. 
Yet, she said that in that scenario her department would “bend over backwards” to make sure people can get enrolled at that point.
What happens next? 
In Washington, Welch and Sanders both have repeatedly called their colleagues’ attention to the immense costs this will incur for all their constituents, as has Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt. Welch believes that for a permanent extension of the enhanced premium tax credits to really get traction, President Donald Trump needs to weigh in.
“I’ve heard a number of my Republican colleagues say that they want to do it, but they won’t do it unless President Trump says, ‘Okay,’” Welch said, adding that for now Trump is insisting on no negotiations with Democrats. “We believe that extending premium support should absolutely be a bipartisan priority — everything that’s going to happen to Vermonters is going to happen to folks in West Virginia or Wyoming.” 
He worries about what it will mean in a state with an already extremely strained health care system. “We have this enormous pressure on the private insurance market in Vermont, where we’ve seen very, very high premium increases. We pay among the highest insurance rates anywhere,” he said. “What happens when the providers don’t get reimbursement from the government or from Medicaid, Medicare or the Affordable Care Act?”
On Capitol Hill, legislators are gearing up for a week where this question will be at the center of the negotiations surrounding whether Democrats will vote on a federal budget resolution. Welch hopes that back at home, Vermonters will not need to learn the answer the hard way.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska State Auditor Mike Foley accused a state agency director of padding his work hours to “bilk the agency” of about $20,700 in what Foley called “unearned compensation.”
In his office’s latest probe, a 54-page report released Monday, Foley took aim at the part-time executive director of the Nebraska Abstractors Board of Examiners and its governor-appointed board. A key criticism: lax oversight.

“This guy reminds me of the legendary ‘Big Foot,’ as there are rumors of his existence but few verifiable on-the-job sightings,” Foley said of Trenton Behr, who was replaced by an interim director and could not be reached for comment. 
Established in 1965, the Abstractors Board exists to ensure competent real estate abstracting, the practice of creating understandable records of leases and deeds so buyers can be fully informed of a property’s legal status.
Funded by certification and exam fees, the agency, which is governed by a five-member board, employs one part-timer. 
Key findings
Among the audit’s findings:

 Alleged fraudulent payroll payments totaling $20,700 were made to the director, who auditors said was responsible for performing all payroll processing procedures. Foley said the amount could have been “worse” had there been no cap on eligible hours to work.
The director received two payments, totaling $1,128, for an unemployment insurance claim Foley said appeared to have been filed fraudulently because Behr still had another job.
Foley said the board is responsible for reporting budget information to the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, and the auditing team said that was not completed properly for fiscal year 2025.

Foley said his team tried to talk to Behr who declined to do so through his attorney.
The board declined to comment to the Nebraska Examiner, but responded in the auditor’s report. At one point, the board reminded Foley’s team of a 2021 arrangement it made with the Department of Administrative Services for DAS to manage payment and oversight of the director’s pay.
“The DAS office should have been responsible for management of timekeeping and reporting of fraudulent hours submitted,” the board said, requesting that auditors remove or modify findings related to lack of internal controls to prevent one person from carrying out financial wrongdoings.  
The board agreed to take other actions in light of the auditor’s probe, including the review of itemized time cards submitted by the director to DAS. 
Foley’s team said that while a contract arrangement with DAS might mitigate some risk, it does not relieve the board of its oversight responsibilities. 
“A proper system of internal controls includes procedures to mitigate the risk for errors or abuse when a segregation of duties cannot be achieved,” the report said.
 Honor and responsibility

Foley, in an interview, reiterated the obligations of governing boards, even those that are volunteer. 
“There is just a common misunderstanding of what board service is all about,” he said. “It is an honor, but it is also a responsibility.”
Foley told the Examiner that his team’s findings do not convey anything negative or inappropriate about real estate-related practices.
“Nothing in our report reflects poorly on the core duties of the Abstractors Board to make sure real estate transactions are being properly handled,” he said. 
Foley said that while Behr was employed by the state, he also worked for another employer full-time and that the audit team collaborated with Albireo Energy in Omaha to examine Behr’s schedule between May 2024 and June 2025.
The audit team laid out documentation that disputed many hours Behr said he worked. In one 48-hour period examined, Behr claimed to have worked 24 hours straight for Albireo and another 10 hours for the board, Foley said. 
During a five-month stretch in 2025, timesheets filled out by Behr showed him working eight hours a day seven days a week for 140 consecutive days — “a remarkable display of fortitude and devotion to duty by a public servant,” Foley said sarcastically.
He also said Behr was a University of Nebraska at Omaha student earning a master’s degree during much of the time in question. The report documented a trip Behr made to Disneyland, while claiming hours worked for the board.
Auditors said they cooperated with the Nebraska State Patrol and the private employer looking into use of the Albireo corporate credit card. 
Foley said that Behr, after his job was terminated at the private employer, filed for benefits from the Nebraska Department of Labor, claiming a “not working” status despite his employment at the time with the board. Foley said the Labor Department paid Behr $1,128, and stopped after auditors  flagged the agency of the situation. 
Foley called the arrogance and “lack of civic consciousness” displayed by a “rogue” state employee  egregious.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montana)LOLO – Reaction time during a bear encounter is the focus of a new effort from Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks to better educate the public about grizzlies and black bears.
And it involves a bear on wheels that can reach about the same top speed as a grizzly can — more than 30 mph. The bear is not life sized, but isn’t tiny and stands on what is essentially a four-wheeled souped-up radio controlled car. 
The training trailer and its educational content come from a partnership between FWP, Montana’s Outdoor Legacy Foundation (MOLF), with support from Safari Club International (SCI) Foundation, the Western Montana Chapter of SCI, and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.
The exercise involves inert bear spray, which a person can use when the bear is rushing at them. It’s an opportunity to find out how quickly you can get the spray up, get the safety off and squeeze the trigger.
Bear spray essentially acts as a barrier, and it’s important to discharge it correctly — forward and at a slightly downward angle, as a rushing bear’s nose and mouth will be low to the ground. 
Getting these types of tips out and giving people the opportunity to see how they would react is important, FWP bear technician Brandon Davis said at an event at Travelers’ Rest State Park in Lolo this weekend.
“A lot of people don’t know there’s bears around, that there’s grizzlies, and so we’re just trying to get people involved,” Davis said. “And just give them that muscle memory so their first time pulling out a bear spray isn’t on the trail.”
Bears have personalities, unique characteristics, can be a multitude of different colors and need personal space, Davis said. They are complicated, nuanced creatures and the education and outreach is in part to help the public understand more about them.

“Some (bear encounters) are really quick, and there’s not much you can do,” Davis said. “But there are times when you can look at the behavior and read that animal.”
Surprising a bear can often evoke a quick response from the bear, and it’s important to hold your ground — timid bears will often not attack someone who holds their ground. Bears also have faux charges.
For example, a female bear with offspring will aggressively defend her cubs. Running away from a bear can actually trigger a chase response from the bear.
Grizzlies and black bears also don’t act the same — black bears seem to rely on bluffing as opposed to a mauling. A grizzly encounter can be deadly, and recognizing these signs and doing what you can to not surprise any bear is important.
Autumn means bears are trying to consume as many calories as possible in a very short time, though rarely do bears attack humans in the name of eating them specifically.
Fear is one of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to bears, he added.
“These are big animals. They have the potential to kill you. But they’re not out to hurt you,” Davis said. “I mean, there’s always an outlier, that’s a generalization, but I think most of the time they just want to get away.”
During hunting season, Davis said, hunters need to be careful about  gut piles, especially this time of year. That’s one of the times people can accidentally bring bears into an area.
Davis said FWP recently set up a camera in an area near a hunter’s kill, and within 24 hours there were bears in the area. Hikers and backpackers should also be aware of carcasses on or near trails, which was the case in a bear encounter in Yellowstone National Park earlier this month.
In that case, a solo hiker surprised a bear near a carcass. The bear charged, the hiker discharged bear spray and suffered injuries that sent the man to the hospital, but were not life-threatening.

This year has, luckily, not seen many bad human-bear conflicts. Rebekah Ficek, an Americorps VISTA member with Travelers Rest Connection, is hoping the event helps keep it that way. She helped organize the event and used to do Americorps work with FWP. That’s where her interest in the creatures began, she said.
“I just really love working with bears, because I feel like they can be misunderstood,” Ficek said. “They’re just wildlife that can kind of get a bad rap sometimes.”
Ficek demonstrated proper usage of the bear spray and helped work with a number of people who cycled through the event. There was a steady flow of people throughout the day, which staff were happy about. 
She was also happy to push back against one  particular misconception.
“A lot of people think bear spray is actually bug spray,” Ficek said. “They try and spray it on themselves. We try so hard to reiterate, no, no, no, do not spray it on yourself. It is pepper spray, not bug spray. I’ve gotten that a lot.”
In addition to a variety of literature, the event also had taxidermy bears and lots of stories, along with plenty of stickers.
FWP staff also takes old and expired bear spray at any regional FWP office. A lot of bear spray also gets left at airports when tourists buy them and then can’t be taken back on a plane.
Throughout the month of September, which is Bear Aware month for the state, the agency is hosting more Bear Aware events across the state.
On Sept. 23 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., the agency is hosting a Bear Spray Program at the FWP Region 3 office in Bozeman. Another bear awareness event will be held at the Troy Apple Festival in downtown Troy on Sept. 26 from 2 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BearEvent1-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-09-22 18:56:57.293204

“We believe the findings of the comprehensive, third-party independent review of this targeted act of violence will offer valuable insights on how college campuses improve response and preparedness moving forward,” Astrid Tuminez, president of UVU said in a statement. “We will integrate the findings into our efforts to strengthen and improve safety practices for UVU and all of Utah higher education.”

The university has implemented several measures to protect staff, faculty and students, according to a news release. Operational details are unavailable for security reasons, but there’s an increased law enforcement presence on campus.
Lawmakers on the Utah Legislature’s School Security Task Force also spoke about the independent review during a Monday meeting, saying they expect those findings to provide valuable insights on how higher education institutions across the state can strengthen safety practices.

“Once the review and criminal investigation are complete, that will be the appropriate time for thoughtful conversations. Right now, we need to allow them to proceed without distractions,” Ogden Republican Sen. Ann Millner said while reading a prepared statement.
The Legislature’s responsibility is to ensure that the FBI, the state’s Department of Public Safety, the Board of Higher Education and Utah Valley University can carry out their reviews, Millner said. 
“We pursue real, evidence-based solutions, grounded in facts, not speculation or emotional reactions,” Millner added. “So let us stand together, firm in our values, respectful in our discourse, and unwavering in our pursuit of best practices and real solutions.”
Over 3,000 people attended the Turning Point USA event on Sep. 10 in an outdoor open venue where Kirk was shot by a lone gunman on a roof. Hours after the shooting, Utah Valley University Police Chief Jeff Long called the incident “a police chief’s nightmare.” Six police officers were at the event, along other officers in plain clothes in the crowd. Kirk’s security team was also present and collaborated with UVU’s public safety officials. 



Let us know what you think...


 


The university said it won’t discuss the specific security measures that were in place on Sep. 10 beyond what has already been shared until the review is complete. The goal is to ensure an impartial review and to support ongoing campus security, according to the release.
Campus closed down for students for a week after the shooting, and many returned feeling uneasy after the event, according to a FOX 13 report.   
Millner’s Monday statement also condemned the shooting, describing it as “a direct attack on the values that define our nation.”
“There’s no place for violence here in Utah on our college campuses or in this country, our universities must remain marketplaces of ideas, places where students, faculty and the broader community can engage in open, respectful and vigorous debate,” Millner said.

Bob Ferguson speaks at Renton High School on Friday, Sept. 19, 2025, ahead of signing an executive order launching the Washington Completes FAFSA Campaign. (Photo courtesy of governor's office) Gov. Bob Ferguson has launched a campaign to increase the number of students who complete free applications for federal student aid to attend college and other education programs after high school. 
Nearly half of Washington households qualify for the financial aid, but Washington consistently ranks in the bottom five states for completion of applications, according to Ferguson’s office. 
Washington ranked 47th among states for Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, completion in 2025, with 45.3% of graduating seniors completing the application. 
“I want every eligible student to take advantage of this money for college, apprenticeships and other education or training,” Ferguson, who is a Democrat, said in a statement following the campaign’s launch at Renton High School on Friday. 
The Washington Completes FAFSA Campaign, created via executive order, establishes an advisory board to set a statewide FAFSA completion goal for each academic year, starting with the 2026-27 school year. 
The advisory board will include students, high school staff, a representative from the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, higher education personnel, and nonprofit groups. 
The board will be staffed by the Washington Student Achievement Council. 
The council and advisory board will develop and execute a plan to help schools meet the year’s FAFSA completion goal, and help support schools in setting up their own goals to increase local FAFSA completion. 
The campaign will include free training and resources for schools and community partners. The Washington Student Achievement Council is also instructed to leverage its artificial intelligence-assisted chatbot, Otterbot, to provide support for students and families completing the FAFSA application. 
FAFSA completion data will be compiled to track progress or identify gaps for low-income students accessing financial aid. The advisory board will also submit an annual report detailing its progress and goals to the governor every year. 
“Completing a financial aid application is a critical step in unlocking opportunities for more than half of Washington’s students who might not otherwise be able to attend college,” said Isaac Kwakye, deputy executive director of Washington Student Achievement Council. 
The council’s research, Kwakye said, shows that students from the lowest-income families who receive financial aid typically surpass their parents’ income within three years of graduation from college. 
By completing the FAFSA, students and families can take advantage of federal grants, scholarships and loans, as well as Washington state financial aid opportunities. 
Only nine of the 228 school districts in Washington that submitted FAFSA completion data for the 2024-25 cycle recorded an application completion rate of 80% or higher. 
“Washington is one of the most, if not the most, generous in terms of financial assistance,” Ferguson said. “To access that money, all you have to do is fill out the form. You will never know how much financial aid you qualify for unless you do.”
While the Washington Completes FAFSA Campaign only sets goals related to FAFSA completion, students who are not eligible for federal aid but may be eligible for state aid have the option of completing the Washington Application for State Financial Aid instead.
The WASFA is an application for the Washington College Grant, which covers full tuition and fees at any of the state’s public universities for students who are below 60% of the median family income. Some money is also available through the grant for those with higher incomes, and there is also some money available for private colleges and universities.
Anyone in Washington can choose to use the WASFA instead of the FAFSA, although they won’t get federal aid if they choose that route. 
The FAFSA for aid that will go into effect for the 2026-27 school year will open by Oct. 1. The WASFA will open sometime in October. 
Superintendent Chris Reykdal, in a written statement, called the new FAFSA campaign “an important effort to boost awareness for students that may be eligible for federal, state, or institutional aid.” But he also said the state would need to “move past the existing high tuition, high aid model if we are going to expand the state’s economic prowess.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota state Rep. Peri Pourier has switched her political affiliation from Democratic to Republican.
Pourier made the announcement on Monday, a day before lawmakers gather for a special session to vote on a state prison construction plan. South Dakota Searchlight confirmed Pourier’s registration switch with a county election official.
The switch further tips the scales in Republicans’ favor, with 97 Republicans and eight Democrats in the Legislature after Pourier’s defection. That’s the lowest number of Democrats in the Legislature since 1953, when there were two.
Pourier is an Oglala Lakota tribal member with a Rapid City address who represents District 27. It stretches from just east of Rapid City to the Pine Ridge Reservation and includes other rural areas. She is a former member of the Democratic House leadership team, but declined to caucus with her fellow Democrats during the most recent legislative session. So did her Senate district mate Red Dawn Foster, who did not immediately respond to a South Dakota Searchlight message Monday.
Special session could resolve or inflame years of debate about SD’s pre-statehood penitentiary

Pourier was minority whip in the House Democratic caucus in 2023 and 2024. She sat on the House Judiciary, Military and Veterans Affairs, and Taxation committees last legislative session. 
In a Facebook post, Pourier said tribal sovereignty aligns with the Republican Party tenets of decentralized government, economic prosperity, lower energy costs, self-determination and public safety. “By contrast,” she added, “well-intentioned Democratic reforms have too often undermined sovereignty.”
“My decision reflects a strategic recalibration — one that strengthens my ability to advocate for our communities and deliver meaningful results,” Pourier said. “I will not explain away poverty and violence with rhetoric. I remain committed to confronting these issues directly — not someday, not when it becomes politically convenient, but now.”
House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, said Pourier has been invited to the House Republican caucus meeting on Tuesday morning during the special session.
“We will benefit from her strong voice and unique perspective on issues, and her constituents will benefit from more exposure to Republican principles,” Odenbach said in a text message. “It should be a win-win for everybody involved.”
Pourier’s Facebook post did not say whether she will participate in Republican caucus meetings or abstain from caucusing as she did during the last legislative session.
House Minority Leader Erin Healy, D-Sioux Falls, said she believes Pourier will continue to “act on her values and principles,” and hopes she will continue to represent the best interests of her constituents in southwestern South Dakota and on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
Healy added that Pourier was the only Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. Healy plans to discuss changing committee member assignments to ensure Democrats have a seat on the committee next session.

South Dakota Democratic Party Executive Director Dan Ahlers said he’s “disappointed” by Pourier’s announcement. He said South Dakota Democrats have addressed Native American issues more successfully than Republicans on the state and national level.
Ahlers added that party affiliation switches among lawmakers “usually happen because of something other than a change in their values.” Sometimes lawmakers switch parties because it’s advantageous for the next election or to gain access to a task force or committee, he said.
Former Sen. Ryan Maher was the last Democratic lawmaker who switched to the Republican Party. He switched in 2011 after serving as a Democrat from 2007 to 2010, while representing a portion of northwestern South Dakota and the Cheyenne River Reservation.
Other examples of lawmaker affiliation switches include former Sen. Jim Bradford, who switched from Democratic to Republican in 2009 and then back to Democratic in 2011, and former Sen. Jenna Netherton, who switched her affiliation from independent to Republican in 2013.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EM8A1122e-1024x683.png,,,2025-09-22 18:56:57.293204

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Harvest season is underway for many Iowa farmers, as more than 65% of corn acres have reached maturity, according to the latest crop progress and condition report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
As farmers log long days in the combines, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig urged farmers to keep physical and mental health “top of mind.” 
In a news release recognizing National Farm Safety and Health Week, Naig said farmers should follow safe equipment operation practices, wear proper protective gear, inspect and maintain machinery and stay safe around grain bins.

Naig also reminded drivers that during harvest season, slow-moving farm equipment will be a common sight on the road. He urged drivers to stay alert, avoid distractions like cell phones and to keep a safe distance on the road.

“It’s also important to acknowledge that the long, stressful workdays and economic challenges facing agriculture can take a toll,” Naig said in the release. “I encourage farmers and ag workers to be mindful of their mental health and well-being, and to watch out for their neighbors too. No one needs to feel alone. There are resources readily available for Iowans.”
The release said engaging in hobbies, prioritizing sleep and talking to family, friends and mental health professionals can help farmers prioritize their mental health during the stressful season.
Iowa State University Extension and Outreach offers farm stress resources that can help farmers and their families. Additionally, farmers can access several hotlines for mental health support, or if they are dealing with suicidal thoughts. 
Hot, wet conditions for the start of harvest season
Wet conditions last week left farmers with an average of about five days suitable for field work. Despite the low number of days in the field, 8% of Iowa corn acres harvested for grain have been harvested, which is ahead of both last year and the five year average for corn harvest. 
Corn rated 74% good to excellent for the Sept. 15-21 reporting period. Soybeans also rated 74% good to excellent for the period. 
The report noted soybean harvest has begun on some farms in the state, but not enough has been harvested to appear on the report. Sixty-two percent of soybean acres were dropping leaves across the state and nearly 90% of the crop has colored in Iowa. 
Soil moisture conditions improved slightly during the reporting period compared to the week prior. According to the report, 70% of topsoil and 72% of subsoil moisture conditions were adequate for the reporting period. Less than 20% of topsoil and subsoil conditions were short of moisture for the period. 
According to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, Iowa had an average of nine-tenths of an inch of precipitation, which was one tenth of an inch above the climatological normal – though some central and southeastern regions had around three inches during the reporting period. 
Glisan also reported that temperatures across the state were 8.6 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. The average temperature for the week was 71.6 degrees.

(Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)LEFT HAND, W. Va. — The residents of Roane County, West Virginia, enjoy living among the rolling mountains and winding, two-lane roads. Situated between Charleston and Parkersburg, two of the state’s largest cities, the rural county is known for its small towns and historic buildings.
That’s how Sherry Husted, the director of the Roane County Public Libraries, described her native community as she worked last week at Geary Public Library in Left Hand, West Virginia. Each of the county’s three library branches has at least three public computers and free internet access, among other services.
These services are essential to residents living in Roane — where less than 32% of the county’s households, businesses and community buildings — have reliable internet connectivity, according to the Federal Communications Commission’s National Broadband Map.
“We love our rural area,” Husted said. “But there’s always the catch. You love your rural area, but then access to things is always more limited there.”
Members of the library staff regularly help patrons fill out job applications and build resumes. They also help those who have never used a desktop computer before — many of the county’s residents rely on their cellular devices and spotty mobile service, Husted said. Most residents still use landline phones, she added.
And those with internet access at home are paying a steep price. Husted’s plan with Frontier, which includes fiber internet and a landline, comes to $170 a month.
“If you work from home, you need reliable internet,” she said. “Frontier does the best they can. But this is a very rural area, so the trees and terrain are constantly messing up the internet. And because of the demand on these older lines, your internet may not be reliable enough to host things like meetings or classes.”
Roane County is one of the areas federal officials hoped to support through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, or BEAD, a federal grant program meant to expand broadband access. The $42.45 billion initiative, created under the Biden administration’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, aimed to close the digital divide — with a focus on rural communities.
The Trump administration’s changes to the program, however, have disqualified hundreds of thousands of locations — including homes, businesses and community buildings — from receiving internet access. And the program’s new technology-neutral approach will also shift a large portion of the federal funds toward satellite internet companies, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, that cost less to build but have more uneven service than underground fiber optic cable.  That means households and businesses that were looking forward to reliable, high-speed internet will no longer get support from the BEAD program.
While some experts were initially skeptical about the program’s goals, every state utilized its allocated funds to develop plans to provide high-speed fiber internet to nearly every home and business in the country, said Christopher Mitchell, the director of the Community Broadband Networks Initiative with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an anti-corporate advocacy group.
Most states are expected to get started on deployment projects in 2026. But the Trump administration’s changes have undermined the major investment for rural areas, Mitchell said.
“I think everyone should care about it — even though most people don’t live in rural America — because when we electrified the entire country, the entire economy grew,” Mitchell said. “We will all benefit from this when everyone has more options to share their knowledge, their gifts and their productivity in the economy.”
Even West Virginia, ranking last in internet connectivity, would have effectively achieved universal broadband under the state’s original proposal, according to an unreleased draft of the state’s plan obtained by The Benton Institute for Broadband and Society, a policy group. West Virginia has about 78% connectivity, the only state with less than 80%.
But under West Virginia’s updated final proposal, submitted to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration earlier this month, tens of thousands of households and businesses will no longer have access to BEAD funding.
West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he is still optimistic about the rollout, telling reporters recently that some of the decrease in coverage was because of inaccurate information. Some areas had just a few homes, or addresses only had a barn on the property, he and an aide said.
“We’ve been trying to target all the available locations that are eligible,” the governor said Sept. 18 at a news conference at the West Virginia State Capitol. “It’s a pretty fulsome application, and so obviously there were some changes made to accommodate some of the responses from the administration. And in a positive way, they’re trying to save money.”
There are other changes: Internet providers  will no longer be required to provide a low-cost service option to residents to address affordability concerns. And under the “technology-neutral” approach, some locations will no longer be receiving fiber internet, which the federal government previously emphasized due to its speed and durability.












You love your rural area, but then access to things is always more limited there.


– Sherry Husted, director of the Roane County Public Libraries




The new guidelines also remove provisions that encouraged states to work with companies and representatives from minority communities. Requirements related to labor, the environment and climate change also were cut.
West Virginia isn’t alone. Under the new rules, thousands of households, businesses and community buildings across the country will be disqualified from the federal government’s push to provide internet access to the areas that need itmost. And those locations that are still eligible for funding may not receive the best service available — or be able to afford it.
West Virginia has one of the country’s worst workforce participation rates. Internet access is key to changing that, said Bill Bissett, chairman of the West Virginia Broadband Enhancement Council.
“We are hopeful that this new proposal will be supported because we need to get started on this development as soon as possible,” Bissett said. “Because the longer we wait, the less people will be connected because of increased costs in deployment and infrastructure.”

Following the required revisions, West Virginia fared well compared with other states, said Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute. But Garner said he expects frustration in other states.
“West Virginia, because it did a good job with its restructuring, is still going to have a lot of strong outcomes,” Garner said. “But across the country in some of these other states, I think there’s going to be a lot of frustration with these changes and the way it walked back from what was going to be a very promising outcome.”
 BEAD restructuring

In June, the Trump administration revised the rules of the BEAD program in what the U.S. Department of Commerce said was an effort to lessen regulatory burdens, reduce costs and streamline the process.
As of Sept. 18, 41 states had submitted their updated final proposals, according to a database from Connected Nation, a nonprofit that advocates for expanded broadband access.
In December 2022, when the FCC released its updated National Broadband Map, nearly 12 million locations across the country were in need of internet service. Over the years, that number has decreased because of private investments, continued deployment by existing internet providers and additional support from other federal programs.
States originally identified 4.86 million locations that would be eligible for getting internet connectivity through BEAD funds. But that number is projected to fall to 4.19 million locations following revisions initiated by the Trump administration, according to an analysis from Broadband Expanded, a project from the New York Law School.
West Virginia was originally slated to deploy broadband to approximately 110,000 locations. Now, 73,560 of those locations will receive BEAD funding, according to the state’s new proposal. Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Nebraska and Rhode Island could see more than half of the locations in their state disqualified from the program.
But some of those locations may still be in need of internet, said Garner, of the Benton Institute.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, directed states to remove certain locations from the BEAD program because they’d acquired internet access from another source.
But, in an effort to save taxpayer money, states also had the option to say they were “financially incapable” of serving a location.
“One of the changes the administration made to the BEAD program is that states and the NTIA now have a way to simply say that these locations are just too expensive,” Garner said. “They can say, ‘It is just going to cost too much, so now we’re going to say they’re ineligible.’”

The BEAD program’s new technology-neutral approach poses another challenge. The original program favored fiber because of its speed, reliability and ability to reach remote locations. But some argue that other technologies would be cheaper.
This change has opened the door for satellite internet providers, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, to receive money from the program. Starlink could be awarded approximately $10 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.
In West Virginia, Starlink will serve more than 4,100 locations, according to the governor’s office.
“Based on the technology and based on all the evidence we have, some of these technologies — unlicensed fixed wireless especially — are not really a reliable internet service that’s going to meet the needs of a 21st century household,” Garner said.
 Rural advocates speak up

In Nebraska, more than half of the counties in the state have signed onto letters to federal officials objecting to the changes, including the disqualification of nearly half the state’s eligible locations.
“It’s very frustrating. We have all these holes in our county, and BEAD was going to bring service to those areas,” Milford County Commissioner Misty Ahmic told the Nebraska Examiner.
Critics in Pennsylvania have said directing funds toward satellite companies is “shortsighted.” Satellite companies Starlink and Project Kuiper, an Amazon subsidiary, were awarded a combined $19.2 million to expand internet access in Pennsylvania.
And in Oklahoma, critics noticed the updated plan would not be using $225 million of the state’s allocated BEAD funds.
The state’s head broadband official said the new proposal would still serve everyone, but critics told the Oklahoma Voice that it would be wrong to send back any federal money while people across the state continue to struggle with internet access.
Originally, states were allowed to use these leftover funds to pay for things other than broadband deployment, such as West Virginia’s plans to improve cellular service and streamline the permitting process for broadband projects. But the federal telecommunications agency has not released guidance on how the leftover funds are to be used under the restructured program.
“There’s a lot of fear right now that NTIA may try to call that money back, which would be a big shame,” Garner said. “That leftover money is the state’s, according to the law. And these ancillary funds would play a huge role to support the BEAD program.”
Affordability also will be a barrier for some households. States are no longer required to provide a low-cost service option for low-income households under the changes. And the federal Affordable Connectivity Program ended last year without additional funding from Congress.
Morrisey said his administration is being aggressive, collaborating with the Trump administration to get internet access to eligible areas.
“I applaud the Trump administration for working with us, but once again, I am not going to do a victory lap until we actually get this all done,” the governor said.
Providing internet to every person in West Virginia was always a lofty goal, said Husted, the Roane County Public Library director.  Other initiatives have promised to connect rural residents over the years, Husted said, and she remains skeptical about this outcome.
“In rural areas, you’re going to need to plan for things, and sometimes that puts us at a disadvantage compared to the cities,” Husted said. “With the internet or with other supplies, sometimes we have to decide what is more important to us.”
