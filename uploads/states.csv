At the eastern edge of America’s “breadbasket” region, Michigan’s Saline Township is a quintessential agricultural community. The township is home to 2,200 residents, several family-owned farms and a small historic district—and a hyperscale data center will soon join the list.
The Saline Township Board voted earlier this month to settle a lawsuit in which development firm Related Digital and the landowners of the proposed construction site accused the township of exclusionary zoning, or of unfairly limiting what property owners can do and build on their land. This lawsuit, filed Sept. 12, came just two days after the board voted 4–1 against rezoning the site’s 575 acres of farmland for the company’s data center project.
A county judge certified the settlement last week, bringing a sudden end to the dispute amid intense opposition from Saline Township residents and elected officials, who expressed concern at public meetings regarding traffic, noise, and water and energy resources.
“We’re a farming rural township, and that’s what we want to stay,” said James Marion, supervisor of the Township Board.
Alongside the rest of the board, Marion attended several public meetings about the data center and lawsuit, and says most of the township is opposed to the project. However, much of the board ultimately bowed to the legal pressure from Related Digital.
“I still voted against it,” Marion said. “I said, ‘Well, if we lose in court, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.’”
Marion’s vote against the settlement ended up standing alone. This month, after a two-hour closed-door meeting, the township’s board voted 4–1 to settle, avoiding a lawsuit that Marion said the township’s attorneys painted as difficult to win. The settlement includes provisions to restore the land if the data center goes unused, preserve existing wild spaces, and invest several million dollars in the community annually.
“We are pleased by the Board’s vote and that we were able to reach a resolution that allows this important project to move forward in a responsible way,” Natalie Ravitz, Related Digital’s executive vice president of corporate communications, said in a statement.





While the developer won out in Saline Township, versions of this fight are playing out across the country. There are currently 4,080 data centers in the United States, up over 30 percent from 3,059 in December 2023. As artificial intelligence continues to drive the data center industry’s growth, many of the companies behind these developments are choosing to build in rural areas where land is cheaper.
In rural communities as close to Saline as nearby Howell Township—where the township’s board similarly voted against rezoning a tract of land for data center development—and as far away as Texas, community members are railing against data center projects popping up in their backyards.


Data Center Watch, a research firm that tracks opposition to data center projects, estimates that $64 billion worth of data center projects have been blocked or delayed due to community opposition as of March 2025, and that number is still growing.
Last month, this fight reached Congress. U.S. Reps. Jim Costa, D-Calif., and Blake Moore, R-Utah, introduced H.R.5227, or the “Unleashing Low-Cost Rural AI Act,” which would require the federal departments of Energy, Interior and Agriculture to collaborate on a study of how data centers are impacting rural America.
“My legislation ensures we take a hard look at how this growth impacts rural communities that are powering the AI industry, and make sure families aren’t left paying the price,” Costa said in a statement. “But at the same time, it’s important that rural communities are not left behind in the new opportunities that AI data centers will provide for agricultural sciences and an improved ability to compete in this modern era.”
The concern, for many experts, is that communities may end up with depleted resources or surging energy costs that aren’t proportional to the benefit the data center brings to the area. Because rural communities often lack a robust local staff equipped to fully analyze data centers’ long-term impacts, these adverse outcomes are common, said Tim Cywinski, communications director of the Sierra Club’s chapter in Virginia, where 35 percent of all hyperscale data centers globally are located, mostly in rural counties within the state. He considers the extension of data center development into rural areas “a justice issue” with outsized impacts on communities’ quality of life.
“It’s kind of a bait and switch for people who bought into the peaceful, rural lifestyle,” Cywinski said. “Then, next thing you know, they’re going to build giant AI data centers … right by their homes.”
One of the difficulties for local leaders and community members analyzing data centers’ impacts is that—like any large-scale industrial activity—data centers vary significantly from project to project. Currently, there are few “standard answers” about how a data center will impact the community around it, said Sarah Mills, manager of the University of Michigan’s Office of Climate and Energy, which helps communities plan for energy development.
Mills said the lack of standardization is why it’s so helpful to take a proactive approach, reevaluating land uses and deciding what the community can handle before large projects come to town.
“I think this [shift] is an invitation, an opportunity for rural communities to really assess what it is that they care about and want to be in the future,” she said.
In Saline Township, this assessment happened at a breakneck pace, as residents filed into jam-packed town hall meetings, determined to ask the right questions about the lawsuit and the project’s long-term impacts even as Related Digital turned up the heat on the township’s decision-making, advising the township’s lawyers they planned to amend their complaint to include a claim for monetary damages if a settlement was not reached.
The company’s complaint rested on the claim that not having any plots of land zoned to allow data centers constitutes exclusionary zoning.
Laws prohibiting exclusionary zoning started appearing in the early 1900s, aiming to combat zoning practices that kept lower-income or minority populations out of wealthier areas. These practices often prevented affordable housing development, keeping costs high and reinforcing segregation.
In Michigan, however, zoning can also be considered exclusionary if a zoning classification—such as one allowing for certain types of industrial buildings—exists in a given township, but no land is actually designated for that use. Related Digital argues this reinterpretation of exclusionary zoning applies to Saline Township.
“Although the Township has a rezoning classification that would permit such a [data center] development (the ‘I-1’ zoning), it is mere window dressing,” Related Digital’s attorneys wrote in the complaint, noting that no property is currently zoned for I-1 uses, and the township’s future land use map doesn’t identify any properties they plan to rezone.
In hopes of assuaging residents’ concerns and urging them to accept the rezoning, Related Digital was on the ground in Saline Township, meeting with residents and clarifying misconceptions about the project’s water use and noise.
“The biggest misunderstanding, frankly, is that people have heard about other data center projects, many of which have hundreds of generators,” said Related Digital’s Ravitz. “That’s not the case with this project.”
Despite being large enough to accommodate an unnamed “large American publicly-traded technology company” as a client, the data center will not rely on noisy generators and will use an air-cooling system to limit water use, Ravitz explained. In fact, the only water used on-site, she said, will be for employee restrooms and fire suppression tanks outside, which the local fire department will also have access to for other fires within the township.
Beyond these conditions, the settlement also ensures the project will be developed on only 250 acres of the property; will preserve remaining acreage as undeveloped or agricultural lands; will never be sold to a tax-exempt entity; and, if decommissioned, the developer will restore the lands as a natural area. While the facility is in use, the company will also annually contribute at least $1.6 million to the township and $8 million to local schools and will make one-time donations of $14 million to the township’s fire services, farmland preservation trust, and community investment fund.
With these concessions in place, the company hopes to break ground on the data center as early as next year, with the goal of having it up and running as early as 2027. Some residents, meanwhile, are still reeling from the quick end to the dispute.

With the federal shutdown entering its fourth week, spurred by a stalemate over the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans on Affordable Care Act plans, a new report shows that over 154 million people with coverage through an employer also face steep price hikes — and that the situation is likely to get worse.
Premiums for job-based health insurance rose 6% in 2025 to an average of $26,993 a year for family coverage, according to an annual survey of employers released Oct. 22 by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
It’s the first time in two decades that the cost of covering a family of four has risen by 6% or more for three consecutive years, data from KFF shows.
Over the last five years, the average premium for family coverage has increased by 26%, compared with a 29% increase in workers’ wages and nearly 24% growth in inflation. The average cost for family coverage is now about the same as a new Toyota Corolla hybrid.
The average annual premium for an individual health plan provided by employers increased by 5% to $9,325 — nearly $3,000 higher than in 2016, according to the survey.
“It’s a concern as health costs just keep going up,” said Eric Trump, controller at Steve Reiff Inc., a small company in South Whitley, Indiana, that specializes in sandblasting and painting heavy equipment.
Trump, who is not related to President Donald Trump, said his company’s health insurance costs rose 8% for the 2026 fiscal year — roughly the same as they have in the last few years.
Workers at Reiff pay about half the cost of their health coverage. About half of its 20 current employees decline the insurance because they get coverage through a family member or choose to go uninsured, he said. “There’s not a lot we can do as we don’t have enough employees to spread out the costs.”
Most people with job-based insurance contribute to the cost of their premiums, with the average worker this year contributing $1,440 for individual coverage or $6,850 for family coverage.
Over time, more workers have paid increasingly higher deductibles, the amount they must spend out-of-pocket on medical services before their insurer pitches in. More than one‑third of covered workers are enrolled in a plan with a deductible of $2,000 or more for an individual. The share of workers with such a plan has increased 32% over the last five years and 77% over the last 10 years, the report said.
Rising drug and hospital costs are often cited as major culprits for rising health insurance costs, and neither shows signs of ebbing.
“Early reports suggest that cost trends will be higher for 2026, potentially leading to higher premium increases unless employers and plans find ways to offset higher costs through changes to benefits, cost sharing, or plan design,” the KFF survey said.
One big concern among employers is the high price of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, which a growing number of companies cover. Their high prices, combined with strong demand, have led some workplaces to tighten or eliminate coverage for weight loss.
“Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” study author Gary Claxton, a KFF senior vice president, said in a press release. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”
Employers typically respond to higher health costs by shifting costs to their workers, but it’s unclear how much more financial pain workers can take. The survey found nearly half of large employers said their employees have “moderate” or “high” concerns about their level of cost sharing.
While the rising cost of employer-sponsored insurance has outpaced general inflation, the issue received scant attention in recent months on Capitol Hill. To help pay for extending tax cuts, Trump’s tax and spending law reduces by billions of dollars the amount the government spends on Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for 70 million low-income and disabled people. Congressional budget scorekeepers predict the cuts to Medicaid will lead to millions more people becoming uninsured over the next decade.
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 as Democrats refuse to vote for a new spending measure unless Republicans agree to extend tax credits that help about 22 million people buy health coverage through the ACA marketplaces. Without congressional action, the tax credits will expire, and premiums will double for many consumers, starting in January.
The KFF report is based on a survey this year of 1,862 randomly selected nonfederal public and private employers with 10 or more workers.

Stainton,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/10/27/medicaid-changes-nj-governor/,New Jersey's next governor is facing major changes to Medicaid.

Neither leading candidate offers specifics on how they would tackle them. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]New Jersey’s next governor will be faced with major changes to Medicaid, with more than half a million New Jerseyans likely navigating new work requirements by the end of next year and an eventual loss of about $2.5 billion in federal aid annually.
The leading candidates for governor — Jack Ciattarelli (R) and Mikie Sherrill (D) — both pledge to protect health care for New Jersey’s most vulnerable residents as the changes to Medicaid championed by the Trump administration start to take full effect. But they have very different views on what it means for the state budget, the health care system, and the 1.9 million residents who receive care through the state’s Medicaid program, NJ Family Care, many of whom have low income or a disability. 
Democrat Mikie Sherrill said she would fight to protect children’s access to doctors and battle President Donald Trump to recover federal funds slated to soon disappear. Republican Jack Ciattarelli said people who are truly eligible for Medicaid can count on him to protect their care. Both say the other is wrong for New Jersey.
“Jack supports Trump’s efforts to rip away health care from more than 300,000 New Jerseyans and double premiums for another 450,000. Jack is one of the loudest cheerleaders for Trump’s budget that is detrimental to New Jersey,” said Sherrill campaign spokesperson Sam Chan. “While Jack talks a big game about being a CPA, his math just doesn’t add up.”
Ciattarelli campaign strategist Chris Russell, meanwhile, noted that Sherrill’s party has controlled the governor’s office for eight years and the Legislature for more than two decades.
“Democrats completely control Trenton and look at what has happened to the state. Why would we give Phil Murphy his third term with Mikie Sherrill?” Russell said.
Neither candidate offered specifics on how they would sustain the program as federal funding declines, or fund the cost of caring for New Jerseyans who lose coverage, but both on the campaign trail stress the need to make health care in general more accessible and affordable. Ciattarelli and Sherrill are seeking to replace Murphy, a Democrat who is barred from seeking a third term this year. Election Day is Nov. 4. Early in-person voting is underway.

By 2032, the changes launched by the Trump administration are expected to cost New Jersey more than $3 billion annually in Medicaid dollars, according to state policy analysts. An estimated 350,000 low-income residents will have lost NJ Family Care coverage, they said. Federal support for child welfare, food aid, and other services has also been slashed under Trump, further reducing revenue for New Jersey programs. 
Sherrill, in her fourth term in Congress, has warned these shifts would be dangerous to residents and the state budget, and said during the first gubernatorial debate in September that the federal actions “will imperil the health care of 1 in 3 children” nationwide. Medicaid spending comprises more than 40% of the current state budget of nearly $60 billion.
In response to a question about changes in Medicaid, Chan, the Sherrill campaign spokesperson, said Sherrill “will take on anyone to ensure that New Jersey’s children don’t lose access to their doctor.”
“As governor, she will work to ensure we have the resources to ensure people can afford to see their doctor. Mikie will take Trump to court to claw back as much money as we can, develop innovative partnerships with health care providers and hospitals to provide preventive care at a low cost, and crack down on tax cheats at the state level and use this funding to lower costs for New Jersey families,” Chan said.
Ciattarelli, a retired businessman who has served in local, county, and state government, has largely downplayed the potential impact of changes to Medicaid and said his positive relationship with Trump, who endorsed him, will benefit New Jersey more than Sherrill’s legal threats. He said government spending on the state and federally funded health care program has increased in ways that are unsustainable, prompting a need for reform. 
“I promise you that no vulnerable populations will be underserved in New Jersey under Governor Ciattarelli. Somehow, someway we will make sure they are taken care of,” Ciattarelli said at a Nutley campaign event earlier this month.

New Jersey allocated $24.3 billion for Medicaid through next spring in the budget Murphy signed in late June, of which $14.9 billion is expected from Washington, D.C. In addition to funding health insurance benefits and subsidizing hospitals — more than $2.6 billion this year, much of it for care in poor communities — the program pays for roughly 40% of all births in New Jersey and almost two-thirds of nursing home beds.
Russell, the Ciattarelli campaign strategist, said as governor, the Republican would “set responsible spending priorities and pull the plug” on funding for the pet projects of Democratic lawmakers. Those projects added $700 million to the current state budget. Democrats now hold majorities in the Assembly, where all 80 seats are up for election this year, and in the Senate.
“The idea that state money doesn’t exist to fund key priorities, whether that be health care, infrastructure, or education, is simply unfounded,” Russell said, pointing to budget growth in recent years. “Jack has said repeatedly that as governor, people who qualify for Medicaid and rely on the program will be taken care of under a Ciattarelli Administration.”
The most immediate change coming to Medicaid is the addition of work requirements for most adults, a provision that would impact some 550,000 people in New Jersey, according to policy experts at the state Department of Human Services, which runs the program. By 2027, adults must spend — and be able to document — at least 20 hours a week at a job, in school, or performing community service. Women who are pregnant or have recently given birth, caring for someone who is disabled or under age 13, or attending addiction treatment would be exempt, they said. 
The work requirements, which studies show have not been highly successful elsewhere, come with changes to Medicaid rules that force participants to verify they are eligible twice a year, instead of just once, as is now the case. Policy experts predict the new rules will lead some 350,000 residents to drop their NJ Family Care plans, reducing the cost to the federal government. 
Over time the additional red tape is also likely to double the workload for state and county employees, state policy experts say.
Ciattarelli has echoed national Republicans in describing the work requirements and eligibility changes as fair and necessary to protect the program’s integrity.
Ciattarelli also defended Trump’s insistence on implementing nationwide work requirements in Medicaid (states havesignificant control in how these are established).
“It’s not to be mean. It’s because billions are being wasted on people who are scamming the system,” he told the cheering crowd in Nutley. “So what measures do you put in to stop the scamming of the system?”
Medicaid is monitored at the state and federal levels to identify fraud and other problems, with New Jersey watchdogs identifying more than $1 billion in fraud, overpayments, or wrongful payments in the past decade. But experts note these improprieties are not as common, or as costly, as Republicans suggest. 
Ciattarelli said he also supports removing undocumented immigrants from the program. New Jersey is one of 14 states, plus Washington, D.C., that use local tax dollars to insure undocumented children, according to non-partisan health care advocates at KFF, and it expects to spend about $164 million this year to cover 47,000 of these youngsters. 
Federal changes to Medicaid will also end coverage for various legal immigrants starting next year, which state experts said will remove some 25,000 people from NJ Family Care, including refugees and victims of domestic violence and human trafficking.
The full financial impact of the federal Medicaid changes starts to take effect in 2028, in the middle of the next governor’s four-year term in office. That’s when the new law begins to limit how states can use Medicaid to generate funding for hospitals and other services, an approach New Jersey has embraced under Murphy. 
New Jersey has used much of this revenue to replace charity care, the longstanding hospital aid program that relies more heavily on state tax dollars than Medicaid. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which expanded Medicaid eligibility and created the market that sells Obamacare plans, started to drive down charity care numbers a decade ago. The increased reliance on Medicaid for hospital subsidies shrank the budget line even more, from $349 million in 2022 to less than $70 million in the current budget.

One area of potential labor growth is in the health care sector, with a recent uptick of union organizing petitions. But the report also noted new challenges and political strain are on the horizon, including budget cuts, unfair labor practices and new anti-labor laws considering signals from federal and state leaders.
Still, researchers said that the Michigan labor movement netted important recent wins in complaint cases decided by the National Labor Relations Board and the Michigan Supreme Court. Additionally, union representation petitions in the health care sector continue to grow, the report noted, with an influx of increasingly progressive locally-based and nationally-affiliated campaigns emerging amid what Wayne State researchers called “new and militant contract battles.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
That shows Michigan health care workers are becoming more cognizant of their labor’s value to their employers and the communities they serve.
“New developments in the economic landscape gave rise to increased labor activism, augmenting the state’s reputation as a labor hub, as industries and workplaces continued to expand,” the report said. “Chief among these changes has been the expansion of union representation in higher education and more active labor representation among health care workers. Also, relatively new on the labor front are the expanded efforts of low-wage, temporary, and precariously employed service workers in retail, food and beverage service, and transportation.”
On the medical front, Wayne State’s research shows that Michigan has a long history of being friendly toward health care organizing. Its growth as an industry has emerged as manufacturing in the state reduces volume, with health care now not too far behind as one of the largest state industries.
Illinois, Michigan see union membership gains after state policy changes

With 13.5% of Michigan’s workforce belonging to a union and 14.7% of the total workforce being actively represented by a union, health care organizing remains strong and has room to grow. 
As of 2025, the sector has 25 unique health systems, and overall, health care workers have tended to affiliate with non-traditional health care unions, like Teamsters, the UAW and the American Federation of Teachers.
The report hailed organizing efforts at Corewell Health. 
Per the report, Metro Detroit stands out as the central hub for union organizing in the state, with a disproportionate share of the state’s union locals and a Detroit-centric base for unique union types.

Other strong pockets of union organizing include Lansing, Saginaw, Grand Rapids and Muskegon.
Although organized labor fought for the the earned sick time and wage increase ballot measures in 2018, which were the subject of a protracted legal fight over the Michigan Legislature’s “adopt and amend” tactics that gutted the measures, the report did highlight the legislative deal that kept some of those measures intact while softening them at the behest of employers and tipped-wage workers across the state.
From 2020 onward, several federal actions have shaped the dynamic in Michigan, but the resurgence of President Donald Trump is challenging that trend.
On Right to Work laws, Wayne State’s research shows that Michigan is still recovering from the era of lower wages due to lack of union representation and restricted collective bargaining. Since its repeal took effect in 2024, Michigan saw a 17,000 person increase in union membership
There are areas of improvement, however, as only 13.4% of all Michigan employees are unionized, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure is well above the national average, though.
Some of that could change if Republicans take back control of the Michigan Senate next year and also take the governor’s office, assuming that the GOP holds the House, as well. 
Both House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) have said the Democratic trifecta of the past few years was wrong to repeal the law. Hall would likely remain as House speaker if the Republicans remain in control of the lower chamber. Nesbitt is angling for the GOP nomination for the governor’s seat. And state Sen. Thomas Albert (R-Lowell) has already introduced a GOP Senate plan to reinstate Right to Work, which currently has no path forward with Democrats still in control of the upper chamber.
That said, the repeal hasn’t protected every union member in the state of Michigan. The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Janus v. AFSCME from 2018 placed Right to Work-style restrictions on public employees. Of note, private sector employees benefitted from the repeal, but laborers like school employees, state workers, police officers, firefighters, nurses, janitors and secretaries in government positions did not.
“As we have shown, Michigan union density has been recovering in the last few years,” the report said in conclusion. “The state labor movement is regaining ground. As the movement continues to grow, there will be uncertainty; but the trends leading into 2025 show a renewed spirit in Michigan unions.”

Washington’s independent office investigating police deadly force incidents plans to name its second region in the coming weeks and pair it with a roadmap for opening the remaining regions statewide.
Office of Independent Investigations Director Roger Rogoff said in an Inside Olympia interview with Austin Jenkins that the announcement would come before the end of the year, adding that the agency will also lay out when the final four regions will open after that. 
Rogoff defended the mission behind the state’s new approach to police deadly-force investigations, calling the model “a really good idea — even a really divine idea.”

The agency’s balancing act — hiring some former law enforcement officers while guarding independence — is “the magic of the agency,” he said. Rogoff says “transparency is the product,” citing plain-language final reports and the agency’s family and tribal liaison programs as tangible examples.
Since taking the lead in Region 1 last December, the office has handled five fatal-force callouts, completed two investigations (in Vancouver and Centralia), and has three pending (in Poulsbo, Ridgefield and Vancouver). Rogoff says all three will be completed by year’s end, while the office is still reviewing six cases that occurred before it was created.
Rogoff said the statutory goal of issuing reports within 120 days is “aggressive,” citing forensic turnaround times and the work required to write comprehensive summaries. “I think that six months, 180 days, is probably a lot more reasonable,” he said.
The new agency had its capacity tested on May 7, when two fatal cases came in the same night. The office split resources and covered both scenes. Rogoff said he was “incredibly proud of my staff” that night — though he added, “If there had been a third one, we would not have been able to do it.”
Staffing remains the choke point. The Office of Independent Investigations has 66 employees, including 31 investigators. “I think we need over 100 investigators,” Rogoff said — far above the agency’s initial concept. For the upcoming supplemental budget in the 2026 legislative session, Rogoff said they have asked for funding for five more investigators.
Recently, the office opened a new headquarters and evidence facility in Thurston County. Rogoff described the 11,000 square feet of evidence storage space and 9,000 square feet of office space as a major step forward. Meanwhile, a more than 20% budget cut that came in the 2025–27 biennial state budget “slows us down” and hits a new agency harder than an established one.
“Let’s make it work,” is his message to lawmakers. “Let’s finish the job.”

But that is changing. (Getty Images)“Bail reform” is a term worthy to send chills down the spine of any law enforcement officer, prosecuting attorney and survivor of crime. Indiana has not been at the extreme edge of change nationally in this area, but that is likely a good thing, as we can learn from the failures of other jurisdictions. 
Bail reform in Indiana has proceeded incrementally and, in my mind, is woefully incomplete at this point. Our legislature and all voting-aged Hoosiers will soon have the opportunity to see the bail reform project finally fill in the missing  piece. 
Almost 10 years ago, the Indiana Supreme Court instituted a pilot program aimed at maximizing release at the pretrial stage of criminal cases. After two years in 11 pilot counties, Criminal Rule 26 went into effect in January 2018. The rule created a system, albeit imperfect, that addresses injustices for certain non-violent offenders. 
Geared toward releasing non-violent or “low-risk” offenders without onerous conditions, this process aims to mitigate the loss of liberty when an  individual is unable to post money bail for want of those resources. The process instead focused on “evidence-based practices” and uses a pretrial screening tool to project the risk of an arrestee’s failure to appear at future hearings. 
In implementing the rule, the court stated that the primary purpose was “to maximize the likelihood of an accused person’s presence at trial while striving for both public safety and protection of the presumption of  innocence.” 
However, this reform provided improved tools to trial court judges for only one end of the arrestee spectrum; it is high time for us to address the other end by putting an emphasis on public safety. 
Proposal seeks to change Constitution — and who has right to bail in Indiana

At least 22 states and the federal government allow the most dangerous arrestees to be held without bail, and Indiana judges should have that discretion to protect the public in that way. 
Early steps toward this concept of “preventative detention” are underway. In its 2023 session, the General Assembly passed Senate Joint Resolution 1, which would amend Article I, Section 17 of the Indiana Constitution to allow for offenses other than murder and treason to not be bailable “if: (1) the proof is evident or the presumption strong; and (2) the state  proves by clear and convincing evidence that no release conditions will reasonably protect  the safety of any other person or the community.” 
The constitutional amendment process requires the language to pass out of a separate General Assembly before going to the ballot for Hoosiers to approve. Merely amending the constitution will not be the end of the story. 
Instead, amended or new statutes will need to provide additional details about the process to ensure public safety as prosecutors seek to keep dangerous individuals in custody in order to protect the public. 
The protection of victims and communities as a whole, is a critical purpose of the bail and release system. 
Not only does the start of the amendment process reflect the political will to engage in these further reforms, but the most recent legislative session also produced meaningful change through Public Law 197, which directs that arrestees for crimes of violence are to be detained until a hearing is held by the court to set bail individually and in open court. 
Indiana’s trial court judges need the tools and the flexibility to address the needs of each particular situation. Forbidding strategies like cash bail, or mandating release when not otherwise required, would unduly restrict the discretion and duties of the state’s trial courts, whose judges every day must weigh appropriate factors and craft safe and effective conditions of release. 
In the next year or two, we have the opportunity to provide balance to Indiana’s bail reform and thereby to improve public safety outcomes through a robust and constitutionally valid procedure. Indiana’s trial court judges need these tools, and prosecutors need the ability to argue for their use in the service of public safety.

Hoosier child care providers are scrabbling for ways to stay open as Indiana’s freeze on low-income vouchers cramps enrollment and double-digit reimbursement rate cuts eat away at already narrow margins.
Providers collectively stand to lose an estimated $3.8 million a week — almost $200 million a year — according to Early Learning Indiana, a prominent child education advocacy group and site operator.
“I don’t know where we’re going to be standing at,” said Jonathan Prewitt, who’s operated in-home programs in New Albany since 2011. “… I’m not saying that we’re going to be in business much longer. I’m hoping that we could … because our kids need us.”

All of Prewitt’s clients pay with vouchers, which previously covered the cost of attendance at Pit Stop for Kids. Not anymore.
“My parents depend on that, and they can’t afford to pay the difference,” he said. But he can’t afford to absorb the losses.
Some providers are mobilizing to swap survival strategies, protest the state’s changes or get trained on advocating with lawmakers.
“This crisis has created new collaboration,” said Hanan Osman, executive director of the Indiana Association for the Education of Young Children. “… We need to figure out how to resolve this before it’s too late.”
Advocates say the cuts hurt more than just an industry.
“There is really no second chance for this time of life, to make the kind of change that we can within the architecture of the brain, when children are in responsive and caring environments with learning opportunities around them,” said Maureen Weber, president and CEO of Early Learning Indiana.
No exit
Low-income Hoosier families can nab vouchers through two child care assistance programs: the federal Child Care and Development Fund and the state-level On My Way Pre-K.
About 35,000 children typically participated pre-pandemic, according to the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.
That swelled to nearly 68,000 children in the final months of 2024 — the waning days of former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration.

FSSA put the jump in demand down to broadened income eligibility, state capacity-building grants and federal funding when, in December, it implemented the first waitlist for child care vouchers since 2018.
“We had, essentially, an extra billion dollars in early care and education through the various rounds of COVID relief funds,” Weber explained. “And those funded a variety of things, but one of them was to fuel that increase in vouchers.”
“Given the other decisions that the state might have made with those dollars, serving more children seems like a good one,” she continued. “I think what we didn’t do was have sort of the smoothest exit plan to bring those numbers back down, which is why we have now the really concentrated change that we’re all experiencing.”
When Gov. Mike Braun took office in January, he proposed allocating $362 million to child care vouchers — enough to close the waitlist.
Lawmakers scrapped that.

Instead, they set aside $147 million in “hold harmless” funding for the 2026 fiscal year, which began July 1. It’s enough to renew vouchers at the same income requirements for families already on the program.
New enrollees face narrower standards.
FSSA is focusing on funding current participants, and “is not issuing new vouchers for 2025,” a spokesperson told the Capital Chronicle.
Nearly 30,000 children were languishing on the waitlist in August, according to an agency subsidy dashboard. That’s the latest data available.
OMWPK vouchers were curtailed for the current school year: there’s a cap of 2,500 enrollees that can each receive a maximum of $6,800 in funding, narrower eligibility thresholds and other changes.
And last month, FSSA announced double-digit reimbursement rate cuts for CCDF vouchers: down 10% for infant and toddler care, 15% for preschoolers and a whopping 35% for school-age children.
Braun’s FSSA pinned the blame on the Holcomb administration.
“These adjustments address a $225 million funding gap through 2026 created by the prior administration’s unsustainable use of temporary COVID relief funds and ensure continued compliance with federal requirements,” a news release said.
The rates went into effect Oct. 5, with the first pay date being Nov. 6.
Children with vouchers were at least 25% of clients at almost half the state’s 4,300 providers in a March analysis by Early Learning Indiana.
“We’re a really low-margin industry,” Weber said.
“If a quarter of your payers are from the public sector, and some big portion of those are going away, there’s vulnerability there,” she added. But she’s most concerned about the 900 “highly dependent” providers with at least 75% of clients using vouchers.
Voucher losses are hitting Hoosier providers at an estimated $1.9 million weekly, while reimbursement rate cuts subtract another $1.8 million weekly, according to an Early Learning Indiana dashboard unveiled this month. It breaks down the impacts by county.
Cutting back
Providers say they’re feeling the impacts — and making adjustments.
“The pressures are high,” said the Rev. Jay Height, executive director of Shepherd Community Center in Indianapolis’ Eastside, where about 65% of children pay with vouchers.
The organization had about 70 seats, but enrollment has fallen closer to 60. Some have just aged out, but others have lost their vouchers.
“There’s no way for them to pay for it,” Height said. “We’re trying to put more emphasis on working with our families to help make sure that they keep their vouchers and don’t let it lapse or miss any deadlines.”
Shepherd’s losing roughly $1,400 weekly.

The organization is exploring group purchasing and teacher-sharing; working with a company to examine utility expenses for possible savings; and trying to raise funds.
The cuts have prompted a laundry list of changes at Little Duckling Early Learning Schools’ neighboring buildings along 38th Street, where more than 80% of students pay with vouchers.
The sites were at 92% capacity this time last year, but are down to 68%, according to Site Director Jacqueline Strong.
“We … never had a problem with enrolling. Our biggest issue, if there was an enrollment problem, was just having space,” said Strong, who’s worked at Little Duckling for six years.
Some families are using their vouchers at elementary schools, but others are locked out — on the waitlist and unable to cover total costs themselves.
Little Duckling has closed four classrooms and moved those students and teachers to the building next door. “With us not getting the new infants that we would’ve normally gotten,” Strong said, three infant rooms with capacity for 24 have dwindled to a single room with capacity for eight.
The organization prides itself on its accredited child development and academic programs — even infants and toddlers have curriculums and lesson plans — but those materials have been halved to save money.
Little Duckling has nixed free events like field trips and “donuts with dad,” cut back on professional development opportunities, lowered pay for new hires and more. Parents of young children must provide their own diapers.
Dozens of providers gathered at Little Duckling this month to share ideas on saving money without dropping their standards.
The lower reimbursement rates are “not enough to sustain what is considered a high-quality program,” Strong said.

It’s possible to run a child care center for less money, “but … you’re not able to all of the extra things that a high-quality program would normally do, because you won’t have funds,” she added.
Little Duckling has a third site, located in a higher-income area along 82nd Street. A lower share of students use vouchers, so it hasn’t been as impacted, according to Strong.
Early Learning Indiana’s Weber predicted conditions will worsen as the reimbursement rates take hold this autumn.
Her group runs nine centers in Indianapolis, with about a third of students paying with vouchers. They’re losing $10,000 a week.
Still, the 125-year-old organization is “relatively well situated to weather the storm,” Weber acknowledged. She warned others don’t have the operating reserves to survive.
Early Learning Indiana has some philanthropic money it uses to support providers across the state, but it’s “a problem at the scale of government, to be candid,” Weber said. “I mean, it’s a multiple hundreds of millions of dollars problem.”
Learning advocacy
Some providers are taking action.
Prewitt, of Pit Stop for Kids, is gathering fellow New Albany-area operators to attend FSSA’s next quarterly financial reporting meeting Wednesday, with plans to rally after the child care discussion ends.
He worries his parents will have to quit their jobs to take care of their children, or keep working and leave them home alone. Older kids might get into trouble, Prewitt fears, or be deputized into caretakers themselves for younger siblings.
“Indiana chose to do this,” he said. “Why they chose to take from our kids instead of taking from one of them higher ups’ pockets or salary makes no sense.”
Other providers are gathering, like at Little Duckling. They’re weighing in at listening sessions with the Indiana Association for the Education of Young Children, and they’re getting trained.
The association just wrapped up a two-day advocacy and leadership academy in Indianapolis, attended by about 70 early childhood educators, according to Osman.
The agenda includes breakout sessions to learn how to write an op-ed, how to approach news outlets or how to speak with lawmakers.
“One of the things we (have) learned over the years is that we cannot be angry when we talk to a legislator,” Osman said. “We have to use numbers. We have to be positive. We have to show the collaborative.”
The association doesn’t organize protests or endorse political candidates in line with its nonprofit status.
Instead, it’s compiling testimonials and preparing members to meet with their representatives about the influence of early child education on kindergarten readiness, ways to lower expenses while maintaining quality and the hunt for sustainable government funding. A Statehouse day is also scheduled for February 5.
“We cannot give up the work we have done in 25 years,” Osman said.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)In St. Paul, hard work should be rewarded with good pay. 
But too often, in Minnesota’s own capital city, ordinances that are supposed to protect workers cannot be enforced, because the city lacks the power to use civil penalties. 
My organization, the Saint Paul Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, brings together over 100 local unions and nearly 16,000 union members who live in the city. The members of the unions I work for know the importance of having the right tools to enforce the rules, and conversely the precarity of not having a way to hold bad actors responsible for their actions. 
City Question #1 on voters’ ballot this year would mean St. Paul joins most other major Minnesota cities to have the ability to use administrative citations to enforce their rules, instead of just criminal convictions. 
We were proud our city passed an earned safe and sick time ordinance long before the state of Minnesota and passed a $15 minimum wage ordinance that is higher than state law. We recently added a new wage theft ordinance so city staff can protect the paychecks of every worker. 
But ordinances are only as good as their enforcement. I sit on the city’s Labor Standards Advisory Council and too often I hear from staff that they cannot fully enforce our city ordinances.
St. Paul — alone among the 25 largest cities in Minnesota — does not have the power to use administrative fines under civil law. Instead our ordinances, including those to protect workers, must be enforced with criminal penalties.
Too often city staff have to settle cases for less than a worker has earned because companies with deep pockets know that the criminal courts are fully occupied. Criminal judges should not have to have their calendars cluttered up with cases involving wage disputes and unpainted garages.
City staff could resolve cases faster through a civil law process instead of a criminal law process. When a low-wage worker gets shorted on their pay, every week they don’t get paid is a big deal. One short paycheck can snowball as unpaid bills lead to fines and late fees. Too often, bad employers use this dynamic to force settlements that leave a worker short.
While the criminal penalties-only approach can help big corporations skirt the law, even worse is that current law can cost workers their job. Without civil penalties, violations of city ordinances can result in criminal convictions that cost people a good job. For example, a St. Paul resident failed to paint his garage. Instead of getting a small civil fine, he wound up with a criminal conviction. He had a good job as a transit driver, but when they discovered his criminal record he lost the job. In other cases, people almost lost their housing because of criminal records related to incidents where dogs got loose. A criminal record can cost someone their job or housing, so we need a civil law alternative that keeps people out of criminal court.
Getting to this point has showcased the near unanimity of support for this tool. It wasn’t just union members who thought this was an important tool, but also the the City Council who approved it by a unanimous 7-0 vote. Both leading candidates for Mayor, Melvin Carter and Kaohly Her, have spoken in favor of it. 
Our national democracy is under threat. Our state is facing a divided government. Our city may be our last line of defense. Now more than ever we need St. Paul to be on the side of workers. 
I hope voters will take time to learn about this process and understand how administrative citations would improve St. Paul governance and make life better for our residents.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8809-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-27 07:17:00.430137

It took him 75 days just to get a court-ordered evaluation from the Department of Mental Health, according to Sarah Boyd, spokesperson for the Clay County Sheriff’s Office.
He hasn’t been convicted of a crime. He was found incompetent to stand trial and has been in limbo ever since – stuck in jail until a bed becomes available in a state psychiatric hospital or services from the mental health department or the jail enable him to satisfy a judge that he can stand trial.
“We want folks to be restored to competency, so that they don’t have their constitutional rights violated,” Boyd said, referring to the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. “We want that to happen, and we wanted it to happen here, but that hasn’t really been the case.” 
In September, an average of 487 Missourians were waiting for a bed in a psychiatric hospital run by the department. The waitlist has grown by a third since September 2024 and almost 88% since September 2023. 
In August, that average number reached 492, an all-time high.

These numbers include people who are receiving services – including medication, therapy and competency education — in jails or out on bond, according to the department.
Lawmakers in 2023 authorized the department to provide jail-based competency, and programs have been established in St. Louis city and county, along with Jackson and Clay counties. The law also allows outpatient treatment for individuals who can be safely released on bond. 
The department has also expanded two mobile teams of clinicians who provide medication and case management to people on the waitlist through in-person jail visits and telehealth.
A year after the launch of the first jail-based competency programs, sheriffs, corrections medical staff and jail administrators say that although the new initiatives have helped address mental health needs, they aren’t enough to tackle the waitlist — or address the underlying need for mental health and substance use treatment that keeps some people cycling in and out of jail.
Only 12 people have so far attained competency after completing a jail-based pilot program, according to the department, and 52 people have participated.
Dr. Jeanette Simmons, deputy director of the state mental health department, said the growing waitlist isn’t a surprise.
“Our numbers have increased,” Simmons said. “We predicted that they would increase.”
Simmons attributed the increase to a static number of hospital beds and increasing numbers of competency evaluation requests from courts.
“As that number continues to increase, I’m not surprised that the number of folks found incompetent increases,” Simmons said. “It clearly correlates together.”
Simmons said the department has dialed up efforts to help people take first steps toward competency while they are waiting in jail, and that the mobile teams in particular have seen successes. Last year, 117 people attained competency through the teams’ work, according to the department. 
“Just by virtue of getting people started on their medications and stabilizing their psychiatric condition, they have restored to competence,” Simmons said.
Boyd, the spokesperson for the Clay County Sheriff’s Office, said Sheriff Will Akin was initially “frustrated” with the pilot program because it wasn’t clear to him at first that his jail would be expected to take patients from Platte, Buchanan and Andrew counties. 
Boyd said the program has been successful for those who participated in it and that Akin and the department have agreed on a plan to work together.
“We definitely want to continue with the program here,” Boyd said, “and we’re moving forward in a way that he thinks will make it successful.”
The idea of county jails housing mental health patients from other counties has been a deterrent for some to participate. Greene County Sheriff Jim Arnott told The Independent in January that was the reason he opted out of the pilot program.
“I’m not going to participate in a warehousing contract of people that are mentally ill that shouldn’t be in jail in the first place,” Arnott said in January.
There are currently six people participating in the Clay County program, Boyd said on Monday. Four were transferred from counties in the Kansas City metro area and northwestern Missouri. Seven people are waiting for a spot in the pilot program or a hospital.
Boyd said that although the department pays the sheriff’s office $900 a day to cover program costs, the jail has sometimes had to send general population inmates to other detention centers to keep a pod available for competency restoration, at a daily cost of $65-$100 per inmate.
Dr. Paula Oldeg, director of corrections medicine in St. Louis County, said that while jail-based services will not eliminate the waitlist, participants in the county’s pilot program have received a higher level of care than is usually available in the jail.
“A jail is not the best place to really treat any condition,” Oldeg said. “A jail is not designed for that. That said, if we don’t treat it, my gosh, people can languish. They can decompensate. They can really suffer, not just mentally but physically.”
A man who waited months to be transferred to a psychiatric hospital died in a Kansas City jail in May. He started harming himself and lost touch with reality after being detained.
The St. Louis County pilot program, which accepted its first patients in January, has had 16 participants in all. Two have been deemed competent. One person was classified as permanently incompetent after multiple assessments. Two were released on bond or transferred. Two were dismissed for violent behavior. Two others opted out of the program.
Sheriffs in rural counties have had to rely on their own resources and community relationships to meet mental health needs in their jails.
Pemiscot County Sheriff Joe Bryant said his office contracts with a local company to provide services in his jail.
“They’ll come do that for us,” Bryant said, “which is great for us, because before that, there was really nothing.”
Perry County Sheriff Jason Klaus said there’s no room in his budget to hire a medical team, but he partners with a local provider to deliver substance use treatment in his 35-person jail at no charge to the sheriff’s office. 
Klaus said that while he appreciates the mobile teams’ work, the competency restoration process doesn’t necessarily meet behavioral health needs.
He said that when possible, he works with attorneys and judges to allow inmates to enroll in residential treatment programs on bond or medical furlough. He’s looking into doing this for people in his jail on the competency restoration waitlist.
“I want to hold people accountable,” Klaus said. “No mistake about that. However, I also believe that somebody sitting in jail for an indefinite amount of time, it’s not getting anyone any kind of justice.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091423_DeptMentalHealth3-1024x690.jpg,,,2025-10-27 06:57:27.446030

Over 598,000 adults — about 10.6% of our state’s population — live with diabetes, and the numbers keep increasing.
Each year, more than 31,000 Missourians receive a new diagnosis, adding to the already heavy burden on our health care system. Diabetes impacts communities unevenly. Rural residents, low-income families and Black and Hispanic Missourians experience higher rates of the disease and encounter more barriers to consistent, effective care.
That’s why having access to tools that help people manage diabetes safely and effectively is so crucial.
In recent years, Missouri has made significant progress. MO HealthNet (our state’s Medicaid program) now covers continuous glucose monitors (or CGMs) for those who use insulin — without requiring prior authorization. In 2024, this coverage expanded to include individuals with gestational diabetes, again, without additional administrative barriers.
These are important steps forward for patients, families, and health care providers across the state.
But we can do even better. The next step is ensuring that people with diabetes have their choice of CGM.
Currently, MO HealthNet limits coverage to a single “preferred” CGM brand. Patients who might benefit from a different model can only access it if their doctor verifies it is medically necessary — even after they have already submitted a prescription for the device. This causes delays and unnecessary administrative work for both the person with diabetes and the health care provider.
This restriction may seem minor, but for someone who relies on a CGM every hour of every day to help them manage their diet and activity levels, it’s important.
The Standards of Care in Diabetes of the American Diabetes Association is clear: the choice of CGM should be based on individual circumstances, preferences, and needs. This isn’t just a matter of convenience. It’s about achieving better outcomes. Studies show that when patients can select devices that suit them best, they’re more likely to wear them consistently and maintain healthier glucose levels.
By providing access to more than one device, which allows patients and their health care providers to select from all types of CGMs, Missouri would align with ADA recommendations, enhance patient choice and improve long-term health outcomes.
The American Diabetes Association urges MO HealthNet to take the final step and provide open access to all CGM brands. Doing so would reaffirm Missouri’s commitment to patient-centered care.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/insulin-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-27 06:57:27.446030

(Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)The efforts of some of the largest companies in the world, including Microsoft, Meta, Oracle and OpenAI, to develop data centers in communities across Wisconsin have sparked heated local debates among residents, government officials and even comedians. 
Those debates have often been over the data centers’ use of water and electricity, the net impact of local government deals with big corporations, the value of handing over large tracts of land for big warehouse-like buildings and the secrecy in which the plans are often shrouded. 
Data centers, buildings that house computer servers to store information for cloud-based software and, increasingly, to support the expansion of artificial intelligence, are becoming more and more prevalent in the Upper Midwest, according to the Minneapolis branch of the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
While Wisconsin still lags behind its neighbors, the state is now home to 47 data centers with more on the horizon. As communities across the state weigh the merits of accepting data center development, critics and proponents say the state needs more than the current, piecemeal local approach. 
In Port Washington, a Milwaukee suburb on the shore of Lake Michigan, the local government has supported a proposal from tech giants Open AI and Oracle to develop an AI-focused data center on 2,000 acres of farmland in the community. That project is moving forward despite local backlash. 
In Mount Pleasant, a village in Racine County where state and local officials have been trying to salvage a failed Foxconn development, Microsoft has spent billions of dollars for the construction of two data centers in the community. 
But in nearby Caledonia, Microsoft was forced to back off a planned development after backlash from local residents led to the denial of a requested zoning change. 
Overwhelmingly, the largest complaints about data centers are the electricity and water usage. A recent Bloomberg News report found that the construction of data centers has caused electric bills in nearby communities to surge because of the high energy needs of the centers. A recent report from Clean Wisconsin found that just the data centers in Mount Pleasant and Port Washington will use enough electricity to power 4.3 million homes. 
Many data centers need to use water to cycle through their cooling systems, which are necessary because computer equipment can’t be allowed to overheat. While proponents of data centers have downplayed the amount of water required to run the cooling systems, critics point to the water use associated with the increase in electricity demand. Wisconsin’s existing power plants use a high amount of water.
These demands on water have become especially fraught as the data centers have become increasingly concentrated in southeast Wisconsin, where residents are very protective of Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes watershed. 
Melissa Scanlan, the director of UW-Milwaukee’s Center for Water Policy, says Wisconsin’s failure to address data centers comprehensively could quickly put an overly burdensome strain on the state’s utilities.
“There should be a state level review of all of the potential proposals, so that the state can assess the impact on electricity generation and water supply,” Scanlan says. “Doing it in a piecemeal way, where you’ve got local governments deciding about hosting, but then utilities that are committed to supplying the electricity and water, is going to very quickly bump up against the realities of our ability to generate electricity in a responsible way.”
Robin Palm, a certified urban planner who lives in Milwaukee, says he’s largely supportive of data centers because they provide local governments with a consistent source of property tax revenue without requiring many city services. 
“A data center is extremely low services, they’re not going to have kids that need to go to school,” he says. “They are not going to have homeowners that are going to make demands at the village board, and they’re not going to have police calls because of crime or anything like that. So it’s a really low services, high value land use.”
He says the current approach of leaving these decisions up to local officials and zoning boards has pointed the public’s skepticism in the wrong direction. The local officials, he says, are making an easy economic development calculation when the real blame for the confusion should go to the state Public Service Commission and power companies — which have failed to support the expansion of renewable energy in the state. 
Palm points to Iowa, which has far more data centers than Wisconsin and gets more than 60% of its power supply from wind. 
“[Iowa is] getting cheap electricity. They use a lot more per capita than a lot of other states, and they’re way far ahead of us in data centers, and it’s mostly renewable,” he says. “I can’t see anything to complain about that situation. So it seems to me that the obvious culprit, I think, on our side, is the PSC and We Energies. There is something in that mechanism that’s basically screwing us.” 
Warning about a ‘data center stampede’
Late last month, state Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said that a “data center stampede” has started in Wisconsin and that state officials need to develop some sort of statewide plan for how to manage it. 
“We must develop a statewide plan for data centers that prioritizes the needs of our neighbors and its impact on the environment and our communities before the profit margins of private utilities and big tech companies,” he said in a statement. “If we don’t, the data center stampede will likely continue unabated, and in its wake may very well be a Wisconsin we no longer recognize — one that has abandoned its tradition of protecting our air, water, and land for future generations.”
Richard Heinemann, an attorney for Madison-based law firm Boardman Clark, says state lawmakers have already made a policy statement affirming their desire for the construction of data centers. In the 2023-25 state budget, passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, a provision was included to give a sales tax rebate on the “development, construction, renovation, expansion, replacement, repair, or operation” of data centers. 
Heinemann also points to two bills signed into law by Evers earlier this year to advance the development of nuclear energy in the state. That legislation was introduced specifically to respond to the increased energy demands of data centers.
“Wisconsin must be prepared to meet soaring energy demands that will be driven by the development of data centers and other energy-intensive economic development,” the co-sponsorship memo states. 
But Heinemann says he believes local officials and residents already have the necessary tools to weigh in on data center development. 
“We already have procedural mechanisms in place to try to address some of these issues,” says Heinemann, who recently wrote an article about local government’s authority to intervene in Public Service Commission considerations of utility expansion. “I’m not saying every issue, but some of the important ones that people have looked at or pointed to. So I don’t know what sort of new legislation one could propose that would address these issues in some more comprehensive way, or in a way that would just provide some due process.” 
Hovering over the whole debate is the secrecy with which big tech companies have operated while working to build data centers. The corporations responsible for development are often hidden behind obscure LLCs and have a record across the country of trying to get local governments to sign non-disclosure agreements (though it’s unlikely such an agreement could stand up to Wisconsin’s open records laws). A group of environmental organizations recently had to file a lawsuit to force the city of Racine to disclose how much water it was estimating it would be providing to the Microsoft site in Mount Pleasant. 
Heinemann says these debates would go more smoothly if the companies worked in the open with communities. 
“Data centers themselves have an obligation to make sure that they’re doing the outreach necessary when they work to site a facility in a locality,” he says. “It behooves them to do that work of trying to address the needs of the locality.” 
Heinemann says says the state Public Service Commission, Department of Natural Resources and local communities through their zoning authority already have the resources they need to regulate data centers
“Each project is complicated. It does require a lot of infrastructure,” Heinemann adds. “There are a lot of potential benefits to communities, but there are also impacts on the communities, those can be addressed, and there are legal procedures and agencies whose job it is to do that.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 06:57:27.446030

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Four more Republican state senators have announced their support for drawing new congressional boundaries early in Indiana.
Both Politico and the Indianapolis Business Journal have reported, citing anonymous sources, that Braun is expected to call a special session as early as Monday.
On Friday, Sens. Scott Alexander, R-Muncie; Ron Alting, R-Lafayette; Justin Busch, R-Fort Wayne; and Daryl Schmitt, R-Jasper, posted statements in support of mid-cycle redistricting sought by President Donald Trump.
That brings the number of “yes” votes to 11, according to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s tally of public statements, with five GOP senators on record as being against. The remaining 24 are undecided or haven’t made their intentions public. Legislation needs 26 votes to pass the Senate.
The new burst of public support comes after Senate GOP caucus leadership announced last week that it didn’t have the votes.
“In light of recent events, including the federal government shutdown, and after much thought and consideration, I have decided I will be supporting efforts to redistrict Indiana’s congressional districts,” Alexander said.
“President Trump and our conservative majorities are delivering real results to improve the lives of Hoosiers and strengthen our country,” he continued. “We cannot sit on the sidelines while the Democrats continue to gerrymander and deny Americans fair representation in Washington D.C. The time to take action is now.”
Alting is one of the more moderate Republicans in the caucus. He’d been quiet on redistricting until Friday.
“The ongoing federal government shutdown has convinced me I must support efforts to redraw Indiana’s congressional maps,” Alting said. “I’ve worked alongside many of our current Indiana delegation in the State Legislature before they were elected to Congress. Given the current situation in Washington, D.C., I feel an obligation to help ensure my former colleagues are working with a strong Republican majority in the US House of Representatives.”
The House Republican caucus is believed to have the votes.
Indiana’s congressional seats are split 7-2 in favor of the GOP. National Republicans want to eliminate both Democratic seats — in Indianapolis and northwest Indiana — to help ensure Trump maintains control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)EDMOND — Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities saw enrollment increase by 3.6% this fall semester, which officials attributed in part to a rise in first-time students.
The 6,100 student increase marked the fifth consecutive year of growth and represented Oklahoma’s highest fall semester headcount in eight years. Over 175,100 students enrolled in a public institution of higher education, officials said.
The greatest growth was at the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University, which saw a 4.7% increase in enrollment, according to the analysis. Community college enrollment grew by 4.3% growth. The state’s regional schools saw the slowest growth at 1.2%. 
Oklahoma colleges and universities also saw 4.1% increase in the number of students enrolling after graduating high school. 
“While campuses across the nation are enrolling fewer first-year students, freshman enrollment at Oklahoma public colleges and universities is increasing,” Chancellor Sean Burrage said in a statement. “This positive trend reflects our state system of higher education’s ongoing commitment to affordability and student success.”
Concurrent enrollment also grew with an additional 1,400 students taking classes from an Oklahoma college or university while still in high school. 
Post-grad employment outcomes
A different analysis found that over 91% of graduates from Oklahoma higher education institutions are still employed in the state a year after graduation, but that number dropped 83% after five years. 
The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education track where graduates work to help measure graduates’ impact on the state workforce and to gauge whether degrees earned in the state are put to use. 
About 51% of non-residents were employed in the state one year after graduating. After five years, that number fell to 37.7%. 
Engineers who earned a bachelor’s degree in Oklahoma were employed one year after graduation at a rate of 72%, but this fell to 56% after five years. 
“Our engineers leave the state at higher rates than some of our other critical occupations,” said Cass Minx, the associate vice chancellor for workforce and economic development. “So this one in particular, I think really is one that we should focus on and need some of the most support to incentivize them to stay in the state.”
Nursing and teaching, however, had greater retention rates. 
Nurses with an associate’s, bachelor’s or master’s degree were working in Oklahoma one year after graduation at rates all exceeding 91%. After five years, these rates remain above 82%. 
“We still have a shortage of nurses, so we know that we still need to put forward through the pipeline,” Minx said. “But we definitely know that there are jobs waiting for nurses immediately upon graduation and that they are still working here in the state five years after graduation.”
More than 87% of teachers with a bachelor’s degree stayed in Oklahoma and 78% were still working in Oklahoma after five years. 
The same report found that as education level and work experience increases, so does pay. 
The median annual income for a graduate with a bachelor’s degree after one year was $47,169. After five years, it rose to $58,751. 
“We see that return on investment through salaries over the last several years,” she said. “Those with high school diplomas, their immediate annual wages have stayed rather stagnant, while those with a college degree and above typically increase.”
While the State Regents don’t track the wages of high school diploma recipients, this refers to findings from the U.S. Census Bureau, a spokesperson said. 
Between 2004 and 2024, earnings of those with a high school degree but no college rose 3.2%, while earnings of those with a bachelor’s degree or more went up 6.3%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 
Graduates who were recipients of the Oklahoma’s Promise scholarship also had high employment rates in the state. One year after graduation, nearly 92% of these students were employed in Oklahoma while five years later almost 82% were still working in the state.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)I’m counting my blessings that we have a state board who is refusing to kowtow to pressure from the Oklahoma legislative elite to boost lawmaker pay. 
Because judging from the pushback the Legislative Compensation Board received after refusing to give our lawmakers a pay raise, it’s obvious that some of our elected leaders have such an inflated ego that they believe they should earn far more than the average Oklahoman does while working far fewer hours.
The average hourly pay in the Oklahoma City area in 2024 was $27.95 an hour, which translates to slightly more than $58,000 a year, according to a July report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Yet, we pay our legislators on average $60,828 a year to work four months. That includes their base $47,500 salary and an extra $196 in per diem to help cover the daily expenses of legislators who live over 50 miles away from the Capitol.
That total compensation jumps to $72,869 when retirement and benefits are factored in, according to the Oklahoma Management and Enterprise Services. 
How nice it must be to be paid that much for what is designed to be a part-time job.
If you spend enough time at the Oklahoma Capitol, it’s hard to miss the fact that during the annual legislative session, our lawmakers generally only work Monday through Thursday, preferring to head home to their districts on Fridays. It’s also not usual for them to make Mondays half-days, often starting their official duties well after the noon hour. There are also plenty of days where the majority of them do pretty much nothing much consequential at all, particularly when budget negotiations are going on behind closed doors. And some of them play hookey, traveling out of state for various reasons during the session. 
And lest we forget, many of these lawmakers are perfectly happy to save a few bucks by being wined and dined — on someone else’s dime — by lobbyists hoping to woo their vote. Lobbyists reported spending over $220,000 on drinks and food for legislators during the most recent session.
Despite that, we pay them the second highest salary of our neighboring states, according to an analysis by Oklahoma Management and Enterprise Services. Only Colorado, which awards a $47,561 salary, pays more. Lawmakers there also voted recently to increase their legislators per diem.
Luckily Oklahomans have a constitutionally created board that sets our legislators’ pay. Voters realized that if left to their own devices, lawmakers would pay themselves a king’s ransom due to an inflated sense of worth.
This board meets in odd numbered years on the third Tuesday of October to set legislative pay for the lawmakers who will be elected the following November. Meeting ahead of a general election gives potential candidates clarity about what they should expect to make if they decide to run.
Five of the members of the board are appointed by the governor, two by the state House and two by the state Senate.
The Board publicly voted last week to keep legislative salaries flat for another year — a prudent decision given the fact that Oklahomans are struggling to make ends meet as they battle soaring grocery prices, a federal government shutdown that is expected to affect access to food, and some of the highest insurance rates in the nation. Lawmakers also just imprudently cut income taxes, which will eventually reduce the amount of revenue they have to spend on programs that make our schools better and our roads less pothole-ridden.
But apparently those economic realities are not a concern for Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, who leads his chamber’s Republican caucus. Paxton criticized the board’s decision to hold their salaries flat. The Senate president pro tem, by the way, will receive a 26% increase in his stipend next November. The board did vote to increase that from $18,829 to $23,750. That potentially brings the Senate president’s pay up to a whopping $84,578.
Still a tone deaf Paxton urged the board to revisit legislative pay, arguing that their job takes them away from families and “other career obligations outside of the Capitol.”
Supporters of higher pay argue that legislative service is a full-time job because they’re busy out of session meeting with constituents and doing other legislative work.
Let’s not forget that our lawmakers made the choice to do this. Nobody is forcing them to serve. If they believe they’re not being compensated fairly, they can leave. There’s always plenty of people willing to serve in their stead.
But I bet you dollars to donuts that most don’t want to do that because they are eying their next cushy roles.
Let’s take former Republican state Sen. James Leewright, R-Bristow, who in 2022 decided not to seek another term and “return to the private sector.” 
Leewright almost immediately became president and CEO of the Oklahoma Restaurant Association. He leads the group’s “public policy, advocacy and regulatory efforts,” according to the group’s website. He also serves as CEO of the Oklahoma Hotel and Lodging Association and the Oklahoma Travel Industry Association.
In addition, Leewright serves as a House appointee on this compensation board and has demanded that this board reconsider their votes on Nov. 4. He touted the common — and insulting — legislative talking point that people don’t understand what they’re doing.
Frankly, I’d like to know how someone who advocates for public policy on behalf of multiple industries ended up on a board setting legislative pay. It sure seems like a conflict of interest.
But if lawmakers genuinely feel like they’re being short-changed, maybe they should spend some time in New Mexico, whose taxpayers don’t provide their lawmakers with any annual salary. 
Maybe it will make our legislators appreciate what Oklahoma taxpayers invest in them and remind them who they truly serve.

It's the right move to right-size the tax and royalty burden on the coal industry, write industry representatives Rob Creager and Travis Deti.
The post Wyoming coal is ready to meet increasing demand for reliable, affordable energy appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration recently announced a broad plan to strengthen America’s coal industry. The Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency outlined new funding, expanded leasing and regulatory relief to extend the life of coal plants to meet rapidly increasing electricity demand and ensure reliable, affordable and dispatchable electricity.

Opinion

For Wyoming, the top coal producer in the nation, these actions matter. Coupled with the July decision to reduce the royalty rate for coal on federal lands to 7% and the state’s reduction of the severance tax on surface coal, Wyoming’s coal and mining industry is in a prime position to thrive after years of being tied to burdensome regulations and executive orders. Importantly, the tax and royalty burden on the industry has been “right-sized” to meet today’s competitive market conditions.
Wyoming coal has been the backbone of America’s power supply for decades, but it has also been carrying a heavier financial load than other fuels. Royalty rates directly affect whether Wyoming coal is competitive in the national marketplace. When the cost of production on coal is pushed higher than on competing fuels — in part due to its diverse tax structure — markets move away from coal regardless of reliability or demand. 
The Department of the Interior is leveling the playing field for the coal fuel supply by adjusting the royalty rate downward. To have a competitive coal fuel supply, taxes and royalties must be equalized. Wyoming coal has been carrying a heavier burden, and this change ensures that when utilities and consumers make decisions, they are comparing fuels on merit, not distorted by unequal tax structures.  
The stakes are not just economic. Royalty reform means Wyoming coal can remain affordable to the utilities and states that depend on it, preserving thousands of jobs and millions in revenue for schools, roads and local services. It also means stability for our rural communities that depend on coal payrolls and the spin-off economy. For too long, royalty rates have been discussed as a simple line item. In truth, they are a determining factor in whether our coal mines stay open, our plants continue to run for the long term and Wyoming coal remains a cornerstone of America’s energy supply.
The new leasing announcement is equally essential. Opening 13.1 million acres of federal land for coal production ensures that supply will be available long term. It is triple the benchmark set under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and clearly recognizes that coal is not a resource of the past but a resource for America’s increasing present and future energy demands.
These federal actions come at a critical time. Electricity demand across the United States is rising rapidly, driven by general consumer increases, data centers, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing. Meeting this demand requires every reliable source of power, and coal is the backbone of that reliability. At a time when national security and energy independence are at the forefront, coal ensures our nation can generate power without depending on unstable global markets.
Along with the royalty rate reduction and leasing announcement, the Department of Energy committed $625 million in investments to extend plant life and improve reliability. These measures give coal plants the time and flexibility to continue operations while innovation and advanced technologies progress.
There are short-term pains in adjusting to and weathering the debates around coal’s future. But the long-term gains are far greater. Royalty relief, fair taxes and federal support give Wyoming coal a fair shot to compete and to continue delivering what America needs: affordable, reliable, dispatchable energy and secure jobs for Wyoming families.
Leadership at the federal and state levels has brought significant, welcomed changes to an industry that has struggled to keep up with the pendulum swings of new federal administrations over the recent decade. 
Trump’s policies are about ensuring Wyoming coal remains a vital part of America’s energy future. They will strengthen our communities, secure and create good-paying jobs, and give confidence that Wyoming coal will be there to do the job and power the nation. 
The Wyoming Energy Authority and the Wyoming Mining Association are proud to support these changes and initiatives together. We have long worked with Gov. Mark Gordon, Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, Rep. Harriett Hageman, the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources and many across the state to ensure coal remains part of the national conversation. Recent announcements show that effort is making a difference.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The potential impeachment of University of Nebraska Regent Elizabeth O’Connor appears more likely after a legislative committee hosted a briefing on what the process would look like and committee leadership echoed calls for her resignation.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, who has said she would pursue impeachment, has proposed a timeline to do so and made available a video of a car crash authorities accuse O’Connor of causing while allegedly drunk in May. Kauth said she received the video from the injured family involved.

The Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee, which would likely handle articles of impeachment against O’Connor, hosted a 30-minute briefing Friday. Kauth told the committee she would introduce a resolution to begin the impeachment process on day one of the 2026 session, Jan. 7, which would require a public hearing after. That’s if O’Connor does not resign.
Voters in central and western Douglas County elected O’Connor to a second six-year term in November. She is a former University of Nebraska at Omaha student regent.
O’Connor declined to comment. Her attorney could not be reached for comment.
Pressure ramps up
Prosecutors accuse O’Connor of driving drunk around 8:30 p.m. May 21, when she allegedly crashed into an oncoming car with five passengers in it, including three children under the age of 7. The front passenger, the children’s grandmother, sustained a broken back and pelvis.
Police collected a blood sample from O’Connor almost three hours after the crash. It came back at 0.321%, four times the legal limit, police allege in court documents. 
A video of the alleged crash, captured by a home security system of a resident of the street where the crash occurred, shows an eastbound green Subaru Outback crossing into the wrong side of the road in Omaha’s Benson neighborhood before colliding with a westbound white Ford Focus. Both cars were totaled.

Kauth had already called for O’Connor’s resignation and suggested impeachment. Now, the chair and vice chair of the Government Committee say O’Connor should resign.
“I’m hoping there won’t be a need for the process,” said State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, committee chair.
“If she’s not willing to do the right thing by resigning her position, then we need to help her to do so,” said State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County, committee vice chair.

Ricoh Mountain, the father of the children who sustained minor injuries in the crash, has pressed publicly for O’Connor’s resignation, including at the latest NU Board of Regents meeting this month.
Kauth set a deadline of mid-session 2026 for O’Connor and said she will file articles of impeachment then if O’Connor hasn’t resigned. It takes 25 votes in the 49-member Legislature to impeach.
‘How we need to proceed’
Kauth said she sought Friday’s briefing because the last impeachment vote came in 2006, nearly two decades ago. It would be just the third impeachment vote of the last century. A former NU regent was impeached and removed from office in 2006, and the state’s attorney general was impeached and removed from office in 1984.
Seven of the eight Government Committee members attended the briefing. State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst, who attended a committee hearing earlier Friday, left for planned travel.

The briefing was originally meant to be closed-door, which Kauth said was done with O’Connor in mind. The committee voted 3-3 to do so, with another “present, not voting.” Conservatives sought to close the meeting at Kauth’s request, and liberals voted to make it open. One Republican, State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, took no position. 
Andersen said after the briefing that his focus is accountability. He said that when someone is in a position of authority, they can’t “pick and choose” when to make sound judgment.
“When somebody demonstrates in such a blatant way that they have complete disregard for the rules and the rules of law and the safety of people in the general public, it shows that they can’t remain in a position of authority,” Andersen said.
Sanders said the briefing helped put her committee members “at ease” and helped them know that there is a process in place and any questions they might have can be answered. Only a few clarifying questions were asked and just one to Kauth confirming that impeachment would need to be juggled around any other legislative matters in a 60-day session.
State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings said of the briefing: “It’s good to know how we need to proceed.”
Committee partisan split
Kauth said she anticipates impeachment would be bipartisan, arguing it’s about the public perception of state officials generally, not just one person. The officially nonpartisan Legislature has 33 Republicans, 15 Democrats and one nonpartisan progressive. The Government Committee is split 5-3 ideologically, majority Republican. O’Connor is a registered Democrat; Kauth is a Republican.
“It should only matter that this is an incident that happened,” Kauth said.

Omaha State Sens. John Cavanaugh, Dunixi Guereca and Megan Hunt, the minority on the committee, declined to comment after the briefing. Hunt, the registered nonpartisan, represents O’Connor and the injured family members in central Douglas County. 
Wordekemper also declined to comment. He could be the deciding committee vote on advancing impeachment.
Even without impeachment, the Nebraska Constitution prohibits felons from holding office, and O’Connor faces one felony charge of driving drunk and causing serious injury to another person, filed in July. Short of a felony conviction, the Legislature is the only path to removing a statewide official from office.
Omaha City Prosecutor Kevin Slimp is taking the lead on the case from the Douglas County Attorney’s Office, which normally handles felony prosecutions, because O’Connor, until early August, had served as a deputy county attorney for civil matters. O’Connor resigned from that post but has not publicly addressed her elected position.
Public trust ‘finite resource’
Kauth said that’s particularly troubling as regents oversee a nearly $3.6 billion operating budget, $700 million of which is from state tax revenue, and determine the general government of the university system. Regents also hire top campus administrators, generally oversee campuses, set short- and long-term goals and establish and enforce standards of conduct.

Pointing to NU policies, Kauth noted the regents can discipline any employee or student whose use of alcohol or drugs off campus adversely affects their work or academic performance or impairs the safety of themself or others. That action is independent of any outside criminal, civil or administrative penalties.
“A more honest, self-reflected individual would look at this situation and recognize the egregiousness of her actions and choose to resign,” Kauth told the committee.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican who served as an NU regent between 2013 and 2023, including four years with O’Connor, has previously said that while O’Connor is innocent until proven guilty, “If she knows the allegations against her to be true, I urge her to reflect on whether she should remain in a position of public trust.”
If impeached, a state official is suspended from service as the case moves to the Nebraska Supreme Court, which conducts the impeachment trial. In other states, the impeachment trial would normally go to a second legislative chamber, which Nebraska doesn’t have. Two state senators would argue the case.

It takes five of the seven justices to convict on “clear and convincing” evidence. Justices could decide to bar an impeached official from holding future office. 
Kauth said she feels lawmakers could clear that bar.
Dick Clark, legal counsel for the government Committee, said at the briefing that an impeachment trial “jumps the line” and would become the top priority for the Supreme Court. Impeachment in Nebraska generally concerns “any misdemeanor in office,” Clark said, or any “malfeasance” as determined by the Legislature and evaluated by the Supreme Court.
Andersen said resigning would be the right thing “on everybody’s account,” and Kauth said no state senator wants to pursue impeachment but that it’s the Legislature’s responsibility if needed.
“We have to hold ourselves to high standards,” Kauth said. “Public trust is a finite resource, and if we continue to erode it, we fall apart.”

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)As the federal government shutdown continues, Idaho’s ability to continue funding for a public assistance program for pregnant moms, new mothers and parents of young children is unclear. 
Tariff revenue is funding Idaho’s Women Infants and Children, or WIC, program through October, and maybe even into November, said Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter. But the state health agency isn’t sure how it would keep funding WIC if the government shutdown lasts until November.
“We don’t have formal guidance about that at this time,” he said in emailed statements. 
If the shutdown stretches into November, which is less than a week away, WIC could run out of funds, USA Today reported. 
Idaho and many other states last week said they would soon stop giving out food assistance benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps. The government shutdown is prompting the pauses. 
The public assistance programs serve low-income earners. Nearly 32,000 Idahoans are on WIC, and almost 133,000 Idahoans are on SNAP, state figures show.

Public health districts in southern Idaho said last week that WIC is still open.
A spokesperson for Central District Health, which serves Ada, Boise, Elmore and Valley counties, said district officials “are closely monitoring the situation and will keep participants updated if anything changes.”

“While federal funding is a bit uncertain without a resolution to end the government shutdown, (Central District Health) plans to continue to remain open to serve our WIC clients,” spokesperson Stephanie Borders said in an emailed statement. “We will use unspent funds from last year’s grant and carryover funds (Central District Health) has from last year’s fiscal budget to pay staff salaries.”
Southwest District Health, which serves Adams, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and Washington counties, has “been communicating to families to continue to attend their appointments and use their benefits as usual,” spokesperson Monique Evancic said in an emailed statement.

The Payette Land Trust and The Wilderness Land Trust announced this month that they partnered to purchase a 94-acre private land inholding within the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness last year. 
In the days before the federal government shutdown began Oct. 1, the land trusts were able to transfer the land to public ownership and officially add it to the designated wilderness area, The Wilderness Land Trust Director of Marketing and Communications Margosia Jadkowski said. 
That means that the Annie Creek property, which includes wetlands, gentle slopes and creeks, is in public hands and permanently protected from development.
 Property would have been vulnerable to development without conservation efforts of the land trusts

The property is located near the western edge of the Frank Church wilderness, about 40 miles from McCall. 
Officials said the property is located near a developed road and would have been vulnerable to development if it wasn’t purchased by the land trusts and added to the wilderness area.
The Leuthold Foundation also contributed support to help purchase the property, officials said. 
“Idaho is changing at a rapid rate which requires voluntary partnerships between private landowners, organizations and foundations to conserve Idaho’s natural beauty,” Payette Land Trust Executive Director Craig Utter said in a written statement. “We are proud to work with The Wilderness Land Trust and the Leuthold Foundation to conserve this unique landscape into the future.”
One of the crown jewels of public land in Idaho, the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness is the largest contiguous wilderness area in the Lower 48 and includes approximately 2.3 million acres. 
The Frank Church wilderness was originally created by Congress in 1980. The Salmon River flows through the wilderness, which is habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife, including deer, black bears, wolves, coyotes, lynx, elk, mountain lions, beavers, salmon and endangered wolverines. 
The Frank Church wilderness also served as one of the original sites of wolf reintroduction in 1995.
“Thanks to our partnerships with the Payette Land Trust and the Leuthold Foundation, this special place will be protected for future generations to enjoy in one of America’s most iconic wilderness areas,” said The Wilderness Land Trust President Brad Borst in a written statement. 
 Wilderness designation is the highest form of protection for public lands in the U.S.

Private land inholdings located within a wilderness area – many of which would have been privately owned and grandfathered in before the wilderness designations were created – were not subject to the same protections as the wilderness area, officials said. 
A wilderness designation is the highest form of protection available for public lands and can only be changed by an act of Congress. A wilderness designation protects land from development and motorized use, seeking to preserve the natural, primitive state of land. 
Over the past 33 years, The Wilderness Land Trust has worked to buy private land inholdings within wilderness areas and transfer the properties to public ownership to become part of the official wilderness areas. Since its founding, The Wilderness Land Trust has purchased 614 such properties and transferred them to be added to wilderness areas in the U.S., Jadkowski said. The Payette Land Trust owns or holds conservation easements on 21 properties, totaling nearly 3,900 acres, officials said.

(Photo: Courtesy NC Black Alliance)It’s the most wonderful time of the year. Well, almost. Autumn leaves will fall first, rolling out a brownish-orange carpet for Thanksgiving and, before that, Halloween. Just how happy those holidays will be is the thing.
The National Retail Federation (NRF) should have some insight during a Nov. 6 media call announcing its retail sales forecast for the 2025 winter holiday season. Next to back-to-college shopping, the winter holidays are when we spend the most money, according to the NRF.
We, the people, had the holiday spirit in early NRF forecasting. During the last winter holiday season, the average U.S. consumer spent $874.67. That’s expected to increase to $901.99 this year. Which is surprising after our elected officials in Congress shut down the federal government by failing to agree on a budget that would keep funds flowing to cover or offset costs for necessary stuff — like health insurance.
Here, listen to Karida Giddings, the access to health care program coordinator for North Carolina Black Alliance: “How do you decide between filling prescriptions or having food on the table, between going to the doctor or presents under the tree?”
Two of Giddings’ visionary initiatives positioned her to take North Carolina’s pulse this year: Rooted in Wellness Day, an annual statewide health and wellness outreach, and her OUR State of Health tour of rural communities.
“We’ve had the opportunity to hear directly from Black North Carolinians about what wellness really means when the cost of living keeps rising and health care affordability feels increasingly out of reach,” Giddings said. “Our communities are carrying the weight of policy decisions they didn’t make — decisions that will soon force them to choose between their health, their household and their holiday traditions.”
On Jan. 1 — really comprehend this, now — the health care premiums of 22 million Americans will double. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 4.2 million people won’t have health insurance because they’ll be priced out of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace on account of rich people who got tax breaks while those in the middle and working classes lost the subsidies that made their lifesaving colonoscopies affordable.
Republicans did that. If it’s too harsh to call them a bunch of Scrooges, then they’re at least elves working for a mean Santa who gave orders to stuff coal in our stockings.
“As premium tax credit enhancements expire and insurance premiums climb, many will wonder whether they can afford to stay insured at all,” Giddings said. “Medicaid expansion offered long-awaited relief, but that progress is now at risk of being undermined by policies that raise costs elsewhere.”
Earlier this year, on the Fourth of July, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law. One of the things it set in motion was some $800 billion in Medicaid cuts over the next decade, with 10 million people projected to lose coverage, according to the CBO.
“I go to the doctor regularly. I’m with Medicaid,” Anson County resident Chavis McQueen said.“Four dollars when I go to a visit. My co-pay is not very high, so my health is pretty good right now.”
Right. For now.
“Medicaid is good,” McQueen said. “Medicare is more for, like, the older [people]. I’m not there yet. But if we get rid of Medicaid, I might not make it there.”
McQueen, 43, works with youth at the HOLLA! Center in Morven, a rural North Carolina town. He’s trying to get a baseball team going for the kids. That’s a good thing for obvious reasons, keeping young people off the streets and all of that. But if one of them breaks a leg sliding into third base, let’s hope the kid’s mama ain’t on Medicaid.
Politicians are accountable to the people, both those who did and didn’t vote for them.
McQueen’s eyeing North Carolina’s senators. “Hopefully, Thom Tillis and Ted — what’s his name? — Budd; hopefully, they’ll be able to do some things,” McQueen said. “That’s why we have to get out here and vote.”
If Tillis, Budd and others on their side of the aisle don’t do what they know is right by extending health care subsidies, then a whole lot of folks are looking at paying roughly $500 extra each month for the right to go see a doctor. That’s from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
It’s really unconscionable to know that’s why the government is shut down, all because individuals who are able to afford medical care are OK denying it to other human beings.
“This is the type of economic uncertainty many folks will face: families stretching dollars, skipping follow-up appointments or postponing lifesaving screenings,” Giddings said. “The question isn’t just how we’ll get through the holidays, it’s how we’ll continue to build power to ensure wellness isn’t seasonal, but sustained year-round.”
All of that while heading into the most wonderful time of the year.

Bill Lee cautioned SNAP recipients Friday to prepare for a lapse in their benefits starting Nov. 1 and blamed congressional Democrats for failing to end the government shutdown.
“The longer Democrats wait to reopen the government, the more delays customers can expect as the program restarts,” a Friday statement from the Governor’s Office said.
Some 690,000 Tennesseans who use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could lose the benefit in November if the U.S. Senate fails to pass a resolution to continue spending federal funds. The federal government spends about $146 million a month putting money onto SNAP cards.
The Governor’s Office release said the program is federally funded and operated and Tennessee won’t be able to use state money to provide the benefit because it doesn’t have a mechanism to load benefits onto recipients’ cards.
Nearly 1 in 10 Tennesseans could lose SNAP benefits come November if government shutdown continues

“Congress has a responsibility to fund the federal government, and while Democrats continue to hold federal dollars hostage, my administration is working with members of the faith community and nonprofit partners to ensure Tennessee families do not go hungry,” Lee said in the statement. “I share the frustration of hardworking Tennesseans who will be impacted by this temporary lapse, and sincerely hope Democrats will choose to put the American people ahead of politics and reopen the government now.”
The Governor’s Office sent the statement a day after Tennessee House Democrats urged him to call a special session to provide funding to fill in the gap and ensure people receive SNAP benefits and other federal services.
“While Washington, D.C. is broken and you may blame whoever you wish for the shutdown, we, as state leaders, have a duty to rise above the partisan politics and serve those we represent,” House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Ray Clemmons wrote to the governor. 
U.S. Senate Democrats have refused to vote for the funding resolution, using their holdout as leverage against President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill and cuts to Medicaid and the end of some Affordable Care Act subsidies. The measure needs 60 votes to pass, and Republicans hold 53 seats, meaning they need seven votes out of 45 Democrats and two independents.










While Washington, D.C. is broken and you may blame whoever you wish for the shutdown, we, as state leaders, have a duty to rise above the partisan politics and serve those we represent.


– Rep. John Ray Clemmons, House Democratic Caucus 


Tennessee Department of Human Services Commissioner Clarence Carter backed up Lee’s assertion that no benefits will be added to recipients’ cards starting in November unless the federal government reopens. He promised that the state would be “ready to act quickly” when federal operations resume.
Sen. Heidi Campbell, a Nashville Democrat, called on the governor to “spare us the political spin” and offer solutions to keep people from being hurt by the shutdown.
“Gov. Lee’s finger-pointing doesn’t change the facts — the Republican Speaker of the U.S. House hasn’t opened the chamber for legislative work since Sept. 19. That means for more than a month, House Republicans have been on vacation while Donald Trump’s shutdown hurts families, freezes paychecks, and stalls vital services for Tennesseans,” Campbell said.

Mike Crapo stands to the right of President Donald Trump as the president signs the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" on the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, July 4, 2025. (Courtesy of White House Office of Legislative Affairs)Idaho’s U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo’s choice to revise the House version of the 2025 reconciliation bill (H.R.1) and expand the child tax credit to include two million previously excluded children was a good, fair-minded decision. 
Unfortunately, he joined Idaho’s congressional delegation in passing the largest cut to public health care funding in U.S. history. He was crucial to Senate negotiations that resulted in this bill; it is anything but beautiful. It punishes Idaho families, effectively excluding many from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, and cutting Medicaid for others. Seventy thousand or more Idahoans will be impacted directly, and many will become uninsured. These cuts will reverberate throughout Idaho’s health care system, impacting everyone. 
Thousands of Idahoans could lose health care coverage under federal spending bill

It’s not a minor inconvenience to be uninsured. I grew up before Medicaid or Medicare existed. It was the 1950s and 1960s, decades before the Affordable Care Act was imagined. As blue-collar workers, my parents’ jobs did not provide health insurance. Most people in my community were uninsured. I did not get health coverage until I was 30 years old. 
I remember my mother treating my leg wound at home because we couldn’t afford to pay the doctor that week. When more serious illnesses and injuries happened, my parents simply had to figure out how to make payments on medical bills. 
When I was 10, my mother got cancer. We received no financial assistance. The cost of her surgery and treatment plunged my parents into medical debt than haunted them throughout their working lives. It wasn’t until well after I left home in 1969 that my dad got health insurance through his job. 
As they aged and finally retired, they received Medicare. Their retirement income could never have supported their increasing health care costs as they aged. Medicare was a financial lifeline. That’s why Medicare was created. There was public recognition that few seniors could afford to pay health care costs out-of-pocket. Few insurance companies would even cover seniors. The 1950 census showed that only one in eight people over 60 had health insurance. Lives were jeopardized, and the quality of life for many seniors was abysmal. 
Similarly, Medicaid and the ACA were created because the public recognized that many working families, people with disabilities and others cannot pay health costs out-of-pocket without having those costs deplete all other family budget items – housing, food, utilities. 
The need still exists in the current era where health costs are many times larger as a portion of household costs than when my mother got cancer. The difference seems to be that there is a worldview loose in the world that demeans people with health needs and little ability to pay, accusing them of being fraudsters. 
The entire Idaho congressional delegation cites “waste, fraud and abuse” as the basis for these cuts of the health coverage for 70,000 Idaho families, particularly the cuts to Medicaid. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates there is little of it in the health care cuts they are making. Georgetown University Center for Children and Families simply states, “This narrative is simply false.” 
Instead of taking a scalpel to remove whatever problems might exist in our public health care system, the majority in the 2025 Congress took a scythe, and became the grim reaper, cutting coverage for many millions of people nationwide. New estimates of the net impact of these health care cuts in the 2025 tax bill (H.R.1) project that 7.5 million people nationwide will have no or drastically reduced health care coverage. They needed a second opinion before they decided to perform such radical surgery on an entire system. 
Idaho advocates estimate that because of this bill, 80 extra people will die unnecessarily every year because they’re uninsured. People without insurance or ability to pay can’t access health care. They don’t get the primary care and testing needed to identify and treat health conditions before they become emergency room visits. Emergency room visits are the most expensive access point in the health care system. Again, the treatment to address a questionable diagnosis will create a more costly approach to health care. 
Sen. Crapo used to champion health care. His flyers still tout his advocacy on various health issues. Sadly, with H.R. 1, Sen. Crapo has joined his Idaho colleagues in Congress in a blunder that will cost Idaho families: in dollars, in fear of not being able to pay for essential health services for their families, in their health, and even in lives. In fact, Sen. Crapo was a key advocate, taking the House bill and negotiating changes to get it through the Senate. He cannot claim ignorance. 
Actions and intentions matter. I do not know the intentions of Sen. Crapo and his Idaho-based congressional colleagues. But their actions are creating immense harm to Idaho families that will roll out for years. Only when they take action to correct this huge and damaging mistake will they show that they did not mean to harm and demean Idaho families.

This story was originally reported by Amanda Becker of The 19th.  Meet Amanda and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
When Kendra Sullivan woke up on Wednesday, the 43-year-old West Virginian was surprised to see that she’d gone viral overnight — in a good way.
The night before, more than 40,000 people had joined YouTube for a what’s-next meeting following the 2,700 “No Kings” pro-democracy demonstrations on Saturday attended by as many as 7 million across the country. The livestream was organized by the same broad coalition of good-government, religious and advocacy groups that arranged the protests. Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, an Appalachian activist and the first Black woman to serve as co-executive director at the Highlander Research & Education Center, a social justice leadership school in Tennessee that dates back to before the Civil Rights Movement, revved up participants by showing photos they’d submitted of Saturday’s events.
She shared a dispatch from Chattanooga, Tennessee, “my hometown, the town I was born in,” Henderson said, where “over 2,000 people came out to declare that Appalachians don’t lick boots and that ICE belongs in sweet tea, not in Tennessee!”
She thanked the thousands of people who marched in Washington for “holding down this resistance movement right on Trump’s freaking doorstep.” She gave a shoutout to senior citizens at an assisted living center in White Plains, New York, whose protest drew 350 people from 2 to 102 years old. She also relayed that pouring rain did not stop 8,000 people in Fort Worth, Texas, from “turning out to say that we see this administration for what it is, and we will not stand for rising fascism.”
Then, as the call drew to a close, Henderson concluded with a Saturday demonstration that was notable for its attendance — a single person: Sullivan.
“And last but not least, in Beckley, West Virginia, Kendra Sullivan staged a one-woman ‘No Kings’ action. Y’all didn’t hear me. I’m gonna say it one more time: In Beckley, West Virginia, Kendra Sullivan — shout out to Kendra Sullivan! — staged a one-woman ‘No Kings’ action. People confronted her. They called the cops on her. They physically threatened her, but she stayed, and she stood up for what she believed in. Kendra, we are with you,” Henderson said.
Sullivan wasn’t on Tuesday night’s call. But on Wednesday, she started seeing messages from people who’d heard about her protest during Henderson’s roundup.
“The majority are people I’ve never met, I’m not Facebook friends with and have no connection to,” Sullivan told The 19th. “I just read a message from a woman who said, ‘You make me feel so much less alone.’ Lots of them feel like a tiny blue speck in a red state.”
She never anticipated it, she said — “I forget about the power of the internet.” On Saturday, though, “I felt pretty lonely.”
Sullivan knew that she’d attend a “No Kings” event on Saturday. She described herself as more politically engaged than the average person and said she has participated in past events, but had no idea until she woke up that morning that it would be a one-woman stand.
On Friday, after work, she’d driven the two-plus hours from where she lives in Clarksburg, West Virginia, to Beckley, where she grew up, a city of about 16,000 in the southern part of the state. Her mother was headed out of town on a “girls trip” to Bermuda, Sullivan said, and had asked her to look after her dogs.

“I knew that there wasn’t a ‘No Kings’ rally in Beckley, so initially I thought I’d go to one in Charleston or Fayetteville or Lewisburg, but all of that was going to require more travel for me when I’d already driven two hours to dog sit for my mom,” Sullivan explained.
On Saturday, she woke up and told herself, “You know what? My mom lives off basically a main drive through town, so I could just walk down, hold up my sign for an hour, and call it a day — because there was no way I wasn’t going to participate.”
Sullivan ran the idea past her father, who also lives in town; he told her it was a good plan. She put in her AirPods and grabbed her handmade signs — “This aggression will not stand, man” and “ICE? Let’s get ICE off our streets and into our beverages, man,” both references to Jeff Bridges’ character “The Dude” in the film “The Big Lebowski.” Bridges had recently appeared on Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show and Sullivan found what he had to say “inspiring,” she said. She walked down the street to the main road and started “singing and dancing around on the street corner.”
Twenty minutes in, an older man came out of the house she was standing in front of and hung a sign supporting President Donald Trump. Then a police car pulled up, followed by another. “It was one of those moments of, ‘Oh my goodness, are they here for me?’ I wasn’t blocking traffic, I wasn’t cursing, I was just exercising my First Amendment rights,” Sullivan said.
Sullivan asked if she’d done anything wrong. The first officer, a man, told her absolutely not; they were just following up on a report that had been phoned in. The second officer, a woman, had joined him because they knew the protester was a woman on her own. The officers confirmed everything was OK and left.
Ten minutes later, a car pulled into the house where the man, still on his porch, had hung the Trump sign. A younger man got out and mentioned that his grandfather was a Korean War veteran. “I said that’s cool, but that’s not ICE,” Sullivan said. He crossed the street and told her as he took photos of her: “You can smile real pretty.”
She called 9-1-1.
The police came back, this time with a third officer. Sullivan started to cry a little. The officers, she said, “were so comforting.” They stayed with her for a half-hour or so and then went on their way. Sullivan ended up staying longer than she’d originally planned, close to two hours.
“I do know people in Beckley who went to alternate locations on Saturday, but I think you need to show your face to your actual neighbors” — or, in this case, her parents’ neighbors, as well as people she grew up with. “It’s not enough to put up a sign,” she said. “It’s important to let people know what those who don’t support this look like, that we’re just like everybody else: We are America.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kendra-Sullivan-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 06:16:31.667578

(Andrew Fraieli/Colorado Newsline)With a little over a week to go until Election Day, early data released by Colorado elections officials show 2025 mail ballot returns significantly outpacing figures from the past two off-year elections.

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

Over 354,000 Coloradans had returned their ballots as of Friday, according to a press release from the secretary of state’s office, which compiled return figures reported by the state’s 64 county clerks.
By comparison, a reported total of 266,094 voters had voted at the same point two years ago. As a percentage of active registered voters across the state, this year’s early returns put Colorado on pace for highest off-year election turnout since 2019.
The state holds coordinated elections in odd-numbered years to elect candidates for certain school boards, municipal offices and other local races, often alongside one or more statewide ballot issues. In 2025, Colorado lawmakers have referred two measures to the ballot, Propositions LL and MM, which would shore up funding for the state’s universal school meals program.

As usual, older Coloradans have made up the vast majority of voters returning a ballot so far this year. More than half of all ballots cast as of Friday were returned by voters aged 65 or older, according to the secretary of state’s data. By comparison, voters aged 18 to 34 accounted for just 8.9% of all early ballot returns.
Voters without a party affiliation, who make up half of all active Colorado voters, had returned 142,827 ballots as of Friday. Registered Republicans had returned 107,094 ballots, outpacing registered Democrats, who had returned 100,332.
Colorado voting basics
In Colorado, all active registered voters are mailed their ballots beginning 22 days before Election Day. Voters who haven’t received a ballot, or are eligible to vote but not yet registered, it’s not too late.
Election Day is Nov. 4. Eligible Coloradans can register to vote or update their registration at GoVoteColorado.com. Today is the last day to register to vote and still receive a ballot in the mail. After today, eligible voters can still register and vote in person at a polling location until 7 p.m. on Election Day.
State and local elections administrators say the best way to return a ballot is by dropping it off, either in a secure drop box or at an in-person polling location. Voters who have already received a ballot can also return it through the mail, but today is the last day it’s recommended to do so to ensure enough time for delivery. A completed ballot must be received by the local county clerk by 7 p.m. on Election Day to be counted.
Information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites. Voters can sign up for the state’s BallotTrax system, which tracks the status of ballots and notifies voters when their ballot is received and counted.
On average, about 1% to 2% of mail ballots in each election in Colorado are rejected because of a signature discrepancy or other issue. Voters whose ballots are rejected should receive a BallotTrax notification or a letter from their county elections office, which will include the steps they need to take to “cure” the problem and ensure their ballot is counted.

She eventually requested an on-site sign language interpreter, knowing it was one of her protected rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
“I was very demanding, because it was my son’s life on the line and I wanted to know what was going on,” Derrick recalled in an interview through an ASL interpreter.
The hospital provided an interpreter, and her son ended up being OK. But Derrick worries other deaf people in similar circumstances could have different results, especially in a state like North Dakota that lacks interpreters.
North Dakota has 15 nationally certified American Sign Language interpreters for the whole state, with none living west of U.S. Highway 83, according to a national registry.
Rep. Kathy Frelich, R-Devils Lake, highlighted the shortage during a recent legislative committee meeting. 
“I’m not sure what the answer is there, but I do need to let you know that is a problem for us,” said Frelich, who works as an adult outreach specialist from the North Dakota School for the Deaf. 
Lawmakers are studying barriers to effective communication for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.

Derrick, the communication and advocacy coordinator for the North Dakota School for the Deaf/Resource Center for Deaf and Hard of Hearing, said she’d like to see each major city in North Dakota have at least four or five certified interpreters, giving deaf people more options during an emergency.
“It would just be easier to call interpreters, and they would be more local,” Derrick said. 
Two interpreters in the Bismarck area, Lindsey Solberg Herbel and Renae Bitner, are in high demand. They both work full time providing sign language in schools while also interpreting for medical appointments, legal hearings, industry conferences and special events like weddings or funerals. 
Solberg Herbel interpreted for then-Gov. Doug Burgum during COVID-19 pandemic press conferences and traveled to Watford City, Dickinson and other communities for meetings and official functions.
Interpreters can spend a significant amount of time traveling to appointments, Bitner said. For example, both Bitner and Solberg Herbel have traveled to interpret the Medora Musical.
“No day is the same,” Bitner said. “We try to piecemeal it together as best as we can. We try to schedule appointments after school, during days when the teachers have in-service.”
There are only eight licensed interpreters who can work in North Dakota courtrooms, according to the School for the Deaf. Interpreting in courtrooms and in a medical setting requires specialized training, said Donna Sorensen, superintendent for the School for the Deaf.
Judges often recognize how busy a sign language interpreter’s calendar is, and they will schedule around the interpreter’s availability to ensure the deaf person can have accurate communication with the court, Solberg Herbel said.
Limits of technology
During the recent legislative hearing, Sen. Michelle Powers, R-Fargo, said she noticed there are examples of artificial intelligence doing sign language interpreting that could potentially fill gaps for on-site interpreters.
Frelich said she worries about whether AI can accurately interpret someone who needs to sign back through the device’s camera. Frelich said police officers have been trained to use talk-to-text applications and other written communication to relay messages with deaf people they encounter while out on patrol.
Sorensen said video American Sign Language services are consistently improving their quality and accuracy, but context and body language can be difficult to convey through a screen. 
“And then you have technology that doesn’t work,” Sorensen said. “It pixelates. It gets blurry. It freezes, and you don’t want that when you are at a medical appointment possibly talking about life and death information.”
Derrick said deaf people also worry that emotions will not come through accurately with video interpreting and other types of assistive communication.

In 1990, President George Bush signed the American with Disabilities Act, which requires state and local governments, as well as businesses and other nonprofit organizations that serve the public, to communicate effectively with people who have communication disabilities.
According to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, communicating effectively can have different interpretations in different settings. For example, a deaf person attending a city council meeting could require an ASL interpreter or real-time captioning if they don’t use sign language. The department also said an ASL interpreter would “generally be needed” during complex medical emergencies and appointments. However, in a retail situation or other short interactions, the department said writing notes back and forth could be appropriate.
ND lacks sign language training
The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf provides the national American Sign Language certification, but it requires applicants to have a bachelor’s degree. 
There are no four-year bachelor’s degree programs that offer a major for American Sign Language in North Dakota.
Minot State University and Lake Region State College in Devils Lake formed a partnership about 15 years ago to offer a four-year degree in interpreting, said Holly Pedersen, the ASL and interpreting program director at Minot State. 
Students would learn sign language in their first two years at Lake Region and complete upper level undergraduate courses at Minot State. But it didn’t make sense for them to pause their practical-use training and then attempt to take the certification test, Pedersen said.
“Leadership at both institutions decided it wasn’t financially sustainable,” said Pedersen, also an associate professor of special education. 
Lake Region State College turned its two-year American Sign Language interpreting program into a one-year certificate in 2020 due to declining enrollment, said Lloyd Halvorson, vice president of academic and student affairs.
Halvorson said college officials have started having discussions about expanding the American Sign Language program because they see a need for it. The college may focus on providing dual-credit opportunities to local high school students in an effort to build a pipeline that could feed into a new two-year program.
“If you don’t have an introduction to that career in high school, students aren’t thinking about that career,” he said.
Lake Region also has partnership agreements for American Sign Language courses at Valley City State University and the University of North Dakota through virtual and hybrid options.
Minot State University offers courses in American Sign Language and interpreting, but only as standalone certificates or part of a minor degree program, Pedersen said. 
She said deafness is considered a “low-incidence disability” compared to other learning, speech and language and intellectual disabilities that make up the majority of special education programs in schools. In 2021, the National Deaf Center estimated about 3.6% of people in the United States considered themselves deaf or hard of hearing.
“Even though it is still really important and in need of service, it’s a small number,” Pedersen said. 
The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf also allows applicants to avoid the bachelor’s degree requirement by submitting an application outlining their college courses, interpreting experience and professional development, but that experience must equal 120 credit hours, said Catie Colamonico, certification manager for the registry.
Colamonico, in an interview through an interpreter, said most people who apply to take the national certification test have a bachelor’s degree and have gone through an ASL program. She added the alternate path to certification without a degree is typically for people with less than a four-year degree, but have been working in the field as an ASL paraprofessional, or volunteer interpreter. They then use that experience to gain credit hours on their application.

Sorensen said another way to address the interpreter shortage is to have more people in different career fields learn and use sign language.
“You may not want to be an interpreter. Maybe you want to be a nurse, but you can be a nurse that knows sign language,” she said.
Meanwhile, state lawmakers studying the barriers to effective communication with North Dakotans who are deaf will make recommendations to Legislative Management before the 2027 legislative session.
“I have mad respect for interpreters and all the work that they do,” Derrick said. “I know deaf people that cherish our interpreters and value them, because without them, there would just be a lack of communication.”

People are trying to link trails from Omaha and Lincoln through Cass County. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Facing a stalemate with Cass County in developing a recreation trail across that eastern Nebraska county, a local natural resources district is taking a new tack.
At a recent meeting, the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District voted to develop a 2.25-mile segment of trail it already owns in Cass County and to pursue trails that connect two state parks and could eventually link up with a hiking-biking bridge that spans the Platte River near Cedar Creek.
The development comes after the Cass County Board did an about face in May, deciding against approving a route across the county for a trail to connect recreation trails from Lincoln and Omaha. Such a route had been approved by the County Board last year before an election changed the board’s makeup.

Connecting the state’s two largest cities with a trail for bicyclists and hikers has been a long-time goal. But it now appears that such a connector trail is on the back burner due to disagreements about the best route.
“Obviously, the way the preferred corridor ended up in Cass County, we had to make a decision to go a different route and examine other alternatives,” said David Potter, the general manager of the NRD.
Currently, the MoPac East Trail from Lincoln ends at the unincorporated village of Wabash — about 8 miles south of the Lied Bridge. But the NRD owns another 2.25 miles of abandoned railroad bed that runs east from Wabash.
At the NRD’s Oct. 15 meeting, board members voted to pursue development of that additional 2.25 mile stretch.
“This provides additional recreational opportunities for our constituents and still leaves options for the trail to proceed north (to the Lied Bridge) once a possible route is determined,” said the NRD’s minutes from the meeting.
Potter said it also was important to make progress on the trail connection, given current state budget shortfalls. The trail connector project, which got an $8.3 million earmark from the Nebraska Legislature in 2022, has already been cut back to about $5 million as the state seeks excess funds to close a budget gap.
The NRD Board voted to seek bids to remove trees on the extension of the Mo-Pac East Trail and have its consultant work on engineering it. When asked if talks about a route for the connector trail had broken down with Cass County, Potter responded, “Good question.”
He said he has a good relationship with the Cass County Board and that perhaps, in the future, a connector trail could be developed. The chairman of the Cass County Board, Alex DeGarmo, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on Friday afternoon.
Also at the NRD’s October meeting, the board approved a memorandum of understanding with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission to explore development of a recreation trail to link Platte River State Park with the Louisville State Recreation Area. Currently, there is no bike trail that links the two parks, which border the Platte River.
Such a trail could eventually link up with the Lied Bridge, Potter said.
Last year, the Cass County Board voted to approve a route for the connector trail along 334th Street, a little-traveled, north-south gravel road. But in May, the board — with two new members elected in November — voted 4-1 against approving the route, and to enter talks with the NRD about a different route.
While NRD officials said the initial route chosen by Cass County was the least-expensive and impacted the fewest residents, Cass County Board members expressed concerns that the route bypassed local towns and the popular Round The Bend Steakhouse.
One projection estimated that a completed, connector trail across Cass County would generate $2.5 million in economic activity. Already, there’s a popular “nacho ride” from Lincoln to Eagle on the Mo-Pac East Trail, and a “pie ride” to Elmwood is used as a town fundraiser.

Then everything went dark. When he came to, he tried to turn over.

He started crying, and a nurse came over to reassure him: He had died on the operating table before doctors revived him. He was lucky to be alive. But they had to amputate his arm to stop the spread of sepsis.
The infection stemmed from a broken bone after Boose, then 38, fell off his bunk at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility onto his arm. Left untreated for a week, the sepsis spread.
A one-year sentence for a Drug Court infraction became a lifetime sentence as an amputee, the Newton County man alleges in a lawsuit filed in federal court for the Southern District of Mississippi.
The lawsuit targets VitalCore Health Strategies, a private company contracted to provide health care in Mississippi’s prisons. Systemic neglect gave way to “cruel and unusual punishment” prohibited by the Constitution, the lawsuit contends.

VitalCore did not respond to requests for comment about the lawsuit or the episode that led to Boose losing an arm.    
Boose, now 40, filed his lawsuit in June and reached out to Mississippi Today after it began publishing its Behind Bars, Beyond Care series documenting alleged denial of health care in Mississippi prisons. He and his attorneys say his story is a case study of how routine injuries in prison escalate into permanent harm.
Additionally, his lawyers’ arguments aim to test a constitutional boundary: At what point under the Eighth Amendment does the delay of medical care in prison amount to cruel and unusual punishment?
‘They took my arm off’
In February of 2023, Boose, a Mississippi State University graduate and former Wells Fargo employee, was arrested for violating the terms of a Drug Court program. He was sentenced in Newton County Circuit Court to complete alcohol and drug treatment in prison, a sentence designed to be a one-year rehabilitative term, his attorney said.

He entered the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility, a sprawling prison on 171 acres in Rankin County. The prison has 18 housing units, and with a capacity of about 4,000, it holds the largest number of people of any state prison.
But when Boose arrived for his sentence, it took months before he received any of the drug treatment mandated by the judge, he said in an interview. 
In phone calls from prison, Boose alerted his mother, Cynthia Boose, to the delay. She called the prison and eventually discovered the Mississippi Department of Corrections was short on drug counselors, she said in an interview. 
“I called, and they said it was because of staffing,” Cynthia said. “OK, so my son is sitting there, waiting for a treatment or waiting for a class, and y’all can’t find nobody to do it?” 
Staffing shortages have been a persistent problem for both MDOC and VitalCore. In April, the department withheld $2 million in state money for VitalCore for having inadequate staff according to its contract, Mississippi Today reported. 
An MDOC spokesperson said the department would not comment on pending litigation and did not respond to a question about the agency’s alleged shortage of drug counselors.
After about four-and-a-half months, Boose said, he began receiving drug counseling. But his treatment was interrupted by the episode that would irrevocably change his life.

On Dec. 15, 2023, Boose took a hot shower and returned to his cot in “quickbed” — a unit where inmates sleep on bunk beds in dormitory-style housing. While climbing up to his bed, he slipped and fell onto the floor, his side bearing the brunt of the impact. The pain was immediate and radiated from his elbow to his collarbone.
He asked a guard to escort him to the prison infirmary. 
“The guard told me to go sit my ass back down,” Boose said. 
Boose said he had no recourse.
That’s a problem born from the absence of an organized process for requesting medical attention, said Rep. Becky Currie, the Republican chairwoman of the House Corrections Committee. Currie has traveled to prisons around the state and spoken with inmates about issues they’ve faced when trying to get medical care.
She said inmates were often not provided any formal process for scheduling medical appointments. Some prisons also didn’t provide access to medical professionals overnight.
At a legislative budget hearing in September, Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain said Central Mississippi Correctional Facility has sent some prison nurses directly into inmate dormitories because requests for medical visits have gone unanswered in the past.
“Inmates would say they signed up for a sick call, and nobody ever sees them,” Cain said. “But we have to track the sick call sign-up to be sure that it’s actually seen and utilized, and they actually see the doctor.”
Over the next week after his fall, Boose’s arm started to swell. He said he repeatedly asked for help, to no avail. As the swelling worsened, he periodically lost consciousness, prompting other inmates to ask guards for help on his behalf. 
The conditions inside Mississippi’s prisons have at times forced inmates to advocate for each other, according to an ex-corrections official who spoke to Mississippi Today. She once encountered inmates carrying a man whose legs appeared to be rotting across the prison, trying to find help for him. 
About seven days after his fall, Boose was taken to the infirmary, where nurses X-rayed his arm and sent him back to his cell with a sling. The swelling continued, and Boose believes he would have died had it not been for a routine sweep by an officer with a dog, searching for drugs.
The officer saw the state of Boose’s arm and urged prison officials to take him to the hospital. 
Editor’s note: The photo below, which can be seen by sliding the button, is graphic and may not be suitable for some readers. It shows the state of Christopher Boose’s arm before amputation in December of 2023.

There, doctors found “massive tissue and muscle damage from the bacterial infection” caused by the delay in treating Boose’s broken arm, his attorneys wrote in the complaint. His arm was amputated at the shoulder.
After nearly dying in emergency surgery and losing an arm, Boose called his mother and told her what happened. It was Christmas Eve. 
“I’ll never forget it. Me and my sister had just finished cooking,” she said. “He called and said, ‘Hey, Ma. Merry Christmas Eve.’ I said, ‘Oh, son, so glad to hear your voice, but I was worried. He said, ‘Well, I got one arm. They took my arm off.’”
Boose remained in the hospital for several days and was then granted early release from custody on Jan. 12, 2024.
Boose and his attorneys argue that the permanent disability he now suffers is the direct result of postponed medical care. Their lawsuit argues the postponement of such care qualifies as “cruel and unusual punishment.”
What is ‘deliberate indifference’? 
In a damning 2024 report, the U.S. Department of Justice accused Mississippi of violating the constitutional rights of those held in four prisons, including Central Mississippi Correctional Facility. 
The Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive bail, excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishment. It should be read to prohibit “prison officials from being deliberately indifferent to conditions of confinement that pose an excessive risk to inmate health or safety,” the DOJ report said.
According to the report, Cain, the state corrections commissioner, has acknowledged that Mississippi is “not where it need[s] to be in terms of running a safe prison system.”
Boose’s attorneys – Warren Martin and Robert Thompson – quoted that line in their complaint. Its legal argument is rooted in the concept of “deliberate indifference,” the legal standard needed to prove cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. 
“The delay of medical care,” the complaint said, “constituted an Eighth Amendment violation … manifesting deliberate indifference” to Boose’s medical needs.
VitalCore, the recipient of hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars through its contract with the Corrections Department, “failed to adopt a strategy to protect the safety, health and lives of inmates in MDOC custody,” the complaint said. This, the complaint argues, reflects deliberate indifference. 
In its 2024 report, the Justice Department said deliberate indifference requires the proof that prison officials were actually aware of “an excessive risk to inmate health or safety” and disregarded that risk.
If Boose’s legal argument succeeds, it would be an outlier, according to legal data
In 2024, Business Insider examined nearly 1,500 cases in federal appellate courts that involved Eighth Amendment claims. The news outlet found that only 1% of prisoner claims succeed, with almost half failing to meet the strict deliberate-indifference standard. 
Boose’s complaint seeks $5 million in damages for the Newton County man, who has since returned to live with his mother. She still helps him tie his shoes and put on a belt. He receives disability benefits in lieu of steady employment. He suffers from “phantom limb,” the sensation that an amputated limb is still attached.
The condition sometimes causes him to lose his balance and fall, transporting his mind back to the rickety bunk at CMCF from which he fell nearly two years ago. 
Unlike that December night, his mother is often nearby to help when he falls. But inside prison, “Anything could happen,” Boose said. 
“Somebody could die at any moment. It’s just like that, it’s the way it is.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/23154058/MT-Prison-Health-Story3-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2025-10-27 06:16:31.667578

Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti this week claimed victory in the case, saying the rule “force(d) radical gender ideology into every corner of American health care.” Skrmetti noted in a news release that the decision by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri not only eliminates the current protections but “makes it more difficult for future administrations to revive them.”
Skrmetti and Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch led a 15 Republican state coalition challenging the rule to protect patients from gender-identity discrimination in programs such as Medicaid, Medicare. the Affordable Care Act plans and other programs receiving federal funding.
The rule was adopted by the Obama Administration, set aside under Trump’s first administration then reinstated by President Joe Biden. It was intended to protect LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination in doctors’ offices and preserve access to gender affirming care for transgender patients based on Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex for recipients of federal dollars.
The appeals court, however, concluded that when Congress enacted Title IX in 1972, it “only contemplated biological sex.”
The decision was issued Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola, Jr., a George W. Bush-appointee.

(Getty Images) Life feels “scary” right now for a Hardin County grandmother who is raising four minor grandchildren ages 10 and younger. 
It could get even scarier soon.
The family is among the roughly 563,080 Kentuckians who may have a hard time feeding themselves in November as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will run out of funds if the government shutdown persists. Also, the state is decreasing small cash payments that go to the Hardin County grandmother and about 15,000 other extremely low-income families in November. Those payments could cease altogether in December if Congress still has not voted to fund the government. 
The Kentucky Lantern spoke to two heads of kinship care families in Kentucky who are facing belt tightening as the federal and state governments restrict safety net services. 
At their requests, the Lantern is not using their last names. Kimberly, 58, of Hardin County, fears that publicizing her family’s plight could result in losing her grandchildren to foster care. Samantha, 40, from Daviess County, is concerned about the safety of her kinship charges and that publicizing their story will make the children’s already difficult situation worse. 
Kimberly has no idea what she’s going to do with already no wiggle room in her budget, she said. 
“You budget out things to stretch, but then you run out, and then you have to use the money you put back to buy that, or somebody gets a hole in a tennis shoe, or outgrows clothes,” she told the Lantern. “You pray that you don’t get sick, or somebody doesn’t get sick, or the car doesn’t break down, because I don’t have that kind of money. If I had a flat tire today, I wouldn’t have the money to fix that tire.” 
Kimberly earns $14.50 an hour at her full-time job, income that covers her $1,400 rent, utilities and car payment, she said. According to a notice from the cabinet she received and shared with the Lantern, her monthly benefit for all four grandchildren is $426 starting Nov. 1, down from $656 from the Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program (KTAP) program. 
The government assistance Kimberly receives helps cover diapers, gas to take the children to the doctor, baby formula and food, among other basic necessities. The grandchildren currently living with her are ages 10, 8, two and eight months. 
“Every penny counts,” she said. “With everything so high, every little bit helps.”
‘Some pretty hard juggling’ 
Increased demand and limited resources led the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to cut KTAP payments to low-income families by about 35%, beginning Nov. 1. The cut is expected to especially strain Kentucky’s kinship care families, 42% of whom receive KTAP support, according to Kentucky Youth Advocates. 
KTAP, which comes from federal funds from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, benefits eligible low-income families for a maximum of 60 months, which do not have to be consecutive, over the course of a lifetime.
Gov. Andy Beshear announced on Oct. 20 that, with the federal government shut down, Kentucky does not expect to receive TANF dollars for November. The state is going to foot the costs for November, but cannot guarantee anything beyond that. 
For Kimberly, these cuts likely mean “some pretty hard juggling” and taking on more hours at work, she said. 
“The fear in the back of my mind,” she said, is: “If I was to ever get sick, what’s going to happen to these kids?” 
‘Just scraping by’ 
Sickness is an issue that family head Samantha of Owensboro, has already dealt with in her kinship care journey. She took custody of her minor cousins — sisters, ages 5 and 7 at the time — while still in her 20s. She later fought and won custody while the sisters’ parents dealt with addiction and incarceration issues, determined to keep her little cousins out of the foster care system. 
Samantha, now 40, was diagnosed with Stage 2 cervical cancer in 2018. She had to undergo a hysterectomy in Nashville and then had daily radiation treatments. 
Her chemotherapy treatment, cisplatin, left her too sick  to care for her children. She sent her biological daughter to Ohio to stay with family and asked the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to set her cousins up with temporary foster care during her treatment. It didn’t go well. The respective six and 14-month stints the girls spent in foster care left them feeling unsupported both mentally and physically, Samantha said. Both eventually came back home before she recovered. 
Samantha still cares for the younger cousin, who is 16, and her biological daughter. Her older cousin is 19 and no longer at home. 
Since her bout with cancer, Samantha developed lymphedema, which hinders her ability to move and, thus, to work. She babysits part time and survives mostly on her Social Security Disability Insurance. She also receives Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and KTAP, a benefit that she expects to drop to $244 in November. 
Her KTAP helps cover groceries and other small bills, she said. 
“It’s paycheck to paycheck, just scraping by,” she said. 
Her plan now is to lean heavily on local food banks for pantry staples and to try and cook more rice and bean meals in the future. 
“I’m living off the government, but that’s not a choice that I wanted to make,” Samantha said. “That wasn’t my choice. I didn’t ask to get cancer. I didn’t ask for my cousins to abandon their children. I didn’t ask for that. This is just what I was given, and I’m making the best out of what I was given.” 
Samantha worries about further cuts to social services, like SNAP. She also lives in a Section 8 apartment. SNAP cuts at the federal level are expected to strain Kentucky’s population in need of food assistance. 
“Once they have cut the food stamps,” Samantha said, “is my housing next?” 
Still, she’s resilient. She thinks about families who have babies in need of formula and who are worse off than herself, she said. 
“I have woke up on days and faced worse battles than this,” she said. “And I’ll figure out a way to keep going.” 
‘Every penny counts.’ 
Since 1999, Kimberly has helped raise 14 of her grandchildren who couldn’t be raised by their parents because of addiction and neglect issues. Those children are among the roughly 55,000 Kentucky youth being raised with a relative, according to a report from Kentucky Youth Advocates. 
Her grandchildren have Medicaid health care coverage and her family also gets SNAP food benefits. Even with her work and KTAP, Kimberly said without SNAP “we wouldn’t have hardly anything.”
Already, there’s “nothing left at the end of the month,” Kimberly said. She expressed feeling “blessed” to have her benefits, but is worried about other programs like SNAP and Medicaid getting scaled back as well. 
She’s too young to retire right now, at 58, but isn’t sure she’ll be able to in the next 10-15 years, either. 
Her grandchildren don’t know that belt-tightening is coming, she said. She’s focused on keeping a “stable environment” for them, physically and emotionally because “they’ve been through too much already.” 
“I love my grandkids. I’d do anything in the world for them — and I have,” she said. She’ll do everything in her power to keep them out of the foster care system, she said. “We’re trying to keep these kids with a family member and not with a stranger.” 
Research shows that is important — being with a relative, when possible, is better for children’s wellbeing than being placed with a stranger.  
“This is not political for me,” Kimberly said. “If I’m not there, helping my grandkids, then what’s going to happen to them?”

(Stock photo by Getty Images)Amid the ongoing budget impasse, Democratic state House lawmakers have offered a compromise to Republicans who see public cyber charter schools as a lifeline for parents whose children aren’t thriving in traditional schools.
The commonwealth’s 14 taxpayer-funded cyber charters have been the subject of scrutiny for soaring bank balances and questionable spending under a funding system that hasn’t been updated since online charters were first allowed a quarter century ago.
A bill passed earlier this month in the House and awaiting consideration in the Senate includes a new method to calculate how much school districts must pay for each student who attends a cyber charter. According to the House Democratic Caucus, it would save an estimated $173 million for the commonwealth’s 500 public school districts.
Susan Spicka, director of the public school advocacy group Education Voters PA, said this  would be a significant development, even though the cost reduction is a fraction of what a single statewide tuition rate would achieve. 
“Is it everything we need? Absolutely not. But is it a step in the right direction? Yes,” Spicka said. “This is very much an outlier in Pennsylvania to say we are taking a serious look at these cyber charters and taking a substantial step to make the system of funding them a little more rational.”
Tim Eller, chief branding and government relations officer for the state’s largest cyber charter school Commonwealth Charter Academy, said the reduction would be equivalent to a 21% reduction in the school’s $500 million budget. The impact would be significant, he said.
“Would it completely change us? I don’t think it would, completely,” Eller said, adding that CCA, which enrolls about 34,000 students, could weather the change better than smaller cyber schools. “You don’t lose $100 million and continue operations as they were.”
House Education Committee Chairperson Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh) said the major concern with cyber charter schools is the tuition bears little relationship to the actual cost of running an online school.
“There are things that school districts pay for that cyber schools get reimbursed for that no one can explain why,” Schweyer said, noting costs such as property maintenance and sports programs aren’t present in online charters.

Senate Education Committee Chairperson Lynda Schlegel Culver (R-Northumberland) was not available for an interview this week. A spokesperson for Culver said the proposal was not agreed to and that Culver supports fully funding all public school options for parents to choose the best education for their children.
Under the commonwealth’s charter school law, public school districts must pay the same for each student attending a charter school as it pays for students within its own buildings.
Because every district in Pennsylvania establishes its own budget and per-pupil spending rate, a single charter school can receive a broad range of tuition payments from each one where it draws students.
The amounts ranged from $6,975 to $25,150 for regular education students and $18,329 to $60,166 for special education students.
Among Gov. Josh Shapiro’s education priorities when he introduced his $51.6 billion budget plan in February was establishing a flat statewide tuition for cyber charter schools. His office estimated it would save school districts $600 million that could be used for programs in traditional schools.
That plan was also part of Shapiro’s 2024-2025 spending proposal, but since then, Republican state Auditor General Timothy DeFoor released the result of a three-year audit of five cyber charters’ finances. It showed budget reserves that grew by 144% and “uncommon” spending practices, such as paying bonuses to teachers and the acquisition of 21 physical properties by CCA.
Republicans, whose approval in the Senate is needed to pass a budget, have staunchly opposed Shapiro’s flat tuition proposal, saying it would harm cyber charters and reduce choices for parents in where to send their children for a public education.
“If we can’t get consensus on a flat rate, can we at the very least agree we shouldn’t be spending money on things that cyber schools don’t need?” Schweyer said, adding that cyber charter students have the right to participate in extracurricular activities in the districts where they live.
When the House passed its latest budget plan earlier this month, it also approved Senate Bill 315. The legislation, introduced by Culver as a bill to make funding for Career and Technical Education more predictable, was amended in the House to include new categories of expenses that school districts could deduct from cyber charter tuition. 
“We don’t reimburse cyber schools for any sort of bus transportation,” Schweyer said. “We are creating new deductions based on the things that the cyber schools don’t provide.”
Those would include tuition for non-special education students, the cost of tax assessment and collection services, 60% of student activity costs and 60% of building operations and maintenance costs.

Dylan Wyatt, director of advocacy for the Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officials, said the additional deductions are a good first step.
“I think a lot of districts had the hope that some kind of flat cap rate would be passed, understanding that would be a tall order for our legislature,” he said.
If the deductions are passed, they would replace the $100 million reimbursement for charter school tuition that was included in the last budget. Because the amount that each district received was based on the number of charter school students, some would receive more relief if the reimbursement remained in place. 
But, Wyatt added, if the rest of Shapiro’s education proposal becomes part of the final budget, the majority of districts would end up in a better financial situation with the deductions.
Shapiro’s proposal includes $526 million for Ready to Learn block grants which are used to distribute funding for the state’s most underfunded school districts. The so-called adequacy funding was included in the last budget to address 2023 a court ruling that found the state’s reliance on property taxes to fund education was unconstitutional.
It also called for a $75 million increase in basic education funding and a $40 million increase in special education funding. Both budget bills passed in the Democratic-led House included all three increases, while the Senate’s proposals would flat-fund education.
“If we see, in addition to the cyber charter deductions … what the governor proposed, the majority of school districts would be in a better position,” Wyatt said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/school_stock-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 05:57:23.278423

(Stock image)With the federal shutdown in its fourth week, spurred by a stalemate over the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans on Affordable Care Act plans, a new report shows that over 154 million people with coverage through an employer also face steep price hikes — and that the situation is likely to get worse.
Premiums for job-based health insurance rose 6% in 2025 to an average of $26,993 a year for family coverage, according to an annual survey of employers released Oct. 22 by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
It’s the first time in two decades that the cost of covering a family of four has risen by 6% or more for three consecutive years, data from KFF shows.
Over the last five years, the average premium for family coverage has increased by 26%, compared with a 29% increase in workers’ wages and nearly 24% growth in inflation. The average cost for family coverage is now about the same as a new Toyota Corolla hybrid.
The average annual premium for an individual health plan provided by employers increased by 5% to $9,325 — nearly $3,000 higher than in 2016, according to the survey.
“It’s a concern as health costs just keep going up,” said Eric Trump, controller at Steve Reiff Inc., a small company in South Whitley, Indiana, that specializes in sandblasting and painting heavy equipment.
Trump, who is not related to President Donald Trump, said his company’s health insurance costs rose 8% for the 2026 fiscal year — roughly the same as they have in the last few years.
Workers at Reiff pay about half the cost of their health coverage. About half of its 20 current employees decline the insurance because they get coverage through a family member or choose to go uninsured, he said. “There’s not a lot we can do as we don’t have enough employees to spread out the costs.”
Most people with job-based insurance contribute to the cost of their premiums, with the average worker this year contributing $1,440 for individual coverage or $6,850 for family coverage.
Over time, more workers have paid increasingly higher deductibles, the amount they must spend out-of-pocket on medical services before their insurer pitches in. More than one‑third of covered workers are enrolled in a plan with a deductible of $2,000 or more for an individual. The share of workers with such a plan has increased 32% over the last five years and 77% over the last 10 years, the report said.
Rising drug and hospital costs are often cited as major culprits for rising health insurance costs, and neither shows signs of ebbing.
“Early reports suggest that cost trends will be higher for 2026, potentially leading to higher premium increases unless employers and plans find ways to offset higher costs through changes to benefits, cost sharing, or plan design,” the KFF survey said.

One big concern among employers is the high price of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, which a growing number of companies cover. Their high prices, combined with strong demand, have led some workplaces to tighten or eliminate coverage for weight loss.
“Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” study author Gary Claxton, a KFF senior vice president, said in a press release. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”
Employers typically respond to higher health costs by shifting costs to their workers, but it’s unclear how much more financial pain workers can take. The survey found nearly half of large employers said their employees have “moderate” or “high” concerns about their level of cost sharing.
While the rising cost of employer-sponsored insurance has outpaced general inflation, the issue received scant attention in recent months on Capitol Hill. To help pay for extending tax cuts, Trump’s tax and spending law reduces by billions of dollars the amount the government spends on Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for 70 million low-income and disabled people. Congressional budget scorekeepers predict the cuts to Medicaid will lead to millions more people becoming uninsured over the next decade.
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 as Democrats refuse to vote for a new spending measure unless Republicans agree to extend tax credits that help about 22 million people buy health coverage through the ACA marketplaces. Without congressional action, the tax credits will expire, and premiums will double for many consumers, starting in January.
The KFF report is based on a survey this year of 1,862 randomly selected nonfederal public and private employers with 10 or more workers.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Things look dire upon an initial glance at the Rhode Island Office of Veterans Services’ fiscal year 2027 budget request.
The office suggests that to meet what the state calls a “constrained” budget scenario — a 7.5% spending cut across state agencies — it would need to cut 32 contracted jobs. That, in turn, would eliminate 32 beds at the Rhode Island Veterans Home in Bristol, and lead to an even longer waiting list for veterans who often wait 16 to 18 months for admission.
But state budget documents are not the most intuitive reading material, and Veterans Services offered more than one possibility for the upcoming fiscal year. The state’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires all state agencies to offer two funding scenarios in their annual requests for state money: One is the amount needed to sustain current operations, and the other is the stricter 7.5% cut. 
The state budget office discouraged agencies from sending in “unconstrained” proposals — essentially an agency wishlist — or “expansionary proposals,” in the words of spokesperson Derek Gomes, because of the projected deficit heading into fiscal 2027. 
Current projections for fiscal year 2027, which begins on July 1, 2026, forecast a $304.3 million deficit. 
That deficit is “within reason for the last few years,” Gomes said. Still, it’s nearly $42 million higher than the deficit for the current fiscal year and more than double the deficit for fiscal year 2025.
‘Off the table’
“The governor’s not going to shut down another wing; that’s off the table,” Laura Hart, a spokesperson for the governor, told Rhode Island Current in a recent phone call. “It’s a no-go.” 
The 208-bed facility housed 141 residents — mostly men over the age of 75 who served in Vietnam, Korea and World War II — at the time of the Oct. 1 budget request by the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, the parent agency of the veterans office. 
Parker Gavigan, spokesperson for the veterans services office, said the immediate goal is to increase the number of residents at the home to its 160 maximum within several weeks, “while ensuring every veteran receives the highest standard of care.”
As of Friday, Oct. 24, Gavigan said the home had 144 residents in beds that include skilled nursing care. Another three residents live in the home’s domicile unit, more comparable to assisted living. Ten veterans are expected to be admitted around Nov. 1, Gavigan said.
There were 211 veterans on the home’s waiting list, when the budget request was submitted on Oct. 1. As of Friday, Oct. 24, it had increased to 214.
“From that list, three are cleared and ready for admission,” Gavigan said. 
The governor must submit a balanced budget to the General Assembly in January, where it will then spend the subsequent months getting hammered into its final shape by legislators by the end of June, right before the new fiscal year begins on July 1.

“Ultimately, not all of those recommendations or proposals will be accepted by the governor’s office,” Gomes said. “So that’s kind of where the discretion is.”
For instance, this is the second consecutive year the Veterans Services office proposed closing a neighborhood at the veterans home to meet the constrained budget framework. The office’s fiscal 2026 request, filed in fall 2024, is recapped in the enacted budget summary by the House Fiscal Advisory Staff.
This option would have “shut down the home’s Alpha-1 neighborhood” and the Veterans Services office “would have to cease admissions, wait for ten current residents to expire, and move five people to open rooms in the Bravo and Charlie neighborhoods.”
Neither McKee nor the General Assembly humored that suggestion. Neither party endorsed Veterans’ Services’ other ask last year either, for four new positions — three “cemetery specialists” and one customer service role —  at the Rhode Island Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Exeter. The office anticipated more burials under the federal Burial Equity for Guards and Reserves Act. 
The veterans services office ultimately received $3 million more in the current fiscal year than it asked for, with its funding at just under $53 million in the enacted budget. 
What would happen if …
When budget request season arrives each fall, state agencies still have to hypothesize what would happen if they performed under their current benchmark.  
“For some smaller agencies, where most of, if not the vast majority of, their costs are tied to personnel, it’s harder to achieve a 7.5% reduction,” Gomes, said. “But to comply with the spirit of the request, the agencies comply.”
Some do not comply. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha refused to submit a constrained proposal this year, noting that the only way to achieve the mandated 7.5% spending cut would eliminate positions “critical to the mission of the Office.”
“Such cuts would severely undermine public safety, and significantly hamper our ability to defend the State and fight on behalf of Rhode Islanders,” Neronha wrote in his Oct. 1 budget submission. “Accordingly, I cannot responsibly put forth such a budget proposal.”
The veterans services office, in complying with the request, noted its worst case scenario — the closure of 32 beds — would generate an estimated $1.65 million of savings in general revenue savings and a total of $2.73 million in savings across all funding sources. 
These savings “would come at a significant operational and human cost,” Veterans Services Director Kasim J. Yarn wrote in his cover letter to his office’s fiscal year 2027 budget request.
“Implementing this cut would close an entire 32-bed neighborhood, directly reducing the Home’s capacity to serve aging veterans,” Yarn wrote in his Oct. 1 letter. “This would lead to a decrease in resident population, a loss of per diem and maintenance fee revenue, and a diminished ability to admit new veterans — ultimately undermining our mission to provide timely, high-quality care to those who served.”
The agency recommendation at the top of the proposal states outright that this is not the path the office wants to pursue: “If asked to make budgetary cuts, there will be severe consequences to vital services at our Veterans Home — a scenario we hope to avoid,” the document reads. 
There were 211 veterans on the home’s waiting list, when the budget request was submitted on Oct. 1. Cutting the 32 positions — all directly involved in patient care — would close an unidentified 32-bed wing at the home. That in turn would “dramatically increase the waiting list timeframe” and “the admittance of new residents will cease for months,” according to the budget document.    
The constrained proposal would allow for replacement hires of current full-timers should they leave but would otherwise freeze hiring for 23 full-time certified nursing assistant positions.

Yarn noted in his cover letter that the Veterans Home already has a shortage of certified nursing assistants and, in a more ideal spending environment, the office recommends that the state raise their pay. 
In its wishlist — or unconstrained — budget request, Yarn’s office asked for $51.2 million. That includes raising certified nursing assistant pay scales at a projected cost of $425,951. Doing so, Yarn said, would help the veterans home move away from contracted agency labor, which now accounts about 50% of its patient care workforce, and would produce savings in subsequent years. The extra money would also buy “an advanced fall detection system” to mitigate resident falls at the home — a major issue, Yarn wrote, with about 32 occurring every month.
Even if the wing closure will likely not happen, other constrained proposals may succeed. Yarn’s office also floated the idea of ending Saturday burials at Exeter’s Rhode Island Veterans Memorial Cemetery, estimated to save about $30,000 in overtime costs. Rhode Island and Connecticut are the only New England states which offer Saturday burials. In the past few years, the budget document notes, Rhode Island has averaged about $35,000 annually in overtime costs related to Saturday burials. 
Another possibility is charging a “modest” burial fee of $978 per plot for veterans’ eligible spouses and dependents to be buried at the Veterans Cemetery. Twenty-six of the 41 U.S. states with veterans cemeteries charge interment fees for non-veteran family members, the office said, but Rhode Island does not. This change could yield an estimated $503,670 in annual revenue, based on the 515 veterans’ family members, including spouses and dependents, who were interred at the cemetery on average per year over the last six years.
The governor’s office will review the proposals over the ensuing months, and McKee will submit his initial draft of the budget to the General Assembly in January. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson offered a joint statement last week on the veterans’ office’s budget request for fiscal year 2027.
“Our respective Finance committees will carefully review all agency budget requests next session, including any proposals the Governor recommends in his budget,” Shekarchi and Lawson wrote. “Veterans’ services remain a priority for the General Assembly, and we will continue working to balance limited taxpayer resources with many areas of need.”

(Photo by Anne Vilen / The Daily Yonder)I drove more than 7,000 miles this summer, from North Carolina to Montana and back, through vast swathes of rural America, tent camping most nights in state or national parks.
This is what I learned: Americans from every zipcode, walk of life, and political persuasion love their public lands.
We don’t want to sell them, develop them, or monetize them. In fact, spending time in these co-owned spaces—literally, our common ground—is a great way to build a shared understanding of America’s diversity, strength, and resilience.
Early in my journey, I spent two nights at Cuivre River State Park, a wild tract of woods and water outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It was hot as a frog in a frying pan that afternoon, but the four twenty-somethings who pulled into the campsite next to mine were undeterred. They leapt out of their old Camry, lit up some weed, swore loudly and casually at their janky tent, and started scouring the campground for firewood.
So much for tranquility, I thought.
Then I remembered how my Dad always reached out to make good neighbors across rising fences — even in a campground. I walked over and offered the boys all of my remaining firewood.
Surprised by the gesture of goodwill from a solo woman easily the age of their grandmothers, they ma’amed me multiple times, explained that they were celebrating someone’s 21st birthday, and apologized for being rowdy. We parted as the katydids started sawing loudly in the dark trees overhead. The next morning, as I poured my first cup of coffee, one of the boys came over and gave me a box of energy bars. “We gotta head into work,” he said. “But thanks for the wood.” It was a peaceful outing after all – for all of us.
A thousand miles and five states later, I ventured into Sentinel Meadows, on the edge of Yellowstone National Park’s famous geyser basin. Alone, I followed the winding trail beside a rippling creek and then through oatgrass and sedges into a broad expanse of field powdered with the white silica-rich deposits of active steam vents. Far away, near what looked like smoke circles rising from the earth, I was surprised and curious to see an army of little green men!
When I got closer, I learned that the people in neon vests were a group of biochemists from Arizona State University, permitted by the National Park Service to study what lives in the soils around geyser basins. “Why should we care about that?” I asked one young graduate student.
“We want to understand the relationships between the organisms and the water in what seems like an inhospitable ecosystem. Some bacteria thrive in hot water, others live without light. That can help us understand the conditions where life is possible even on other worlds.”
A trail’s turn after I left the scientists, a shaggy coyote burst out of the pines about 30 yards in front of me. We both lurched backward, jaws dropping. For a split second, before she bolted back into the trees, we stared at each other. And in the golden marbles of her eyes, I imagined another world–not human, but sentient and thriving.
At Devil’s Tower National Monument in Wyoming, I had a different multicultural experience. I arrived nearly at daybreak and circumnavigated the tower on foot before other visitors arrived. Serenaded by bird song and the hush of wind through junipers, I photographed the stone edifice behind fluttering prayer flags, honoring an ancient sacred place.

Back at the visitor’s center by mid-morning, hundreds of motorcycles were roaring into the parking lot, en route to the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. Bearded, leathered, and lathered with sweat, they too were enjoying their public lands. To ensure that the bikers, as well as families, a bus load of French tourists, park staff, and other visitors stayed safe, a gang of Christian Cyclists was directing traffic.  “This is our public service,” one burly tattooed woman told me. “Have a blessed day.”
Road weary in week four of my journey, I pulled into a public rest area outside of Chamberlain, South Dakota, where I was greeted by yet another sacred symbol on public lands. The Dignity of Earth and Sky Statue is a 50-foot-tall, stainless steel rendering of a Lakota woman wrapped in a traditional star quilt. The artist, Dale Cloude Lamphere, I read on the inscription, sculpted this tribute to native women in the hope that “Dignity will . . . encourage all of us to embrace our similarities and celebrate our differences.”
Just down the road, in a public park beside the Missouri River, I saw that hope in action.  I shared a walking path with Donna Kocer, a Chamberlain retiree, who volunteers her mornings to pick up trash from the riverbank and beautify the park.  “Aren’t there park staff whose job that is?” I asked her.  “Maybe,” she said. “But it’s a public park, and I’m the public. I feel responsible for keeping it clean because it’s mine.”
We walked a while together, gabbing about how there’s a lovely surprise around every turn in South Dakota, a state most people prefer to fly over. And then we stopped to watch a group of Amish women in gingham bonnets, long skirts, and sneakers playing volleyball next to the pavilion, with the wide Missouri rolling along behind them.
After Minneapolis, Madison, and Chicago, I took a wrong turn and impulsively followed a sign to Indiana Dunes National Park–a tiny, vestigial spit of sand and marsh clinging to the edge of Lake Michigan between Gary and Michigan City. I walked out to the shore where a Spanish-speaking family was enjoying a picnic of empanadas and rootbeer on the sand. A few miles down the beach to my left, the massive smoke stacks of U.S. Steel’s midwestern plant belched gray clouds. To my right, the cooling tower of the city power plant rose behind hundreds of rail containers. Just two percent of Indiana lands are public. If it’s up to some in Congress, that fraction too will be privatized, industrialized, and monetized.
The story of public lands in America is the story of opposing appetites. One hungers for beauty, solitude, and adventure. The other craves conquest, power, and progress. Republican senators (and their constituents) objected loudly and successfully to remove a provision from the recently passed Big Beautiful Bill that would have mandated the sale of federal lands.
However, Trump’s Justice Department, going against previous legal determinations,  believes the president has the right to abolish national monuments (like Devil’s Tower) without congressional approval.
Another recent action eliminates the Roadless Rule, opening up millions of pristine acres where wildlife and endangered species thrive without habitat disruption from logging, mining, and other development.
And finally, a recent effort to revoke the Bureau of Land Management’s Public Lands Rule devalues the work of conservation scientists, like those I met in Sentinel Meadows, so that uses that monetize natural resources, like mining, logging, and recreation, take precedence on public lands.
In Kentucky, paddling up Clifty Creek through the Daniel Boone National Forest, I thought about what these incursions into public lands would bring. I watched a wood duck shyly hide itself against the riverbank, behind the veil of a lacy waterfall. Then, turning downriver to take in the sun-bright bluffs arching over cool green water, I spotted a fisherman in another kayak, the first human I’d seen that day.

“It’s a beautiful day out here,” I offered in greeting.
“Isn’t every day a beautiful day out here?” he responded, tipping his paddle at our surroundings.
Suddenly, we both startled as a bald eagle, a species brought back from the brink of extinction by 20th-century conservation efforts, strafed the river and soared into the tree above our heads. The fisherman and I watched in silent awe, and then I whispered the only answer that made sense. “Yes.”
The House Committee on Natural Resources recently convened at Jenny Lake, a popular lodge in Grand Tetons National Park, ostensibly to support park funding, while elsewhere, government officials are busy carving up the pie of public lands that belong to you and me.
The Persian poet Rumi wrote, “Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I’ll meet you there.” That field – dense with wildflowers and native grasses and buzzing insects, alive with birds and mice and maybe a hunting fox – is where I’d like to take our government decision makers. Up the trail into the mountains, alongside ordinary Americans who’ve come to hike or investigate or pray or celebrate a birthday or fish or just ride their motorcycles through our extraordinary public lands, they too might be inspired to be curious about “the other” people and creatures that inhabit our wild spaces.
And that curiosity is the seed from which understanding and unity grow.

(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)When he ran for reelection during the 2023-24 election cycle, Kentucky Republican Brett Guthrie raised $851,493 during the first nine months of his campaign.
Then he ascended to the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in January 2025 — and more than tripled his fundraising.
And the amount of money he raised from political action committees — the vehicle that allows corporations and other special interests to help fund congressional campaigns — also grew, to $1.6 million between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 from $651,800 during the same period two years earlier, Federal Election Commission records show. That was more money from PACs than any other House candidate except Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
One reason he did so well: Guthrie raised money from around 100 PACs that had never written him a check before he became the committee chair this year, according to FEC and OpenSecrets data.
“It’s the obvious game of campaign contributions,” said Craig Holman, who lobbies on campaign finance issues for Public Citizen. “You make campaign contributions and expenditures to those who have direct influence over what policies you’re pursuing. That’s the influence peddling game at its rawest. This is the classic case of why campaign contributions really are legalized bribery.”
Guthrie isn’t alone. A look at congressional fundraising during the first six months of 2025 found several newly minted Senate and House chairs receiving checks from special interest PACs that had kept their checkbooks closed until the lawmakers got their hands on a gavel.
Consider:

The Walt Disney Co.’s PAC didn’t support Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in any of his previous Senate campaigns until this year, when he became chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which oversees the broadcasting industry. Disney, which donated $5,000, didn’t respond to a request for comment.
New Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) received his first-ever donation, $2,500, from the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, after landing the gavel of a panel with a health care subcommittee.
The Teamsters Union PAC made its first contribution to the campaign of Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.), in the amount of $1,000, after he became chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee, which has jurisdiction over unions. The Teamsters did not respond to a request for comment.

“They’re not making those donations out of goodwill but they’re making an investment and they expect a return on that money,” said Tiffany Muller, president of End Citizens United/Let America Vote, an advocacy group that supports stronger campaign finance laws.
“That return can be in the form of what gets investigated, what gets ignored, what legislation makes it out of committee, what hearings are held,” she said. “You see corporate donors and corporate interests driving the agenda with these committees time and time again.”

Guthrie did not respond to requests for comment.
He chairs the committee whose jurisdiction was once described this way by former Chairman John Dingell (D-Mich.): “If it moves, it’s energy; and if it doesn’t, it’s commerce.”
Mercedes-Benz gave its first-ever PAC donation to Guthrie this year, $1,000. The Energy and Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over auto safety and emissions standards.
The money was donated at an auto industry event hosted by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation’s PAC, company spokeswoman Melinda Mernovage said.
Guthrie also received $5,000 from the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns local stations throughout the country and temporarily took talk show host Jimmy Kimmel off the air of its ABC affiliates following his comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
And his campaign took in $1,500 from Oracle, the technology company.
Neither company responded to a request for comment.
Muller said PACs “make these decisions on who they support on what’s best for their business. I’m not surprised that committee chairs are reaping the biggest rewards because they have the most power.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Each month, when his Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds arrive, Daniel Garratt stocks up meats and pantry staples like canned goods in bulk at Walmart. He then visits local discount or dollar stores for nonperishable items. 
Fresh produce, however, is something that he buys sporadically throughout the month at his neighborhood grocery store, The Market At 25th. There, he benefits from the Virginia Fresh Match program, which offers discounts on produce. Garratt has even invested in a vacuum sealer to make his food last longer and reduce waste.
Despite living in a facility for senior citizens and people with disabilities, much of his Social Security income still goes toward rent. Having been disabled for more than 20 years, Garratt has learned to get creative in stretching his dollars. 
“My rent goes up every year,” he said, as his cat, Sawyer, curled up in his lap. 
He’s watching November’s planned grocery haul with concern amid Congress’ monthlong government shutdown, which means Garratt — along with roughly 850,000 other Virginians — would not receive SNAP that month. Nationwide, more than 42 million people rely on the program. 
SNAP helps low-income earners and people who can’t work afford groceries. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program, has told states to pause November payments until further notice. 
At a press conference Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, said she and her colleagues are urging the USDA to tap into its contingency funding for SNAP. However, that $6 million reserve falls short of the $8 million needed to support those who depend on the program.  
Virginia’s food banks also emphasized that they would be unable to absorb the higher demand if SNAP goes unfunded next month. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin has since declared a state of emergency, allowing him to use emergency funds to “provide food benefits.”
The Congressional stalemate has dragged on since early October, as federal lawmakers failed to agree on annual appropriations bills. Multiple attempts from members of both parties to pass a continuing resolution have collapsed. 
Democrats have sought to extend federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act during negotiations, while Republicans — who control both chambers of Congress — have blamed Democrats for the shutdown. The U.S. Senate has continued to meet, but the U.S. House of Representatives has not convened in weeks. 
“Congressional Democrats want to fund the government, and we have repeatedly asked Speaker Mike Johnson for over a month to gavel us back into session so that we can continue working on behalf of the American people,” McClellan said. 
Meanwhile, Youngkin said his emergency order was “only necessary because of the shamelessness of Congressional Democrats.”

The political back-and-forth has left Richmond resident Asia Broadie feeling stressed. A single mother of six, she balances a restaurant job with schooling to become a nursing assistant. 
“It’s a constant daily journey. I try to manage it all,” she said as her washing machine hummed in the background of her Northside apartment. Dishes and laundry are just part of the juggling act as Broadie keeps her schedule — and her household — running. 
While The Mercury accompanied Broadie to a store, she pointed to pantry staples — rice, noodles, canned vegetables — along with grab-and-go snacks like granola bars, yogurt and apples for her older children, who cycle in and out of the apartment. Like Garratt, she takes advantage of the Fresh Match program when buying fresh produce such as grapes and lettuce. 
Meats are a key purchase, especially when she prepares large meals so her family can eat leftovers for a few days. 
“I’m trying not to have to go to the store a lot and be cooking and making a mess everyday. I run my dishwasher twice a day sometimes. They’re growing and they’re eating — it goes quick,” she said with a smile and a sigh. 
 Other effects to SNAP on the horizon

More than the shutdown’s impact on her SNAP benefits, Broadie has watched with concern as a reconciliation bill Congress passed this summer could lead to  people receiving less food assistance or losing eligibility altogether. The bill imposes additional verification requirements for recipients.
For his part, Youngkin issued a directive aimed at reducing error rates — the measure of overpayments and underpayments of SNAP benefits. The reconciliation bill stipulates that states with higher error rates will have to pay a portion of SNAP benefits to recipients that the federal government otherwise would otherwise cover. Virginia’s 12% error rate, outlined by Youngkin in the directive, must drop to 6% in the next two years to avoid paying $270 million annually. 
The work is expected to be challenging for local governments, which administer food assistance and may need to rely on their staff to more closely scrutinize expenses and household compositions. 
While Garratt and Broadie support efforts to ensure SNAP operates effectively, they warn against changes that could weaken the program. Broadie worries that stereotypes about recipients as people who “mooch” off the government has made it an easy target for federal funding cuts. 
It’s disheartening, she said, reflecting on her own experience juggling school and work in hopes to one day no longer need SNAP. 
“Also imagine the people who literally cannot work,” she said. “This is going to be hard.”

The state education department identified the data to determine how it can improve and support Virginia’s early childhood care centers and family day homes, as families continue to seek high-quality sites. Seven out of 10 Virginia children under the age of six have working parents, according to the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE).
The state uses the Unified Virginia Quality Birth to Five system (VQB5), which is focused on improving children’s school readiness and expanding access for parents and support providers. The system is also a tool for gauging the effectiveness of Virginia’s early childhood education programs. 
Jenna Conway, chief of early learning and specialized populations at VDOE, said none of the sites identified as needing support in the 2023-2024 school year repeated the following year. However, the agency still plans to continue helping more sites meet or exceed expectations.
“We want every single actor in the system, every single person, to pay attention to what’s happening in each and every classroom,” Conway said. “That’s why we require observations in the fall and spring in every single classroom, and that’s why our data system captures data about every single classroom and then rolls that up to create the site results.”
Last Thursday at the state Board of Education work session, Conway shared some details from the agency’s second release of the VQB5 ratings of 3,923 sites and new honor rolls, which were presented by Gov. Glenn Youngkin and VDOE earlier this month.
Many sites branded as “needing support” also need improved instruction. Between the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years, the number of sites “needing support” decreased from 51 to 25. The 25 sites represent only 1% of the total number of sites, with 3,167 (96%) meeting expectations and 101 (3%) exceeding the state’s quality expectations.
Under this measurement, the state focuses on how educators interact with and support children’s learning across different age groups. Conway said this could range from language modeling for infants and toddlers to helping preschoolers ask questions and encouraging critical thinking.
The data is also raising awareness of the state’s VQB5 Quality Profiles portal, which helps families “search for and choose the public or private early childhood option that best meets their needs,” according to the agency. 
Conway said the portal has received 125,000 views as of Thursday afternoon, after collecting approximately 10,000 views in the first 24 hours.
The system was made possible by successful legislation first introduced and carried by Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, and former Democratic Sen. Janet Howell in 2020, which was amended in 2022.
The system took another step forward after the General Assembly approved funding the Youngkin administration’s $1.2 billion Building Blocks for Virginia Families initiative, which invests in early childhood slots this biennium.
The state conducted 31,258 local and external site observations during the 2024-2025 school year, supporting over 11,300 classrooms, nearly doubling the previous year.
Agency data from the 2024-2025 school year also shows that 51% of Virginia’s kindergartners are “school ready,” while the remaining 49% began the same year needing to build skills in literacy, mathematics, self-regulation and/or social skills.
In the past two administrations, Virginia has seen substantial growth in publicly funded early childhood care and education programs. Notably, state funding has increased by $390 million since 2018.
Additionally, the number of children served with public funds has nearly doubled, rising from approximately 37,000 to nearly 70,000. The growth has primarily been driven by the Child Care Subsidy Program, which provides subsidies to eligible families, and funding to private, community-based preschools. The initiatives help support children at risk of entering school without the necessary skills.
President Grace Creasey, whom Youngkin appointed, said at Wednesday’s work session she was appreciative of the early learning team and its forward-looking approach to continuous improvement in early childhood education.
She suggested the state should continue investigating salary differences among early childhood providers, focusing on instructional leadership development, exploring ways to support early identification of special education needs, and improving communication between early childhood and K-12 systems.
“I know for your team, this is truly a moment of finality to some degree,” Creasey said. “I know we’re never finished doing this kind of work to make things better, to prepare kids better to get to our K-12 systems, and I just thank all of you for your commitment to moving this continually down the field to get to that goal post that you all set for yourselves and for the commonwealth.” 
Conway said she hopes the data will help address the challenges with teacher turnover, in the short and long term.
According to the data presented, 31% of childcare teachers left day care centers between fall 2024 and spring 2025, compared to 5% of teachers who left public schools.
Conway also hopes the data will encourage families to visit the portal and help them understand why child interactions, or exchanges between a child and a teacher or caregiver, matter for healthy development.
“We hope that not only can we help more parents understand what VQB5 is and why it’s so important, but also that it helps us understand — as parents and grandparents and guardians — how we can ultimately improve our own interactions and support all kids’ learning and development,” Conway said.

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Ahead of Election Day, when Virginians will choose a new governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and House of Delegates members, a group of registrars from around Virginia recently explained how elections work, how they help keep them secure and the inspiration behind their efforts facilitating people’s ability to participate in the democratic process. 
The discussion stemmed from a partnership between the Virginia Mercury and Keep Our Republic, a civic education nonprofit.

Security is paramount, the registrars said, as they broke down how they pre-test voting equipment, create protocols for election worker conduct and access to ballots, and how  they participate in the post-election audits state law requires. 
Though registrars and other workers may appear to have heavier workloads on Election Day and the 45 days of early voting that leads up to it, registrars said the work of maintaining voter rolls is a year-round duty.
“It’s funny, people think we work once every four years for the presidential election,” said Norfolk registrar Stephanie Iles. “We are working every day. We’re not just running the elections, we are handling the voter registration and campaign finance, but we have elections every single year.”
She, along with Richmond registrar David Levine, Henrico County Registrar Mark Coakley, and Virginia Beach Registrar Christine Lewis, explained that they’ve also acted as educators when sharing their insights with state lawmakers regarding ballot box accessibility. 
Another key responsibility is catching voter fraud — something that most often is a voter’s own error, rather than malicious attempt to undermine democracy, they said. 
But the distrust in the system that some politicians and influencers have sown in recent years has made their jobs challenging at times. 
“If somebody you’ve lionized, somebody that you worship, somebody that you respect – perhaps somebody that you voted for — is pushing information that’s incorrect and doing so repeatedly, combating that is a challenge,” Levine said. 
Much of the electoral process distrust and the spread of misinformation about it escalated during and following the 2020 presidential election. That year, President Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden and insisted election fraud was to blame. Recounts in battleground states confirmed Biden’s victory that year, but his assertions culminated in a violent storming of the U.S. Capitol after he spoke at a “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6, 2021. 
Numerous lawsuits filed by Trump and allies have been dismissed and Fox News paid millions in a settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, one of several technology companies to file defamation suits. 
Levine said that he thinks it’s “fair to say” that democracy is “under threat.”
“We’re at a critical inflection point,” he said and he added that he stays in the profession so that he can tell his sons years from now how he worked to ensure that everyone’s votes were counted. 
The registrars shared the often unseen, nitty gritty details of how they run their offices — from processing applications, to administering elections, to verifying everything is secure and accurate. 

They wish more voters knew about and understood the layers of security and points of double-checking, they emphasized. In some cases, they’ve invited skeptics to be involved in the work and experience it up close.  
“We’ve taken some of the biggest naysayers, I would say, that have questioned the process or have questioned the security, and we’ve invited them to serve as officers of elections in our polling places to see what goes on behind the scenes,” Iles said. 
As a result the critics have relayed appreciation for the preemptive testing, layers of security during elections, and post-election auditing, she added. 
Additionally, Iles shared that “we always do things in pairs, so no one person is around our equipment at one time. There’s always multiple people.”
And while voter fraud is rare, the different registrars shared instances where they’ve caught it and protocols for how to address it. 
“Most of the time, our voter fraud is not intentional,” Virginia Beach Registrar Lewis said. “It’s usually someone that’s voted early or by mail the first couple weeks, and then on Election Day, they forgot they voted.”
Coakley of Henrico explained that commonly, in areas with concentrations of universities, students that were previously registered where their parents live then try to vote in the locality where they attend college. 
“A student may be registered at home 45 days before an election, and their parents say, ‘go vote,’ and then on election day, a professor will say, ‘look, there’s same-day registration in Virginia,’” Coakley said. “It’s easily caught, and there is no double voting going on with those situations.”
Iles said there was a time her office caught an intentional double-voting attempt where a resident voted locally in Norfolk and absentee in Florida. They were referred to law enforcement for investigation and prosecution. That instance was the exception rather than the rule, as Iles said her office most often catches paperwork mistakes. 
For instance, sometimes people with past felony convictions fail to indicate that status on paperwork — a misrepresentation that is then referred to local commonwealths attorney offices to investigate. In Virginia, people with past felony convictions are unable to vote unless they’ve successfully petitioned the governor to restore their rights. 
The state legislature advanced an attempt to enshrine automatic voting rights restoration into  Virginia’s constitution this year. If it passes again next year, it can appear on ballots statewide for Virginians to approve or reject. If approved, people who have completed their prison sentences would automatically be able to vote again in lieu of petitioning the governor. 
With over 750,000 votes already cast by mid-October, registrars and other election workers will continue to staff early voting locations and process mail-in ballots leading up to Election Day on Nov. 4. Despite long-simmering Republican opposition to early voting nationwide, Gov. Glenn Youngkin has launched advertisement campaigns in recent years to encourage voters to take advantage of all of their voting options. Shortly after early voting began, turnout was high in GOP-strongholds — areas once reluctant to embrace early voting — or “purple” districts, which have been critical to both parties.

The registrars enjoy assisting first-time voters, whether they are naturalized citizens, newly legal adults finally allowed to participate, or those compelled by key issues to cast their first ballot. Coakley said first-time voters serve as a living reminder of why he stays in the election administration industry. 
“(They’re) the best part. If they’re 18 or 83, it does not matter,” Coakley said. “When you see that first-time voter and give them that sticker and everybody has applause, that’s what keeps us coming back each day.”

Gov. and Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears speaks at a rally on June 17, 2025. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)Transgender teenagers ages 13 to 17 comprise a scant 3.1% of the youth population in Virginia. But trans issues have loomed unusually large in Virginia’s gubernatorial election this year – and not in a good way. 
From 2014 to early 2025 – when state policy changed to prevent transgender athletes from participating in girls’ sports in the public school divisions – just 48 appeals had been filed by transgender athletes to compete in school sports, a Virginia High School League spokesman confirmed to me. That’s a minuscule number of students who participate in sports annually.
On the record: Winsome Earle-Sears

Yet Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears has flogged the issue repeatedly, in a way disproportionate to the number of people affected. The scheme also distracts from more-critical concerns, like soaring food costs, impending health-care changes, and the chaos that has beset the federal government since Donald Trump’s second presidential term started in January. Those issues affect all Virginians.
Earle-Sears’ hateful strategy targets already vulnerable people who seek to be their true selves. She’s employed it to try to defeat Democratic Party nominee Abigail Spanberger in November. The former congresswoman has been more tolerant on transgender topics, and she’s said bathroom use in schools based on gender should be decided at the local level.
CNN reported that last month, Earle-Sears’ campaign spent $2 million on ads focused on transgender policy, more than it spent on any other issue. The news website Notus.org said Republicans in the gubernatorial contest, including her campaign, have dedicated a whopping 57% of all their paid media campaigning toward transgender-related issues, citing data from the company AdImpact.
On the record: Abigail Spanberger

The discriminatory crusade demonizes transgender people and their families. Other GOP candidates across the country have followed suit in local, state and federal contests. It suggests how bankrupt their overall messaging is.
For example, state Del. Chad Green, R-York, who’s running for re-election, teamed up with Earle-Sears this month at a campaign stop in Williamsburg. He said barring “biological males” from competing against females was among his top priorities, The Virginian-Pilot reported.
Added Earle-Sears: “All the Democrats want biological men in girls’ sports.”
It’s a lot of umbrage directed at a relatively small population of athletes and individuals. And these Republican candidates know it.
Transgender adults, incidentally, have a prevalence of past-year thoughts about suicide “that is nearly twelve times higher, and a prevalence of past-year suicide attempts that is about eighteen times higher, than the U.S. general population,” according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. They certainly don’t need hyped comments from political leaders.
The Republican tack on transgender people is reprehensible. This cynical blueprint to stoke fear, drive transphobic voters to the polls and exploit ignorance mimics one that Trump used in the 2024 presidential election.
Republicans nationwide, obviously, would rather spew on this topic than debate cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. Those reductions occurred because of the president’s bill that took money from the poor to pay for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the rich. Republicans in Congress, who control both chambers, passed the legislation.
Such programs impact millions of people, including folks in the commonwealth. Nearly 2 million Virginians used Medicaid or FAMIS, the state’s health insurance for children, earlier this year. More than 866,000 used SNAP.
Regarding the fixation on trans people, “They’re focusing on this more than issues that affect all Virginians,” Reed Williams told me. The 23-year-old trans woman attended high school in Virginia Beach and is now on the staff of Equality Virginia, a LGBTQ+ advocacy organization.
Williams recently wrote a heartfelt column in the Richmond Times-Dispatch verbalizing her dismay at the attention that conservative candidates place on this issue, when things like the economy and rising prices are much more important. She’s right.
Williams noted, matter-of-factly, that she used the girls’ bathroom from the 8th to 12th grades – one of the overheated talking points for conservatives. Williams had a summer job in City Hall at 16.
Reed Williams, director of digital engagement & narrative strategy at Equality Virginia, told columnist Roger Chelsey ““Virginia’s current fight over transgender people is entirely manufactured.” (Photo courtesy Equality Virginia)
“Confusion over my gender could be remedied with a productive conversation, agreement to disagree, or simply moving on,” she wrote. “Virginia’s current fight over transgender people is entirely manufactured.”
I reached out to a spokesperson for Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor, about her focus on trans issues, but Peyton Vogel didn’t respond to my messages. Among them: Has Earle-Sears actually discussed her concerns with transgender individuals, especially those who transitioned during high school?
Besides, it’s not like the topic leads the list of priorities for Virginians. Far from it.
A Virginia Commonwealth University poll in September said that, among the top issues influencing registered voters in the state, 28% named the rising cost of living, followed by women’s reproductive rights (13%) and immigration and education (12%). Similarly, a Washington Post-George Mason University poll this month found just 4% of voters in the commonwealth said policies about transgender students were the most important issue in the governor’s race.
Instead, look at what Virginia is facing:
Because of the ongoing shutdown by the federal government, 900 furloughed federal employees have filed unemployment claims in Virginia during the first two weeks of October.
The Trump administration’s federal job cuts – most of which had little publicly announced criteria – have hurt Virginia; 341,000 federal workers lived here in 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau reported.
The state’s unemployment rate is projected to hit 4.1% by the end of the year, up from 2.9% in 2024, according to the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia.
But sure, Republicans, continue to be transfixed on transgender voters.
It’s not the first time you’ve scapegoated minorities by race or gender. Going back to at least your Willie Horton ads during the 1988 presidential contest between George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, you’ve been chock full of stereotyping and fear-mongering.
You simply don’t care who you harm in the process.
May your gutless ploy backfire.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)I saw some of my former Naval War College colleagues at the recent No Kings rally in Providence. Given that National Guard troops and protestors had clashed in Los Angeles at an earlier June rally protesting ICE raids, we wondered whether we would see National Guard troops as we marched, where they would be from, and their mission? We didn’t. That doesn’t mean, however, that there is no need for concern about the future.
The National Guard is unique to the U.S. military given it is under the authority of both state governors and the federal government and has both a domestic and federal mission. Governors can call up the National Guard to help when states have a crisis, either a natural disaster or a human-made one. Federal authorities can call on the National Guard for overseas deployment and to enforce federal law. 
President Dwight Eisenhower used both federalized National Guard units and regular U.S. Army units to enforce desegregation laws in Arkansas in 1957. But using military troops to intimidate citizens and support partisan politics, especially by bringing National Guard units from other states has never been, and should never be, part of its mission.
But that’s what is happening now.
A host of Democratic U.S. senators, led by Dick Durbin of Illinois, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and 25 others has called for an inquiry into the Trump administration’s recent domestic deployment of active-duty and National Guard troops to Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Portland, Oregon, and Memphis, Tennessee. In an Oct. 17 letter to the Defense Department’s Inspector General, the senators challenge the legality of the domestic troop deployment and charge that it undermines military readiness and politicizes the nation’s military. 
Ostensibly, the troops have been sent to cities “overrun” with crime. Yet data shows that has not been the case. Troops have been sent to largely Democratic-run cities in Democratic-led states. 
The case for political theater being the real reason behind the deployment certainly was strengthened when largely Republican Mississippi sent troops to Washington D.C., even though crime in Mississippi cities like Jackson is higher than in D.C. Additionally, there is an even more dangerous purpose to the troop presence  — that of normalizing the idea of troops on the streets, a key facet of authoritarian rule.
There are fundamental differences in training and mission between military troops and civilian law enforcement, with troop presence raising the potential for escalation and excessive force, and the erosion of both civil liberties and military readiness.
Troop deployments have hit some stumbling blocks. Judges, including those appointed by President Donald Trump, have in cases like Portland impeded administration attempts to send troops. Mayors and governors, including Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, have pushed back as well. While the Trump administration has shown its willingness to ignore the law, it has also shown a significant ability to come up with a “Plan B.” In this case, Plan B, used by many past dictators, is likely the utilization of private military companies (PMC).










While the Trump administration has shown its willingness to ignore the law, it has also shown a significant ability to come up with a 'Plan B.' In this case, Plan B, used by many past dictators, is likely the utilization of private military companies.


Countries have used these mercenary organizations to advance strategic goals abroad in many instances. Though the Wagner Group, fully funded by the Kremlin, was disbanded after a rebellion against the regular Russian military in 2023, Vladimir Putin continues to use PMCs to advance strategic goals in Ukraine and other regions of the world wrapped in a cloak of plausible deniability. Nigeria has used them internally to fight Boko Haram. The United States used Blackwater in Afghanistan in the early days after 9/11. Overall, the use of PMCs abroad is highly controversial as it involves complex tradeoffs between flexibility, expertise and need with considerable risks to accountability, ethics and long-term stability.
Domestically, the use of PMCs offer leaders facing unrest the advantage of creating and operating in legal “gray zones.” Leaders not confident of the loyalty of a country’s armed forces have resorted to these kinds of private armies. Adolph Hitler relied on his paramilitary storm troopers, or “brown shirts” to create and use violence and intimidation against Jews and perceived political opponents. Similarly, Mussolini’s “black shirts,” Serbian paramilitaries, and PMCs in Gaddafi’s Libya served similar purposes. 
President Trump has said he was “open” to the idea of using PMCs to help deport undocumented immigrants. He has militarized Homeland Security agents to send to Portland, evidencing his willingness to circumvent legal challenges. And perhaps most glaringly, poorly qualified and trained masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are already terrorizing American cities.
At the No Kings rally in Providence my former colleagues and I did see a man in an unfamiliar uniform — with a gun and handcuffs — standing alone on the sidewalk along the march path. He wasn’t doing anything threatening, just watching. In the past, he might not have even been noticed. 
But that day he was, some people even waved to him. Protestors are not yet intimidated, but they are wary, and rightfully so.
Be aware, America. They have a Plan B.

Wes Moore (D) has filed as a federal political action committee. The filing raises provides little insight on who's behind the group, but puts it in company with dozens of other Republican and Libertarian campaigns. (Screenshot of NoMoore.org)A federal campaign filing by NoMoore.org, a group that Democratic Party operatives called “shadowy,” raises more questions than it answers about the group that is using social media to needle the first-term Democratic governor.
The group in August filed a statement of organization with the Federal Election Commission for the NoMoore Political Action Committee, a “hybrid” PAC that can raise unlimited amounts of money for independent expenditures, and limited amounts for candidate donations. But the PAC has yet to report any fundraising activity and its sole listed officer, who also oversees two dozen other conservative PACs out of a Northern Virginia mail drop, did not respond to requests for comment.
NoMoore.org, in an unsigned response to reporter’s questions, insisted its efforts are focused on issue education not electioneering.
“Our organization is focused solely on supporting or opposing policies at the state level and calling out the failures of those in power in Annapolis. Our mission is to fight back against the reckless tax-and-spend policies that are destroying our state,” the organization said in its email.
Rumors persist about the identity of those behind the group. Democrats, including the state party and those who support Moore, insist the group has motivations beyond issue education.
“We love that we are living in the head of Governor Moore and the out-of-touch Maryland Democratic Party,” the group wrote.
Some theorize the virtual jabs are an effort to soften Moore up in anticipation of the 2026 election and a potential head-to-head contest with former Gov. Larry Hogan. The Republican predecessor to Moore is often mentioned as a potential 2026 candidate, and has at times has teased the idea himself, but has not made any public moves that indicate he is running.

Others suggest the NoMoore campaign is meant to strip the shine off Moore, a rising national star in his party and considered a potential candidate for president in 2028. So far, Moore maintains that he is not considering such a run.
A spokesperson for the Moore re-election campaign declined to comment on this story.
Complaints referred to state prosecutor
NoMoore.org gained attention earlier this year with social media posts targeting Maryland’s governor.
In March, the Maryland Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Maryland State Board of Elections, questioning whether NoMoore’s activities violate state election laws. In particular, the party expressed concerns that the group had failed to file as a campaign entity in Maryland.
The party recently criticized the group for what it called racist AI-generated content lampooning the governor. One post drawing specific criticism features Moore in a red clown nose and rainbow wig. An identical theme was used in a post about Carter Elliott, a white Moore spokesperson who recently moved to the governor’s campaign staff.
NoMoore said the Democratic Party was “screaming ‘racism’ and inventing conspiracies” to distract from what it said was Moore’s “record on spending and taxes.”
Allen Norfleet, director of candidacy and campaign finance at the board of elections, said the Democratic Party complaint and an anonymous second, previously unreported, complaint were forwarded to the Office of the State Prosecutor.
Norfleet said forwarding the complaints to the state prosecutor is not an indication of election law violations. “It’s just because they are the investigative agency for the state board,” Norfleet said.
The prosecutor’s office does not acknowledge the existence or status of investigations.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“It’s deeply concerning that the Maryland Democratic Party will do anything and everything in its power to weaponize our judicial system against political opposition,” NoMoore.org said in its unsigned response to questions. “We are following every law and simply exercising our First Amendment rights. Opposing higher taxes is the very basis on which our country was founded.”
A spokesperson for the Maryland Democratic Party declined to comment.
NoMoore is a federal PAC
NoMoore.org has not registered with the State Board of Elections, but with the FEC instead.
“At this time, we have no intention of being involved in next year’s election,” the group said in its email. “We only began raising money in September and are powered by small-dollar donations and volunteer energy, not special interests. Our goal is simple: to educate, organize, and empower Marylanders who feel left behind.”
The August filing established NoMoore PAC as a hybrid PAC, which can operate with two segregated bank accounts.
One can solicit and accept unlimited contributions. The money can come from individuals, corporations, unions and other political committees. The contributions can be used for independent expenditures, including ads referring to a federal candidate or generic voter drives in federal elections, according to the FEC.
The second bank account — subject to contribution limits — can make donations to individual federal candidates.
NoMoore PAC has yet to report any financial activity. Contributions and expenditures, if any, will become public in future filings, possibly after the first of the year.
The identities of the organizers remain unknown, and the subject of much speculation around the State House. The organization sidestepped questions about who was involved in the group.

“NoMoore.org is a grassroots movement built by and for Marylanders who are deeply concerned about the direction of our state under Wes Moore’s leadership,” the group wrote. “We are everyday citizens who have come together out of shared frustration and a desire for change. Moore’s record of spending, tax hikes, and misplaced priorities compelled us to act.”
Connections to conservative PACs
The statement of organization filed with the federal agency appears to tie the group to a network of national Republican PACs.
It is not clear why the group opted to create a federal campaign entity. Norfleet said the creation of a federal account surprised him.
“I don’t see any interest at the national level based on their activity,” Norfleet said.
The treasurer and bank named in the federal filing — Melodie Johnson and Chain Bridge Bank, respectively — have ties to other PACs backing Republican and Libertarian interests.
Johnson is also treasurer and custodian for at least two dozen other right-leaning political action committees, according to a review of FEC and IRS records. Some of those committees date back over a decade.
On that list are committees supporting Donald Trump, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and groups including FreedomWorks, Change New York – Save America PAC, and the GOPAC Election and GOPAC Education Funds.
A mail drop
The address for many of those federal committees — including NoMoore PAC — is a store front in a McLean, Virginia, shopping center three miles from CIA headquarters. The business offers private mailbox rentals.
Many of the committees overseen by Johnson, including NoMoore PAC, have accounts at Chain Bridge Bank, which was founded by former U.S. Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, a Republican from Illinois. The online bank has one physical location in McLean, roughly half a mile from the store front that serves as a mailing address for NoMoore PAC and other committees.

The bank has worked with every major Republican presidential candidate since 2008, including Donald Trump, according to Reuters.
A phone number for Johnson, found in FEC filings, is no longer in service. She did not respond to an email requesting an interview.
Norfleet said Johnson did not respond to emails he sent. He did receive an out-of-office vacation message.
Johnson is also listed as the treasurer or custodian of other PACs that operated in Maryland.
Ties to Hogan allies
Some of those organizations employed or were run by political operatives connected to Hogan.
One such committee, a 501(c)(4) called New Path Inc., was engaged in educating the public on new policies that would improve the economy and quality of life, according to IRS records.
The group hired a Pennsylvania-based political consulting firm called Red Maverick Media. Mike Leavitt, a founder and partner at the firm, worked as a consultant to Hogan’s 2014 campaign.
New Path also hired Steve Crim, a senior aide and campaign manager for Hogan, in 2016. Crim was the architect behind Hogan’s Change Maryland effort. The social media juggernaut billed as a grassroots campaign helped propel Hogan into the governor’s mansion in 2014.
Crim was also listed as a contact person for an organization known as Common Sense America Inc., according to IRS records. Johnson was listed as the principal officer using the same McLean address used for NoMoore.org.

NoMoore.org did not respond to questions about Crim’s involvement in the organization.
Crim, in an email, said he was not working for NoMoore.org, but that, “This summer, as a professional courtesy, I connected NoMoore.org to a compliance team that helps organizations navigate the complexities of grassroots advocacy.”
‘No plans to engage in the 2026 election’
Establishment of a federal PAC does not necessarily mean NoMoore.org will not have to register with state elections officials eventually.
Currently the group is walking a line between campaigning and what might be considered protected political speech.
But there are activities that could trigger registration with state elections officials including aggregate donations of $10,000 or aggregate donations of $6,000 or more in an election cycle. Either would require the group to file in Maryland.
That filing under the so-called 48-hour rule would have to include details about spending and donations, donors and the person directing and controlling the activities of the group.
Norfleet said those triggers were provided to NoMoore.org.
“As we have no plans to engage in the 2026 election and are not advocating for the election or defeat of a candidate, registering as a state committee did not make sense,” the group said in its email. “If we ever engage in a Maryland election and reach the required reporting thresholds, we will fully comply.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1814-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-27 07:17:00.430137

They continue to seek bipartisan support. (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Advocates for a ban on plastic bags said they chose to hold off on presenting legislation this session after they could not secure a Republican co-sponsor for what they hope will eventually be a bipartisan bill.
“We just feel like it would be more damaging to advance it and have it turn into a partisan football,” said Susan Richman, an advocate with New Hampshire Network, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group that formed in 2021.
Richman said the group had seen an encouraging bipartisan response to their advocacy on the topic, including from members of the House Environment and Agriculture Committee and the Solid Waste Working Group earlier this year. Ultimately, however, the group did not land on a version of the ban that could attract a Republican co-sponsor ahead of the 2026 session, Richman said.
Bag ban proponents are motivated by environmental, health, and landfill capacity concerns, said Richman and Rep. Nicholas Germana, of Keene.
Of the waste generated in New Hampshire in 2023, 105,770 tons — or 16.6% — was plastic, according to a 2024 report by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. 
“We really need to focus on not needing another landfill for a good long time,” said Germana, who has participated in discussions around possible bag ban legislation. “… The best thing we can do is reduce the amount of waste we are producing.”
Further up the waste stream, the bags also create issues for transfer stations — and, by extension, municipalities, Richman said.
“(Plastic bags) are hugely expensive to get rid of. They can’t be recycled, despite public mythology,” she said. A few companies, like Barrington-based Plastic Recycled, collect plastic bags and other hard-to-recycle plastics and transform them into composite park benches, siding, and other materials. But most plastic bags do not find another purpose; and when they are mistakenly sent through traditional recycling streams, they “gum up the works” when the thin plastic bags get caught in transfer station machinery, according to Richman.
Germana also raised concerns about microplastics. Plastic bags “break down into smaller and smaller pieces, but they don’t go away,” he said. “They end up in our water, our food, and then our bodies.”
Richman said ban proponents were concerned that some plastic grocery bags may contain PFAS, toxic materials known as “forever chemicals” for their ability to persist in the environment and in the body. Researchers have previously detected PFAS, which are linked to illnesses including cancer, in various kinds of plastic food packaging. 
Four of the six New England states — Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, and Vermont — have enacted statewide bans on single-use plastic bags at most retailers within the last five years. (In Massachusetts, a similar bill passed the Senate in 2024 but did not leave the House. Another version of the bill will go before the Legislature this year.)
Generally, the issue of waste reduction receives bipartisan attention, Germana said. However, Republican legislators resisted the idea of a ban some said could pass on costs to customers. Germana provided the example of stores selling paper bags at the register for a nickel or dime a piece, in lieu of free plastic bags.
Richman said the New Hampshire Network had recorded more than 5,000 signatures on a petition they began in 2024 supporting a retail bag ban. Though no legislation will be officially considered this year, Richman said the network would not drop the issue.
“People do well without (plastic bags),” she said. “It’s just a matter of convention and custom.”
Germana agreed the discussion would continue, though he said the disagreements that had stalled it were exemplary of some of the most fundamental differences between the two parties.
“I think this question about single-use plastic bags really does go deeper, into the role of the government in solving our problems,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bags-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-27 05:16:31.773600

This order of events is also known as the success sequence and Senate Bill 156 passed with a 24-9 party-line vote. State Sen. Al Cutrona, R-Canfield, introduced the bill which now moves to the Ohio House for consideration.

“We have an obligation to the next generation,” Cutrona said. “We need to help them break the chains of poverty. Now this bill provides just that, creating the opportunity by taking (a) three-pronged approach.”
The bill requires the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce to create a model curriculum for the success sequence for grades 6-12 and this would be a graduation requirement. 
The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that published Project 2025, provides model legislation for the success sequence.
“This, by no means is some golden ticket to the rich heels,” Cutrona said. “This is an opportunity — one thing that we can do that can help break those chains of poverty.”
Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, said this bill will help break Ohio’s cycle of poverty. 
“We’ve got an obligation to try to break that poverty cycle by giving these kids positive intervention that will help them want to improve their lives and grow,” he said. “And if we don’t do it, we’re going to continue to see the same old thing over and over again.” 
Following these sequences of events means people are “overwhelmingly less likely to live in poverty in adulthood,” according to the bill. 
However, a 2021 study funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found those who finish high school, work full time, and get married are less likely to experience poverty, but the order did not matter much. 
Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, said this bill might be the least effective policy solution to combat poverty. 
“If we were serious about fighting poverty and being a help to Ohio’s working poor, we could be providing paycheck protections or working family support,” he said. “Poverty is not a failure of personal responsibility, it is a failure of public policy priorities. And in that respect, Senate Bill 156 will not change poverty in Ohio for those who need it the most.”
Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said the bill leaves out the lived experiences of many families in Ohio. 
“This bill promotes certain values that don’t reflect the experiences of many Ohio families,” she said. “… It tells kids there’s only one way to have that successful family structure that’s not unconventional.”
Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, said he is perplexed by opposition to the bill.
“We have been throwing money at the war on poverty, and where has it gotten us?” he said. “Not very far. We need better life decisions to be made. We’re not dictating people how to live their lives. We’re making suggestions.”
Tennessee passed a similar success sequence bill earlier this year and Utah enacted a similar law last year. Kentucky, Mississippi and Texas all had similar bills this year as well.

(Photo by Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)In U.S. cities big and small, mayors are finding their tenures shaped by housing shortages, and efforts to build more homes, so that people of any income can afford a place to live.
In a series of conversations, mayors of big cities such as Atlanta and Seattle, as well as of midsize Midwest cities like Columbus, Ohio, and Madison, Wisconsin, told Stateline that housing is the No. 1 priority for mayors to tackle.
“Housing is by far one of the most important issues facing every mayor in America. It impacts everything from safety to the workforce to transit,” said Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, who also is the immediate past president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. “Mayors are on the front lines of our nation’s housing crisis. And it is a crisis.”
More than half of mayors in a recent bipartisan survey expect affordability in their cities to decline over the next year, and nearly all say their residents are dissatisfied with current housing costs. The survey was released in June by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, along with the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Capital One Insights Center.
And while a large share of big-city mayors are Democratic, members of both parties are seeking some nonpartisan solutions. Republican Mark Shepherd of Clearfield, Utah, and Democrat Rex Richardson of Long Beach, California, are pressing Congress to expand rental assistance and affordable housing programs, while also partnering with business leaders to boost supply. The two mayors help lead a coalition called Mayors and CEOs for U.S. Housing Investment.
Housing is a pivotal issue in next month’s mayoral races in Minneapolis, New York City and Seattle.
But even as mayors set ambitious targets, they’re often working within narrow lanes of authority. While city halls can zone land, streamline permits and invest local dollars, they can’t override state preemption laws or control climbing construction costs and interest rates. In many municipalities, the success and reach of a mayor’s housing vision hinges as much on what state lawmakers allow as on what local voters demand.
At least 30 states have barred cities from enacting rent control. Other factors not related to the push-and-pull of home rule between state and local governments cap how much mayors can influence housing within their borders.
“You have to analyze what you can control and what you can’t,” Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell said. “Interest rates, tariffs, the cost of materials — those are conditions we can’t fix. What we can do is plan smarter, permit faster and fund what’s within our reach.”

A fast-growing metro area
Ginther, the Columbus mayor, could talk about housing all day. He told Stateline he can’t imagine a mayor in the country who doesn’t have housing consistently on their minds.
As Columbus grapples with record growth and rising housing costs, Ginther says the city’s biggest challenge isn’t political will, it’s scale. Columbus needs 200,000 more housing units in the next 10 years to help bring down the cost of rents and ownership, he said.
Ginther, who is serving his second term, recently proposed creating a Division of Housing Stability. He said that mayors need to use the talent in their offices and agencies to tackle different aspects of the housing crisis, from helping residents find an affordable home to enabling them to keep it.
He’s also said that city voters’ willingness to approve big-dollar bond issues is a “buy-in” that many cities would be fortunate to have.
Since 2019, the city has used $250 million in bonds to build about 4,000 rental units. Voters are being asked to support another $500 million housing bond this November, along with other bonds for parks, police and fire, and road paving. More than half the city’s residents are renters.
Ginther said it’s a part of a $1.9 billion infrastructure package — combining city, county, state, federal and private resources — to reach the 200,000-unit goal.
“It’s ambitious, but if we commit to housing the way we’ve committed to jobs and workforce development, we’ll get it done.”
Can states, and a little bit of faith, convert church land into affordable housing?

According to census data, the Columbus metropolitan area ranks among the fastest-growing U.S. metros. Meanwhile, the Ohio Housing Finance Agency reports that from 2016 to 2021, the state saw a 38% decline in vacant units available for sale or rent, and during the same period saw a 13% increase in units classified for seasonal, recreational or occasional use, such as short-term rentals.
“The city has created jobs and we have one of the fastest-growing economies in the Midwest, but we didn’t build enough housing in previous years to keep up with that. And we have been only doing it a certain way,” said Ginther.
He added that the scale of housing issues is bigger than any one jurisdiction.
“We need regional and state partners to step up, too,” Ginther said. “I’ve said I’ll do half the [Franklin County] region’s housing needs … but I need my suburban and exurban neighbors to do their part.”
The squeeze in small cities
In northern Utah’s Davis County, Clearfield is proudly the home of Hill Air Force Base. Since the 1940s, a large share of military air force personnel have worked and lived nearby.
But Shepherd, the mayor, says his city — with about 32,000 people and once the blue-collar “starter home capital” — has transformed into a market that military families can no longer afford.
“It’s scary,” Shepherd, a Republican who was elected in 2013, told Stateline. “We used to be where people came for their first homes. Now, four airmen are splitting a two-bedroom apartment.”
Despite limited land, Clearfield has permitted or built 4,000 homes in five years, many through denser, vertical development. Shepherd, a longtime real estate agent, is pushing for Utah to expand condominium construction and creative financing tools, including through a new $300 million state loan program.
“Everybody wants ownership,” he said. “If someone wants to buy, we have an obligation to help make that happen.”
But he’s frank about the political headwinds: resistance to density, neighboring cities blocking townhome projects, and a state legislature eager to preempt local control.
“Density is a swear word for elected officials,” Shepherd said. “Some cities just won’t build, and when the carrot doesn’t work, sometimes you have to bring out the stick.”
Lower interest rates, higher incomes made homes more affordable in June

Shepherd said housing challenges are a constant topic among his peers across the country, especially in communities tied to military installations. As a member of the National League of Cities’ Military Communities Council, he regularly exchanges ideas with other mayors facing similar shortages.
“I haven’t had one mayor of a military city tell me they’re totally fine with housing,” he said. “Everywhere, it’s the same story. … The demand is high, the supply is tight, and servicemembers are getting priced out.”
Pressure from outside city borders
In Atlanta, one of the economic and cultural hubs of the South, Mayor Andre Dickens has seen the city get some good headlines in its efforts to address housing issues.
According to Realtor.com’s August 2025 rental report, the median asking rent in metro Atlanta dropped 13.6% year-over-year, one of the largest declines among the 50 biggest U.S. metros, tied with Las Vegas. Dickens credits the trend to an intentional surge in housing production.
In just under four years, Dickens has reached 60% of his goal to build or preserve 20,000 units of lower-cost housing by 2030, he said. Since taking office, he said that 12,000 units are already built or underway, aided by an Affordable Housing Strike Force that meets monthly to fast-track permits and secure funding for those projects.
“Atlanta was seen as affordable compared to New York or California, but our incomes weren’t keeping up,” Dickens told Stateline. His approach, in addition to approving a boost in city workers’ pay last year, was to help create more housing. “We made it our mission to build for low- and moderate-income families and to stop people from being rent-burdened.”
Among the projects Dickens touted to Stateline was the Atlanta Beltline, an urban redevelopment along 22 miles of rail line that delivered 569 affordable housing units last year — almost double its annual goal. The aim is 5,600 units in the area by 2030. Funding often combines public and private sources, and Dickens said that as the mayor, it’s his responsibility to bring these groups to the table.
Cities lead bans on algorithmic rent hikes as states lag behind

He also noted that the city is dealing with an influx of residents both from Atlanta’s suburbs and from cities that have their own housing challenges, such as Chicago, New Orleans and Chattanooga, Tennessee.
“Some suburban or rural counties don’t invest in homelessness or affordability, so those residents eventually land in cities,” said Dickens, who also is a co-chair of the National Housing Crisis Task Force, a coalition of elected officials.
“We can’t push them away,” he said. “We just have to deal with it, because cities are where people come for hope and help. That’s why mayors must lead with compassion and strategy.”
Kitchen-table terms
In Wisconsin, Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway told Stateline that the capital city’s housing challenge is simple but daunting:
“We were not building enough housing to keep up with our population growth,” said Rhodes-Conway, who was elected in 2019. “We built ourselves into a problem.”
Madison is Wisconsin’s fastest-growing city, but housing supply lagged far behind. When Rhodes-Conway took office in 2019, the city’s rental vacancy rate hovered around 1-2%, she said, far below the healthy 5-6% range.
Since then, Rhodes-Conway and the City Council have opened new funding channels and loosened zoning rules to speed construction. The city’s Affordable Housing Fund, once focused solely on federally funded Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects, now includes money for co-ops, community land trusts and homeownership efforts, she said.
“It was important to invite folks to think creatively about how we create affordability,” she said.
Her administration also works to preserve existing affordable stock through the Efficiency Navigator program, which upgrades older apartments for energy efficiency in exchange for rent-stability commitments. On the regulatory side, Madison has updated its zoning code to clear “pain points” such as density limits and onerous approval processes that once stalled projects, she said.











Talking about your neighbor or your kid who can’t find an apartment, that’s real life.


– Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway of Madison, Wis.



The results are tangible, as the city has completed more than 17,000 new homes since 2015, with another 5,000 under construction. Under a regional plan, Madison aims to add 15,000 more between 2025 and 2030, aligning with Dane County’s housing goals.
Rhodes-Conway sees the role of a housing-focused mayor to be both a policymaker and a translator.
Mayors need to discuss housing not in zoning jargon, she said, but in kitchen-table terms: stories about parents who can’t afford to buy where they grew up, the seniors priced out of longtime homes, or workers enduring farther commutes for a reasonable, cost-efficient living situation.
“Talking about NIMBYs and AMIs [area median incomes] doesn’t help,” she said. “Talking about your neighbor or your kid who can’t find an apartment, that’s real life.”
Personal experience
Harrell, the Seattle mayor, says he’s trying to turn one of America’s priciest markets into a working model of coordinated, city-level housing governance. When Harrell took office in 2022, he declared himself a “housing mayor.” Seattle’s population growth and its million-dollar home prices demanded more than a single department could manage, he said.
“I realized a city as large as Seattle had a fragmented housing policy,” Harrell said. “So we created a housing subcabinet — every department that touches housing now rows in the same direction.”
And when the state government does make changes to housing or zoning laws, that’s when mayors need to strike, he said.
In 2023, for example, Washington state allowed for the building of duplexes, triplexes and other forms of “middle housing” on land formerly zoned only for single-family homes. Seattle immediately adopted the change.
Harrell shepherded a $970 million property tax levy approved by voters in 2023 to help pay for affordable housing. The city’s new 20-year housing plan increases zoning capacity to allow for 330,000 new housing units, roughly double the target of the city’s previous plan. His administration has also accelerated permitting, which he said has “sped up some projects by one to two years.”
For Harrell, who hopes to win a second term in November, changing affordability in the city harks back to his parents’ first home in Seattle.
“The first house my mom and dad bought here in Seattle is still there,” Harrell said. “Same condition, same footprint. … It hasn’t had an addition. They bought it for $6,000 and sold it for $30,000. That same modest house today is worth over a million dollars.”
He then drew a parallel to his own experience buying a starter home in the 1980s.
“The first house I bought, I was making less than $40,000 a year, and I bought it for $87,000 with my college roommate, at about twice our income,” he said. “That house, too, is worth about a million now. I should’ve held onto it.”
These two homes capture the scale of the affordability crisis, he said.
“That’s the context we’re operating in,” he said. “And if I’m asking people who are already struggling with rent or mortgages to pay more into affordable housing through a levy, I have to be the evangelist. I have to show that we’re putting our own skin in the game.”

""Sloppy"" Floyd State Park and other Georgia parks could be getting a little pricier to visit. Photo by Jill WilliamsThe next time you want to take in some of Georgia’s natural beauty at one of its state parks, it could cost you a little more.
Or at least it will if the Board of Natural Resources signs off Tuesday on a proposal to raise fees. Under the plan under consideration, the cost to park at Georgia’s state parks for a day would double.
The Georgia Department of Natural Resources’ State Parks and Historic Sites Division spent just over $109 million in the 12 months preceding July 1, according to a new report from the state Department of Audits and Accounts, about half of which – $55.5 million – came from self-generated revenue sources like park passes, campsite rentals, golf course fees and gift shop sales.
State funds and bonds pay for about 43% of the division’s expenses, or about $46 million, and the federal government chipped in about $7 million, good for around 7%.
The auditors called the self-generated portion of the division’s revenue “significant.”
“However, we noted additional revenue-generating opportunities related to price adjustments, marketing, and targeted future investments,” the report reads. “Generating revenue to staff and maintain parks must be balanced with ensuring Georgians can access these public resources.”
In all, the auditors came up with more than two dozen recommendations dealing with topics from planning and maintenance to marketing and pricing.
In response to a request for comment, State Parks and Historic Sites Division Chief of Finance Katherine Darsey said the department “recently received the report and will be reviewing its findings and suggestions in the coming weeks.”
You can read the full report here.
Vehicle entry passes
The price to park your car at a state park has been unchanged since 2009 – $5 for a day or $50 for an annual pass, and the auditors found that among southeastern states that charge for park access, Georgia’s fees are the lowest. The report found that Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee do not charge for daily or annual passes, and Tennessee does not charge for the majority of its state parks.
The state Board of Natural Resources is set to meet Tuesday and vote on increasing next year’s fees to $10 for one visit or $70 for a year, according to the proposed amendments to the existing rules. Using 2024 visitation numbers, auditors found a $10 fee could increase revenue by $3.7 million.
Under the proposed changes, groups like senior citizens and disabled veterans who receive discounted rates would see price increases as well, though they would still pay less than the general population.
The auditors also called on the division to push for visitors to opt for annual passes since they bring in more money and drive down the number of potential daily noncompliers.
They note that some states offer discounted annual park passes along with vehicle tag renewal. In one such program in Michigan, 38% of the population purchased discounted passes, generating $42 million.
The auditors found that if owners of 10% of Georgia’s 8.5 million registered vehicles opted for a $20 discounted park pass, state parks could see a $15.8 million revenue bump.
The DNR parks division expressed concerns with the vehicle registration plan, noting fears that such a program could reduce revenues from the state’s license plate program, which allows people to buy a specialty plate and fund conservation efforts.
Reaction
Georgia Rivers Executive Director Rena Peck said bringing Georgia parks’ prices more in line with neighboring states makes financial sense and will help fund the work needed to keep facilities attractive and bring in more customers.
“I think it’s a good plan,” she said. “You’ve got to upkeep these places so that people can come, and then it’s a good, positive cycle with outdoor recreation because those state parks and historic sites, most of their budget comes from income from outdoor recreation. So, you’ve got to keep the facilities up in order to keep the stream of money in order to maintain them for people and nature.”
But Sierra Club legislative chair Mark Woodall said it doesn’t make sense for the state to increase prices at all when it is in a strong fiscal position.
“The state parks of Georgia should be for all the people of Georgia, regardless of income. With over $14 billion in reserve, it would be outrageous for the state parks to increase fees,” he said.
“In these difficult times, we ought to be encouraging people to get outdoors, not making it harder,” he added.

Earlier this month, university officials announced they would hang 500 Ten Commandments posters donated by Christian organization Counteract USA to comply with a new state law that requires “a historical representation” of the tenets be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
According to Act 573 of 2025, posters must be donated or purchased with funds through voluntary contributions. Posters that don’t meet specifications required by the law may be replaced with public funds or private donations.

As a “very strong believer of separation of church and state,” UA alum Andy Kinslow said he was angry to learn about the posters. Kinslow, who grew up in Arkansas but now calls Oklahoma home, said he was already contemplating ending his financial support of the university after being told one of his scholarships that referenced diversity needed to be modified to comply with state and federal law. 
Learning about the Ten Commandments posters “was the tipping point” that made him decide to pull both of his scholarships from the Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design and remove the department from his will.
“Why would I give money to an institution that is not fighting this law when there are lots of other places that the money could go that would be appreciated,” Kinslow said. 
A federal judge blocked implementation of Act 573 at a handful of Arkansas public school districts in a lawsuit focused on K-12 schools, but a suit challenging implementation of the statute at the higher ed level has not been filed. 
Kinslow said the law, which feels like “someone trying to impose their belief system on everyone else,” represents “religious overstep into public institutions that should be there to serve everyone and not just their interests.” 
“I’m very proud to have gone to the University of Arkansas, but I’m really saddened that this is happening,” he said.

University officials began hanging up the posters the week of Oct. 13, according to UA spokesperson John Thomas. Several dozen have been hung in multiple buildings, and installation is expected to continue throughout the fall semester, Thomas said. Campus leaders, building executives and the university’s primary communications directors have been briefed and notified about the installations.
“The posters are considered state property, therefore any tampering or removal will be investigated,” he said. “Responsible parties could face criminal charges, employment-related discipline, and/or other charges under the Code of Student Life.”
While there have been no formal speaking events expressing opposition, Thomas said he understands the posters have generated conversation.
“Certainly, we are aware and respect the fact that some students and employees disagree with the required postings…While we understand that there are different opinions about Act 573, the university’s practice is to comply with the law.”

Supporters of Act 573 have argued the Ten Commandments are a historical document because they influenced the nation’s founders and their creation of the country’s legal system. Opponents, like UA junior Nathan Gray, argue the posters are unconstitutional.
After the Ten Commandments began appearing at the university this month, Gray hung his own flyers around campus that drew attention to Stone v. Graham, a court case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a Kentucky law requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment (which forbids the government from “establishing” a religion) because it lacked a nonreligious, legislative purpose.
Proponents of Act 573 have pointed to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling in Kennedy v. Bremerton that instructed the Establishment Clause to be interpreted by “reference to historical practices and understandings.” 
Gray disagreed that the tenets have historical precedence.
“It’s purely religious, and I think that if they really felt that it was a historical document then we would have something like the Bill of Rights placed up or even the Constitution,” Gray said. “… their argument is that this is a document that’s influenced the documents like the Bill of Rights, so I think we could just skip right to our rights and how about we place those up in every classroom?” 
Gray thought it was “a joke” when he first saw a local news report about the donated posters and was “really shocked” they were installed so quickly. After hearing concerns from other campus community members, Gray said he realized no one was taking action and decided to organize himself.

The Fayetteville native hung posters gauging interest in a teach-in, an informal lecture to discuss all sides of the issue. Over the last week, he’s received feedback from more than two dozen graduate and undergraduate students, including a few who are willing to speak. Gray hopes to include faculty members in the lecture, which he intends to host before Thanksgiving break. 
In-person discussions can be fruitful for developing solutions to issues, according to Gray, who noted it’s easy for his peers to focus on virtual actions like signing an online petition.
“Those are really important, but I think getting together in person is a really powerful way of sending a message that we can organize together, and the power really is with the students here and the people,” he said. “And that’s our main way of being able to show it, is just organizing together in a big room.”
While some classmates may assume the debate over the posters is a religious issue that doesn’t affect them, Gray said it’s bigger than that. It’s a question of constitutional rights.
“I think they’re testing the waters and seeing what’s the easiest part of the First Amendment to start to chip away at,” he said. “This unfortunately is it and it has to do with religion, so I think that’s where we are at.”
Gray said Act 573 proponents are taking advantage of a “really chaotic moment” in the country with the government shutdown and a busy news cycle that forces students to move on to the next issue instead of continuing to focus on one thing. Immediate action against the Ten Commandments posters will likely require judicial intervention, Gray said, but in the long term, he hopes creating dialogue around this issue will encourage voters to consider their options for the 2026 election. 
“To make sure that we’re all voting for people who really want to prioritize our constitutional values, and I think that right now people just aren’t aware of a lot of this stuff, especially students,” he said.

Many economists predicted that they would raise costs and prices, and that seemed to be confirmed by two reports produced recently by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
The bank is one of 12 in the United States, and its region includes all of Ohio and adjacent parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky. 
Eight times a year, it conducts surveys of business and community leaders. It uses them to inform its contributions to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policies regarding the money supply and interest rates.
The results of the survey conducted between Sept. 18 and 25 were released last week. 
A tariff is a tax on imports. Trump has said his strategy is to use them to bring back jobs that have fled the country since the free-trade agreements of the 1990s and the 2000s. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXBut so far, tariffs appear to have significantly increased companies’ input costs and customers’ prices — and given most employers an incentive to replace people with machines.
“Respondents said their firms’ nonlabor costs had risen by an average of 6.8% over the past 12 months,” the report said. “Roughly two-thirds indicated that they had raised prices to offset some portion of these higher costs, and more than half noted adopting new technologies or increasing automation to reduce overall nonlabor operating expenses. Respondents reported that their firms’ selling prices had risen by an average of 3.3% over the past 12 months, and they expected greater price growth in the 12 months ahead.”
Trump’s unpredictable imposition and de-imposition of tariffs also might be taking a toll. In August, a panel of economists who study various aspects of the economy said that lack of predictability made it difficult for businesses to plan when and how to invest.
In a second report called the Beige Book, the Cleveland Fed last week said that uncertainty contributed to declines in business for manufacturers.
“Manufacturers reported modest declines in demand for goods, a situation which they attributed to tariffs and trade-policy uncertainty, and consumer spending declined slightly,” it said. “On balance, contacts said that their employment levels increased slightly and that wage pressures grew modestly. Nonlabor cost pressures remained robust, and selling prices continued to grow modestly.”
The Beige Book said the tariffs were increasing costs across a wide swath of the economy.
“Overall, nonlabor input costs rose at a robust pace in recent weeks, continuing the trend seen in the prior three reporting periods,” it said. “Tariffs were frequently cited as drivers of these cost increases across industries. Many manufacturers reported tariff-related cost increases on raw materials, imported components, and chemical inputs. Retail contacts noted tariff-driven cost increases on vehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate. Two contacts noted that foreign producers were factoring in tariffs and cutting prices accordingly to retain market share.”
It added that consumer spending, a vital economic driver, is also down somewhat. 
“Consumer spending declined slightly in recent weeks, and contacts expected demand to be flat in the coming months,” the Beige Book said. “Several retail stores reported a drop in unit sales, and a large retailer reported lower in-store and online traffic. Similarly, a food and hospitality contact said that customers were ‘more value aware,’ and another large retailer reported that tariff concerns continued to drag down customer sentiment.” 
When it comes to tourism, Trump’s pugnacious attitude toward our neighbors might not be helping.
“One tourism contact, who reported a year-over-year decline in activity, said that visits by Canadians fell by 50%,” the Cleveland Fed reported. “Auto dealers generally reported that sales were flat to down, except for used car sales, which one dealership expected to remain strong in the coming months.”

This comes as lawmakers are passing bipartisan relief bills.
It’s reached a boiling point for Beth Blackmarr, a Lakewood resident fed up with rising property taxes.
“My house payment is going to be going up to $120 a month,” Blackmarr said. “It’s crazy. That puts a stress on us.”
She has been begging state lawmakers to provide some relief — and she isn’t the only one. She is part of Citizens for Property Tax Reform, a grassroots organization based in Cuyahoga County.
“Something is wrong and what’s wrong is that the legislature did not do their job,” she said. “Legislature, get moving!”
The state lawmakers say they are trying.
“The changes we made today will save $2.4 billion over the next three years for our taxpayers in Ohio,” state Rep. Bill Roemer, R-Richfield, said in a press conference Wednesday afternoon.
Roemer and the Republican leadership cheered two bipartisan bills that passed this week.
Both House Bill 186 and House Bill 335 limit how much money school districts can get from rising home values — tying tax increases to inflation.
Read more in-depth about each proposal on News 5’s media partner Ohio Capital Journal.
State Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, explained that not everyone will get relief, but this is a step in the right direction.
“It will vary district to district,” Thomas said. “But those that saw the most spikes will then see the most benefit.”
Blackmarr isn’t impressed, laughing at the legislators’ efforts.
“It’s probably about 20 years too late for some of this,” she said.
House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, knows this and acknowledged the sudden urgency to pass property tax relief bills after years of inaction.
“I have to say that the threat of a ballot initiative is part of the thing that’s driving this,” Huffman said.
Blackmarr is leading the movement to abolish property taxes in the state, collecting signatures to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot.
“We’ll tell you that — well in excess of 100,000,” Blackmarr said when asked how many signatures the campaign has collected.


To get a proposal on the ballot, amendments need to receive about 415,000 valid signatures.
She said they don’t have any backers or money, and aren’t affiliated with any political action committees — it’s all volunteer work.
Lawmakers warn that the initiative could bankrupt local governments. Blackmarr pushed back, saying they better do something to appease homeowners, then.
“They need to compete with this ballot initiative,” Blackmarr said.
When asked how legislators could earn her support, she wasn’t sure.
“I don’t know that they’d earn my support,” she replied. “They need to do something drastic.”
At this point, she said, the campaign is not standing down.

Read additional coverage of the November 2025 election in Maine here.

	But a new report and a referendum on the upcoming November ballot underscore that the ability of incarcerated Mainers to exercise that right is largely dependent on voluntary work — the goodwill of government officials, some of whose jobs are not supposed to be administering elections, and civil rights groups willing to assist. 
Addressing the barriers within the state’s prison voting system is ever more pressing as President Donald Trump’s administration challenges voting rights through executive orders and other pressure on states, including sweeping requests for personal voter information that current Secretary of State Shenna Bellows has twice denied. There has also been an increase in the number of new restrictive voting laws passed by state governments. 
Maine is now considering added restrictions. 
Mainers will decide on Nov. 4 whether to pass a referendum that would make numerous changes to election procedures — including requiring identification at the polls and adding restrictions to absentee voting. Proponents say doing so will increase election security, while opponents say it will lead to voter suppression. 
The referendum doesn’t explicitly mention incarcerated voting, but legal experts, civil rights advocates and incarcerated people caution that the changes could result in added barriers, on top of already existing ones, for people to vote in prison — who rely entirely on the absentee process and have limited access to identification. 
“Any kind of restrictions or reduction of the ability to vote by absentee ballot is worrisome to us because it disenfranchises folks that we have decided have the ability to vote in our state,” said Joseph Jackson, executive director of Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition. “All of us have a stake in where our government goes.”
Because incarcerated people are under the government’s control and care, whatever is happening politically can also impact them in an even more direct way than people on the outside, said Bruce King, executive director of Maine Boys to Men who is a board member for Maine’s Juvenile Justice Advisory Group.
Incarcerated people partner with state officials to encourage voter turnout in prisons

Voting is also one of few ways people in prison can still have a say in what’s happening in their hometown or where their family lives, said King, who was incarcerated himself during his late 20s. 
“I think part of the challenge is that a lot of people in prison don’t feel like they are up to date enough to vote, but the ones that are tend to have a much stronger tie to their communities,” King said, “and when they get out, mainstreaming is less of a challenge.”
How voting in prison works 
The only way to vote while incarcerated in Maine is by absentee ballot. Voting machines and ballot boxes are not brought into prisons or jails. 
Voting in Maine is tied back to a person’s municipality, so incarcerated voters are registered using their last residence, not the prison address. 
To register, residents have to fill out a registration form and a proof of residency/ identification form, which must be notarized. (Maine currently requires voters to provide proof of identification to register to vote but not when casting a ballot.) 
Those are reviewed by their municipality and incarcerated voters can then request an absentee ballot. They’ll fill it out once it gets to them via mail in their facility and return it again by mail. 
While this may seem straightforward, in practice it is not.
Delays with prison mail, limited access to paperwork needed to vote, and limited capacity and training of corrections staff — whose primary roles are supervision and care — to assist with the multi-step process to vote absentee are just some of the barriers to incarcerated voting that currently exist, according to the latest report of the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit advocating for humane responses to crime. 
“Everything in prison is 100 times harder than it is on the streets,” a staff member of the Maine Department of Corrections told the researchers. 










Any kind of restrictions or reduction of the ability to vote by absentee ballot is worrisome to us because it disenfranchises folks that we have decided have the ability to vote in our state.

The voluntary apparatus holding up incarcerated voting 
The Sentencing Project report also revealed that the ability to break through those barriers is heavily dependent on voluntary work, notably the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) prison branch founded by incarcerated residents in the early 2000s and located within Maine State Prison. 
The prison branch has run in-person voter registration drives since 2004 and also organizes educational opportunities, such as bringing in candidates to help with another barrier to voting: a lack of knowledge of candidates and issues. 
During a recent webinar about the report, president of the Maine State Prison chapter of the NAACP Foster Bates said they plan to invite all of the candidates for governor in 2026 into Maine State Prison, with the hope — if enough are willing and if the chapter can get approval from the governor — to host a debate or town hall meeting for incarcerated residents. 
In 2006, the Department of the Secretary of State started working with the NAACP to run voter registration and absentee ballot application events within state correctional facilities, providing a way to address discrepancies on voter registration forms or ballot requests in real time while collecting  ballot applications in-person, though not absentee ballots themselves. 
These typically occur every two years before presidential and gubernatorial races and vary from including all facilities to only the larger ones, according to the Department of the Secretary of State.  
But, the Department of Corrections is the gatekeeper to “if and how” this voting work unfolds, including which entities have access to incarcerated residents, the report found.
“I cannot stress enough that if the Department of Corrections does not buy in, voting registration in Maine for those who are incarcerated would be absolutely difficult,” Bates said.

Kristen Budd, one of the report authors, told Maine Morning Star that turnover among those driving this effort is guaranteed — in the Department of Corrections, Secretary of State and incarcerated residents who assist from inside who could get transferred or released.  
Unlike Vermont, the other state where those in prison retain the right to vote, Maine doesn’t have a written policy for prison staff on how to guide incarcerated residents to exercise their voting rights. The report recommends Maine create one. 
“There has to be built in institutional knowledge so that part does not get lost in the day to day,” Budd said. 
The overarching recommendation of the report is to implement on-site polling locations in all prisons and jails where there are eligible voters. Jails present even greater challenges to voting access because of their fluid populations. But even so, turnout in jails with on-site polling locations has surpassed citywide turnout rates in some places, including in Washington, DC, which restored voting rights in prison in 2020. 
Maine’s Secretary of State Department has said doing so would prove difficult here, where elections are run by municipalities. But Budd doesn’t see that as a dead end. She said, “Where there’s a will, there’s a way, right?” 
Voter turnout of people who are incarcerated lags far behind Maine’s overall engagement in elections.
Neither the Maine Department of Corrections nor the Maine Department of the Secretary of State track the number of people in prison who vote in each election. However, a 2020 report from researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimated that around 6% of incarcerated people in Maine likely voted in the 2018 election, compared with more than 60% of all eligible Mainers who voted.  
With such low participation already, civil rights advocates and those who are currently and formerly incarcerated worry adding more voting restrictions will effectively prevent even that small subset of the incarcerated population from exercising the right altogether. 
Implications of Question 1 
People who are incarcerated are not allowed to keep documents such as driver’s licenses in their possession, according to Maine Department of Corrections policy. This presents an obvious barrier to adhering to the referendum’s proposal to require identification at the time of voting. 
Bates described the referendum as an effort to try to circumvent the Maine Constitution, which states that every U.S. citizen residing in the state of Maine who is at least 18 years old has a right to vote.

For those outside of prison, the referendum would require showing a valid form of photo ID at the polls: a Maine driver’s license, non-driver identification card, interim identification card, U.S. passport, passport card, or military or veteran identification card. When voting absentee, voters would have to return their ballots along with an “identification envelope” that includes their driver’s license or nondriver identification card number and other personal information.
Maine Department of Corrections stores identification if a person has it on them when admitted and case managers can access it if needed, according to spokesperson Jill O’Brien. While someone is incarcerated, they’re issued a facility identification card, which wouldn’t be considered a valid form of ID to use for voting purposes under the proposed referendum. 
Alex Titcomb, the lead petitioner of the ballot question committee, said he wasn’t aware that incarcerated people lose possession of their IDs while serving their time, but he said Question 1 doesn’t impact them any differently than anyone else who may not currently have a valid photo ID. 
“The burden is upon the Secretary of State to provide a non-driver photo ID, or adjust rulemaking, so that they can continue to cast their ballot,” Titcomb said, referring to a section of the referendum that would also direct the secretary to establish a procedure to issue free, non-driver IDs.  
Presumably, incarcerated residents would still not be permitted to have that identification in their possession. Alicia Rea, a policy fellow at the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said that would mean a new process would likely have to be developed to give incarcerated residents temporary access to those cards to be able to provide the needed information to vote. 
“We’re really placing a great deal of dependency on DOCs cooperation for a process that really isn’t DOC’s process,” Rea said. “It’s a constitutional right for them to cast their vote, but we’re saying, ‘Okay DOC has to administer this in some way.’”
There could also be implications for those recently released from prison. 
The Bureau of Motor Vehicles, which is run by the secretary of state, currently has an agreement with the Department of Corrections to produce state IDs for incarcerated residents approaching release from one facility, the Maine Correctional Center in Windham. According to Department of Correction’s policy, case managers are supposed to verify that inmates have at least two forms of ID for employment purposes and help those who don’t leading up to release. 
“Nothing when you’re incarcerated is instantaneous,” said Jackson from Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition. “It takes a bit to get easy things done, so something like that, it’s something that’s possible, but it does take a little while to accomplish.”
King from Maine Boys to Men previously worked as a counselor for people with barriers to employment and said much of his time was spent helping people track down documentation, such as security cards and birth certificates, needed to obtain identification.
People serving time often have limited access to the paperwork needed to obtain identification, he said, not only because they’re currently incarcerated but also because a lot of transient people end up behind bars. 
Other potential barriers could come from the changes proposed to the absentee ballot process. 
For example, the referendum would remove some ways absentee ballots can be requested, including by telephone and by an immediate family member on behalf of a voter. This narrows incarcerated people’s options for requesting ballots. 
Both Bellows and Jill O’Brien, director of government affairs for the Department of Corrections, said the two departments would work together to determine the appropriate course of action if Question 1 passes, noting that they already collaborate on the in-person registration and absentee ballot drives. 
However, Bellows said in an interview that she believes “the constraints contained in Question 1 will make the right to vote for people who are incarcerated even more dependent on the goodwill of the sitting Secretary of State at the time.”

(Photo by Getty Images)Pennsylvania is a microcosm of a divided nation.
It’s one of only three states to have a politically divided state legislature. Republican control the Senate by four seats and Democrats have a one-seat majority in the House. 
The commonwealth’s one of only four states to have a split U.S. Senate delegation: Sen. John Fetterman (D) and Sen. David McCormick (R). 
The state voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2024 and former President Joe Biden in 2020. 
On top of that, state budget negotiations continue to drag on months after the fiscal year deadline. 
Could the investment of more pickleball courts in Pennsylvania be the pathway towards mitigating political division, cultivating civic engagement, and working together despite political differences?
In his seminal work “Bowling Alone,” political scientist Robert Putnam noted that more people were ‘bowling alone’ rather than joining bowling leagues. He argued that this was symptomatic of a decline in social capital, which he defined as “the collective value of all ‘social networks’ and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other.”
The decline in social capital may be contributing to increased partisanship, a decrease in volunteerism, and the decline in civility in political discourse. Alarmingly, a recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that there has been a spike (30% in Oct 2025 from 19% in April 2024) in the number of people from both parties saying that at times political violence may be necessary.

One possibility to increase social capital is to supplant “bowling leagues” with pickleball groups. Playing pickleball with people outside of one’s immediate social network can potentially soften partisan edges and foster greater empathy with others. Pickleball courts regularly feature times for “open” play, whereby players from all backgrounds and levels are invited to participate. Players rotate partners and opponents frequently, encouraging interaction beyond existing social or political bubbles.
In one widely-reported case, a woman in a Pittsburgh suburb played with members of the Pittsburgh Steelers, including T.J. Watt, and did not even know that they were NFL football players until a crowd had gathered to watch them play. 
Pickleball groups connect people across lines that often divide us, including different socio-economic backgrounds and generations, which exposes them to different points of views, including partisan views. There is already a bipartisan U.S. Senate Pickleball Caucus that meets regularly to play. 
Beyond political loyalties, there are no shortage of things that divide Pennsylvanians, including the battle over Wawa v. Sheetz or Pittsburgh sports teams v. Philly sports teams. But on the pickleball court, players encourage each other, strategize together, and build real-world relationships that are not necessarily sorted by online algorithms on their social media feeds or partisan media consumption habits.
The truth is that Pennsylvania – like many states – could stand to benefit from a boost of social capital. Volunteer fire departments, which cover most of the fire responses in Pennsylvania, are struggling to find a new generation of volunteers, and the same applies for EMS volunteers. 
Churches, which have traditionally been a source of building social capital, are struggling to find parishioners to fill their pews. According to the Pew Religious Landscape Study, only 28% of Pennsylvanians attended church once per month or more in 2023-2024, compared to 49% in 2014. 
As America’s fastest growing sport with over 19 million pickleballers in the United States, Pennsylvania should go all in on the pickleball bandwagon. Pickleball isn’t a cure-all, but it is a step toward building community. It promotes physical health, mental well-being, and civic connectedness, and it exposes players to people and perspectives they might never otherwise encounter. 
If Governor Shapiro is serious about “getting s*** done,” then let’s take a tangible step towards increasing social capital and build more pickleball courts in the Commonwealth. If Pennsylvanians can learn to live together more harmoniously, we can lead the way for the rest of our country.

The Planned Parenthood affiliates said they received letters from the Ohio Department of Medicaid, dated Sept. 24, suggesting they be cut from Medicaid. The letter referenced the federal budget reconciliation bill that was passed and signed into law by President Donald Trump in July, which bans Planned Parenthood from receiving federal Medicaid payments for one year. 
“We have officially requested a hearing with the Ohio Department of Medicaid to affirm our status as a trusted Medicaid provider without any reports of misconduct that would justify our termination from Medicaid,” Melissa Cohen, general counsel for PPGOH and PPSWO, said in a statement. “We hope the hearing will clarify that the federal funding prohibition is purely a political attack on Planned Parenthood and does not provide any basis for ODM to terminate Planned Parenthood from the program.”
The national Planned Parenthood Federation of America is suing to stop the federal cuts from being enforced. A federal judge temporarily stopped the cuts in July, but another judge allowed the cuts to go through in a September ruling. The national Planned Parenthood group pledged to continue fighting the law. Medicaid already does not cover direct abortion services. 
The Ohio Department of Medicaid did not respond to the Ohio Capital Journal’s request for comment. 
Banning Planned Parenthood from Medicaid will prevent more than 27,000 Ohioans from accessing reproductive health care at their centers, according to the organization. 
Two Planned Parenthood clinics in Springfield and Hamilton closed earlier this year and Medicaid cuts were cited as the reason. Those clinics did not provide abortion services, focusing instead on primary care services and screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted infections.
Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio President and CEO Nan Whaley said she was disappointed but not surprised. 
“Anti-abortion politicians are once again using every tool at their disposal to block people from accessing essential, life-saving care at Planned Parenthood, indefinitely,” she said in a statement. “This move is part of a broader, coordinated strategy to push reproductive health care out of reach.”

(Submitted)Much like Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman joined forces to fight evildoers as the Justice League, so the Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, Kansas Action for Children and Kansas Appleseed joined forces to combat apathy and misinformation with a recent cross-state tour.
The three nonprofits aimed to inform residents about H.R. 1, the tax and spending package touted as a “big, beautiful bill” by President Donald Trump. As we’ve written repeatedly, that law literally takes resources from the poor through cuts to Medicaid and food stamps and gives them to the rich as tax cuts. All three organizations raised alarms as the bill was being debated, and while some of its roughest edges have been sanded down, daunting problems remain. Members spoke to audiences in Iola, Garden City, Hutchinson and Manhattan toward the end of September and beginning of October.
To learn more, I sat down to talk with April Holman of the Alliance, Adrienne Olejnik of KAC and Haley Kottler from Appleseed. Here are a handful of big worries and small mercies from our conversation.


 
Why go on tour?
Kotter: “I think we really wanted folks to understand how deep the cuts went in this bill. I think a lot of people had heard ‘one big, beautiful bill.’ They had heard that President Trump signed it on the Fourth of July, and they maybe knew some of the top provisions in it. But I think what was unique about this was standing together on several different issues and showing how they all interconnect.”
Holman: “Our hope was that people would walk away understanding that even though this is a huge bill and the health care cuts might be very weedy in terms of the policy, that impact was going to be really significant in Kansas, among people that they knew, and perhaps among themselves even. … To put that accountability piece into the work is important to us.”
 
What’s happening now?
Kottler on SNAP: “The biggest threat right now immediately is that there are some cuts that are going to go into effect on Nov. 1. For the first time ever, parents are going to be subject to work requirements. … For the first time ever, parents with children 14 or over are going to be subject to 30-hour-a-week work or training requirements. Additionally, seniors up to 64 are going to have to have these work requirements as well. And that’s just one piece of this puzzle. Those are the most immediate.”
She also highlighted increased SNAP cost sharing with the state: “We’re hearing from other states that their agencies are saying, ‘We don’t know how we’re going to even run the program,’ and I think that’s a risk that Kansas will will face as well. So we’re really going to be in a bind on SNAP in the next couple years.”
 
How do Kansans feel?
Olejnik: “People are already seeing impacts in their communities. H.R. 1 is just one piece of what we’ve already seen in cuts from the state over the years, from the federal government in other ways and other spending programs this year already. So it feels like just one more thing now that they’re going to have to worry about. They already have stories of impact to share before H.R. 1 is even coming to their community and hitting programs like Medicaid, SNAP. We heard from churches who are struggling to feed people. We heard from child care providers who are really concerned about impacts on the families that they serve, and they don’t know how they’re going to meet some of their basic needs. So it was really a hard conversation, but it was important to have.”
 
What does the shutdown mean?
Kottler: Without action, “SNAP benefits will not go out in Kansas in November, or until the government shutdown is discontinued. We’ve heard from the state agency that they need about 72 hours to put out benefits. So Oct. 28 is kind of the drop dead date for benefits to go out on time in November for SNAP. … I was up until 1 in the morning talking to someone who does food pantry work, who has just been inundated with families this week because they are worried about their benefits going away.”
Holman on Affordable Care Act plan costs: “There are going to be a lot of people across the country who are expected to lose their coverage, and in Kansas, we think that it could increase the level of uninsured Kansans by as much as 27%. It’s going to mean a really significant increase in the cost of those plans, an average of 77%, so that is enormous. … We’re getting to the point where open enrollment is going to happen, the higher costs are going to be baked in to next year’s premiums for people.”
 
What gives you hope?
Olejnik “We’re really hoping that Kansans keep paying attention, and they keep connecting the dots to what is happening, and they share their feedback — the stories about the impact of these federal changes — with each other and with their lawmakers. Secondly, it is not too late ever for the federal government and Congress to make different choices. We know that’s why we’re in a shutdown right now, because of the impact of these advanced premium tax credits” for ACA plans.
Finally, Olejnik asked: “What are state lawmakers going to do with all of this? They have some really tough decisions ahead, and when they come back to their regular session in January, they’re going to be confronted with quite a few of those.”

More than seven years ago, my husband and I received devastating news: our perfect baby boy had been diagnosed with a rare, terminal genetic condition called Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (also known as Niemann Pick Disease Type A/B) — ASMD for short.
What made this diagnosis even more difficult was the fact that we found out we were expecting our daughter just three days prior. We quickly learned that any of our offspring has a 25% chance of inheriting this disease. A year later, our beautiful daughter was born, and our hearts shattered for a second time when she, too, was diagnosed with ASMD.
The diagnosis was completely soul-crushing, but the true nightmare came later—learning just how hard we’d have to fight the health care system to keep our children alive.
When our children were first diagnosed, doctors told us they wouldn’t live past the age of three. Today, they are six and seven, growing, thriving, and living full lives in their own beautiful way. Due to the progressive neurological disease from their condition, they are both nonverbal, use wheelchairs, are tube-fed, and require around-the-clock care. Every medication, every feeding, every bath, every shift of their bodies is planned and aided by a caregiver.
It’s exhausting, yes, but everything I do is for my children, and I’m honored to be able to care for them. Every day, I get to witness miracles in motion. They are stable today because we’ve been fortunate enough to have the at-home care they need—care that has only been made possible through Medicaid. It pays for their nursing, their life-saving infusion medications, therapies, and even the specialized equipment that allows us to keep them safe in our home. Without Medicaid, my kids wouldn’t just lose comfort; they wouldn’t be able to survive.
That’s why every time I hear our members of Congress talk about yet another round of “budget negotiations,” “health care cuts,” or about the different ways they plan to make government more “efficient,” my stomach drops and my heart breaks. Parents like me know exactly what these words mean: It means wondering if the treatments keeping our children alive will still be here tomorrow.
Right now, the government shutdown has put programs like Medicaid back on the chopping block. For so many families like mine, the consequences aren’t a number on a spreadsheet; they’re a terrifying nightmare. When Washington freezes, the systems that families depend on slow to a crawl. Our requests for approvals on essential medical equipment and special medications get delayed. And the nurses who support our home care can’t get paid. Every bureaucratic pause adds up to very real suffering for the people at the end of those systems.
But to be blunt, these cuts didn’t start with this shutdown—and re-opening the government won’t magically fix the damage. The cuts have been happening quietly, piece by piece, since the beginning of the year. Every budget that trims “nonessential” services chips away at the fragile scaffolding that keeps children like mine, elders and entire communities alive.
When politicians talk about “reducing spending,” what they’re actually reducing is access to care. They’re talking about fewer hours of care for children who can’t breathe or eat on their own. They’re talking about cutting aid to parents like me who have been forced to quit our jobs to become full-time caregivers. They’re talking about families bathing their disabled children in unsafe ways because the home modification grant they were promised is still waiting for approval.
It took me years to learn how to navigate the health care system. Every form, every appeal, every phone call feels like a test of endurance. And still, even with all that effort, I live in constant fear of what might be taken away next.
Families like mine are already doing everything we can to hold our lives together, to keep our children safe, comfortable, and cared for.
We shouldn’t have to fight this hard for care that should be a basic human right. My children and so many others like them deserve better.
It’s time for our leaders to stop treating health care as a bargaining chip.

That’s […],"Nebraska's primary election in 2024 was the first statewide election to require poll workers to check photo IDs. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Among a recent rash of bad ideas comes two recycled clangers for Nebraskans: Hand counting paper ballots for all state elections and adopting a winner-take-all format to determine the state’s presidential electors.
A nonprofit group has launched a petition campaign to put both bricks on the ballot in hopes of making them constitutional amendments. That’s about right. We apparently have a thing here about changing our guiding principles. We — voters or legislators — have amended the current constitution 240 times since its adoption in 1875.
That said, neither of these ideas seem worth the ink. The requirement that all elections use paper ballots and that those ballots are then counted by hand flies in the face of research on election accuracy. Plus, any revival of the winner-take-all system seemingly comes up only when the GOP loses in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. Only Maine and Nebraska choose electors by district.
This space has used more than enough column inches arguing that instead of changing the rules to make it easier for the GOP to capture Nebraska’s “blue dot” in Omaha, maybe it should try to compete for votes there with better ideas.
Changing to a winner-take-all system is a calculating cousin of recent attempts to treat elections as civic duties with which we can do as we please. Midcycle redistricting — redrawing congressional districts between census counts — is trending for the GOP as Texas, Missouri and North Carolina are redrawing congressional districts at the urging of the White House in hopes of gaming the system to win in 2026. Democratic stronghold California has chosen to leave redistricting up to voters, who will decide in November whether to respond with its own plan that would in part offset Republican gains.
Much of the ruckus may end up in court as Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits redrawing districts based on race unless it is to remedy past discrimination. Plus, the Supreme Court has already heard oral arguments on the issue this session and will weigh in on Section 2 next spring. 
Meanwhile, other states, including Virginia as of this writing, surely have their sharpies ready to redraw, making congressional races more about gyrating geography than good ideas.
Color me nostalgic, but I long for the days when voters chose their politicians rather than today’s redistricting nonsense that lets politicians choose their voters. 
As for trying to sell Nebrasakans on the idea of hand counting ballots comes this bit of promotion from those championing the cause. “This petition simply codifies the most secure and publicly verifiable method of counting votes by prioritizing the manual counting of every ballot. We are setting a strong precedent that can be a trend setter for other states looking to restore public confidence in their election system.” 
Well, perhaps. Still, I’m at a loss as to how hand counting paper ballots adds to security and transparency. Or why another state would follow suit.
What we do know — or should — is that the science clearly indicates that counting by hand not only extends the time between the polls closing and the final tabulation, it increases the likelihood of errors. While hand counting may strike some as simple, it’s hardly a model of efficiency and accuracy given the science and current available technology. 
Aside from ceding efficacy and precision, exactly which Nebraskans — apart from the group trafficking the hand count and winner-take-all — are clamoring to restore public confidence in our election system? While we’re at it, maybe somebody could give us the details of any recent or former fraud that may have skewed an election outcome or sullied the state’s reputation as a place that conducts and embraces fair, free and unencumbered elections. We’ll wait. 
Nor are mechanical vote tabulators some cog in a nefarious, AI-inspired rise of the electoral machines. The U.S. Election Assistance Commission requires each machine to count 10 million ballots without an error. When reviewing hand counts to the work of the machines, the commission showed that, especially when faced with large numbers of ballots, human errors can reach 25 percent.
Finally, hand counting costs more than machine tabulations. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, Shasta County in northern California estimated that if it used hand counting to tabulate its 100,000-plus votes, it would cost taxpayers $1.6 million, use 1,200 additional staff and take 18 days, not counting any redos because of errors.
Everyone wants secure, accurate and timely election results. A campaign to add a couple of new, old ideas to the Nebraska Constitution does nothing to further that goal.

As the days grow shorter and autumn settles in, it’s a good time to shine a light on a topic that can feel mysterious: your credit score. For many, credit can feel confusing or even intimidating, but understanding how it works and why it matters can be an important step toward strengthening your financial health journey.
How Your Credit Score Impacts Your Financial Journey
Your credit score is a three-digit number used by lenders, landlords, insurance companies, mobile phone providers, and financial institutions to assess your reliability. A higher score can help you qualify for lower interest rates and better loan terms, saving you money in interest and making it easier to achieve major financial goals such as buying a home or car.
Establishing good credit means building a record of responsible usage. Using your credit card and paying your bill on time demonstrates financial responsibility to lenders. On the other hand, missing payment deadlines or not meeting the minimum amount due can negatively impact your score.
Understanding the Factors Behind Your Credit Score
Credit scores typically range from 300 to 850. The better your score, the more options you may have with lenders. Here’s what usually influences your score:

Payment History: Consistently paying bills on time has a positive impact, while late or missed payments can lower your score.
Credit Utilization: Using a smaller portion of your total available credit is better for your score; high balances relative to your total credit limits can be a negative factor.
Total Debt: Lower overall debt is viewed more favorably, while carrying high debt can reduce your score.
Types of Credit Accounts: Having a mix of credit accounts, such as credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages, can strengthen your score.
Length of Credit History: A longer track record of responsible credit use contributes positively to your score.
Recent Credit Applications: Applying for new credit  can temporarily lower your score.
Credit Inquiries. Soft inquiries, like checking your own credit or receiving pre-approved offers, don’t affect your score. Hard inquiries, such as applying for a loan or credit card, may lower your score slightly, but the impact fades over time and drops off your report after two years.

If your credit score is on the lower end, don’t worry—there are steps you can take to help improve it.
Credit Smart Habits for

Pay your bills on time. Payment history is an important factor when it comes to calculating your credit score. If you struggle with meeting payment deadlines, consider setting reminders or enrolling in autopay.
Pay down your debt. Your credit utilization—meaning the size of your card balance—is the second biggest factor in most credit scoring models. Create a plan to pay down high-interest debt first.

According to the Right, schools and colleges are hotbeds of anti-American degeneracy propagated by teachers hell bent on indoctrinating the young into evil opinions and all manner of weirdness, thus hastening the nation’s descent into the kind of depravity that spurs atrocities such as painting rainbow crosswalks, wearing inflatable frog suits, and flying upside-down American flags at “No Kings” marches.
Y’all clutching those pearls yet? 
The very people always telling us to “do your own research” don’t really want you to do your own research, unless they get to pick the sources.
They don’t want you to listen to people who’ve spent years and years in universities and labs, no academically rigorous studies, no evidence-based information, no verifiable facts.
Who needs expertise?  
Florida, you will not be surprised to hear, is a model for the nation, walking backward into the future.
Rep. Tom Fabricio (R-Miami Lakes) has filed a bill demanding classroom teachers take an oath to uphold the constitutions of Florida and the United States and promise to conduct themselves “in a professional, independent, objective, and nonpartisan manner.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThey would swear “that I will uphold the highest standards of academic integrity and professional ethics; that I will foster a respectful learning environment for all students, which promotes critical thinking, civic responsibility, and lifelong learning; and that I will serve as a positive role model in both conduct and character, so help me God.” 
Couple of issues with this: 1. Classroom teachers already sign an oath to uphold both constitutions; 2. Would this new oath also apply to teachers at schools that take taxpayer-funded vouchers?
What if some school board or some parent decides a class on evolution is “partisan” because most Democrats will tell you the earth is older than 6,000 years?
Anti-science silliness has long been part of Florida’s brand. We’ve attacked evolution and championed teaching Creationism and “Intelligent Design.”
As for the “positive role model in both conduct and character” stuff, who gets to say what that means?
Do evangelicals accept that a gay teacher can be a “positive role model”? What about a teacher who posts something the DeSantis administration doesn’t like on her private social media?
At least three K-12 teachers have been fired for something they said about Charlie Kirk, the ultra-conservative campus activist who was murdered last month.
University professors have also lost their jobs or been sanctioned, often for quoting Kirk’s own words.
He’s the one who said it was “worth it to have a cost of — unfortunately — some gun deaths every single year” in order to preserve the Second Amendment. 
Swearing oaths
You know that Constitution thing? The one teachers (and politicians, lawyers, etc.) swear to uphold? It guarantees all of us the right to free expression, even if it upsets the government. 
But the DeSantis administration seems happy to trash that pesky First Amendment whenever they feel like it, forbidding educators to discuss systemic racism — no learning about redlining, unequal access to justice, Jim Crow, habitual dumping of toxic waste in minority communities, or denying Black veterans access to GI Bill benefits — policing college course descriptions for naughty words such as “gender” and “decolonize,” or hyperventilating over the possibility sex mightnight be mentioned in the classroom.
They’re also happy to trash the Establishment Clause.
To be fair, Florida hasn’t gone quite as demented as Texas, where a state-sponsored (though not officially required) curriculum is basically Bible study. 
But given Florida wants to be Texas when it grows up, this might be what we have to look forward to.
A law passed last year allows “volunteer chaplains” in schools. Counselors and psychologists cost money; the district doesn’t have to pay some unlicensed, untrained rando preacher with time on his hands.
So far, few school systems have taken the state up on its offer to install a member of the God Squad in taxpayer-funded institutions.
Hernando County, however, has taken the plunge with the Rev. Jack Martin, a failed Republican congressional candidate and member of the “Black Robe Regiment,” an outfit dedicated to demolishing the wall between Church and State.
Martin has called for President Barack Obama to be arrested and thinks public schools force kids “to believe stuff they shouldn’t.”
He’s also written a song in praise of the “martyr” Charlie Kirk.
Blackmail
This is on-brand for Florida, where school vouchers are intended to destroy public education, and universities are threatened with financial penalties if they hire the wrong professors or teach the wrong things.
To demonstrate who’s boss, Rep. Kevin Steele, R-Dade City, a backbencher clearly looking to grab a little publicity, has filed a bill that would force all 40 Florida colleges and universities to name streets after Charlie Kirk.
The bill even specifies exactly which streets: Chieftain Way at FSU, Stadium Road at UF, and West Osceola at FAMU, to name but a few.
If the streets don’t get renamed, colleges and universities will be defunded.
Yet again: issues.

 This is yet another in the long series of governmental attacks on university autonomy and may have constitutional problems, too. As one UF grad student with a law degree, herself a Kirk fan and member of Turning Points USA, said, it “raises a huge red flag.”
 Students across the state are largely opposed. A computer science major at UF pointed out Kirk “wasn’t some civil rights activist,” but went around “actively spewing hatred.”

Tina Meyaart, a student in Communications at FSU, called it “grossly disrespectful,” especially since Kirk was pro-gun and the person charged with the mass shooting at Florida State was allegedly a member of Kirk’s TPUSA.

There is no West Osceola at FAMU. That street was renamed Rudy Hubbard Way earlier this year.  

Is the Legislature really going to force the nation’s premier Black public university to ditch the name of a road honoring the Hall of Fame football coach who led the Rattlers to two Black College National Championships in favor of a guy who once called the Civil Rights Act “a huge mistake,” among other offensive comments?
This is Florida. The answer may end up being yes.
Slash and burn
President Donald Trump’s slash-and-burn policies have cost Florida universities millions in research money. As of May, FSU had lost $53 million in grants from the National Science Foundation, USAID, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Department of Agriculture, and others.
At USF, EPA grants that would have allowed the university to bring scientific solutions to contaminated water in poor communities got axed.
FAMU lost $4.9 million that would have promoted climate-friendly hemp growing. USDA called the program “far-left.”
Ron DeSantis has not said one word in defense of Florida’s colleges and universities.
Why would he? His administration despises education in general and higher education in particular.
It’s obvious why: The more you know, the less gullible you are, the more willing to question authority, the more able to imagine and empathize with the lives of people who aren’t like you.

We’ve ignored this growing problem for too long.,"In his recent essay in CT Mirror, Melvin Medina asked: whose voices matter to Connecticut policymakers when we talk about housing? I hope it’s clear to anyone listening that the voices of those who need affordable, accessible, and safe housing are being drowned out by what Mel calls the “No-Growth, No-Opportunity Coalition.”
Connecticut once welcomed newcomers, young families, and growing businesses as essential to our civic and economic life. My own family benefited from growth-friendly policies in 1971, when my young parents were able to buy a small ranch-style home in Waterbury to raise their growing family. I want my kids to have the same opportunities in Connecticut, but that’s unlikely if we keep ignoring what young people are telling us.
Still, I feel a shift. Have you noticed it too? Connecticut’s foundations are shifting. Too many young people don’t see a future for them in Connecticut. We’ve ignored this growing problem for too long. Like so many of life’s challenges, the longer we delay facing our housing affordability crisis, the harder it becomes to solve. It’s simply too expensive to afford a home in Connecticut, and the consequences of denial are becoming more severe.
I work in housing policy, and I hear heartbreaking stories every day from people struggling to find or keep a home. But something unusual is happening more often — maybe it’s happening to you, too. More and more people in my personal life are sharing how Connecticut’s housing problems — high costs, limited options, aging and unsafe homes — are making their lives less secure, less affordable, and less successful.
Here are three stories I’ve heard recently from people who didn’t know I work in housing policy:

A family fears eviction without cause if they ask their landlord to make necessary repairs. They choose not to ask and instead try to fix the problems themselves. They know how difficult, if not impossible, it would be to find another affordable rental home in their school district. They want their son to stay with the friends and teachers he loves.
A young man who recently sold my daughter a car wishes he could live closer to his job and family in Fairfield County. He endures a long commute from the Naugatuck Valley because he and his wife can’t afford to rent closer to work. Now, they’re considering a larger apartment even farther away to make room for a future family. What he really wants is to buy a home but that feels impossible.
A young dental hygienist is frustrated that she still lives with her parents, despite avoiding student loan debt and working multiple jobs in her field for years. Her advice to young graduates is practical but disheartening: move out of state.

Connecticut’s housing shortage is reshaping people’s life choices. It’s weakening our families and our economy like rot in a home’s foundation that, left untreated, spreads through the structure. What was once a limited and solvable problem is now systemic, demanding immediate and serious intervention.
Yet, our local and state leaders have not been united to address the crisis. Too many local officials remain obstacles to progress, letting those voices of NO dictate a less vibrant future for Connecticut. We’re still waiting for the promised special session from the Connecticut General Assembly and Governor Lamont after the governor’s veto of a comprehensive housing bill in June.
When it comes to housing, the status quo isn’t working. Building homes is harder and more expensive than ever. Public policy can’t fix everything, but the state must do what it can. We need our leaders to share the urgency that this crisis has brought to so many of our neighbors and pass meaningful reforms.
Legislators and Governor Lamont: please return to the Capitol, meet in special session, and begin the hard work of rebuilding the foundation of housing affordability and stability for the people of Connecticut.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 04:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,No candy in elementary school? No smartphones in high school,Emily Bauer,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/no-candy-in-elementary-school-no-smartphones-in-high-school/,High schoolers should be restricted from using cell phones in the classroom the same way we limit candy in elementary school.,"It is a melancholy mission for those who walk the cafeterias of our great nation’s elementary schools to behold the tender children of the Republic, their lunch trays burdened with broccoli, their faces solemn, their spirits subdued. These young citizens, deprived of joy and simple pleasure, choke down baked chicken and steamed vegetables, while candy—sweet, radiant candy—lies banished, deemed too dangerous for their delicate constitutions.
I think it is agreed that this deplorable situation must be remedied, and that children should be allowed, nay entitled, to select candy as a legitimate option for lunch.
I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my thoughts on this most righteous addition, which I expect will not be subject to the least objection.
The Proposal
Every elementary school shall be required to offer candy as a regular, state and local board of education-approved lunch option, equal in standing to the turkey sandwich, the whole grain vegan wrap, or bagel with butter option. Elementary-aged children, upon entering the cafeteria, may exercise their unalienable rights to freedom of choice by selecting as part of their school lunch from a variety of tantalizing confection offerings—candy bars, jellybeans, gummy bears, and, for the health-conscious, dark chocolate (70% cacao minimum).
The Advantages of This Scheme

Cultivation of Moral CharacterThough candy is known to be addictive and nearly impossible to resist, the opportunity to abstain builds character and virtue. What better way to teach self-control than to place temptation directly in reach of a four to eleven- year-old? It is by confronting vice that true grit and character is forged.
Rewarding Good ChildrenWe must remember that these are “good children,” raised on parental and societal affirmations steeped in sound nutrition. Surely being model, mini-adults entitles them to the option—if not the necessity—of choice. Denying candy is an unspeakably paternalistic insult to their moral worth and conception of self-worth.
Therapeutic Benefit for the Candy-DependentFor those unfortunate youths already succumbed to candy addiction, this policy will serve as exposure therapy and fulfil the school’s obligation to grow and train such children emotionally. Permitting access to known weaknesses, those children will surely develop the strength to overcome temptation and addiction, as is the case with some. History has shown this method to be universally successful, at least according to social media posts and comments.
Minimal Collateral DamageNow, some have raised the alarm that permitting candy at lunch will unleash scenes of ungovernable frenzy — that the halls shall echo with the delirious laughter of sugar-maddened youth, that teachers shall cower behind their Chromebooks as children overturn desks and rend the very Smartboards from the walls. These apprehensions, though charming in their naïveté, are founded upon nothing more substantial than hysteria. For if any parent objects, let them simply instruct their own offspring to abstain from such sugary indulgence, and further, to remove themselves from the presence of any classmate who dares to partake. Surely this modest act of self-segregation will present no difficulty to the progeny of those noble families still guided by “old-fashioned” principles — those steadfast souls who raise their children as though it were still the era of rotary telephones and VCRs. 
Physiological SuitabilityEveryone knows that children have famously fast metabolisms. Their small bodies burn sugar with the intensity of a ravenous tiger. Thus, the consumption of candy as an occasional main or even side dish at lunch would serve to merely sustain their natural energy levels, preventing that tragically familiar afternoon fatigue.
Emergency PreparednessSignificantly, in an age where schools must be vigilant against all manner of threats—from weather events to escaped wildlife roaming the halls—it is only prudent to ensure our children are equipped. Candy offered at lunch, being light, portable, and high in caloric content, can be safely stored in a child’s pocket in the case of such an emergency. 
Dental Concerns Grossly ExaggeratedSome nervous Nellies warn that candy will rot the children’s teeth. But such fears are misplaced. Parents may simply instruct their children not to eat candy at home and to brush their teeth while at home instead. In this way, schools promote freedom and sweetness, while the parents maintain oral hygiene and stricter rules in the privacy of their own homes. Truly, a perfect balance of liberty and responsibility.
Parental SovereigntyTo deny a parent’s right to send their child to school that offers an option of candy at lunch is to deny the very foundation of liberty. What next—will the school prohibit their smart devices? I shudder to think what tyranny lies ahead of that slippery slope.
Culinary ExcellenceCandy, unlike the mundane meat and sides currently served, is delicious. The human palate evolved to crave pleasure, and to deprive a child of this natural delight is both cruel and unusually contrary to nature.
Preparation for AdulthoodLastly, we must recognize that children will have access to candy for the rest of their lives. It is better that they now learn, while under the supervision of the public school system, to make wise dietary choices. After all, a well-timed sugar crash in third grade may prevent far greater misjudgments in college.

Conclusion
I must profess in all sincerity to a personal interest in promoting this necessary reform, having observed my young citizen and her comrades clearly benefit academically and social-emotionally from a deliberative fill-up on candy goodness during school hours, even though it is not presently permitted. Though, I must also confess to holding a modest amount of stock in a local candy shop near a local elementary.
I merely offer this proposal for the good of the children of the nation, in the hopes that one day our children may roam the cafeterias free, joyful, and sticky-fingered, munching on chocolate with teeth to which gobs of sugared crystals from lollypops are affixed, beneath the watchful eye of liberty herself.
Reader – If you cannot support allowing elementary students the option of candy at school despite all the reasons above, then by precisely the same logic, you should oppose allowing high school students to access personal smart devices during school hours.

Starting Nov. 1, New Mexico will offer free child care to every family in the state. There will be no fees to pay and no income limits to sign up, according to the Early Childhood Education and Care Department.
State leaders and newspapers across the country claim it as the first universal child care paid for by a state.
People who support the program say it will help parents keep their jobs, give child care workers better pay, and make the economy stronger — adding it will also help the state’s youngest children who get the care.
“The well-being of kids is tied to the well-being of the adults in their lives,” said Dr. Philip Fisher, a professor of early childhood at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Education and director of the Stanford Center on Early Childhood. “And adults’ well-being depends on their economic circumstances.”
But there’s a problem. New Mexico might not have enough child care centers to actually take care of all the children whose families want help. There simply aren’t enough spots available, especially for babies and families living out in smaller towns.
The state has gradually helped more families with child care assistance since 2019. By 2023, families making 400% of the federal poverty level were able to get help, opening the program to more middle- and higher-income families.
Right now, about 27,000 children across the state get child care, according to the Legislative Finance Committee’s 2025 Accountability Report on Early Childhood. Officials think another 12,000 children will join the program when it becomes universal.
But the committee found, as of this year prior to the new subsidy going into effect, there were only enough openings for about one out of every three babies under age two. The shortage was even worse in rural counties where almost no licensed infant care exists.
The number of child care spots dropped by 3% between 2019 and 2023. That’s mostly because the number of people providing child care in their homes dropped by half, according to data from the Cradle to Career Policy Institute at the University of New Mexico. Most of the drop was in unlicensed home-based care—places that were simply registered as providers.
Not counting those home providers that closed, the numbers would show more licensed child care centers, which have higher quality ratings from the state. But home-based providers are more likely to offer care at night or in a family’s native language. With so many of them gone, families who work night shifts or want someone who speaks their language may have a harder time finding the right fit, according to the institute. It’s worth noting that the share of assistance going to families at or below the poverty line fell by nearly 3% between 2019 and 2023.
State officials know there are not enough child care options and have announced a $12.7 million fund that offers low-interest loans to build new centers or fix up old ones. They plan to ask lawmakers for another $20 million. The growth will focus on care for babies and toddlers, low-income families, and children with special needs. The state is also working with businesses and schools to open more locations and is trying to recruit new people to run child care in their homes.
To keep workers, state officials plan to pay child care centers more money so they can cover their real costs. Programs that pay staff at least $18 an hour and stay open 10 hours a day, five days a week will qualify for incentive rates.The state plans to boost child care in underserved communities by making sure workers get fair pay and by using data to make smart choices, said Elizabeth Groginsky, secretary of the Early Childhood Education and Care Department.
Fair wages can help child care workers think of early education as a real career instead of just a temporary job. That means they can build lasting relationships with the children and families they serve, Groginsky said. “We use data to drive our decisions. We just completed a supply-and-demand study with interactive maps showing which parts of the state have the largest gaps. That will guide how we fund applications through the new loan program.”
Even with those plans, questions remain about who will benefit most and how much difference the system will make for children.
While supporters say universal child care is a win for families and the economy, Republican lawmakers argue that removing income limits means taxpayers will now help pay for child care for wealthy families.
Legislative Finance Committee analysts have also questioned the program’s impact on learning. Their 2025 report found that while child care meets an essential need for working families, it does not have the same effect on kindergarten readiness as public pre-kindergarten programs.
But Fisher said the benefits go beyond teaching ABCs and 123s.
Stable, predictable, caring relationships are the foundation of healthy learning and development, he said. That matters more than exposing young children to math or reading skills that they will pick up anyway once they start school.
Healthy child development has more to do with relationships than what kind of child care you use, he said.
“There is not like a prevailing amount of evidence that having a child in a kinder care situation is going to lead the child to be a college graduate [versus] having them cared for by the lady down the street or in your apartment complex is going to lead them to end up, you know, incarcerated,” Fisher said.
Fisher also questioned whether the market alone can give families what they need.
“It’s a broken market,” he said. Parents can’t afford what high-quality care actually costs, employers don’t usually help cover it, and providers often don’t make enough to live on.
When adults are stressed about money, he said, it directly affects children.
“It’s easy to imagine that if you’re an adult who’s taking care of a young child, that if you yourself are worried about not having enough food for you to feed your family, or you’re skipping meals so you can feed the children, or you’re worried about eviction, or you can’t pay for health care, that those things weigh on you and that they take away from your ability to really buffer your child from what’s going on around them,” he said.
Groginsky said the stakes are high.
“The first five years is the fastest period of human development, with over a million new brain connections per second in a baby’s brain,” she said in an interview. “It’s those responsive, nurturing relationships that drive positive outcomes.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EarlyChildhood-2048x1454-1-1024x727.jpeg,,,2025-10-26 18:00:29.351725

(Photo by Mark Mirko/Connecticut Public)Connecticut, along with the rest of New England, has long recognized that its energy future lies in cleaning up the electricity sources in its power grid.
And since the 1990s, with the start of the effort to close the “sooty six” coal and oil plants, cleaning up the air for health and climate reasons has figured equally with saving money by using free renewable sources like sun and wind.
The Trump administration has now made that a lot harder, if not impossible, to do, leaving Connecticut and the entire region with the question: Now what?
Since his first day in office, Trump has set about eliminating future development of onshore and offshore wind on federal property, which effectively means all offshore wind, a form of renewable power Trump openly despises. So far, his administration has issued stop-work orders for two northeast offshore wind installations already under construction, including one for Connecticut. Each resumed construction after about a month, losing millions of dollars in the process.

Trump has also succeeded getting a law on the books to end the widely popular and effective federal tax credits for wind, solar and energy efficiency projects. The administration also threw its weight behind keeping old and dirty coal plants operating longer than previously planned, as well as subsidizing more coal mining. And it is ramping up oil and gas drilling, all in the name of an “energy emergency” that Trump claims exists, even though the country is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.
“Singling out and disfavoring renewable resources while many other resources continue to enjoy favorable tax treatment, including fossil resources — this is not leveling the playing field. This is definitely putting a finger on the scale to disadvantage clean renewable energy resources,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. She called the end of the tax credit “really challenging,” noting the state had a pipeline of projects it had hoped to bring forward, and warned that power prices would likely increase.
“We are doing what we can within our state jurisdictional programs to try to fill in some of the gaps. Obviously, we can’t fill all the gaps,” Dykes said. The state is urging residents, businesses, governmental entities and energy developers to take advantage of the tax credits before many of them disappear at the end of the year. To that end, DEEP issued an expedited request for proposals for solar and onshore wind. Proposals were due Oct. 10. Energy efficiency, especially useful to lower income and environmental justice communities, may feel the impact most acutely.
But it is offshore wind and the massive amount of carbon-free power it can generate, that Connecticut, and really the entire Northeast, had been counting on.
DEEP must sort through all of this uncertainty as it devises its new Integrated Resource Plan, a 10-year look ahead at energy needs and how to meet them, in keeping with the energy and climate policies the state has in place.
But in addition to the federal government’s energy policies, DEEP now has to reckon with the administration’s tariffs, policies on imported critical minerals, supply chain concerns and environmental about-faces. And it risks the potential for retribution if the state defies Trump’s wishes on anything, not just climate policy.
“We are undertaking planning efforts that are intended to try to assess as best we can what some of the different future scenarios will look like in terms of electricity needs, but also climate planning, and to do our best to identify the types of investments that might make sense, on what time horizon, given the change in the federal landscape, but also demand growth and reliability needs and so on,” Dykes said.










The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated.

Dan Dolan is also thinking about what to do now. He’s president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade organization that represents about 95% of the generating capacity in the region.
“Where we stand right now is this muddled middle period,” he said.
Demand isn’t rising quite as fast as anticipated due to the impacts of solar and energy efficiency on the grid. But there’s also uncertainty about whether that trend will continue without tax credits and whether planned large power source additions will come online on time or at all.
“In terms of new supply sources, I am not seeing meaningful, large-scale new developments happening anytime soon in the region,” Dolan said. “If demand continues to be more muted in its growth, we can handle that.“
But he said if demand does go up significantly, despite individual state commitments to transition from fossil fuel power sources to clean and renewable ones, the region might have to look at keeping older, dirtier power sources operating for longer than planned, and that might mean spending more than a little money to upgrade them.
“I’m seeing a lot of investors watching but staying on the sidelines for the moment,” Dolan said.
Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, is co-chair of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. He has been a member of the committee since entering the legislature in 2011, so he has seen the twists, turns and growing pains as the state endeavored to create and implement its first short- and long-term strategies toward renewable energy while addressing climate change, health of citizens and high energy rates.
“We had, in our procurement planning and our capacity analysis, obviously — in conjunction with (grid operator) ISO-New England — counted on the availability of renewable energy sources to meet our needs,” he said. With the federal government now undermining those supply plans, “That is now a crisis that might have been 10 years away. It is now moving closer and closer to being an actual, impending crisis.
“We’re really low on options, but renewables were a critical part of that picture going forward.”

The NECEC transmission line from Canada through Maine will provide 1,200 megawatts of renewable hydroelectric power to Massachusetts, which will benefit the whole New England power grid. (Photo courtesy of Iberdrola)After many years of delay, a transmission line for hydropower from Canada — the Northeast Clean Energy Connect, NECEC — is months from completion. The power is being purchased by Massachusetts, but it provides a relief valve for the entire New England grid. Breath-holding is underway that the Trump administration will not sabotage it, given the administration’s fraught relationship with Canada as well as the blue-state northeast.
If that and the two offshore wind projects under construction off New England are finished, Dykes said, it will add about 13% of supply.
But any offshore wind beyond that, including projects approved by the Biden administration? ‘Unlikely’ would be a generous assessment of its future.
 How dead is offshore wind?

Offshore wind was the big prize. At the end of the Biden administration, 11 projects had been approved nationally that would have provided the power equivalent of nearly 10 Millstone power stations and gotten the U.S. about two-thirds of the way to the Biden goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.
Today, five are under construction. A sixth, South Fork Wind off the eastern tip of Long Island, is completed and began operating about a year ago. The remaining five have been stopped either at early stages or through efforts by the Trump administration to review or outright rescind already-issued federal permits. The administration ended all new lease-area designations and permits.

Of the two under construction that faced stop-work orders, one is Revolution Wind, a joint Connecticut and Rhode Island project that is already 80% complete. While it and the other project — New York’s Empire Wind — have restarted, it’s unclear what might happen to the other three. In the case of Revolution, a legal dispute is still underway.
“I think there’s no question that East Coast states, particularly from the mid-Atlantic up, have to continue to fight for offshore wind,” said Elizabeth Klein, who served as the final Biden administration director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, the entity within the Interior Department responsible for offshore wind.
“There’s no question that what the current administration is doing is damaging to the industry and causing a great deal of harm,” she said. “The looming question is whether or not these companies who are involved will be able to essentially wait it out and invest their time and resources in parts of developing offshore wind that aren’t directly about getting permits and approvals to move forward with new projects.”
Ørsted, the company developing Revolution Wind and other projects, declined to comment on the situation. Avangrid, the company developing Vineyard Wind 1, the only other New England project under construction, did not respond to inquiries.
Klein said the Trump administration claim that it was concerned about national security issues with Revolution Wind is “specious.” She said national security is reviewed in conjunction with several departments throughout every stage of the offshore wind process, beginning with the basic identification of offshore areas that might be suitable for leasing.
“All of those things are considered throughout the process, starting with where these sales first take place,” she said. “This is arbitrary and capricious decision-making. There’s no evidence that there’s something new or unusual or that had not been considered.”
Trump himself has circulated a host of falsehoods about offshore wind — that it causes cancer and kills an outsized number of birds and whales, and that it only runs some of the time. Offshore wind is a technology that is a quarter-of-a-century old, during which time it has operated successfully in Europe. Onshore wind is far older.
A one-year assessment of South Fork Wind by its developer, Ørsted, showed the turbines operated every month of the year. The data, which came from U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration, EIA, showed some of South Fork’s highest outputs were during the winter, when the power is needed most, due to natural gas being used for heating as well electricity. The wind power can prevent electricity price spikes.
https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js
The company also found the turbine foundations were already operating as artificial reefs that supported marine life.
The waters off the northeast U.S. are considered among the country’s best for offshore wind, given the area’s wind speeds and other factors. And since the region doesn’t have any fossil fuel resources, even with steep up-front costs, offshore wind is likely to quickly become cost effective, given the fuel is free.
A recent analysis by Politico of EIA data showed that adding wind and solar to the electricity mix tended to lower the cost of electricity, not increase it, as the Trump administration claims. The Politico analysis said: “Among the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices in June, according to EIA data.”
“Undermining viable sources of energy is inconsistent with the objective of addressing an energy ‘emergency’ and will instead exacerbate energy supply challenges in the Northeast,” said Peter Shattuck, a director at Power Advisory LLC., a joint Canada/U.S.-based energy consultant. Shattuck also is an energy and grid expert with long experience in New England.
He said that, in something of a tarnished silver lining, the Trump blockage will give long-term projects such as transmission extra time to plan. But trying to strategize through all the Trump executive orders, other policy changes and legal battles is bound to make projects more expensive.
“It will likely raise the risk profile and risk premiums that are included in projects,” he said.
“The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated. In our view, it’s holding back a huge source of power that is so desperately needed,” said Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president of communications and external affairs for the educational nonprofit Oceantic, which supports marine renewable energy world-wide including offshore wind.
“The administration talks about an all-of-the-above energy strategy and unleashing American energy dominance. We advocate that offshore wind is a critical component to that strategy.” She said energy needs to be depoliticized so the market, not the government, can pick the winners and losers.
“They’re looking to take apart an entire industry that could support energy demand in the U.S., address national security issues actually, because there is nothing better from a national security perspective on energy supply than generating it yourself at home, here in the U.S.,” Klein said.
Those concerns are not lost on the region’s grid operator, ISO-New England, which released an uncharacteristically blunt warning a couple of days after work stopped on Revolution Wind.
“The ISO is expecting this project to come online and it is included in our analyses of near-term and future grid reliability. Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability,” the statement read. “Unpredictable risks and threats to resources —regardless of technology — that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” it continued.

The Revolution shutdown, along with the tax credit eliminations, unpredictability of Trump energy policies and mandates come just as the ISO was beginning its next 10-year energy forecast. The ISO has already said it expects demand to begin to increase after years of flat or even declining energy needs.
“I think in the short term we still expect to be OK, but it’s kind of in that longer-term and the uncertainty that’s brought into this that’s challenging from a grid planning standpoint,” said ISO spokesman Matt Kakley.
The ISO’s most recent estimates are that region’s annual electricity consumption will increase by about 11% over the next decade. On one hand, the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles and heat pumps could shrink that demand. On the other, their removal for solar systems and energy efficiency could increase it.
In addition to the offshore wind and the NECEC transmission line, the ISO is also expecting the six New England states to move ahead with their first joint development of transmission that, after more than a decade of delay, would finally get onshore wind from northern Maine onto the southern part of the New England grid.
Kakley said six proposals from four different developers were submitted by the Sept. 30 deadline.
Now there is the concern that the need for any federal signoffs could mean further delay, or worse.
Kakley said the ISO always deals with uncertainty when predicting power needs in the face of the complexities of long-term power and transmission projects. “This is a different sort of uncertainty than what we’ve seen,” he said. “We’re really looking at what we can do to enhance our ability to forecast and synthesize all the different factors that are coming in – adding resources, taking resources out, and seeing what that does to the region’s risk profile.”
 What about solar?

Solar’s outlook is a little squishier than offshore wind’s. Yes, the coveted 30% tax credits are slated to disappear — for purchased residential systems at the end of this year and in another year for leased and commercial ones.
But costs for solar have come down dramatically over time, making it one of the cheapest forms of power to purchase. It’s also the fastest to install. So it’s possible residential consumers and commercial investors will still consider it a cost effective option.
Another unknown factor is the effect of tariffs and other restrictions on imported components on that low price and availability, as well as to storage systems that can be paired with it.










Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us.


– Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport


New England has never been a hotbed for huge commercial installations the way the desert southwest and other parts of the country, with large sunny expanses, can be. But rooftop solar for homeowners and on municipal and commercial buildings still has huge potential in the region and can be extremely useful to grid reliability.
It is already more useful than the ISO ever imagined it would be. The ISO says it has prevented brownouts and worse on hot summer days with air conditioning cranked up around the region. It has sent spot market prices into negative territory, especially on sunny days when neither heat nor air conditioning is needed.
“I think there’s capital out there that’s willing to invest,” said DEEP Commissioner Dykes. “I think the question is, what’s the price of solar without federal support, and with tariffs, all these other things coming into play? How does that affect the cost benefit for investment, and how much can we bring those costs down?”
Dykes has a few ideas. One is to look into swapping out solar panels in older systems for new, more efficient panels as a means to increase power output. Another is to use — in her words — already disturbed sites, such as the site of a retired oil-fired generator, for grid-scale storage for excess solar power. Using a preexisting power site would mean there’s already connections to the distribution system.

The biggest open question for Connecticut is what might change in state policy to help make up for the lost tax credit. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority will be weighing that as part of its reconsideration of the rules for the solar program it established. That reconsideration was already planned and underway, with recommendations due in March.
Another policy aspect involves what the state might do legislatively. Unlike most of its neighbors, Connecticut has kept caps on the amount of solar allowed, only loosening some of them in the last few years.
It’s also an open question whether state money would be authorized to make up some of the tax credit shortfall, or whether the state might do as Canada already does and establish an infrastructure bank to leverage private and public money into the financing pipeline, or create a Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator like California recently enacted to access low-cost public financing for such projects as a way to save money overall. The northeast-based advocacy group Acadia Center is helping the six New England states explore financing models.
“My only priority for next session is to set the stage for some extension or enhancement of our solar incentives,” said energy co-chair Steinberg. “This is very important to me as the godfather of solar, as Katie Dykes once called me, and that will be very hard.
“Everybody says it’s over; federal government has killed solar, game over, there’s nothing Connecticut can do. I cannot accept that,” he said. “Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us. To abandon it and not offer any incentives, or to backtrack to the point where the incentives don’t stimulate actual implementation — shame on us.”

But there are other ways to indirectly reduce costs for solar; specifically by streamling permitting, the regulatory process and siting – soft costs, as they are sometimes called.
Massachusetts is already doing that.
“We’re going to have to throw everything we can at permitting, streamlining and reducing soft costs in order to support the affordability of more solar investment for grid-scale projects,” Dykes said.
Kat Burnham, senior principal at the consulting and policy group Advanced Energy United and the state lead for all three southern New England states, said Connecticut and other states need to step up and put some financial skin as well as policy in the game. She pointed to financial tools like the Green Bank.
“I think what’s important is to make sure that we’re looking at a range of different options and trying to find the right one that fits the particular need or situation,” she said. “What are the tools in our kit, and how do we use those so that we minimize our risk?”
She said there’s a cost to building things. And she said there’s “a cost to inaction … We can’t just sit on our hands and hope for the best.”
DEEP is also in the final throes of accepting bids for innovative energy efficiency and energy upgrade proposals designed to help lower energy bills.
In Massachusetts, for instance, all three major utilities — one of which is Eversource — have agreed to discount electric rates in the winter for people who use heat pumps. While they run on electricity, aside from being efficient, they free up other fuels like natural gas to run power plants. In Connecticut, DEEP is continuing with its focus of lowering the upfront installation costs for heat pumps.
 Solutions

Barbara Kates-Garnick, a former Massachusetts energy official, now a professor of practice at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, said the path forward she sees is bringing together utilities, regulators, policy makers, other stakeholders and system participants to explore some of the out-of-the-box solutions.
“The answers aren’t clear, but I think we have to look at how we regulate, what we regulate, and come to some conversations with the utilities so that we come to a bigger grand bargain,” she said.
She noted, however, the Biden idea of promoting clean energy by providing incentives, funding and jobs — especially in red states — “when push comes to shove, it didn’t work.”
Dykes is not ruling out increasing fossil fuel-run power as part of Connecticut’s solution to the Trump anti-renewables effort.
“It’s a possibility,” she said, noting that Lamont has talked about the need to be open to natural gas as part of a solution.
If the offshore wind and other projects do not come online, she said, “that will certainly put us into a very challenging place in terms of having an adequate reserve margin and ability to maintain reliability even under some normal weather conditions.
“In light of that, we have to consider what are the alternatives that make the most sense to ensure we can continue to have an affordable, reliable grid in the early 2030s, and natural gas is part of that. Retaining those oil units — is that a solution that we’ll have to rely on?” Dykes said.
Dolan of the Power Generators Association, while also advocating continued use of the region’s gas and oil fleet, doesn’t have specific facilities he’d like to see targeted for reinvestment.
“I think there needs to be a refocus around the meat and potatoes about what is operating today and making sure it continues to operate tomorrow. Now the replacement energy supplies are not coming or not coming anytime soon, and for these power plants to be able to continue operating and operating at higher capacity, reinvestment is going to be necessary,” Dolan said, taking a thinly-veiled swipe at Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which all plan to have net-zero grids in the next 20 to 25 years.
For offshore wind proponents, it’s a rebuilding and refocusing period for the industry, said Oceantic’s Francoeur, who added that more than 100 turbine foundations and towers had been installed in the active offshore wind projects since construction season opened in May.
“The industry is going to weather this administration. Who knows what the next will bring,” she said. “But I think it won’t be the orderly advancement that it once could have been.”
Former BOEM Director Klein said she thinks it’s important for states to keep supporting the offshore wind projects that are underway.
“It’ll demonstrate to the project developers that there are important entities in the U.S. that are still supportive and want to find a path forward,” she said. “Folks aren’t building this for kicks, because it’s fun. This is about actual energy supply needs … and actually communities, when presented with alternatives, are likely to see that offshore wind is the best of the bunch.”
In the meantime, some of the wind focus may shift to Canada, where the provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador are exploring the development of huge amounts of offshore and onshore wind. Whether New England will be able to access some of that is years and likely many diplomatic twists away.
The Trump administration’s pivot away from wind and solar in particular and back toward fossil fuels is already taking the U.S. globally out of step. Recent data from the European clean energy think tank, data and policy tracker Ember showed that worldwide, in the first six months of 2025, renewables overtook coal power for the first time. And it showed that the growth in solar and wind power outpaced the growth of demand in the same time period. But while fossil fuel generation and its emissions dropped in China and India, the world’s most populated countries, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased in the U.S. Clean generation growth did not keep pace with demand growth in the U.S.

“For a bunch of largely economic reasons, we do still think that solar and wind are going to out-compete fossil fuels,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, though she admitted the Trump actions are slowing down their adoption.
But she wondered whether the industry would be able to pivot enough in the face of multiple challenges to keep investors confident enough to continue.
“That, I guess, is the big question mark,” she said.
Dykes sees the same challenge.
“Investors need to know that after a multiyear permitting process, when you have a project that’s 80% constructed, that you can bring it online, sell your power and get your money back,” she said. “And if we can’t guarantee that in the Northeast or in the U.S. anymore, I think that affects the investment climate for all types of resources at a time when we can least afford to increase investor perception of risk.”
The energy committee’s Steinberg added a warning. “That’s an excuse to be paralyzed. That’s an excuse to basically throw up our hands and say, ‘we just have to wait out the feds,’” he said. “That’s going to mean that the ramping up stage is going to be even more complicated on the other side, assuming there is another side.”

Over the last several months, Nicholas Pierce’s work as an asylum, refugee and deportation defense lawyer on the Front Range has meant playing catch-up. The immigration policies and orders that seem to come on a near-daily basis from the federal government have been hard to keep up with.
In a recent interview, Pierce tried to make sense of the latest effort by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which activists said was called “Freaky Friday,” offering unaccompanied immigrant children cash to self deport, and potentially depriving them of the right to hearings. A local human services agency had reached out to him earlier in the day asking how it would impact the young immigrants in their care. 
He couldn’t answer. Instead he had to turn to others, including a contact at ICE, to figure it out.
“It is, in a lot of ways, much worse than what I had anticipated, much faster than I had anticipated,” Pierce said about the impact the president’s immigration crackdown has had on Colorado. “I was an immigration lawyer during the first Trump administration, and there was just a lot more checks and balances in the system.”

With about 400 cases on his plate through his Denver-based firm Amistad Law, Pierce said he’s seen firsthand how families and communities are being torn apart. He said many have had their legal statuses stripped away, through things like ending Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans — many of whom sought refuge in Colorado. Others, he said, have chosen to go into hiding for fear of being detained when appearing for their asylum interviews.
Pierce, who is a former U.S. Army Reserve service member and whose work receives state funding through the Colorado Refugee Support Program, is one of hundreds of Coloradans polled by CPR News and other outlets in the Colorado News Collaborative who have expressed either complete opposition to or frustration with some of the ways Trump has carried out his campaign promise to close the southern border and reduce the number of undocumented immigrants living in the country.

A small number we heard from say they support the president’s actions, calling them necessary to free up government resources for things like housing and Medicaid for citizens or protect the country from socialism. 
Since the beginning of the year, the Trump administration has increased immigration raids across U.S. cities, including in Colorado, escalated tactics like sending the National Guard to back up ICE in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and reversed Biden-era policies, including allowing arrests at schools and churches.
What Coloradans are saying about immigration
In the survey circulated by Colorado newsrooms, including CPR News, a majority of the nearly 400 respondents said that, even if they supported some of the president’s stated goals, they opposed some of the immigration enforcement tactics currently being used by federal agents. 
Specifically, Coloradans take issue with federal agents violating due process and not focusing on deporting the “worst of the worst” criminals. 

“I have no problem with deporting those convicted of felonies, but ambushing families is despicable,” said a woman in Grand Junction. 
“I am in favor of the overall goal, but I do take issue with some of the practices,” said a man from Broomfield. “Treat people as human beings, even if they are criminals.”
A man in Durango summarized it like a report card. He gave efforts to close the border an A+, deporting criminals a C-, visa restrictions a D-, the use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement an F and described the use of the National guard as illegal. He said Trump also failed in the area of “Politicalization.”
“Deport criminals not workers,” said a woman in Durango. ICE tactics like “unmarked cars, civilian clothes, refusal to identify themselves should be eliminated.”
“It’s a waste of time to deport people contributing to the economy,” said a man in Colorado Springs. “I’m more concerned with the affordability of housing and health care.”
“The response has been too extreme and brutal,” said a woman in Colorado Springs. “It targets too many law-abiding, legal, U.S. residents,: denying due process to detainees.”

Evergreen resident Norman Sherbert said he believed the president was carrying out what he promised to do when elected and correct the previous administration’s actions. 
“I’m not here to tell the government how to do their job,” Sherbert elaborated via email. “All I know is that 11 or 12 million illegal immigrants coming into our country, seeing pictures of the masses of people standing at our borders, and hearing of children without guardianship being used to gain entrance into the U.S. is not good policy. And, in the long run over the next generations, will have a deteriorating effect on our society and way of life.”  
Sherbert sees the administration’s extreme measures as a necessary way to right the situation with the limited time and resources it has. 
At a flea market in Colorado Springs on a recent weekend, JoAnn Antaya said she believed Trump wanted to help people during his first administration but doesn’t agree with the tactics being used today.
A German-born American who remembered how difficult it was to adjust to a new culture as a child, Antaya believes society has lost its compassion. 
“We do not care about our fellow man,” Antaya, 63, said. “So it’s easy to put a wall between here and Mexico because you know what? They have nothing to do with you. Heaven forbid if you should hand them a crust of bread. No, I’m not happy with my country.
“It’s like they’re not compromising. They’re not coming to a happy medium. They’re just combative. And that’s all it is: Argument, argument, argument.”

What the polls say about immigration concerns
Opinion polling suggests how Coloradans feel about immigration has a lot to do with where they live.
A poll from the Colorado Health Foundation released earlier this year looked at top issues facing Coloradans. It surveyed over 2,300 people across the state.
It found that “illegal immigration” was a major concern for about half of the residents surveyed, though the extent of the concern depended on where respondents lived, lower in urban areas (39 percent), versus suburban (58 percent) and rural (65 percent). 
Ninety percent of respondents on the Eastern Plains believe illegal immigration is a problem in Colorado compared to 46 percent in Denver metro.
On the flip side, 20 percent of all respondents said the mistreatment of immigrants was an “extremely serious” concern compared to 42 percent of respondents saying it was “not too serious.” 
Broken down by region, that concern fluctuated, with 44 percent of urban respondents saying mistreatment is extremely or very serious compared to 30 percent of suburban respondents and 23 percent of rural respondents.
“The regional, the urbanity and the partisanship seemed to really be driving how folks react to those problems and react differently to the two different framings that we tested,” said Lucia Del Puppo, senior vice president with the research firm that conducted the Pulse Poll.
CHF spokesperson Katie Peshek says Pulse Poll findings are shared with policymakers to help them understand the real issues residents are facing and prioritize those concerns.
“With a third of poll respondents pointing to government and politics as the state’s leading challenge, it’s clear that on issues like immigration, the cost of living and housing, Coloradans are ready for real action and solutions,” Peshek said.

Meanwhile, a national Gallup poll released this summer found that only 30 percent of Americans say immigration should be reduced, a position that has shrunk by fifteen points since last year.
But the support for stanching immigration largely falls along party lines, with the poll finding “Republicans are the only group still showing at least plurality support for reducing immigration.”
In a recent national poll of registered voters by the New York Times/Sienna, “51 percent said they thought the government was deporting mostly people who ‘should be deported,’ while 42 percent said the government was deporting the wrong people.”
That poll, too, found respondents wrestling with the administration’s aggressive tactics.
“More than half of voters, 53 percent, think the process of deporting people has not been fair; 44 percent said it was mostly fair,” according to The New York Times.
How Colorado leaders are responding to federal actions
Some Coloradans praised the work of elected officials to stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement. 
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has used his office’s powers to fight against federal immigration actions, from defending in-state tuition for noncitizen students to suing a sheriff’s deputy for involving ICE in a traffic stop that resulted in the detainment of a college student.
In the spring, state lawmakers passed a bill designed to protect undocumented immigrants from coming to the attention of federal authorities. And over the summer, Colorado’s Democratic members of Congress toured the state’s only immigration facility in Aurora, only to leave with more questions than answers.

Colorado governments are in danger of losing federal funds and the state is being sued by the federal government for so-called sanctuary policies, but Democratic leaders have so far resisted the administration’s pressure campaign, arguing immigration enforcement is not the state’s problem.
That doesn’t mean inter-agency coordination isn’t happening. Despite state laws strictly limiting when officials can cooperate with ICE requests, state agencies were found to have provided federal immigration officials with Coloradans’ personal information in response to subpoenas several times this year. Those actions by the Polis administration have riled fellow Democrats and immigration advocates.
Looking ahead
Even though state laws prohibit local law enforcement from helping federal agents, targeted immigration raids continue to take place across the state, including outside of metro regions. In the last couple of weeks, local news outlets have reported on an incident in Alamosa where ICE detained a family with a baby inside a vehicle at gunpoint, smashing a car window, and a situation in Routt County where a county commissioner was blocked by ICE vehicles.
For Pierce, it’s not just new policies that have made it difficult for him — or other lawyers — to do this job. He’s seen announcements of immigration court judges resigning or being fired, resulting in longer processing times for cases. Clients are also being transferred to detention facilities out of state, making it hard to connect with their legal counsel and putting them at risk of being deported within days. 
“So when it comes to hurting people, the system’s gotten a lot faster. When it’s come to helping people, the system’s gotten a lot slower,” he said.
The majority of Pierce’s cases involve Afghan men who fought alongside the U.S. military during the Afghanistan War and are now waiting to get legal residency. Most of them filed petitions in 2022 or 2023 but still don’t have a court date set. With the reimposition of the so-called Muslim ban by the Trump administration this summer, it has been difficult for them to be reunited with their families. Pierce says these policies betray a promise made by the U.S. government for fighting alongside its troops. 
The situation is leaving the men with two options: risk likely death to join their families back home or wait in the U.S, in the hope that their families will eventually be allowed to join them. 
It’s gotten so bad that Pierce has found himself for the first time ever advising people to seek asylum in Argentina or Chile. He’s even started to offer powers-of-attorney services so that family or friends with U.S. citizenship can take control of bank accounts and other assets if their loved ones are rapidly deported.
“I’ve dedicated my life to this, but the good legal advice has become, ‘Hide, or go somewhere else.’”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)It’s pumpkin season – from spiced lattes to Halloween decorations on the porch – and chances are it was grown in Illinois.
Just over a third of all pumpkins in the United States – 485 million pounds – come from Illinois, according to annual USDA surveys.
Much of that production centers on Morton, a village in Tazewell County that proudly calls itself the “Pumpkin Capital of the World.” About 85% of the world’s canned pumpkin is packed at the Nestlé/Libby’s plant in the middle of town.
Indiana ranks second in production, but Illinois grows roughly three times as many pumpkins, even after its production fell by 30% last year. That decline came even though the harvested acres remained steady; acreage had already dropped by nearly 18% in 2023 compared to the previous year.
Despite their hard exterior, pumpkins are highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions.
Depending on the location, farmers typically begin planting between late May and early July, allowing the pumpkins approximately four months to mature for a fall harvest.
A late spring frost can wipe out young plants before they have a chance to take root. At the same time, extreme summer heat can cause blossoms to fall before they are pollinated, according to a 2024 publication from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Excessive rainfall can also delay planting in spring or harvesting in autumn, and leave crops more vulnerable to disease.
According to USDA Economic Research Service data, Illinois not only leads the nation in pumpkin production acreage but also devotes most of its fields to processing varieties, the kind used in pies and canned filling.
Nearly 70% of Illinois’ pumpkin acres are dedicated to pie filling and other processing uses, compared with just 3% in Pennsylvania and even less in Washington, Indiana, and California. This focus helps explain why Illinois outpaces other states in both yield and price.
Other states are catching up, though. In 2024, New York, Wisconsin and Michigan reported the most significant gains, with production increasing by 49%, 43%, and 33%, respectively.

This story was originally reported by Mel Leonor Barclay and Jasmine Mithani of The 19th. Meet Mel  and Jasmine and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Nonprofits working to combat domestic violence and sexual assault have notched a string of legal wins as they push back against efforts by the Trump administration to put restrictions on work that goes against the administration’s views.
A series of lawsuits has, at least temporarily, blocked the administration from enforcing restrictions on millions of dollars of funding for upcoming grants and forced it to return grants it took away from some nonprofits working with LGBTQ+ victims.
Domestic violence groups and the broader network of gender-based violence nonprofits have been on high alert since the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders — followed by a temporary federal freeze in late January — to end federal funding for programs or organizations out of step with the administration’s ideology. The funding, advocates say, is essential to providing life-saving services to vulnerable victims, who are more likely to be women.

Through agency rules, the administration is actively trying to restrict the use of federal grants to fund what it calls “illegal” diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility activities and “gender ideology extremism.” It is also trying to restrict federal grants from organizations that in any way express support for abortion and that serve immigrants without permanent legal status in the country.
The restrictions go even further: Nonprofits that want to continue to receive federal funding from the Office on Violence Against Women, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, are not allowed to “frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”
Trump, who has been found liable for sexual assault, last month downplayed the seriousness of domestic violence crimes in a speech. “If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime,” Trump said.

The lawsuits

In June, 17 state-level coalitions that support victims of domestic and sexual violence, represented by Democracy Forward and the National Women’s Law Center, sued the administration over such restrictions on Violence Against Women Act grants awarded by the Justice Department. The following month, in a separate lawsuit filed by Democracy Forward, many of the same state coalitions sued over similar rules attached to grants from the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
In early August, Judge William Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from enforcing the new restrictions on Justice Department grants as the case progresses.
The judge agreed that the nonprofits face an impossible choice between accepting conditions that will harm the core services they provide or going without essential funding. The judge cited two examples: Complying with the rules would bar the organizations from providing the same quality of services to transgender victims and could also prevent organizations counseling victims from doing anything other than calling law enforcement.
“These examples are simply two of many activities that the coalitions engage in that they reasonably fear will now subject them to loss of grant funding,” Smith wrote. “The Office’s assurances that … the office will be reasonable in its interpretation of the conditions is cold comfort.”
A similar preliminary injunction came down in mid-October in the HHS and HUD case, blocking the rollout of restrictions on those agencies’ grants as the case continues. In her ruling, District Judge Melissa DuBose, also of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, said the administration didn’t provide a “satisfactory explanation” the new slew of restrictions, finding that Trump officials “engaged in a baseless and arbitrary process” that didn’t consider the “harmful impact their decision would have on the coalitions and the vulnerable populations they serve.”
Litigation in both cases will likely stretch into 2026.
Advocates against domestic violence and sexual assault celebrated the two rulings, which are part of a broader effort that also includes challenges to rules trying to strip funding from groups that work with LGBTQ+ and immigrant victims.
“This injunction provides immediate relief to survivors, and it allows us and our programs to continue our life-saving work without the threat of restrictive, harmful policies that would have undermined our ability to support those who need it most,” Mike Waterloo of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence said of the August ruling.
“This is not a permanent solution, and we still have work to do.”
A coalition of states working with Democracy Forward called the ruling on health and housing grants “a relief and a win that gives us breathing room to continue this vital work.”

LGBTQ+ victims

One of the Trump administration’s first targets was funding that supported groups working with LGBTQ+ people. Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group, helmed an early lawsuit on behalf of nine nonprofits that receive federal funding, several working in the intimate partner violence field.
The organizations argue that the Trump administration’s executive orders, including the order calling for the end of federal funding for activities that promote “gender ideology extremism,” amount to “an existential threat to transgender people.” Forcing the organizations to comply violates the groups’ free speech, due process and equal protection rights, they say.
In June, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction in the case that favored the nonprofits, saying that their case was likely to succeed in court. The judge’s ruling reinstated canceled grants and voided instructions hindering new applications and instructions for funding, including one from the Office of Violence Against Women stating that “that no LGBTQ+ related content should be submitted.”
The administration appealed the decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in August. The case continues to move through the courts.
LGBTQ+ Americans, with the exception of gay men, are more likely to have experienced domestic violence, partner abuse or dating violence than cisgender and heterosexual people. Queer women are significantly more likely to have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime than straight women, according to an analysis of federal survey data by the Human Rights Campaign. Fifty-four percent of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Trans Survey said they have experienced intimate partner violence, and 47 percent reported being sexually assaulted.
FORGE, one of the plaintiffs, is among the only organizations in the country focused specifically on transgender victims of violence. The 30-year-old organization relies on federal grants for 90 percent of its funding.

Legal services for immigrant victims
 

A coalition of Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in early October challenging a new rule from the Justice Department that could restrict the use of federal grants to pay for legal services for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence.
The upcoming rule says states and the local nonprofits they fund are barred from providing some legal services to survivors who don’t have legal status to be in the country. The lawsuit argues that the Violence Against Women Act — which authorized a part of the funding in question — includes a broad list of allowable legal services that include divorce, parental rights, child support, employment-related lawsuits, housing, civil rights and more.
The Justice Department’s new rule does allow states to pay for restraining and custody orders, legal action dealing with human trafficking and legal services to obtain U and T visas, as required by other laws.
The states argue that it’s unclear how exactly they and the organizations that use the funding will be able to comply with the order: Which immigrants are restricted? What legal services are not allowed?
They also argue that the order would force them to violate the law, including the Violence Against Women Act, which says that services for victims are “not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.”
“With this cruel attempt to dictate which survivors deserve access to legal supports, DOJ is endangering families, silencing survivors, and threatening public safety. I will not stand idly by while the federal government unjustly attacks people seeking protection from violence,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is taking the lead on the lawsuit. (James, who has led more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, is a political target of Trump; the president’s Justice Department is pursuing federal mortgage fraud charges against James related to a house she owns in Virginia.)
“We are asking the court to block this illegal rule before it takes effect, immeasurably harming survivors.”
The administration notified states of the new rule in August. It is expected to take effect in November.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Domestic-violence-nonprofit-illustration-for-Oct-26-2025-story-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-26 08:16:43.929694

Let’s first work within our existing supervisory unions to not just “imagine” but create effective change that would serve everyone’s best interests
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peggy Stevens: Act 73 needs to go back to the drawing board.","This commentary is by Peggy Stevens of Charleston.


Act 73 of 2025 “establishes a process for Vermont to transition to a reimagined system of public education” — that’s according to the state’s website explaining the law. The legislation is supposedly designed to streamline Vermont’s education system and alleviate the burden of education expenses on property tax payers.
I attended an informational meeting put on by the North Country Supervisory Union school board chair and superintendent in an effort to answer questions and concerns  community members have about the impacts of Act 73 in our supervisory union.
I came away astonished that this legislation was ever passed, especially by legislators who claim to be fiscally conservative. The bill has “reimagined” a funding system that is uncertain about what the ultimate cost will be. If you ask me, it is a pig in a poke, something that is bought or accepted without knowing its value or seeing it first.
The 17-page handout from the Joint Fiscal Office provided at the meeting included many “estimates” for various projected costs. There are instances of “unknown” and “yet to be determined” and “impact is unclear” in those 17 pages that could have severe unintended negative consequences for our schools and students, especially in rural Vermont. People need to know they were being sold an idea that makes it look like something is being done to help taxpayers when it can’t be proven! Many communities are actually likely to see an increase in taxes! So, potentially no gain and lots of pain
Of course, any piece of legislation cannot be absolutely certain what final costs may be, but this act seems to be chock full of uncertainty. Worse, in addition to financial repercussions, is the loss of local control. Our area schools will not have local boards and representation, in a school district potentially spanning from Canaan to Lowell to Glover that will have one school board of five to seven individuals chosen in “voting wards.” Folks will no longer vote on town school budgets, instead the boards of these “mega districts” will determine how the money is spent. 
I am sure there are many areas where education costs could be shared, streamlined and trimmed without leaving the future of our education funding system in jeopardy. Let’s first work within our existing supervisory unions to not just “imagine” but create effective change that would serve everyone’s best interests, especially our rural community schools, their students and teachers, and our taxpayers.
Talk to your legislators. Act 73 would best be repealed and brought back to the drawing board. We deserve a better process, and our students and taxpayers deserve a better future.

bursting with food, we are overflowing.
Uniformity is not a problem in our sukkah. We can
name all the fruits, the breads, in different languages, colors,
dishes that are like nothing you’ve ever seen before. We are beautiful,
and it is beautiful, the amount, I mean, the muchness, this fracture of

While President Donald Trump is demolishing the East Wing of the White House and no one is stopping him, there is a state law that prevents Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves from acting on his own to make major changes to the Governor’s Mansion. And to be clear, Gov. Reeves is not planning any major renovations to Mississippi’s version of the White House, though he does attempt to emulate President Trump.
This past week work began to remove, according to news reports, the entire East Wing of the White House – arguably the nation’s most recognizable building – to prepare for the construction of President Trump’s one big beautiful ballroom.
Who knew in America one person could tear down a portion of what we fondly called the people’s house and construct a massive structure that based on drawings will dwarf the original building and overwhelm the iconic White House grounds? For comparison, the original White House, situated on 18 acres, is 55,000 square feet while it is anticipated the ballroom will be 90,000 square feet.
Based on state law, one person cannot undertake similar activities to public buildings in Mississippi.

The guidelines established by the long-standing Antiquities Law of Mississippi govern work of many historic buildings in the state, including the Governor’s Mansion and the Capitol.
Under the law, any action involving “excavation, property transfer, excavation or ground disturbing activities of any nature, demolition or significant alteration” of a building or property designated as a Mississippi Landmark must be approved by the Department of Archives and History Board of Trustees. Mississippi landmarks could be state or local public buildings, including those found at education entities.
Granted, nearly every president makes changes to the White House. For instance, former President Barack Obama incorporated a basketball goal into the tennis court. And his wife, Michelle, had the nerve to add an organic vegetable garden.
Before Trump was inaugurated for his first term, conservative personality Ann Coulter posted on social media, “I respectfully suggest a new name for Michelle’s White House vegetable garden: ‘Putting green.’”
Trump already has made significant modifications to the White House, replacing one of its most legendary features – the Rose Garden – with a concrete patio. And he has incorporated enough gold features in the Oval Office to make envious Tony Montana, the drug-dealing kingpin in the movie “Scarface.”
Various groups, including the congressionally created National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Society of Architectural Historians, have urged a delay on the ballroom construction to gather more information and to allow input.
Who has been silent on the issue are congressional Republicans, including Mississippi U.S. Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith who previously served in the state Legislature where the Mississippi Antiquities Law was created. And Wicker was a vocal supporter of the designation of the Jackson home of civil rights leaders Medgar and Myrlie Evers as a national monument under the supervision of the National Park Service.
The National Capitol Planning Commission does have some authority over changes made to the White House. But Will Scharf, a Trump appointee and chair of the commission, said the president can do demolition at the White House on his own.

“Demolition and site preparation work can certainly occur, but if you’re talking about actually building anything, then, yeah, it should go through our approval process,” he said during an early September meeting, according to The Associated Press.
So, what does that mean? How much of the White House can the president demolish on his own? 
Scharf said there is nothing to worry about.
”Given the president’s history as a builder, and given the plans that we’ve seen publicly I think this will be a tremendous addition to the White House complex, a sorely needed addition,” he said.
Reports have said the ballroom will cost $250 million or more and private funds will be raised to pay for the structure.
Little else is known. If the funds are not raised, will Trump turn to Congress for taxpayer money to complete the project?
Or will he depend on Mexico to pay for it just as he said Mexico would pay for a border wall?
Incidentally, Trump is seeking money from American taxpayers to compensate himself for criminal investigations he has been subject to. He is asking for $230 million – almost enough to pay for one big beautiful ballroom.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/22140226/AP25295630685369-1.jpg,,,2025-10-26 07:16:31.680576

In a video called Investing In Place: Increasing the Impact of Land Conservation, a cartoonish red push pin hovers over a map of the United States, directing viewers to Norwich Farm, a small dairy operation along the border of Vermont and New Hampshire.
The scene here is quintessential New England. A red barn peeps out from snow while a few people in boots and barn coats crunch toward the barn’s big sliding door. Cows moo somewhere off screen. The camera pans to cheesemaker Chris Gray, his wife, and their five-year-old daughter, sandwiched between them, who calls herself “the cheese monster.” 
The family is at the center of a decade-long saga over a contested piece of farmland. The promotional video highlighted what appeared then to be a mutually beneficial partnership between a cheese maker, a state school, and a land trust headquartered in nearby New Hampshire. They were working together to conserve land and begin a new agricultural education program on a property called Norwich Farm. 
“I hope that Norwich Farms is a place that contributes to the wellbeing of the community as a whole,” Jeanie McIntyre, president of the Upper Valley Land Trust, the land conservation group involved in the partnership, said at the time.
Perhaps the fact that the promotional video was released on April Fool’s Day should have been a clue that the rosy vision would falter in the ensuing years. A decade and many media reports later, the Grays say the story of the partnership could end in the foreclosure of the farm and bankruptcy for their business. 
There were strong personalities on all sides, reluctant to compromise. There were millions of dollars at stake in beloved Vermont industries — agriculture and farming — which have continued to confront enormous losses. Today, the saga is reminiscent of parties trying to reclaim the narrative after a nasty break up. It’s also a singular example of how difficult it can be to sustainably finance a farm-based business without additional levers of support.
The land trust
The idea for the Upper Valley Land Trust came about in the 1980s. It evolved from a question that a pestering neighbor asked Dana Meadows, who became the first chair of the board of trustees of the land trust.


“How are we going to keep our farms in farming?” Meadows recalled the  neighbor asking in the trust’s 1987 annual report. 
Together with her community, Meadows thought community land trusts could be an answer, and in 1985, the land trust was born. 
Their goal was to keep agricultural land affordably in agriculture. Agreements between farmers and trusts could protect land and provide money or tax benefits to farmers in exchange for the sale of developmental rights and environmental protections. 
Land trusts around the country were originally formed to conserve land for the local community. Conservation was big federal business under President Theodore Roosevelt in the 20th century. Roosevelt launched land protections including the growth of the national parks system.

Things changed in the 1980s, when the federal government drastically scaled back its conservation of public lands. The gap was filled by land trusts and their donors, who receive federal tax incentives. Meanwhile, the global food system was shifting. International trade and technological innovation mutated U.S. farms, increasing consolidation and corporate control while access to affordable land decreased. 
More than 61 million acres have been conserved through land trusts across the U.S., according to the Land Trust Alliance, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. That includes more than 1.3 million acres conserved through dozens of active trusts in Vermont. They account for more than a fifth of the state’s total acreage. 
The scale of these operations vary. While town-based land trusts in Vermont, including ones in Charlotte, Richmond and South Hero, have protected hundreds of acres, massive national conservation groups like The Nature Conservancy and The Conservation Fund have protected hundreds of thousands. By far the biggest holder of state lands is the Vermont Land Trust, which has conserved more than 721,000 acres, according to the alliance, or more than a tenth of state land since 1977. 
The Upper Valley Land Trust falls somewhere in the middle of these groups in the size of its holdings. Based in Hanover, New Hampshire, the trust has conserved almost 35,000 acres in Vermont, according to the Land Trust Alliance, and almost 20,000 acres in the Granite State. In 2024, the Upper Valley Land Trust was worth more than $23 million in assets.
In the summer of 2015, the land trust paid $300,000 for 352 acres of farmland now called Brookmead Conservation Area in Norwich. The trust’s intent was to keep the Brookmead Conservation Area’s meadows and pastures conserved and to continue as a working farm, according to a 2018 brochure.
The trust bought the land from Vermont Technical College, which has since become Vermont State University. The land was donated to the college in 2015 by a millionaire named Andrew Sigler, a Dartmouth College graduate who had owned a forestry business, according to court records. Sigler bought the land from the Somerville family, once a Vermont Farm Bureau Farm Family of the Year. The property, where the family raised cows for generations, was the last remaining farm selling milk in Norwich. Before they sold it to the Siglers, it was called Brookmead Farm.

At the time, the trust persuaded the Norwich Conservation Commission, a local municipal group, to provide $30,000 to preserve the agricultural land for conservation and recreation, according to the trust’s request for assistance and subsequent emails. 
“Protection of this parcel will ensure that the land remains available for agricultural endeavors in the future,” with possible future site activities like cheese-making and animal husbandry classes, McIntrye wrote in a 2015 funding request.
At the time, the trust’s leaders knew that the state college planned to move its dairy herd to Norwich as part of a new program to educate students about the dairy industry. The purchase would provide the college with enough funds to launch the education program and provide a new opportunity for the trust to pursue its mission of land conservation.
Beyond the transaction, the college retained two parcels on an island cut out from Brookmead Conservation Area. This included roughly six acres of farm buildings, including a top of the line dairy barn built by Sigler, who had a penchant for Holstein genetics. There was also a house on two acres of land.
Under the vision of the college and the cheesemaker, these parcels would host a state-of-the-art dairy, a dormitory, and a small herd of cows that would have access to the surrounding pastures of Brookmead.
“The fact that we’ll be able to really inspire people to pursue an experience in agriculture or at the very least just understand the intimate connection between the food we make and the landscape that surrounds us is a really exciting thing,” Dan Smith, then president of the state college, said at the time. 

The creamery
Chris Gray met his wife, Laura Brown, working in the music industry. They began their family in Brooklyn, New York, but dreamt of getting out of the hustle and into food production.
So in 2010, just after their daughter was born, they bought a house and moved their family to southwestern Vermont. With business partners, they began a cheese making company in West Pawlet called Consider Bardwell Farm. (The business closed last year.) 
But when the Grays found out about the Norwich property, they decided to uproot again. 
“I took one look at this place, and I was like, ‘Oh my god, when do we start?’” Gray said. Over the years, it was overbuilt and underused, he said, but it was the only one like it in New England, with capabilities for a state-of-the-art, value-added dairy. He and Brown named their nascent business Lucky Us Ranch, LLC.

The Grays enrolled their daughter at a nearby school. Gray signed a temporary, one-year lease with the college in 2015. He helped the college design the property’s micro-dairy, and invested $150,000 in the buildout, he said. (According to a 2023 business plan, improvements to the farm since 2015 have cost $1 million; the creamery itself cost $650,000, largely paid for in grants and loans orchestrated by the college.)
By 2016, all the parties were still friendly, sometimes exchanging pleasantries over email. But then, the creamery started losing advocates at the college to job transitions. One of the first to leave was Chris Dutton, the chair of the college’s agricultural department who had championed the project, Gray said. Soon after, Dan Smith, the president of the college, moved to a position at the Vermont Community Fund. 
During the transition, the Grays signed a five-year lease with the college that included two options for ten-year extensions. 
Smith did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Emma Allen, the executive coordinator for the Vermont Community Fund, said Smith was on an unplugged sabbatical until early November and Allen was unable to get in touch with him.
The first semester of the on-farm dairy program was rocky from the start. Brown was hired as a residence director to help manage the six students in the dorm and buy groceries for the group. Gray worked as the cheese maker and a teacher on contract. The family paid $500 a month in subsidized rent for the three-bedroom farmhouse. 
Brown said that “a lot has been made” about the family’s low rent. “I want to qualify that we were teaching students,” she said.

Conflicts began to snowball. Gray and the former herd manager disagreed over the care of the cows and the quality of the milk. The creamery got a late start due to a delayed construction process. The students were disappointed in the program. They felt isolated in the small town of Norwich, according to a 2021 testimony from the college to state lawmakers, and they were unhappy being so far from the campus in Randolph. 
“I had three students come to speak with me, quite impassioned, of the six we had, saying, ‘This just isn’t working,’” said Patricia Moulton, then president of the college, in the 2021 testimony.
When the fall semester ended, the college planned to take the spring off and reassess the program, Gray said, before bringing students back in the fall of 2017. That spring, after conflicts with the herd manager, the cows left. The college helped pay for Gray to haul in milk. Gray began selling dairy products like ricotta cheese, yogurt, ice cream and bottled milk. 
But then the college, facing its own financial crisis, decided to end the program. Moulton, in an email response to questions this October, said the former agricultural program at the college’s Randolph campus later closed but parts of a new agricultural program could launch in the fall of 2026. Moulton did not agree to an interview because she said years had passed and her role at the campus had ended. Moulton is now the state’s flood recovery officer for central Vermont.

Ending the agricultural program in Norwich triggered an option the college had signed when they sold the land to the land trust. This option allowed the land trust to buy the six acre sliver that the college had retained when it sold the land back in 2015 — the pocket where the Grays lived. 
The option had set the price the land trust would pay at $50,000, a fraction of its actual market value in the affluent town of about 3,600 people. The median home value in Norwich exceeded $750,000 in Dec. 2024, according to Forbes, making it one of the priciest zip codes in the state. 
The dissolution of the partnership could have been less litigious if the Grays had cut their losses and tried to move their business to another property. But affordable farms are hard to come by. The average value of a farm has almost doubled in the last decade and a half, according to data published by the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service in August. In Vermont, land costs slightly more than the national average, about  $4,400 per acre. While farms are getting bigger in Vermont, largely due to consolidation, the number of farms has shrunk, according to a 2022 USDA agricultural census of the state.

“Everything that you read about us is that we’re horrible people,” Brown said while crying at her table in June. “That we’re tenants that won’t leave. That we’re planning an intensive dairy operation.”
“I feel like the truth needs to come out,” Brown said. 
“There’s many layers to this story,” said Anson Tebbetts, the state’s agricultural secretary, in an August interview. “You’ve got land agreements, you’ve got leases, you’ve got a state college going through a very difficult financial situation and that kind of unraveled in the middle. So a lot of things didn’t go as hoped and sometimes things just happen that way.” 
The Grays say they sunk roughly half a million dollars into their value-added agricultural business over the last decade. They say the land trust’s refusal to help a working farm sent them spiraling into debt, and now foreclosure could evict them from their home. They continue lobbing accusations against the land trust, claiming the organization orchestrated the debacle facing their small business. 
“A lot of people think we should have quit or given up but why would you? It’s literally a $50,000 problem that’s been turned into a million dollar situation,” Brown said.
McIntyre, president of the land trust during the entire saga, called the issue “ancient history,” and said she doesn’t want any part in the debate. Instead, according to McIntyre, it’s the land trust that lost out in the debacle, deprived of the opportunity to permanently protect the six-acre parcel of land. 
When asked about the damages that McIntyre claimed the land trust suffered on an August phone call, McIntyre’s voice rose in frustration. 
“We would own the building,” McIntyre said. “We would own the property where the Grays are currently located. I’m sorry to be short with you, but what is happening here is the Grays are attempting to create a story about something that isn’t a story anymore. This is done.”

The lawsuit
The Grays realized things were taking a turn for the worse when they met with the land trust in the fall of 2017, after the college’s education program shut down. As the land trust prepared to exercise its $50,000 legal option, they began to feel less confident in the future of their business. 
“It became clear immediately that they did not want to work with us,” Gray said. 
Part of that legal arrangement between the college and the land trust required the college to deliver the six-acres of land “unencumbered.” This meant that, if the land trust did not make a new deal with the creamery, the Gray family would need to leave. 
But the Grays refused to leave. Instead, the couple sent the land trust business plans outlining their proposals to stay in response to a request for proposals the land trust sent out.
In January 2018, as the land trust looked at business opportunities for the property including the one shared by the Grays, they offered the Gray family an estimate for a new lease rate. The proposed rate of $58,941 annually, or nearly $5,000 a month, included capital costs, real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and utilities for the farmhouse and surrounding barn properties. It was about ten times the lease rate that the family was paying at the time. Later, the trust offered a lease rate for only the farm house for $2,500 plus utilities. Neither offer included the use of the adjacent farm land.
“No agricultural business could operate at Norwich retail market rates,” Gray said in an email this summer. “They are essentially creating conditions so bad that we would have no choice but to leave.”
McIntyre sees the situation differently. She said the land trust was doing its due diligence to determine whether they could afford to exercise the legal option and manage the property, including its carrying costs.
“We’re a land conservancy, so we can’t have our operating budget distorted or get into an untenable situation,” McIntyre said in an interview in October. “The Grays provided UVLT with a business plan at that time that demonstrated their business would not be able to meet those carrying costs, and they disparaged UVLT publicly for not being willing to let them stay on the property for $500 a month. They didn’t join us in figuring out how to pay for those carrying costs, they just showed us that they couldn’t.”
Although the Upper Valley Land Trust has long promised to maintain the agricultural value of these parcels, the trust didn’t allow the Grays to raise a herd of cattle on the adjoining pastureland. Instead, the trust has leased parcels for grazing to at least two other farmers. 
The Grays went on the offensive and rallied their neighbors for support. The neighbors, eager to retain local farm products, eventually formed a foundation to support the creamery.
Even the college tried to advocate for the Grays’ business. Moulton, in a March 2018 email, said she would like to speak face-to-face or by phone with McIntyre. Moulton said she was sending an email outlining plans for the farm because McIntyre “requested that I do so in writing.” Moulton noted that the college did not intend to operate a degree program at the farm but wanted to continue holding workshops with Gray, who in turn wanted to stay on the farm and expand his business.
“Their proposal seems to enable each of us to continue to operate within our preferred areas AND to enable agriculture and value added dairy to remain on the farm which seems to be what folks in Norwich and the neighborhood would like to see happen,” Moulton wrote. 
In emails, she asked McIntyre to assign its option to purchase the property from the college to the creamery instead, in exchange for being reimbursed for the expenses incurred to date. The land trust would be able to purchase the property from the creamery for $50,000 in the future if the creamery ceased agricultural operations at the site. The creamery would be able to negotiate with the land trust on using the conserved land for agricultural operations. 
Moulton said keeping the site a working farm was “consistent with the spirit of the gift from the Siglers.” (Sigler, who died in 2021, apparently wanted nothing to do with the controversy. “Not my problem,” he told Jim Kenyon, a Valley News Columnist, according to a 2021 obituary.)
The proposal appeared to be a three-way win. It gave the land trust the option to purchase the property in the future while avoiding landlord responsibilities for the creamery. It gave the college the opportunity to divest but continue to conduct workshops and educational operations on the farm. The Grays would own their own farm, and if they decided to leave, the option would again transfer to the trust. Moulton asked for the three parties to get together as soon as possible. 
The land trust said such an arrangement wasn’t possible. McIntyre told VTDigger that, as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the trust couldn’t legally provide public benefits to private individuals like the Grays. In the 2018 emails, McIntyre wrote that she’d previously explained “the legal, ethical and strategic reasons why we felt it was unlikely UVLT’s Board would accept.” (In a 2025 email, Stan Williams, board chair, told Brown that the trust had a “fiduciary duty” to exercise the option to purchase the land after the college withdrew.)
Moulton said she was “very sorry to hear this.” A little more than a week later, Moulton wrote another email reminding McIntyre that the college supported the creamery remaining on the farm. She mentioned a recent post on the land trust’s website called “Bringing the Cows Back” that stated: “We hope that the increased visibility for the Norwich Farm Creamery and the growing public awareness of operating complexities at the site will help the Grays strengthen the Creamery finances and, if viable, bring back the cows!”
Moulton offered to clear her calendar to make time in the next week for a resolution and suggested finding a mediator to advance the process. But McIntyre said the land trust’s attorneys didn’t want them having direct contact with Chris Gray.
Brown said officials at the college fought for the creamery and offered a long-term lease because they knew the business was never going to own land in Vermont. “The reality is we’re not wealthy people,” Gray added. “We don’t have money to burn to create some fantasy.”
A value-added dairy business is hard to make a go of in New England, according to Lee Robie, a 76-year-old, fifth generation former dairy farmer at New Hampshire’s Robie Farm. His family transitioned years ago from a conventional dairy into a value-added dairy business with cheese making, raw milk and a farm store.
“I can’t say we’re rolling in the dough, but we do sell a lot of products in New Hampshire and Vermont and we employ quite a few people on the farm,” Robie said in an interview. Years ago, he sold some of his farm’s lease rights to a land trust. While his family considered the Upper Valley Land Trust, they eventually went with Ammonoosuc Conservation Trust because it encouraged the family to keep farming and develop its agritourism business, Robie said.
By May 2018, after a spat over the use of a classroom on the farm for a celebration of Dale Somerville’s life, the former owner of the farm, to which the Grays say they were not invited, McIntyre told Moulton in an email that the trust’s “goodwill in this matter is nearly exhausted.” In a later email, McIntyre noted that the land trust had twice extended the closing of the option to benefit the college. “It is increasingly difficult for me to respond to VTC requests for goodwill, as these delays damage UVLT,” McIntyre wrote. 
The settlement
Representatives of the college and the land trust spoke with a mediator in June 2018, but the proposal put forward by Moulton ultimately failed. Almost a year later, the college still hadn’t delivered the land without the Grays. So the land trust sued the college.
The lawsuit appeared to change the way the college approached the Grays. A settlement was reached in 2020, after which the college listed the property for sale. The Grays would need to vacate the property when their five-year lease terminated on June 30, 2021.
McIntyre said the lawsuit in April 2019 only came after discussing for a year how to resolve the situation. The land trust never had any legal obligation or legal ability to help the Grays, according to McIntyre, and she said she didn’t know why the college claimed that the land trust could transfer the option. 
“We’re a private charity, it’s not the same thing as a publicly funded institution, so maybe they just didn’t know we’d have these constraints because it’s not the world they live in,” McIntyre said. 
But the Grays remained convinced that the land trust could have done more. While the college and the land trust negotiated their lawsuit, the Grays mobilized their neighbors into forming the Norwich Farm Foundation, a nonprofit with goals of maintaining local food security, creating affordable farmer housing, preserving the working landscape and restoring regenerative agriculture. The group submitted a ten-year business plan for the creamery to the land trust that included producing 350,000 pounds of dairy products each year. It hinged on grazing cattle on the surrounding pastureland in the Brookmead Conservation Area, owned by the land trust. 
But McIntyre said, by that point, the land trust didn’t need to see a plan, because it wasn’t going to own the six-acre property. The plan the trust did receive in May 2020 was very similar to the initial 2018 plan it received from the Grays, McIntyre said, except this time the Grays wouldn’t pay rent and would receive a salary. 
As McIntyre repeatedly told the creamery and said in public commentary, the land was not available to the Grays’ business. The college listed the six-acre property for $1.25 million. The Grays, bolstered by the enormous wealth of the Norwich community and desperate to maintain their business, managed to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy the property through the foundation. 
It took months, but finally, in the spring of 2020, the foundation submitted an unsolicited offer through email to buy the property for $300,000, according to Omer Trajman, then treasurer of the Norwich Farm Foundation, who spoke to lawmakers during a March 2021 Senate Agriculture Committee meeting that was held on Zoom and included the parties involved in the dispute. When that failed, the foundation raised an additional $180,000 and doubled its offer to $610,000. The college again rejected the offer. (Trajman did not respond to requests for comment.)
“We all sort of had high hopes and great ideas about that operation and know that the people in Norwich certainly enjoy having that farm there,” Sen. Robert Starr, D-Orleans, said during the 2021 committee meeting.
But Moulton, also in attendance, no longer appeared interested in supporting the Grays. She told lawmakers that the college had been clear with the Grays that their plan to make Norwich Farm their dairy operation was no longer going to work. The barn was not ideally set up for milking, and was instead better positioned to raise prize Holsteins, she said. Because they didn’t have access to surrounding pastures, feed would have to be trucked in and manure trucked out, she said.
“That’s not the way you typically do dairy farming,” Moulton said as McIntyre nodded along to her comments on the Zoom screen. 
Gray put in over half a million dollars in the dairy he told lawmakers in 2021. He told VTDigger his family paid over $80,000 in legal bills to maintain their rights on the property. (Gray later said that he received pro bono representation and saved money from ballooning legal costs by working with the Vermont Legal Food Hub at the Vermont Law and Graduate School.) 
The tension on the Zoom call was palpable. Gray shook his head and looked appalled at McIntyre and Moulton’s statements. McIntyre shook her head and appeared to laugh at Gray. 
Moulton said the only offer on the farm as of March 2021 was from the Norwich Farm Foundation, but that it was far below fair market value. She said the college spent around $70,000 a year subsidizing the farm’s operating expenses, which came from the students’ tuition. The college plowed the driveway, mowed the fields, and emptied the grey water produced by the creamery, Moulton said. In the last several years, between renovation and operation, the college system had spent “several million dollars” on the property, Moulton said.
If the college sold the property, asked Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, would the money go directly to the college system’s budget?
“Yes,” Moulton said, nodding. The sale could provide 25-50 student scholarships, she added.
Between the foundation’s first offer in 2020 and the end of 2021, the Norwich Farm Foundation made at least five offers for the property to the college, which rejected them all, according to the Grays. In May of 2021, the Grays sued the college for $500,000. The lawsuit was settled in mediation, the Grays said. By early September, the college filed an eviction notice against the Grays. The family contested it, and in April 2022, settled with the college for $10,000.
But in the middle of the fight over the eviction, the foundation raised $400,000 from the community, according to the Grays. In December 2021, the foundation was finally able to buy the property from the college for $1,065,000. The foundation bought the property so the Grays could continue operating the Norwich Farm Creamery, making an operating dairy again viable in the community. 
But much of the money the foundation spent on the property did not go to the college system or to student scholarships, as the Grays and their neighbors had assumed after the 2021 Senate testimony. The details of the private settlement between the college and the land trust became unredacted after the sale went through. Under that settlement, the trust had earned $849,674. Those hundreds of thousands of dollars would “advance UVLT’s conservation and stewardship missions,” according to a 2022 annual report.
The purchase left the Norwich Farm Foundation with an almost equivalent $850,000 mortgage debt. 
“The Upper Valley Land Trust took all the money,” Gray said. “In the end, UVLT created $850,000 in debt and profited from a farm that was originally given away.” 
Moulton confirmed in an email that “money from the sale of the Norwich Farm did not go into scholarships” or students at the college. She said she couldn’t speak to where the money ultimately ended up because she left the college in 2023. 
The settlement, unsealed and then unredacted through multiple public records requests, showed that the land trust received an initial $75,000 and then played a role in the sale, choosing the broker for the sale who would recommend the pricing. 
McIntyre told VTDigger that the $75,000 was compensation for “real out-of-pocket costs we incurred,” including the staff time reaching out to potential tenants and the analyses of business plans for the property. 
But the Grays brought up other issues: The land trust was able to reject offers for the six-acre property under $500,000 and match any offer less than $450,000 after a three-month veto period, according to the settlement. In 2021, the Norwich Farm Foundation alleged that the trust had been involved in the sale and driven up the costs.
McIntyre stands by a claim she’s made for years that she never saw or evaluated any of the offers the college received: “UVLT had absolutely nothing to do with whatever offers the college rejected,” McIntyre said in October. While who saw what remains an open question, the settlement makes clear that the land trust received 100% of the first $450,000 and 70% of any net sale proceeds over $450,000.
That means the land trust — with a stated mission to permanently protect land in the Upper Valley, including working farms — reaped more than 18 times the original $50,000 trigger option it would have paid the college for the six-acre property. But McIntyre said this settlement was just about recouping financial losses for the failure of the college to deliver the property as initially promised. 
“UVLT did not make money,” McIntyre told VTDigger, adding that the trust was  only paid 80 percent of the value of the property that should’ve been conveyed to the trust by the college. “We were damaged, and we were compensated for the loss of opportunity caused by the school’s default.”
“We have nothing to do with the property where the Grays are located now,” McIntyre said in August. “Their business, from what I gather, is not working out.” 
The debt
From his kitchen table in June, Gray said his family was “crushed financially” by the debacle. The foundation’s debt is more than a million dollars, according to foreclosure documents. The foundation can’t make enough money from the creamery, which relies on hauling in milk instead of milking dairy cows, to pay back the debt without access to the land or larger donors, Gray said. 
The Grays’ faced another defeat in 2023 when they tried and failed to get a property tax exemption for the property valued at $1.239 million, according to the property’s town tax bill. The town of Norwich decided the for-profit business operation within the non-profit status of the Norwich Farm Foundation didn’t meet the standard of the land used for a charitable purpose. The annual taxes on the property are more than $34,000.
The foundation disbanded after realizing the debt for the property they purchased was untenable. None responded to a request for comment or agreed to speak on the record. Kate Barlow, the former president of the foundation, said in a September email that it had been more than three years since she was on the board and requested not to be contacted.
The foundation listed the property a year ago for $1.275 million. Failing to secure any offers, let alone a buyer, the foundation took it off the market Sept. 1.
That was more than a month after the foreclosure began. 
The $850,000 mortgage has been held by Iroquois Valley Farmland REIT, a farmland finance company out of Illinois, since May 2022. In July, the company filed a foreclosure notice against the foundation, Norwich Farm Creamery and Brown and Gray themselves, according to court records. The notice says the parties now owe $1,065,000, or roughly what the foundation initially paid for the property with accumulated taxes, interest and attorney fees, according to court records. 
After a foreclosure notice, defendants can often work to pay off the debt during a redemption period. In Vermont, that period is typically six months for farms, but Iroquois Valley argued last month that the property was not actually farmland, but rather a commercial property taxed by the town of Norwich. Therefore, the finance company requested a redemption period of one day. 
Eventually, the foreclosure could mean bankruptcy and eviction, according to Gray. He said the couple could close their value-added dairy business by the end of the year. 
“We do not know at this point exactly how long that process will take or ultimately what will be the outcome for our business and our family,” Gray said in August.

The Grays continue to place most of the blame on UVLT for subdividing the working farm – hewing the working land from the working infrastructure. They’d fundraised to buy the property on the presumption that the money they were spending would support the state college, the Grays said, and according to the Senate agricultural committee meeting, go to student scholarships. They blamed the realization that the money had instead gone to the land trust on sidelining much of their fundraising efforts.
“All the money we raised, and all the money we continued to raise, just went to servicing the debt and keeping the lights on, so zero money went back to growing the system and getting it to a sustainable level. It’s what happens to all farms. They just get in so much debt, then they can’t grow and be sustainable,” Gray said. 
Brown now works a second job in retail at King Arthur Baking Company. The farm is currently processing about 175 gallons of milk a week purchased from Billings Farm and Museum in Woodstock, according to Gray. Their gross revenues are about $200,000 a year, according to their farm plan.
The couple has stopped paying the mortgage and taxes on the property. Gray said the creamery is still in production but the finances are week to week while the family looks for a new backer for the business.
“The situation is so complicated,” Gray said from his kitchen, looking grim. “And the money has become so big that it’s hard to get anyone to pay attention. And you have no access to the land.”
When asked about UVLT not allowing the Grays to use the surrounding 350 acres for agriculture, McIntyre said the land was always intended for conservation purposes and had never been available to the Grays’ private business.
“The Grays have known for years that it won’t be available to their operation. They knew that before they got there. Before the foundation bought it for them,” McIntyre said. “UVLT was not going to subsidize a business or tie up our property in an unsustainable plan.” 
The Grays’ daughter, Eugenia, five years old at the start of this saga, is now 15 and in high school near Norwich. The couple said they want to stay in the community for her education and because the farm is important to their family. 
“We don’t have any other options,” Brown said. “We don’t have any place to go.” 
So the creamery is making a last ditch effort to bring in another partner: Dartmouth College.
The couple is asking for an investment of about $2.5 million for ownership of the property. They’ve shared a five-year growth plan that involves returning cows to the farm, hiring two herd managers, tripling production and becoming financially self-sustaining after five years. 
They said they’ve received positive feedback, but the college’s real estate office isn’t yet interested in buying the property. Dartmouth College declined to comment.
But they’re not giving up: They pitched rebranding the business as Dartmouth Farm Creamery.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Oct. 23, 2025.
The Vermont Public Utility Commission officially opened an investigation into Hyde Park Electric on Monday after the village utility admitted to the state last month that it was experiencing “significant financial distress.”
Hyde Park Electric, which serves 1,400 ratepayers, has failed to cover expenses as it struggles under the weight of its $1.5 million debt, and is “essentially not solvent,” according to correspondence between the state and the utility.
The Department of Public Service, which advocates on behalf of Vermont ratepayers, learned about the severity of the village utility’s situation only after another state program informed  commissioner Kerrick Johnson that Hyde Park Electric had not been paying its bills.
After a meeting in Montpelier held Sept. 9, Johnson laid out his directives for addressing the situation in a letter to Hyde Park village manager Brian Evans-Mongeon on how to proceed in addressing a catastrophic situation that was “entirely of its own making.” Kerrick admonished the utility for failing to inform the state of its dire situation “months if not years ago.”
Johnson outlined concerns including the utility’s use of loans taken out by the village to cover losses incurred by the electric department; various loans that the utility had fallen behind on; and the handling of energy efficiency charge collections, which the utility had been using to cover other costs, rather than sending them on to the state as required.
“The Department continues to weigh all options relative to our view on whether Hyde Park Electric’s continued operation is the most efficient means of ensuring reliable, affordable and sustainable electric service to its ratepayers,” Johnson wrote. He later clarified that it is still his department’s position that the existence of a solvent village utility would be the best outcome for ratepayers.
In a subsequent letter to the Public Utility Commission filed on Sept. 29 at the behest of the Department of Public Service, Evans-Mongeon and village trustees chair Fredericka French told regulators that the department had unpaid transmission bills outstanding, along with other suspect financially unsound transactions that had resulted in a “negative retained earnings and a negative net income position.”
They promised that the utility, after contracting with the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority, would be cooperating fully with the state to right the ship.
“(Hyde Park Electric) understands the gravity of this situation and is endeavoring to restore (the utility’s) financial footing and assuring that its public service obligations are fully met,” the letter from the Hyde Park officials said.
In a follow-up interview, French pledged that there would be no interruption to electricity access in Hyde Park village, an assertion that Johnson corroborated.
Johnson said his department’s first priority was to work with Hyde Park Electric to propose a new rate increase that would allow the utility to stabilize itself financially while his department maintains strict financial surveillance going forward. But how, exactly, the Hyde Park board of trustees got itself into this mess remains a mystery.
French said that this was purely a matter of financial mismanagement, not fraud, while Johnson awaits the result of a VPPSA audit to adequately apportion blame, to “untangle in terms of responsibility and how and when we got here.”
Johnson said he had seen other municipal utilities face financial struggles, but Hyde Park’s insolvency is extraordinary.
“There’s been nothing like this where there’s been a series of utility management decisions over a period of time, especially the legally questionable, regulatory questionable, practices and measures and strategies undertaken,” he said. “This is not just doubling down; this is quadrupling down of debt and mismanagement that have brought the utility to its current position.”
Crisis unveiled
Shortly after Johnson was appointed to the Department of Public Service, he attended a regular February meeting of the Hyde Park village board of trustees with an offer of collaboration with the utility, with which he had concerns, but received no interest from the village.
As laid out in the public utility commission’s filing on Monday, Hyde Park Electric had been requesting rate increases that the commission believed “were insufficient to meet its operating needs.” The utility last filed for a rate increase of 2% in October 2023 and promised to return with another increase request the following spring, but didn’t.
In September, representatives from Efficiency Vermont reached out to Johnson for guidance when Hyde Park Electric, in what they say was an unprecedented situation, had not paid the remittance the utilities regularly pay the program.
Evans-Mongeon and the trustees met with Johnson in Montpelier in a “tense” meeting during which the utility ultimately admitted to being insolvent. According to Johnson, it took some discussion to get to that point.
“There was evasiveness, evasiveness and finger-pointing to anyone but themselves at first, and that was dismissed summarily, and (we) started to get, at last, an acknowledgement of the depth of the problem,” he said.
According to Johnson, along with being behind on various payments and in serious debt, the village had been covering the debt with loans it had taken out and had been commingling electric utility funds with its water and sewer utility.
In 2022, Lamoille County sued Hyde Park village for changing its water and sewer rate structure to protect residential customers while increasing the rate for state and county-owned buildings like the courthouse and elementary school from a $15 flat fee to $1,418 base charge. The county and village eventually settled on a slightly lesser fee.
This water and sewer rate adjustment was presided over by former Hyde Park village manager Carol Robertson. Robertson suddenly left her position in the spring of 2023 after developing serious medical issues and died that April, according to an announcement made by French. Evans-Mongeon took the job that same year.
Johnson said it’s unclear at this time how far back the mismanagement of Hyde Park Electric’s resources goes. French said past and current management practices would be scrutinized in the ongoing VPPSA audit.
A separate independent audit conducted by a St. Albans-based accounting firm Kittell Branagan & Sargent submitted to the village on Oct. 10 included comments complaining of significant delays in the auditing process due to a lack of documentation and accused management of not possessing “the expertise in financial accounting and reporting in order to prepare financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.”
State takes charge
Hyde Park Electric was already being investigated by the Public Utility Commission after implementing a new rate tariff for infrastructure upgrade costs that the commission felt it needed to better explain. The Department of Public Service pushed Hyde Park to abandon this request, filing a scathing motion to dismiss, instead of waiting for the trustees to make a decision.
It was a move that one of Hyde Park’s lawyers with Stackpole & French said, in an email to department lawyers, felt like the department was “just trying to kick HPE while they are down and took an opportunity to take another shot at them.” Ed French, senior partner at the law firm, is Fredericka French’s husband.
Johnson said the tenor of that initial meeting and Hyde Park Electric’s record of resisting cooperation with the state caused him to grow impatient.
“There’s fundamental cracks in the foundation of your house, and you’re doing new window treatments,” Johnson said of the rate tariff. “Stop it. Concentrate on the financial fundamentals. That’s where you should be concentrating on re-earning trust for your management team with the Department of Public Service.”
On Oct. 16, the Department of Public Service sent a proposed two-phase rate case process to Hyde Park, a plan that, as enacted, will stabilize the utility in the short-term.
The next part of the process will require the utility, under surveillance by the department and with the support of VPPSA, to submit a rate increase proposal that will allow it to achieve some form of long-term financial stability. Johnson said the rate increase will be substantial, but not “the most expensive rates in the state.”
A solvent Hyde Park Electric is still what Johnson believes will ultimately be best for its ratepayers, but dissolution is still on the table.
“It shouldn’t have taken a third party knocking on the department door that tipped us off to exactly the depth of the financial challenges that (they) are facing,” he said, “but the village and the leadership there have a responsibility towards its own rate payers as well as to the rest of the state’s rate-payers, to look for assistance when they need it.”

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The 19 proposals advanced on Wednesday by a legislative task force aiming to reduce property taxes for South Dakota homeowners are a mix of ideas including spending cuts, increases in other taxes and tapping into other funds.
In addition to recommendations by the task force, lawmakers will likely have to contend with other property tax proposals when they convene for the annual legislative session in January. That could include a revival of a state sales tax rate increase from 4.2% to 5% and the governor’s proposed optional half-percent sales tax for counties, which currently don’t have authority to tax sales (only the state and cities have that power).
Lawmakers on the task force expressed a hope in June to propose legislation that will significantly cut the average South Dakota homeowner’s property taxes. South Dakota property taxes paid by homeowners increased 38.8% between 2020 and 2024.
The proposals include cutting state spending and applying the savings to property tax relief, replacing some property tax revenue with sales tax increases, using one-time tax credits for temporary relief, and reserving a portion of future state revenue increases each year to reduce property taxes.
Chair of the task force and Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, said details need to be hashed out with some of the proposals. Task force member and Sen. Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish, cautioned lawmakers at the end of the meeting.
“We need to be very careful about what we wish for,” Deibert said. “If we lower our property taxes so much, we’ll have more people moving here and have a big impact on that. We have to be very careful on that balance, to keep our quality of life and not be overrun by people moving here because we have such a great tax environment.”
Cut state spending by 5%
The most contentious proposal to make it through the task force is cutting state government general fund spending by 5%, or about $123 million — with cooperation from Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration to identify where potential cuts could be made. The cuts themselves wouldn’t reduce property taxes, because the state doesn’t receive any property tax revenue (only counties, schools, cities and other local governments do). The state would have to dedicate the savings toward property tax relief.
Task force Vice Chair and House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, said the executive branch’s cooperation is needed to “cut state government in this fashion.” 
“I think the fundamental reason for this request is because, if we want real tax relief, it must come from cuts to government spending,” said Hansen, who is running for governor next year. “Otherwise, we’re just shifting the burden onto other taxpayers.”
Other members of the task force and the public warned task force members against state cuts. Jim Terwilliger, commissioner of the South Dakota Bureau of Finance and Management, said many of the budget cuts proposed by the Rhoden administration for this fiscal year were unpopular with lawmakers, and some of them were restored.
“It’s pretty easy to say, ‘Oh, let’s go cut 5%,’” Terwilliger said, adding, “I think it’s going to be very, very difficult to do that at the end of the day.”
Reserve some future revenue growth for property tax relief
Another recommendation would create a new property tax relief fund by depositing 25% of the annual increase in ongoing state revenue into the fund each year.
The idea, proposed by Karr, would be a long-term investment in property tax relief, he said.
Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, said it would be a new line item in the state budget and grow each year. Karr compared the idea to annual increases in state employee salaries, education and Medicaid reimbursements. 
“Even with an average of 4% growth, we can have a significant buildup,” Karr said, adding, “Maybe this is the seed we plant for future growth in property tax relief.”
Sales tax increase used for property tax relief
The task force also advanced a proposal to use a sales tax increase from 4.2% to 4.5% to create a fund to replace a portion of property taxes collected by school districts. A temporary sales tax reduction from 4.5% to 4.2%, adopted in 2023, is already scheduled to expire in 2027 unless lawmakers make it permanent.
South Dakota Retailers Association Executive Director Nathan Sanderson encouraged lawmakers to support the idea, saying that his organization has been advocating for the “relatively simple” proposal since 2022.
One-time $500 tax credits
A $500 property tax credit for owner-occupied properties would be funded by remaining Housing and Infrastructure Financing program money and budget reserve funding, totaling $120 million.

Lawmakers used a combination of state and federal funding in 2023 to create a $200 million Housing and Infrastructure Financing program, meant to spur housing developments across South Dakota. Much of that money has been spent as grants, but just under $65 million in loans remain untouched. The Legislature earlier this year dipped into the fund to spend $15 million on a loan for the Douglas School District, serving the Ellsworth Air  Force Base, to help build an elementary school.
Hansen proposed spending the remaining funds on property tax relief. On Friday, the governor unveiled a rival proposal to spend some of the the remaining housing infrastructure money on airport expansions in Sioux Falls and Rapid City.
Julie Johnson, a lobbyist who represents various housing groups, said many organizations have proposals in the works to use the remainder of the Housing and Infrastructure Financing money.
“I would urge your avoidance of that fund,” Johnson said. “It’s filled incredible niches in the housing infrastructure economy and allowed a lot of communities to take the next steps into building their own opportunities.”
Tax increment financing regulations
One of the most controversial proposals related to property taxes is Howard’s tax increment financing district regulation package.
Local tax increment financing districts provide upfront financing to build streets, water pipes and other infrastructure for development, while capturing the higher property taxes generated by the development to pay off the financing over time. TIFs, as they are known, have become controversial in some areas, including Rapid City, where critics including Howard allege they’ve become handouts for wealthy developers.

If passed, Howard’s proposal would restrict TIFs by reducing the percentage of a city or county’s overall assessed value that can be part of a TIF, requiring that at least 50% of the area within a proposed TIF district be blighted, redefining “blight,” requiring counties to approve TIF districts established by a city, requiring an independent evaluation that a project would not be built unless a TIF was established, and requiring a special election for TIF districts totaling $10 million or more.
Howard called the changes “common sense” as TIFs become a more commonly used tool, especially in urban counties, to “reign it back.”
Other task force members, including Deibert, were concerned the package is too restrictive and would harm communities. Deibert and other critics conceded that TIFs could be further regulated in the state, but without “punishing people who really need” them.
The impact of TIFs on local property taxpayers is a subject of debate, with critics saying the capturing of a project’s property taxes to pay off TIF financing temporarily burdens other taxpayers, while TIF proponents say TIFs spur development that broadens the tax base over time.
Other proposals
Other proposals advanced by the task force:

Expanding the state’s property assessment freeze program income limit for older and disabled South Dakotans.
Requiring counties to include a QR code on property tax bills to direct taxpayers to the state’s property tax website, in an effort to increase transparency about how property taxes are used.
Setting school districts’ annual increase for property tax revenue at the same level as all other taxing districts, since school districts are currently exempt.
Allowing property owners applying for tax relief programs to fill out forms online, rather than at the county office.
Raising the minimum value of a new structure or addition that qualifies for the discretionary formula, a property tax incentive to promote economic development in the state, from $30,000 to $100,000. 
Creating a new fund directing all state lottery revenues to state aid for education, rather than placing the revenues into the state general fund.
Prohibiting a school district from transferring money from its capital outlay fund to its general fund, as well as limiting annual increases in a school district’s capital outlay property taxes to 3% or inflation, whichever is less, and removing additional increases allowed from growth.
Expanding the state’s property tax relief program for disabled veterans by increasing the maximum exempt assessed value to the entire assessed value of the property, and offering a refund of property taxes to eligible South Dakotans who qualify but did not apply in the last five years of eligibility.
Allowing more cities to implement a property tax rebate program for owner-occupied properties, such as the one in Sioux Falls, which has such a program in place because it has a unique charter, called home rule, allowing more autonomy in its governance.
Restricting school district opt outs (decisions to exceed state-imposed limits on property tax revenue growth), by making it easier to bring an opt out to a vote of the people by automatic referral, decreasing signature requirements for referral, requiring 60% approval, or increasing the number of days opponents have to gather petition signatures to force a referral.
Creating a fund to replace a portion of property taxes collected by school districts, using any sources of revenue lawmakers put toward the fund.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Oct. 23, 2025.
Stowe’s Visitor Center was a foliage hotspot this season.
More than 10,000 people have entered the visitor center so far in October, compared with 6,500 for the entire month last year, according to guest services coordinator Adrianne Johnson, who said visits have been up all year. The visitor center also doubled its previous one-day visitation record — 581 last year to 1,148 this year.
Those visitors traveled from nearly every continent, with people coming from the United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Greenland, China, Japan, India and Sudan, according to Johnson.
Dispelling notions that Canadian visitors aren’t visiting Stowe, Johnson said the visitor center has seen many tourists from Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, as well as a few first-time visitors from the western provinces.
On any given weekend this month, a line of leaf peepers has snaked through the visitor center toward the bathroom and front desk, behind which Johnson and her colleagues have done their best to answer a litany of questions about Stowe. While the questions may seem similar, each set of guests is unique, according to Johnson.
“They want to know the best photo spots, where they should shop, which of the trails they should hike for the best colors and best views, or the most accessible ways to experience Stowe beyond scenic drives and shopping downtown,” Johnson said. “Sometimes they have no idea what they should do and other times they aren’t sure they can do all they have planned.”
The gondola skyride and auto toll road at Stowe Mountain Resort and the von Trapp Family Lodge are among the most popular destinations for people who pass through the visitor center, Johnson said.
This time of year, roadways and trails with foliage views are also popular. A lot of people are interested in traveling Smugglers Notch, or Stowe’s gravel roads with covered bridges. The Stowe Recreation Path and Cady Hill mountain bike trails attract recreationists.

According to Johnson, Stowe history was another popular topic this foliage season.
The visitor center sends history buffs over to Stowe Historical Society, the Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum, Stowe at Night Lantern Tours and the self-guided hiking tour of historic sites in Sterling Forest.
Johnson and her colleagues give food and beverage recommendations as well. They keep menus at the visitor center and can describe to guests how many crosswalks it takes to reach a restaurant, or where on the rec path it’s located. They regularly receive phone calls from people who get lost on their adventure and frequently give directions over the phone.
“Sometimes guests will come back to tell us how much they enjoyed their time in Stowe, which stands as a testament to how everyone does such a great job welcoming visitors,” Johnson said. “The only real complaints we hear are that they wish there was a little less traffic, a little more parking and a few more public restrooms.”

From frontline service providers to statewide advocacy groups, many organizations that anchor our communities are now fighting to survive. And while headlines often focus on executive leadership, we should be equally attentive to the role of governing boards.
2025 is a historically challenging year for nonprofits, and the road ahead looks far from easy. A combination of federal funding cuts, rising costs fueled by tariffs, and continued attacks on diversity and inclusion initiatives have created a perfect storm of instability. Here in Colorado, where nonprofits generate more than $62 billion in revenue, employ 182,000 Coloradans, and support 80,000 contractors, the stakes couldn’t be higher.
The numbers tell a sobering story.

According to the Nonprofit Finance Fund, 52% of nonprofits have three months or less of cash on hand, and 36% ended 2024 operating at a deficit — the highest rate in a decade. Candid data warns that more than 14,000 organizations could run out of cash within months if funding continues to dry up, threatening millions of jobs and countless services.
In moments like these, attention often turns to the executive director or CEO. Exceptional leaders can unite teams, weather uncertainty, and even help their organizations thrive under pressure. But sustaining mission-driven work in a turbulent environment requires more than strong executives — it demands exceptional boards.
Too often, the nonprofit sector overlooks how critical strong boards are to long-term success. Board performance varies widely, and two issues tend to drive that variation:


Recruiting and retaining directors with the right mix of skills, lived experience, and resources


Building governance systems that actually harness those strengths to set direction, oversee performance, and ensure accountability


Finding board members who bring that balance can feel like hunting for unicorns. Many boards overemphasize one area — like fundraising — while neglecting community representation or relevant expertise. On top of that, nonprofits must fill unpaid roles, often expecting personal contributions, while operating on limited budgets and minimal staff support. It’s no surprise that even high-functioning organizations struggle to assemble “best-in-class” boards.
And even when nonprofits recruit talented directors, ideal composition doesn’t always translate to effective governance. As governance expert Dr. John Carver once observed, “Nonprofit boards are often groups of highly competent and responsible people who, as a group, are neither competent nor responsible.”
That paradox points to a deeper need: building systems that promote group competence. Boards need clear standards for performance, transparent accountability to the communities they serve, and structures that empower — not micromanage — staff.
The takeaway is simple but urgent: Nonprofits must approach board recruitment and engagement with far greater intentionality. With the right mix of skills, representation and training, boards can transform from passive fiduciaries into strategic partners helping organizations navigate this moment of volatility.
There’s also good news. Adversity breeds opportunity, and Colorado is filled with talented, civic-minded professionals who want to make a difference. Serving on a nonprofit board offers a chance to address real-world challenges — from housing affordability to early childhood education to climate resilience — while developing leadership skills and broadening one’s perspective.
For nonprofits, this is the moment to take a hard look at how their boards operate. Revisiting officer and committee roles, clarifying expectations, and strengthening the board’s role as both a strategic visionary and a hands-on partner can turn governance into a true engine of resilience.
Colorado has always prided itself on community — neighbors stepping up for one another, across divides and across the mountains. As the nonprofit sector faces one of its most challenging chapters in decades, that spirit of service and collaboration must extend to the boardroom.
The way forward may not be easy, but it is clear: We need more Coloradans to step into governance, strategy and stewardship — and we need to equip them to lead effectively together. Nonprofits that do will be the ones that not only survive the current turbulence, but emerge stronger, more inclusive, and better prepared to serve the people who count on them most.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-26 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT needs to plan for its energy future, but the view is cloudy",Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/26/ct-energy-future-iso-solar-wind-gas/,"From politics to policies, a lot of uncertainty needs to be resolved before officials can plan to meet CT's energy needs in the future.","Connecticut, along with the rest of New England, has long recognized that its energy future lies in cleaning up the electricity sources in its power grid.
And since the 1990s, with the start of the effort to close the “sooty six” coal and oil plants, cleaning up the air for health and climate reasons has figured equally with saving money by using free renewable sources like sun and wind.
The Trump administration has now made that a lot harder, if not impossible, to do, leaving Connecticut and the entire region with the question: Now what?
Since his first day in office, Trump has set about eliminating future development of onshore and offshore wind on federal property, which effectively means all offshore wind, a form of renewable power Trump openly despises. So far, his administration has issued stop-work orders for two northeast offshore wind installations already under construction, including one for Connecticut. Each resumed construction after about a month, losing millions of dollars in the process.

Trump has also succeeded getting a law on the books to end the widely popular and effective federal tax credits for wind, solar and energy efficiency projects. The administration also threw its weight behind keeping old and dirty coal plants operating longer than previously planned, as well as subsidizing more coal mining. And it is ramping up oil and gas drilling, all in the name of an “energy emergency” that Trump claims exists, even though the country is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.
“Singling out and disfavoring renewable resources while many other resources continue to enjoy favorable tax treatment, including fossil resources — this is not leveling the playing field. This is definitely putting a finger on the scale to disadvantage clean renewable energy resources,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. She called the end of the tax credit “really challenging,” noting the state had a pipeline of projects it had hoped to bring forward, and warned that power prices would likely increase.
“We are doing what we can within our state jurisdictional programs to try to fill in some of the gaps. Obviously, we can’t fill all the gaps,” Dykes said. The state is urging residents, businesses, governmental entities and energy developers to take advantage of the tax credits before many of them disappear at the end of the year. To that end, DEEP issued an expedited request for proposals for solar and onshore wind. Proposals were due Oct. 10. Energy efficiency, especially useful to lower income and environmental justice communities, may feel the impact most acutely.
But it is offshore wind and the massive amount of carbon-free power it can generate, that Connecticut, and really the entire Northeast, had been counting on.
DEEP must sort through all of this uncertainty as it devises its new Integrated Resource Plan, a 10-year look ahead at energy needs and how to meet them, in keeping with the energy and climate policies the state has in place.
But in addition to the federal government’s energy policies, DEEP now has to reckon with the administration’s tariffs, policies on imported critical minerals, supply chain concerns and environmental about-faces. And it risks the potential for retribution if the state defies Trump’s wishes on anything, not just climate policy.
“We are undertaking planning efforts that are intended to try to assess as best we can what some of the different future scenarios will look like in terms of electricity needs, but also climate planning, and to do our best to identify the types of investments that might make sense, on what time horizon, given the change in the federal landscape, but also demand growth and reliability needs and so on,” Dykes said.
The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated.Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president, Oceantic
Dan Dolan is also thinking about what to do now. He’s president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade organization that represents about 95% of the generating capacity in the region.
“Where we stand right now is this muddled middle period,” he said. 
Demand isn’t rising quite as fast as anticipated due to the impacts of solar and energy efficiency on the grid. But there’s also uncertainty about whether that trend will continue without tax credits and whether planned large power source additions will come online on time or at all.
“In terms of new supply sources, I am not seeing meaningful, large-scale new developments happening anytime soon in the region,” Dolan said. “If demand continues to be more muted in its growth, we can handle that.“ 
But he said if demand does go up significantly, despite individual state commitments to transition from fossil fuel power sources to clean and renewable ones, the region might have to look at keeping older, dirtier power sources operating for longer than planned, and that might mean spending more than a little money to upgrade them.
“I’m seeing a lot of investors watching but staying on the sidelines for the moment,” Dolan said.
Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, is co-chair of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. He has been a member of the committee since entering the legislature in 2011, so he has seen the twists, turns and growing pains as the state endeavored to create and implement its first short- and long-term strategies toward renewable energy while addressing climate change, health of citizens and high energy rates.
 “We had, in our procurement planning and our capacity analysis, obviously — in conjunction with (grid operator) ISO-New England — counted on the availability of renewable energy sources to meet our needs,” he said. With the federal government now undermining those supply plans, “That is now a crisis that might have been 10 years away. It is now moving closer and closer to being an actual, impending crisis.
“We’re really low on options, but renewables were a critical part of that picture going forward.”

After many years of delay, a transmission line for hydropower from Canada — the Northeast Clean Energy Connect, NECEC — is months from completion. The power is being purchased by Massachusetts, but it provides a relief valve for the entire New England grid. Breath-holding is underway that the Trump administration will not sabotage it, given the administration’s fraught relationship with Canada as well as the blue-state northeast.
If that and the two offshore wind projects under construction off New England are finished, Dykes said, it will add about 13% of supply.
But any offshore wind beyond that, including projects approved by the Biden administration? ‘Unlikely’ would be a generous assessment of its future.
How dead is offshore wind?
Offshore wind was the big prize. At the end of the Biden administration, 11 projects had been approved nationally that would have provided the power equivalent of nearly 10 Millstone power stations and gotten the U.S. about two-thirds of the way to the Biden goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.
Today, five are under construction. A sixth, South Fork Wind off the eastern tip of Long Island, is completed and began operating about a year ago. The remaining five have been stopped either at early stages or through efforts by the Trump administration to review or outright rescind already-issued federal permits. The administration ended all new lease-area designations and permits.

Of the two under construction that faced stop-work orders, one is Revolution Wind, a joint Connecticut and Rhode Island project that is already 80% complete. While it and the other project — New York’s Empire Wind — have restarted, it’s unclear what might happen to the other three. In the case of Revolution, a legal dispute is still underway.
“I think there’s no question that East Coast states, particularly from the mid-Atlantic up, have to continue to fight for offshore wind,” said Elizabeth Klein, who served as the final Biden administration director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, the entity within the Interior Department responsible for offshore wind.
“There’s no question that what the current administration is doing is damaging to the industry and causing a great deal of harm,” she said. “The looming question is whether or not these companies who are involved will be able to essentially wait it out and invest their time and resources in parts of developing offshore wind that aren’t directly about getting permits and approvals to move forward with new projects.”
Ørsted, the company developing Revolution Wind and other projects, declined to comment on the situation. Avangrid, the company developing Vineyard Wind 1, the only other New England project under construction, did not respond to inquiries.
Klein said the Trump administration claim that it was concerned about national security issues with Revolution Wind is “specious.” She said national security is reviewed in conjunction with several departments throughout every stage of the offshore wind process, beginning with the basic identification of offshore areas that might be suitable for leasing.
“All of those things are considered throughout the process, starting with where these sales first take place,” she said. “This is arbitrary and capricious decision-making. There’s no evidence that there’s something new or unusual or that had not been considered.”
Trump himself has circulated a host of falsehoods about offshore wind — that it causes cancer and kills an outsized number of birds and whales, and that it only runs some of the time. Offshore wind is a technology that is a quarter-of-a-century old, during which time it has operated successfully in Europe. Onshore wind is far older.
A one-year assessment of South Fork Wind by its developer, Ørsted, showed the turbines operated every month of the year. The data, which came from U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration, EIA, showed some of South Fork’s highest outputs were during the winter, when the power is needed most, due to natural gas being used for heating as well electricity. The wind power can prevent electricity price spikes. 

The company also found the turbine foundations were already operating as artificial reefs that supported marine life.
The waters off the northeast U.S. are considered among the country’s best for offshore wind, given the area’s wind speeds and other factors. And since the region doesn’t have any fossil fuel resources, even with steep up-front costs, offshore wind is likely to quickly become cost effective, given the fuel is free.
A recent analysis by Politico of EIA data showed that adding wind and solar to the electricity mix tended to lower the cost of electricity, not increase it, as the Trump administration claims. The Politico analysis said: “Among the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices in June, according to EIA data.”
“Undermining viable sources of energy is inconsistent with the objective of addressing an energy ‘emergency’ and will instead exacerbate energy supply challenges in the Northeast,” said Peter Shattuck, a director at Power Advisory LLC., a joint Canada/U.S.-based energy consultant. Shattuck also is an energy and grid expert with long experience in New England.
He said that, in something of a tarnished silver lining, the Trump blockage will give long-term projects such as transmission extra time to plan. But trying to strategize through all the Trump executive orders, other policy changes and legal battles is bound to make projects more expensive.
“It will likely raise the risk profile and risk premiums that are included in projects,” he said.
“The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated. In our view, it’s holding back a huge source of power that is so desperately needed,” said Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president of communications and external affairs for the educational nonprofit Oceantic, which supports marine renewable energy world-wide including offshore wind.
“The administration talks about an all-of-the-above energy strategy and unleashing American energy dominance. We advocate that offshore wind is a critical component to that strategy.” She said energy needs to be depoliticized so the market, not the government, can pick the winners and losers.
“They’re looking to take apart an entire industry that could support energy demand in the U.S., address national security issues actually, because there is nothing better from a national security perspective on energy supply than generating it yourself at home, here in the U.S.,” Klein said.
Those concerns are not lost on the region’s grid operator, ISO-New England, which released an uncharacteristically blunt warning a couple of days after work stopped on Revolution Wind.
“The ISO is expecting this project to come online and it is included in our analyses of near-term and future grid reliability. Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability,” the statement read. “Unpredictable risks and threats to resources —regardless of technology — that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” it continued.

The Revolution shutdown, along with the tax credit eliminations, unpredictability of Trump energy policies and mandates come just as the ISO was beginning its next 10-year energy forecast. The ISO has already said it expects demand to begin to increase after years of flat or even declining energy needs.
“I think in the short term we still expect to be OK, but it’s kind of in that longer-term and the uncertainty that’s brought into this that’s challenging from a grid planning standpoint,” said ISO spokesman Matt Kakley.
The ISO’s most recent estimates are that region’s annual electricity consumption will increase by about 11% over the next decade. On one hand, the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles and heat pumps could shrink that demand. On the other, their removal for solar systems and energy efficiency could increase it.
In addition to the offshore wind and the NECEC transmission line, the ISO is also expecting the six New England states to move ahead with their first joint development of transmission that, after more than a decade of delay, would finally get onshore wind from northern Maine onto the southern part of the New England grid.
Kakley said six proposals from four different developers were submitted by the Sept. 30 deadline.
Now there is the concern that the need for any federal signoffs could mean further delay, or worse.
Kakley said the ISO always deals with uncertainty when predicting power needs in the face of the complexities of long-term power and transmission projects. “This is a different sort of uncertainty than what we’ve seen,” he said. “We’re really looking at what we can do to enhance our ability to forecast and synthesize all the different factors that are coming in – adding resources, taking resources out, and seeing what that does to the region’s risk profile.”
What about solar?
Solar’s outlook is a little squishier than offshore wind’s. Yes, the coveted 30% tax credits are slated to disappear — for purchased residential systems at the end of this year and in another year for leased and commercial ones.
But costs for solar have come down dramatically over time, making it one of the cheapest forms of power to purchase. It’s also the fastest to install. So it’s possible residential consumers and commercial investors will still consider it a cost effective option.
Another unknown factor is the effect of tariffs and other restrictions on imported components on that low price and availability, as well as to storage systems that can be paired with it.
Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us.Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport
New England has never been a hotbed for huge commercial installations the way the desert southwest and other parts of the country, with large sunny expanses, can be. But rooftop solar for homeowners and on municipal and commercial buildings still has huge potential in the region and can be extremely useful to grid reliability.
It is already more useful than the ISO ever imagined it would be. The ISO says it has prevented brownouts and worse on hot summer days with air conditioning cranked up around the region. It has sent spot market prices into negative territory, especially on sunny days when neither heat nor air conditioning is needed.
“I think there’s capital out there that’s willing to invest,” said DEEP Commissioner Dykes. “I think the question is, what’s the price of solar without federal support, and with tariffs, all these other things coming into play? How does that affect the cost benefit for investment, and how much can we bring those costs down?”
Dykes has a few ideas. One is to look into swapping out solar panels in older systems for new, more efficient panels as a means to increase power output. Another is to use — in her words — already disturbed sites, such as the site of a retired oil-fired generator, for grid-scale storage for excess solar power. Using a preexisting power site would mean there’s already connections to the distribution system.

The biggest open question for Connecticut is what might change in state policy to help make up for the lost tax credit. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority will be weighing that as part of its reconsideration of the rules for the solar program it established. That reconsideration was already planned and underway, with recommendations due in March.
Another policy aspect involves what the state might do legislatively. Unlike most of its neighbors, Connecticut has kept caps on the amount of solar allowed, only loosening some of them in the last few years.
It’s also an open question whether state money would be authorized to make up some of the tax credit shortfall, or whether the state might do as Canada already does and establish an infrastructure bank to leverage private and public money into the financing pipeline, or create a Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator like California recently enacted to access low-cost public financing for such projects as a way to save money overall. The northeast-based advocacy group Acadia Center is helping the six New England states explore financing models.
“My only priority for next session is to set the stage for some extension or enhancement of our solar incentives,” said energy co-chair Steinberg. “This is very important to me as the godfather of solar, as Katie Dykes once called me, and that will be very hard.
“Everybody says it’s over; federal government has killed solar, game over, there’s nothing Connecticut can do. I cannot accept that,” he said. “Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us. To abandon it and not offer any incentives, or to backtrack to the point where the incentives don’t stimulate actual implementation — shame on us.”

But there are other ways to indirectly reduce costs for solar; specifically by streamling permitting, the regulatory process and siting – soft costs, as they are sometimes called.
Massachusetts is already doing that.
“We’re going to have to throw everything we can at permitting, streamlining and reducing soft costs in order to support the affordability of more solar investment for grid-scale projects,” Dykes said.
Kat Burnham, senior principal at the consulting and policy group Advanced Energy United and the state lead for all three southern New England states, said Connecticut and other states need to step up and put some financial skin as well as policy in the game. She pointed to financial tools like the Green Bank. 
“I think what’s important is to make sure that we’re looking at a range of different options and trying to find the right one that fits the particular need or situation,” she said. “What are the tools in our kit, and how do we use those so that we minimize our risk?”
She said there’s a cost to building things. And she said there’s “a cost to inaction … We can’t just sit on our hands and hope for the best.”
DEEP is also in the final throes of accepting bids for innovative energy efficiency and energy upgrade proposals designed to help lower energy bills.
In Massachusetts, for instance, all three major utilities — one of which is Eversource — have agreed to discount electric rates in the winter for people who use heat pumps. While they run on electricity, aside from being efficient, they free up other fuels like natural gas to run power plants. In Connecticut, DEEP is continuing with its focus of lowering the upfront installation costs for heat pumps.
Solutions
Barbara Kates-Garnick, a former Massachusetts energy official, now a professor of practice at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, said the path forward she sees is bringing together utilities, regulators, policy makers, other stakeholders and system participants to explore some of the out-of-the-box solutions. 
“The answers aren’t clear, but I think we have to look at how we regulate, what we regulate, and come to some conversations with the utilities so that we come to a bigger grand bargain,” she said.
She noted, however, the Biden idea of promoting clean energy by providing incentives, funding and jobs — especially in red states — “when push comes to shove, it didn’t work.”
Dykes is not ruling out increasing fossil fuel-run power as part of Connecticut’s solution to the Trump anti-renewables effort.
“It’s a possibility,” she said, noting that Lamont has talked about the need to be open to natural gas as part of a solution.   
If the offshore wind and other projects do not come online, she said, “that will certainly put us into a very challenging place in terms of having an adequate reserve margin and ability to maintain reliability even under some normal weather conditions.
“In light of that, we have to consider what are the alternatives that make the most sense to ensure we can continue to have an affordable, reliable grid in the early 2030s, and natural gas is part of that. Retaining those oil units — is that a solution that we’ll have to rely on?” Dykes said.
Dolan of the Power Generators Association, while also advocating continued use of the region’s gas and oil fleet, doesn’t have specific facilities he’d like to see targeted for reinvestment.
“I think there needs to be a refocus around the meat and potatoes about what is operating today and making sure it continues to operate tomorrow. Now the replacement energy supplies are not coming or not coming anytime soon, and for these power plants to be able to continue operating and operating at higher capacity, reinvestment is going to be necessary,” Dolan said, taking a thinly-veiled swipe at Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which all plan to have net-zero grids in the next 20 to 25 years.
For offshore wind proponents, it’s a rebuilding and refocusing period for the industry, said Oceantic’s Francoeur, who added that more than 100 turbine foundations and towers had been installed in the active offshore wind projects since construction season opened in May.
“The industry is going to weather this administration. Who knows what the next will bring,” she said. “But I think it won’t be the orderly advancement that it once could have been.”
Former BOEM Director Klein said she thinks it’s important for states to keep supporting the offshore wind projects that are underway. 
“It’ll demonstrate to the project developers that there are important entities in the U.S. that are still supportive and want to find a path forward,” she said. “Folks aren’t building this for kicks, because it’s fun. This is about actual energy supply needs … and actually communities, when presented with alternatives, are likely to see that offshore wind is the best of the bunch.”
In the meantime, some of the wind focus may shift to Canada, where the provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador are exploring the development of huge amounts of offshore and onshore wind. Whether New England will be able to access some of that is years and likely many diplomatic twists away.
The Trump administration’s pivot away from wind and solar in particular and back toward fossil fuels is already taking the U.S. globally out of step. Recent data from the European clean energy think tank, data and policy tracker Ember showed that worldwide, in the first six months of 2025, renewables overtook coal power for the first time. And it showed that the growth in solar and wind power outpaced the growth of demand in the same time period. But while fossil fuel generation and its emissions dropped in China and India, the world’s most populated countries, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased in the U.S. Clean generation growth did not keep pace with demand growth in the U.S.

“For a bunch of largely economic reasons, we do still think that solar and wind are going to out-compete fossil fuels,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, though she admitted the Trump actions are slowing down their adoption.
But she wondered whether the industry would be able to pivot enough in the face of multiple challenges to keep investors confident enough to continue. 
“That, I guess, is the big question mark,” she said.
Dykes sees the same challenge. 
“Investors need to know that after a multiyear permitting process, when you have a project that’s 80% constructed, that you can bring it online, sell your power and get your money back,” she said. “And if we can’t guarantee that in the Northeast or in the U.S. anymore, I think that affects the investment climate for all types of resources at a time when we can least afford to increase investor perception of risk.”
The energy committee’s Steinberg added a warning. “That’s an excuse to be paralyzed. That’s an excuse to basically throw up our hands and say, ‘we just have to wait out the feds,’” he said. “That’s going to mean that the ramping up stage is going to be even more complicated on the other side, assuming there is another side.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wind-Turbine-Towers-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-26 05:16:39.133693

It was made by G.S. Smallwood of Chicago. (Library of Congress)When it came time for John Seybold to place the ring on his bride’s finger, he was given a warning: he must not touch any other part of her body or risk death.
That should have been enough to alert the 71-year-old retired Kansas farmer that things were not as they seemed, but love does weird things to people. He proceeded with the ceremony, held in a darkened séance room, and later sat during a festive wedding dinner next to an empty chair reserved for his spectral bride.
Seybold was in love with “Sarah,” the ghost of a girl he had known in his youth back in Ohio, and he trusted the spirit medium who had summoned her from the great beyond.
The medium, 36-year-old Nellie Moore, had been holding classes in spiritualism in Wichita for the curious and the credulous. She had introduced others to their ethereal soulmates, but being matchmaker to Seybold and his gossamer love had been a singular achievement.
She had enjoyed material benefits from her association with the lonely farmer, who had come to her two years before from Liberal and asked to make contact with his long-dead son. In a darkened room with black curtains and a wardrobe that produced such wonders as spirit photos and floating luminous stars, Moore had done just that.
Or at least Seybold thought she had.
Soon, Moore had a new car and furniture and even deeds to the farms Seybold owned, one near Liberal, a couple of hundred miles away in southwestern Kansas, and another across the state line in Oklahoma.
When it finally dawned on Seybold that he’d been taken for his life savings, he did what many disappointed spouses do: He sued. The case must have been one of the strangest ever to come before a Wichita judge, and it made headlines across the country.
“She was really after his money,” author and historian of the strange Tim Shepard told me. “When it was all over, she got him for $7,500.”
Because I’m a diurnal skeptic when it comes to paranormal activity — my answer changes according to how often things go bump in the night — I asked Shepard for his take on Wichita’s “ghost bride” case.
Shepard is the author of two books of Kansas ghost stories, the most recent of which is “Return to the Prairie: More Tales of History and Hauntings.” He’s working on a forthcoming book about hauntings along Route 66, and as research for that book he drove the length of the mother road in a 1934 Hudson Terraplane. He’s given ghost tours across the state, worked at the Red Rocks State Historic Site at Emporia, and at 52 says he’s considered the grandfather of ghost hunting in Kansas.
“Moore’s tactics were very similar to what most spiritualists were doing in the late 1800s,” Shepard said. “The room she held her séances in was painted black, with black curtains, a large wardrobe, and a couple of chairs. She actually told him not to touch the spirits because if he did both he and she would die. Based on the details he gave of meeting Sarah, there was probably somebody hidden in the cabinet.”
At one séance, Moore was instructed to write a $500 check to an organization for wayward girls. He did so, Shepard said, and an otherworldly hand took the check.
While Seybold’s actions may seem foolish now, he seems to have had a serious interest in spiritualism, a belief system that holds the soul survives death and spirits of the dead can communicate with the living.
It all began with the Fox Sisters in western New York in the 1840s, who claimed they could communicate through raps and knocks with the spirit of a murdered peddler. The sisters were soon demonstrating spirit communication at public events that drew hundreds, dividing the press and the public on whether they were genuinely in touch with the spirit world or youthful hoaxers seeking money and attention.
During and after the Civil War, spiritualism surged in popularity. The bloodiest conflict in American history drove many to the comforting belief that they could communicate with their beloved dead. Even Mary Todd Lincoln held séances at the White House. Years after the war, the last photograph taken of Mrs. Lincoln contributed to another spiritualist-related craze, spirit photography. A photo by Boston photographer William Mumler purports to show the ghost of Abraham Lincoln looking kindly down upon her, hands on her shoulders. But it was a cheap photographic trick relying on a double exposure.
Spiritualism was not just a fad in Victorian American, but a serious societal and political movement. The first woman to run for president was Victoria Woodhull, a trance medium and “free love” radical. Kate Bender, of the murderous Bender Family of Kansas, also claimed to be one. While some mediums were perpetrating hoaxes on their credulous victims, often with the use of mechanical tricks such as the magic slate tablet, there were millions of Americans who embraced spiritualism as proof of life after death.
After the First World War, the movement gained renewed popularity. Its chief proponent was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. Despite having created the epitome of the rational detective and being trained as a medical doctor, Doyle was gullible and proclaimed his belief in spirits, including the now-debunked Cottingley Fairies photos.
If Doyle was the champion of mediumship, Harry Houdini was its nemesis. The world-famous magician and escape artist (and friend of Doyle’s) spent much of his career campaigning against charlatanism. He devoted himself to exposing the tricks used by fake mediums. Houdini was an expert in those tricks, because he and his wife Bess had started their careers by using them.
In November 1897, they had appeared at the opera house in Garnett, Kansas, promising to name the killer of a recently murdered local woman. Houdini had already demonstrated an escape from the local jail, according to “The Secret Life of Houdini” by William Kalush and Larry Sloman. Bess had been promoted as a “psychometric clairvoyant” and her séances with Houdini were a hit. But it was all trickery, and in Garnett, according to the authors, Bess feigned a swoon at the climactic moment to avoid actually naming the murderer.
In addition to tricks like the spirit slates, charlatans used rhetorical sleight-of-hand. If a medium failed to materialize a spirit it was because there were unbelievers present. Some, like Nellie Moore, claimed they couldn’t remember anything while under control of spirits. If Seybold’s dead son or the ghost of “Sarah” told the old farmer to do things, such as take $3,000 out of the bank to give to her, she would just have to take other people’s word for it.
“During the wedding ceremony,” Shepard said, “he actually places a diamond ring on the ghost’s finger. And he said it felt solid.” But the old man was so fearful of dying from touching the ghost that he dared not embrace his bride.
Seybold, who had two previous marriages to living women, moved from Liberal to Wichita to be close to his medium and was directed to deed all of his property to her. When the aging farmer said he wanted to consult an attorney, Moore produced the ghost of Samuel B. Amidon, a recently deceased Wichita lawyer. But it seems unlikely the famous jurist would have advised him to trust Moore.
“In the very first séance, Mrs. Moore, in a semi-trance, told the Kansan his son had come to her and was telling her what to say,” reported the San Francisco Examiner in July 1927. He was cautioned that turning on the lights, or otherwise interfering with the spirits, would result in immediate death.
Like many of us, Seybold was susceptible to flattery. He was called “doctor” by those in his medium’s orbit, apparently after healing somebody of a headache, and was told he could quickly become proficient at piano if only he bought one for Moore’s home.
“Here’s a lonely old man,” Shepard said. “He believed he was really in love with a ghost. At trial, he pondered whether he was really married to her or did he need to get a divorce?”
The only time “Sarah” visited him in his bedroom, according to Shepard, Seybold became suspicious. “All he saw of her was her hands,” he said. “But instead of just fading away, she backed out of his room and around the corner. Ghosts don’t do that, do they?”
The case went to trial in November 1927.
Moore claimed that Seybold came to establish a “spiritualistic class room,” but that he soon began claiming healing powers of his own. She admitted she had been the recipient of gifts and loans secured by mortgages, but denied having hoodwinked Seybold. Witnesses testified, however, that Moore had shown them devices used in her séances, including a speaking trumpet with a rubber hose and a star that glowed with luminous paint.
“An Aged Farmer Loses his Battle with the Spooks,” the Wichita Eagle reported Nov. 17. “Superlative advice might come from the trusted sources of the spirit world, but all of Seybold’s business transactions were drawn in black and white.”
The judge, J.E. Alexander, ruled Seybold had no case because he had reached a compromise settlement with Moore before bringing his suit. Any question of spectral evidence was not considered. Even if fraud had been involved in summoning “Sarah,” it was not for the court to decide whether spirit communication was possible or had been practiced by Moore.
While Seybold’s faith in Moore was shattered, he remained an ardent spiritualist. He later married again, this time to a woman named Dollie who was an ordained spiritualist minister.
“He was looking for something,” Shepard said. “I think we all desire to connect with something beyond ourselves.”
In the years he’s been investigating the paranormal, Shepard said, he’s run into only three people he considered true mediums. One of them is a woman in Topeka, and when she does her readings for groups of 30 or 50 people, she doesn’t turn the lights off.
“Real paranormal research isn’t done in the dark,” he said. “They want the lights on. They want to see what’s happening around them. They’re trying to answer the questions we’re still searching for. Where do we go when we die? Is there life after death?”
Shepard said he was both a believer and a skeptic. He says he believes there are spirits out there, but that he doesn’t necessarily believe every story that’s told to him.
But there is still mystery to the “ghost bride” case, he said.
What was Seybold’s son’s name, and how did he die? What was Sarah’s last name? Seybold said he knew her during his youth in Dayton, but there’s no evidence from him of how she crossed over — or whether she existed at all.
We may never know.
Seybold died in 1941, aged 85, of lingering injuries suffered when he was struck by a car a year earlier at Third and Broadway in Wichita. Moore moved to California, where she died in 1974, at San Diego. She was 83.
A century after Seybold attended that first séance in Wichita, it might be easy for us to dismiss him as a fool. Here in the modern and allegedly rational age, we would never fall for such tricks. Right?
But there are people who fall in love with their AI chatbots. This year, a Colorado man “married” his digital companion, with the approval of his real-world wife. And the MIT Technology Review cautions that it’s easy to stumble into an emotional relationship with a digital assistant.
We’re all looking for something, whether it’s “Sarah” or “Siri.”
Perhaps in a hundred years, some cyber columnist will look back and be incredulous that any chatbot could ever fall for an ephemeral something made of meat and bone.

But I hate the leaves!
Sure, they look pretty as they change colors, but when those leaves are spent and fall to the ground, they present real problems for travelers.
Whether you rake your leaves yourself or have someone “blow” them for you, disposing of leaves is a hassle.
Growing up (many years ago) I remember we used to burn our leaves, heedless to the air pollution and health effects. A better alternative is to use a mulching-mower and just grind up the leaves on your lawn, providing much-needed nutrients to your soil. Or try composting them on your own property.


In most towns leaves must be bagged and left curbside for pick-up. In other towns, like Stamford, Middletown and Farmington, you can just rake the leaves into a pile at the curb, loose, and the town will vacuum them up… eventually. Often however, the piles of leaves left curbside get rained on, creating a giant soggy mess, blocking parking and leading to slippery roads. At speeds of 40–45mph, it can take up to three times longer to stop on wet leaves compared to dry pavement, with stopping distance increasing from about 80 feet to over 200–250feet.
But the slippery, almost winter-like driving conditions caused by wet leaves also affect our trains. Their wheels also slip on wet leaves and the trains’ “brains” sense it and go into emergency braking. You’ll know this is happening when the trains suddenly “dump their air”, and brake quickly.
Usually it’s just a minute or so to reset the computer and you carry on. But as in a real emergency, braking and stopping distance are quickly diminished. Which is why railroads take a number of defensive steps to literally clear the tracks.
So bad was the leaf slime problem in years past that Metro-North would have 25% of its fleet out of service as the trains’ brakes locked the wheels to a stop, grinding flat spots on the wheels, requiring repairs.
This is especially a problem on the Danbury branch, a 397-foot uphill climb from Norwalk to “The Hat City”.  Often, locomotive-pulled trains couldn’t get enough traction so that they had to skip stations like Cannondale just to keep momentum to climb uphill.
You see, on a diesel locomotive there are only eight traction wheels making contact with the rails.  But on the electric M8 cars, every car is a locomotive, so contact with the wheels is spread across the entire train, increasing traction…another good reason to re-electrify the Danbury branch.

In years past the railroad used high-pressure water jets to blast the slippery leaf pectin from the rails. But now they have resorted to lasers.
Metro-North’s Laser Train uses high-intensity lasers to remove this contaminated layer in a single pass at speeds up to 60 mph, allowing Metro-North to clean the entire network at least once a day. The train is a rare sight, usually operating overnight to clear the tracks in time for the morning rush hour.
Last year the Laser Train saw a 40% reduction in leaf-related “slip slide” events, leading to the lowest wheel-regrinding costs on record.  
So enjoy the fall and the beauty of the foliage. But beware the dangers, whether driving or training, of “slip sliding away”.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201020_CatHollowPark_KIM_09.jpg,,,2025-10-26 04:16:31.946391

The landscape of housing services […]","AS A FAMILY medicine physician at Boston Medical Center, I have cared for hundreds of individuals and families experiencing homelessness over the last 20 years. The landscape of housing services that I can offer them continues to change, sometimes leaving me with a great sense of hope and possibility and, at other times, more hopeless than ever for my patients’ restoration to health.  
Recently, this seesaw from hope to hopelessness has become more extreme, as decisions by our state leaders seem to be simultaneously pulling in opposite directions when it comes to housing help for those most in need. Two families for whom I provide medical care illustrate the mixed messages of our state’s recent housing policies affecting the state’s most vulnerable residents. 
The first is a husband-and-wife couple in their seventies. I have cared for them both for over 10 years, and while they have both suffered a litany of medical concerns, the husband has been particularly unwell. He came to me with a history of long, uncontrolled high blood pressure and diabetes with an ensuing heart attack and stroke. He also was suffering from an untreated substance use disorder, which helped him paper over his years of untreated anxiety and depression.  
One saving grace when I met him was that he had a safe and stable place to live. From that fundamental base, we could begin to build back his health — delivering medications to his doorstep, connecting him to community services, and treating both his behavioral health concerns and substance use.  
Seven years ago, however, this fundamental base disappeared when he lost his housing. Three years into retirement, he no longer had enough savings for a home. Ironically, he was a retired construction foreman from Boston, where throughout his 30-year career, he had poured his talent into building homes in Roxbury and Dorchester.  
Despite years of working with incredible housing advocates, my patient and his wife have not been able to find a stable place to live and continue to sleep on loved ones’ couches in a distant Boston suburb. As a result, his health has begun to rapidly deteriorate again. It is harder to come in for appointments, to receive his medications when he does not know where he will next be sleeping, and to keep his diabetes medications in the fridge or his diet filled with fresh fruits and vegetables. 
However, in the last few months, things have begun to look at least a little more hopeful for this gentleman and patients like him. Early this year, Gov. Healey released “A Home for Everyone,” the state’s first comprehensive plan to address Massachusetts’s housing challenge. The plan aims to build 200,000 new housing units by 2030. This ambitious goal came a year after the governor signed the Affordable Homes Act, which authorized more than $5 billion in spending and included nearly 50 policy initiatives to spur more housing. In addition, three new commissions have been established to prioritize the residents of these future homes: elderly, extremely low income (earning less than 30 percent of the median income), and individuals with disabilities (physical, sensory, intellectual, mental health or neurodivergent).  
My patient and his wife fit squarely into all three of these categories. Though the housing needs among these groups far outstrip the available supply, since the launch of these state initiatives, I have begun writing letters advocating that, given his medical conditions, he cannot be living with unstable housing — this time with greater hope that these letters will make an impact.  
For another family in my care struggling to find stable housing, the situation has not turned hopeful, but is, in fact, more grim as a result of recent actions by state government.  
They first came to me for a prenatal visit. New to Massachusetts, nobody in the family had a primary care provider and, seeing their complex social needs, I agreed to have all family members (the mother, father, older sibling, and soon to be infant) establish care with me that day.   
When they moved to Massachusetts, this family was able to benefit from our strong 40-year precedent of the “right to shelter” law, signed by Gov. Dukakis in 1983, that mandated shelter services for parents with children and pregnant women.  
Partnering with incredible organizations such FamilyAid, homeless families have been able to find shelter and transition to housing. Through the safety of stable shelter, the mother in this family was able to expend her energy finding and receiving adequate prenatal care — yielding the best possible outcomes for both the newborn and her future health.  
The parents were also able to start securing employment resources as well as educational support and starting to get back on their financial feet. Like many families living in Boston, this one was living on meager wages (though did not qualify as extremely low income).  
Boston, surprisingly perhaps for some, carries the unenviable statistic of having the fifth largest number of families living in poverty among 30 of the largest US cities, with poverty levels 65 percent higher than the national average. This translates to the third highest rate and the fifth highest number of homeless families among comparable large cities. However, the “right to shelter” has now been dismantled through a recent set of mandates from the Healey  administration, limiting the number of shelters available (from a high of 7,500 family shelter units in 2023 to 4,000 units by 2026) as well as imposing a six-month maximum stay in shelters.  
These new rules place this family, and thousands of families like them, at dire risk. In addition to the devastating health outcomes for adults experiencing homelessness, children who are homeless are also at high risk for a myriad of downstream health outcomes. These include such concerns as higher adverse childhood events, higher risk of future behavioral health illness such as depression and suicide attempts, higher rates of future substance use, lower levels of educational attainment, and higher risk of homelessness as an adult.  
The current fiscal constraints of the state and the high cost of shelter services are legitimate concerns. But turning our backs on families in need is not just wrong; it’s shortsighted and works against the long-range goals the governor has set. Children experiencing homelessness are at high risk of becoming the next generation of homeless individuals that Gov. Healey and her team are trying to help in her laudable “Home for Everyone” plan.  
As I bear witness to the housing journeys of these two families and countless others like them, I cannot help but wonder if Massachusetts leaders have lost sight of the whole picture. If we are truly to address the housing crisis in our state, we cannot only work to find housing for our elderly and disabled while simultaneously giving up on our children and families.  
Our health as a Commonwealth depends upon the current and future health of each of us.

Dan Glickman of Wichita proposes Kansas Democrats deepen ties to rural Kansas with economic messages and a dose of self-deprecating humor.,"Former U.S. Rep. Dan Glickman urges Kansas Democrats to expand the party's base into rural communities with messages tied to meat-and-potatoes economic issues that delve into leadership shortcomings of President Donald Trump. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)WICHITA — Fifty years ago, Wichita school board member Dan Glickman turned to his wife and declared interest in running for the U.S. House.
“She said, ‘You don’t have a chance. You don’t have a shot,’ ” he said, recounting a campaign that would precede his 18 years of service in Congress representing the Wichita region.
The Kansas Democrat defeated eight-term incumbent Garner Shriver, a low-key Republican with the misfortune of running for reelection in the post-Watergate era. Glickman’s rookie run for Congress didn’t feature a mountain of cash — he raised a mere $100,000. He attributed success, in part, to relentless shoe-leather campaigning and knocking on 45,000 homes in the district.
“I don’t know if that could happen today, because you need a message, you need money, you need time and you need luck,” he said at an event Saturday sponsored by the Sedgwick County Democratic Party and Wichita State University Young Democrats.
Fast forward 50 years, Glickman said, and the imperative was for Democrats to win control of the U.S. House in 2026. Three of Kansas four congressional seats are held by Republicans, but the Kansas Legislature could redraw maps to make it difficult for Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids to win reelection next year.
Glickman said Democratic control of the House would bring more balance to the federal government because the GOP currently had simultaneous hold of the House and Senate in the second term of President Donald Trump.
“We’ve got to elect a Democratic Congress,” Glickman said. “I’m not going to tell you it’s going to be easy. One of the reasons why is because, perhaps, our messaging isn’t right.”
 
Appeal to rural voters
Glickman said Democrats shouldn’t be a party of culture warriors. The agenda should reflect meat-and-potatoes economic issues that included health care, education and employment, he said. The objective in Kansas, he said, must be to expand Democrats’ base from population centers such as Johnson County and nominate candidates more relevant to interests of rural Kansans.
“We cannot win without appealing to rural, small-town America,” said Glickman, who served as secretary of agriculture under President Bill Clinton. “There’s a lot of raw material there. I don’t know if they’re going to go through with this, but the president is proposing to give … $25 billion to the government of Argentina so they can sell more beef into the United States.”
Trump’s proposal has been condemned by U.S. livestock producers who earned solid returns on beef sales at the same time domestic grain farmers suffered a period of low market prices and high input costs.
The president’s plan to lower grocery prices with imports could be an opportunity for Democratic candidates to speak with rural voters about a topic central to survival of their communities, Glickman said.
“Focus on issues that people care about — economic issues, inflation, cost of health care, research and America’s role in the world,” he said.
 
Negotiation and humor
Glickman, who held his seat in the U.S. House from 1977 to 1995, when ousted by GOP nominee Todd Tiahrt, said debate about fixing what ailed Washington, D.C., shouldn’t be an exclusively partisan conversation. He said there were “loads of good Republicans who don’t like what’s happening either.”
He said the government shutdown should be resolved through negotiation. But the messages Americans see each night on television have been dominated by partisan attacks. Trump should be a key player in working out a deal, he said.
“That’s what the American political system is all about,” Glickman said. “It’s really difficult with a president who doesn’t want to get his hands dirty when getting in there to solve the problem.”
Glickman, who also worked as chief executive officer of the Motion Picture Association of America, said Democrats could better connect with voters by deploying a sense of humor. The idea isn’t to be stand-up comedians, he said, but to offer voters a slice of self-deprecating humor that illustrates personal life lessons.
He pointed to Presidents Ronald Reagan and Franklin Roosevelt as role models in this regard, and criticized the current array of national politicians as humorless.
“I have found that almost every successful person — every leader that is successful in politics or whatever field — has a decent sense of humor,” Glickman said. “They could laugh at themselves. I have never seen (Trump) laugh at himself. Only at other people.”
He said recent No Kings rallies across the United States successfully brought unity among people frustrated by Trump. His praise elicited a round of applause from more than 100 people at the luncheon on the Wichita State University campus.
“Are you going to follow up? If you don’t, they’re a total waste of time,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dan-Glickman-1-wichita-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-25 17:56:47.694699

Republicans expect to craft political districts more to their liking if they receive a favorable ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court later this year.,"The Louisiana Senate voted along party lines to move state election dates in 2026 back by about a month. (Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)The Louisiana Senate voted along political party lines Saturday to push back 2026 election dates in an effort to leave as much time as possible to redraw Louisiana’s congressional map. Republicans expect to craft political districts more to their liking if they receive a favorable ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court later this year. 
The GOP Senate majority, made up entirely of white senators, outvoted the Democrats, all but one of whom are Black, 27-9, on Senate Bill 1. The legislation moves the political candidate qualifying period and two spring election dates for congressional primary contests back by approximately one month. 
Elections scheduled for April 18 and May 30 would move to May 16 and June 27 respectively.
The delayed election timeline will create more opportunity for the Republican-controlled legislature to draw new U.S. House districts where Black voters, who overwhelmingly vote for Democrats, have less influence over who gets elected.  
Louisiana’s current congressional map, passed in early 2024, is made up of six House seats, including two districts with a majority Black electorate. Those two seats are held by Black Democrats, Troy Carter of New Orleans and Cleo Fields of Baton Rouge. 
Should the Supreme Court allow it, state lawmakers will likely approve a new congressional map that includes one or zero majority-Black districts, even though the state’s population is approximately one-third Black. This would make it harder for Black officials and Democrats to be elected to Congress.

Republicans are hopeful the Supreme Court will hand down a ruling in the Callais v. Louisiana case that not only allows them to draw new maps but on an expedited schedule. 

While Supreme Court decisions typically come out in late spring or early summer, Louisiana Republican officials want justices to issue a ruling in this case by the end of December. 

The accelerated timeline would allow state lawmakers to draw new U.S. House seats in time for the next congressional election in November. If the decision comes out later, lawmakers would likely have to wait another two years — the length of a term in the U.S. House — to use new political districts.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The Supreme Court will not necessarily rule by the end of the year, however. Even if it does, Louisiana would probably not be obligated to change its political map in time for the November election contests. 
Previously, when the Supreme Court has struck down election maps as unconstitutional, it has not required that new maps be drawn and used if the election process is already underway or about to start. The court has permitted – even required – states to wait to use their newly compliant maps in the next cycle, which would be 2028 for Louisiana’s U.S. House seats.
But President Donald Trump has urged Republican officials in states across the country to redraw their congressional districts to favor the GOP ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. More Republican districts would increase the chances the U.S. House would remain under Republican control and aligned with Trump. 
In Louisiana, GOP lawmakers have tried to downplay arguments from Democrats that their efforts to push back the election dates are related to Trump’s push to have more Republican seats. 

Republicans have said the moving of the election dates is simply allowing more time to get clarity from the Supreme Court over redistricting requirements. 

“We could draw a 6-0 map. We could draw a 5-0 map [that removes majority-Black districts]. That’s not what we’re here doing,” said Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, a white Republican from Port Allen and sponsor of the legislation, ahead of the Senate floor vote Saturday. 
Democrats countered that the election dates were being moved for no other reason than to accommodate the Republicans’ desires to pass a map with fewer majority-Black districts faster. 
“Remember when President Trump so boldly stated to the state legislatures to go and get me more Republican congressional districts?” Sen. Katrina Jackson, a Black Democrat from Monroe, said Saturday. “We’re not here for drawing districts, but it seems like we’re here in the hopes that the Supreme Court will rule a certain way.”
Moving election dates will affect more than just next year’s congressional races. 

Municipal elections and ballot initiatives that were supposed to be voted on at the same time as the congressional primaries will also be pushed back in anticipation of the Supreme Court ruling. 

Depending on what the Supreme Court decides, it’s possible that some municipalities could also redraw their political districts ahead of elections to provide Black voters with less influence at the local level too, Sen. Gerald Boudreaux of Lafayette, who is the head of the Senate Democratic Caucus, said in an interview this week. 
Lawmakers also had to write an exception into Senate Bill 1 that allows for local ballot measures concerning bonds, debt and taxes to move forward on the newly proposed election dates in May and June if those measures were initially pegged to current election dates that could be eliminated. 
On Saturday, the Senate also voted to push back the election dates of five proposed constitutional amendments from April 18 to May 16  through Senate Bill 2. These amendments include those that affect public school teacher compensation, the mandatory retirement age for state judges and a reworking of state civil service. 
Democrats argued that these adjustments are evidence the legislature is acting too swiftly to adjust elections. 
“I wish that this debate was as simple as what some people are trying to fashion – saying this is about moving dates,” Sen. Sam Jenkins, a Black Democrat from Shreveport, told his colleagues. “It’s really not that simple.”
Republicans said the changes they are to making are not consequential.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/electionday2022-009-1-1024x6831742327334-1.jpg,,,2025-10-25 16:01:34.157887

Smyrna defeated St. Georges, 44-12, Friday night earning its third win in a row — all against district opponents.  
The Eagles offense performed well in the passing game and the running game amassing over 200 yards on the ground and through the air. It was the passing game that got their offense going in the first quarter.
Junior quarterback Drew Marks and senior receiver Phoenix Henriquez connected four times on Smyrna’s opening drive as the offense traversed 64 yards down the field. Henriquez’s final catch of the drive was a nine yard touchdown that scored the game’s first points. 
The Eagles scored on their subsequent possession on a diving effort from senior Kahmaj Kearney at the goal line. Henriquez completed Smyrna’s first half scoring with a rushing touchdown right before halftime.
The Hawks scored once in the first half cutting the Eagles lead down to ten with less than six minutes remaining until halftime. 
Quarterback Jayden Goffigan and receiver Jordan Triplett connected on a 33-yard throw down the right side of the field that brought the offense to the Smyrna 16 yard line. Junior running back Joel Buck finished the drive with a two yard touchdown run off a direct snap, cutting into Smyrna’s lead. 
The Hawks scored again on their first possession after halftime driving 68 yards down the field. Junior running back Derek Foxmoor scored the touchdown with a two yard run up the middle from the shotgun formation. 
Smyrna scored the final three touchdowns of the second half all of which came on the ground. Henriquez, Marks and freshman Terrell Ingram all ran for a touchdown in the second half helping Smyrna to its second highest point total this season. 
The Eagles have two more games remaining in the regular season with a home matchup against Dover scheduled for November 1 and a road matchup against Sussex Central on November 7.
The Hawks will face Sussex Central before the Eagles with their matchup scheduled for November 1.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Department of Social Services plans to revamp its opioid treatment and prevention grants, with a three-tiered system including “transformative” grants up to $2 million.
Department officials announced the new grant structure using opioid settlement funds at Tuesday’s Board of Social Services meeting.
“Just trying to put some of the same window dressing on some of the same old methodologies isn’t what we’re after,” Secretary Matt Althoff said. “We’re looking for true innovation, a true effort to earnestly fill the gaps that exist today.”
South Dakota is projected to receive just under $99 million in settlement funds by 2038, based on the department’s settlement dashboard. The money comes from a series of nationwide settlements with the makers and sellers of the opioid painkillers that contributed to a spike in drug addiction and overdoses.
The majority of that funding will be distributed and spent by the state, while 30% will be used by local governments.
The state has received about $23 million in its share of the funds so far, with about $11.7 million uncommitted. The department plans to reserve about $12 million in a trust fund to sustain the state’s opioid abatement plan, in case federal funding for other substance use-related grants ends. That equates to about 25% of each disbursement received over the life of the settlement.

Most spent funds have gone toward the community grant program, with the state using part of its share to give additional money to local entities and organizations, followed by the prescription drug monitoring program, naloxone distribution (naloxone is a medication used to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose) and overdose follow-up programs.
Brenna Koedam, behavior health division chief, said there is an increased number of referrals for opioid use and other substance use disorder treatment services, increased understanding in how to handle substance use among providers, reduced burnout among first responders and law enforcement, and reduced stigma surrounding opioid use disorder in the last few years. She did not explain to the board how most of those achievements were calculated or measured, though she attributed them to programming assisted by the settlement fund.
Opioid related deaths in South Dakota decreased to 39 in 2024, compared to 2023’s peak of 47. According to the state’s Drug Overdose Surveillance and Epidemiology data, 844 South Dakotans visited emergency departments for suspected drug overdoses — opioid and other — in the first six months of this year. That’s down by one visit compared to the same timeframe in 2024 and up by 44 compared to 2023. 
Attorney General Marty Jackley criticized the department in August for not spending the opioid settlement funds as quickly as he wanted, and not sending enough of the money to the city governments of Sioux Falls and Rapid City. Althoff said at the Tuesday meeting, and in response to Jackley’s comments in August, that the department needed to spend COVID-19 relief funds that were expiring before they spent more settlement dollars.

Koedam announced Tuesday that the department will restructure its community grants into three tiers:

Small grants of up to $5,000 for immediate or short-term projects, offered on an ongoing basis and focused on prevention, such as funding a speaker on opioid use and risks at a school district.
Mid-size grants of up to $50,000, offered twice a year, intended for projects that can be completed in a year.
“Transformative” grants of up to $2 million intended for regional innovation, which could include workforce development to attract more workers to the behavioral health field, based on a letter of interest from potential grant recipients.

Althoff said South Dakota’s substance use problems extend beyond opioids, citing meth and alcohol as other examples.
“The opioid dollars will not necessarily be able to just solve the opioid problem,” Althoff said. “We’re trying to be very creative about how we do this in ways that — even if opioid isn’t the first level of addiction, it might be even tertiary involvement — it’s all bridged and interrelated.”
Koedam added that the department signed contracts with Colorado-based Steadman Group and the University of South Dakota totaling just under $325,000 to conduct a statewide opioid needs assessment, which will identify gaps in South Dakota’s treatment and prevention infrastructure. The needs assessment is expected to be completed by spring 2026.

Fans at Ole Miss gather at The Grove for elaborate setups and the Walk of Champions. At LSU, tailgates feature Cajun cuisine.","In the South, there is only one thing that can rival college football itself: the party before kickoff.
Pinpointing the exact origins of tailgating is near impossible. Some trace it to Nov. 6, 1869, when Rutgers and New Jersey (later Princeton) played in the first college football game. Others credit Green Bay Packers fans, who folded down pickup truck tailgates for makeshift pregame seating during the team’s inaugural season in 1919.
Arguments over who has the best tailgating traditions are as old as the sport itself and the creativity is as varied as the fans themselves. From Bevo Boulevard (Texas) and the Tiger Walk (Clemson) to the Vol Navy (Tennessee) and the sailgating on boats outside Husky Stadium (Washington), the options are endless.
The tradition runs deep in the South, and few do it like Ole Miss and LSU.
It’s hours before kickoff. Ole Miss is hosting LSU in its biggest game of the season so far, and tens of thousands of fans gather at The Grove, a 10-acre plot in the center of campus surrounded by oak trees. The grassy area has transformed into a sea of red and blue tents decked out with chandeliers and elaborate spreads.

Anticipation builds for The Walk of Champions – one of the program’s longest-standing traditions where coaches and players are met with applause and “Hotty Toddy” cheers as they exit the buses and pass under the archway en route to the stadium.
Elizabeth Heiskell, a caterer from Oxford, is at the center of it all. She’s become a Grove regular since marrying into the fan base, and she wouldn’t want it any other way.
“It is a beautiful space right in the middle of campus with gorgeous trees that have been here forever,” Heiskell said. “There’s just really no place like it. It’s not like we’re, you know, dropping a tailgate in some parking lot. I mean, it is so green and so beautiful.”
Like most Grove goers, Heiskell is dressed for the occasion. She’s wearing a red and white blouse, gold jewelry and a fabulous pair of red sunglasses that tie the whole look together. This isn’t an outfit she just threw together; gameday getups are carefully curated.
“Of course everybody gets dressed up. I mean, we shop all year long for our game clothes,” she said. “When they say it’s a red game, honey, we’re all gonna wear red.”
The pregame buzz carries into Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, where nearly 68,000 fans watch Ole Miss hold off LSU for a 24-19 victory.
Two weeks later, crawfish boils and Cajun spices replace the chandeliers and elegance of The Grove as the party moves 330 miles South to Baton Rouge.
Fresh off a bye week, LSU is hosting South Carolina in Death Valley, where home-field advantage is alive and well, thanks to a passionate fan base of their own.

Gameday preparation begins early for Wayne Breaux, a fisherman from New Iberia, Louisiana. He drives up to his condo near campus on Thursday night, reserves his spot on Friday and begins the setup early Saturday. After 35 years, his tailgate has become quite the attraction. Breaux regularly welcomes football, basketball and softball coaches and recruits.
“Tailgating is an event in itself. A lot of people, even if they don’t have tickets to the game, they’ll come out and enjoy the atmosphere, the friendship and the camaraderie,” Breaux said. “I love the football game itself, but tailgating is a very close second.”
Like every good tailgate, Breaux’s setup centers around the menu. His spread features speckled trout, red fish, steak tips, pork loin, and of course, jambalaya and boudin.
“We got one rule,” Breaux said. “If you leave here thirsty or hungry, it’s your fault. It’s not mine.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/21135351/AP25290045208644.jpg,,,2025-10-25 08:16:40.899223

“Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go,” protestors chanted in the middle of Times Square, among a sea of signs that read “love reigns not kings,” “gays against faux-king Trump,” “we stand with … our trans family,” and “the future is coming.”
On Saturday, Oct. 18, independent analysts estimated that the No Kings March drew between
5 and 8 million people, and organizers say over 7 million people attended 2,700 events across all 50 states. The event, which was organized to push against the rise of authoritarianism in the U.S., was the largest single-day protest in America since 1970.

Among the crowd were countless LGBTQ people, fighting back against an administration that has introduced a litany of anti-LGBTQ executive orders and used vile rhetoric to denigrate queer people.
This backsliding of LGBTQ rights, according to experts, has a deep connection to authoritarianism, with research showing that when governments weaken protections for queer and trans people, they often turn to broader democratic institutions next.
“Threats to democratic institutions and threats to LGBTQ rights are mutually reinforcing, generating a vicious cycle that strengthens authoritarian control,” said Ari Shaw, director of International Programs at the Williams Institute. “Increased persecution of minority groups, including LGBTI people, is itself evidence of democratic backsliding by indicating the erosion of liberal democratic norms meant to protect minority rights.”
 Legal Abuse of Power

One of the ways the Trump administration’s abuse of power has been most evident is through its legal actions.
On Jan. 20, Trump signed 26 executive orders, the most signed by any president on their first day. Since then, he’s penned hundreds more—more than President Joe Biden signed during his entire four-year term. In many cases, he bypassed Congress in the process, leaving elected legislators on the sidelines.
Many of these actions have targeted LGBTQ rights. Trump has used executive orders to ban transgender people from serving in the military, limit participation of transgender students in school sports, and direct federal agencies to recognize only two sexes.
He’s also slashed HIV funding at a staggering rate. Uncloseted Media estimates that the National Institutes of Health has terminated more than $1 billion worth of grants to HIV-related research, including 71% of all global HIV grants.
“The specific reason that I’m protesting is actually on the shirt I’m wearing,” said Brooklynite Jeffrey Cipriano. “My best friend works for an organization called AIDS United. … His job is to travel the country and help people get AIDS medication, specifically trans and unhoused community members. But his job is at risk.”
Executive orders are meant to direct how existing laws are implemented—but Trump has ignored democratic norms, filling agencies with loyalists, using orders to go after opponents, and pushing the limits of what the law allows.
“The President is directing various executive branch officials to adopt policy that has either not yet been adopted by Congress or is in violation of existing statutory law,” said Jodi Short, professor of law at UC Law San Francisco. “The analogy to a king … is the sheer consolidation of executive branch power in one individual.”
“Illegality has been rampant,” added Dave Owen, Short’s colleague. “People are often cynical about government … but most of the time, the executive branch takes the law seriously. This administration has broken with those traditions.”
 Revolt Against Executive Orders

Many Americans have recognized this. A survey from April found that 85% of Americans agreed that the president should obey federal court rulings even if he doesn’t like them.
In response to Trump’s overreach, more than 460 legal challenges have been filed across the country challenging his executive actions. One is a federal lawsuit by Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation that challenges the constitutionality of the transgender military ban. Another lawsuit challenges Trump’s order withholding funds from medical providers offering gender-affirming care to minors.

Both lawsuits are why 17-year-old Zoe Boik joined the protest with her dad. “Obviously, I’m disappointed and kind of helpless because there’s nothing I can directly do to change or impact anything that’s going on,” said Boik, who identifies as pansexual and gender fluid.
 LGBTQ Rights and Democratic Backsliding

This type of blatant discrimination is often a key sign of a country moving closer to authoritarianism. A 2023 research paper by Shaw and colleagues found that anti-LGBTQ stigma may contribute “to the erosion of democratic norms and institutions.”
“The level of acceptance of LGBTQ people is closely associated with the strength of democracy in a country,” said Shaw. “In some cases, rising anti-LGBTQ rhetoric or policies preceded a broader decline in democracy.”
Examples include Brazil under Bolsonaro and Poland under the Law and Justice Party, both of which saw LGBTQ rights regress alongside democratic erosion.
When it comes to LGBTQ rights, Trump has mirrored these leaders—even though most Americans don’t support it. A 2022 survey found that 80% of Americans favor laws protecting LGBTQ people against discrimination.
“The definition of an authoritarian system is a system where power is consolidated in one individual whose power is unchecked by any other institution,” said Short. “And I fear that’s the direction this administration is trying to move us.”
 Attacks on Higher Education

Another common tool in the authoritarian playbook is attacking higher education.
Trump has pressured top universities to eliminate DEI programs and inclusive policies for transgender athletes, calling them “ideological capture.”

“I’m here because I’m angry and I feel that we aren’t angry enough,” said Maddy Everlith, a gender studies major at Pace University. “Being a woman of color in America and having so many intersectional identities … I want to stand up and advocate for other people.”
 Scapegoating Transgender People

Beyond laws and policies lies a vile rhetoric used to scapegoat trans Americans. During the 2024 campaign, Trump spent roughly $215 million on anti-trans ads—more than five times what he spent on the economy.
“What Trump has done is he’s taken people that haven’t done anything wrong and has turned them into scapegoats,” said Lars Kindem, a retired pilot. “His language is hateful, petty, mean and hurtful.”
 Christian Nationalism

This scapegoating has fueled Trump’s alliance with white evangelical Protestants—the only major denomination in which most believe society has gone too far in accepting transgender people.
“For Christian nationalists, attacking LGBTQ rights is the first pillar in destroying civil rights for all,” said Heidi Beirich of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “This has happened in countries like Hungary and Poland, and now it’s happening here.”
 Moving Forward

As the country bleeds toward authoritarianism, LGBTQ protestors are encouraging people to use their voice—something the queer community knows well. A 2012 survey found that queer folks are 20 times more likely to be active in liberal social movements than their straight, cis counterparts.
“It is imperative that people continue to pay attention,” said Short. “We have to engage in political action and resist inappropriate assertions of authority and continue to show up and vote for our democracy.”
Seventeen-year-old Zoe Boik is ready. She remembers crying the day after Trump won in 2016. Now, she’s eager to vote in the next election.
“My fears about Trump don’t stem specifically from me being queer, but from his authoritarianism as a whole,” she said. “I am scared about how far he will move into dictatorship, and my biggest fear is that our right to vote will be compromised.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8-1024x737.png,,,2025-10-25 07:16:56.258027

Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said the decision left him feeling “extremely disappointed.” Crowley spoke from his office at the Milwaukee County Courthouse Friday, saying that the funds would go towards repairing parks, government buildings, and other public infrastructure damaged by the so-called flooding which swept communities two months ago. 
When the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) initially sent disaster relief after the floods, Crowley said he “commended the Trump administration,” and that “I thought that we were putting politics behind us in making sure that communities can recover.” Crowley said that by Friday over $123 million in financial assistance has been distributed to county residents for home repairs.

But it’s not just local businesses and homes that were damaged. The rainfall, which fell in a torrential downpour on the weekend of Aug. 9, left Hart Park in Wauwatosa underwater. Downed trees and other debris were strewn along roadways. Cars, swept away by the overnight flooding, were abandoned in the street for days. 
Over 1,800 homes were left damaged or destroyed, with an estimated $34 million in damage to public infrastructure. “The preliminary damage assessments show that the damage that we saw throughout all six counties is more than significant,” said Crowley. “Roads and bridges that our residents rely on sustained substantial damage. Public buildings and facilities were not only washed away, but in some cases had significant mold contamination that will also impact the public health and safety of our residents. Our parks and our trails, they were damaged, which will harm our quality of life in the short term, as well as the long term, and the list goes on.”
Crowley pointed to Hart Park as a prime example of an area with lingering damage additional funds could remedy. As the disaster relief is denied, Milwaukee County is also in the middle of crafting a budget which will not be padded by COVID-era federal funds. County supervisors are currently debating amendments to Crowley’s proposed $1.4 billion budget, which carries cuts to transit services and eviction legal defense programs and increases property taxes by 4.1%.
“We’re already making challenging decisions about funding not only programs and services, but future infrastructure spending, and capital projects that are needed not only now, but in the years ahead. Today’s action by the Trump administration will send us back even further. It will delay progress in our recovery efforts from this natural disaster, and it will place a financial burden solely on local taxpayers who have already had to sacrifice so much as a result of these floods.”

Gov. Tony Evers issued a statement Friday saying he filed an appeal asking the Trump administration to release more than $26.5 million in public assistance for infrastructure repair  it has denied. “Denying federal assistance doesn’t just delay recovery, it sends a message to our communities that they are on their own, and that the Trump administration doesn’t think over $26 million in damages to public infrastructure is worthy of their help,” Evers said in a press statement. “I couldn’t disagree more. The federal government should not expect our communities to go through this alone, and we are going to fight tooth and nail to ensure they get every possible resource to rebuild and recover. We are hopeful that the Trump administration will reconsider this decision, so we can make sure folks have the resources and support they need.”
The denial comes during a federal government shutdown that has lasted nearly a month. In a letter to Evers, FEMA said that while the flood damage was significant, assessments determined that “the public assistance program is not warranted.” 
The storm and flooding was dubbed a “thousand year storm” and dumped record-breaking amounts of rain essentially overnight. Wisconsin now has 30 days to send an appeal. 
“Turning your back on families facing washed-out roads, damaged schools, and flooded homes because they’re not seen as political allies is unconscionable,” said Kerry Schumann, executive director of Wisconsin Conservation Voters in a statement. “These communities didn’t cause this crisis, but they’re living through it. They deserve leadership that helps them recover and protects them from the next flood, not one that deepens the damage.”

“By denying federal assistance, the Trump Administration is leaving Wisconsin communities to fend for themselves,” said U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. “No community can pick up these pieces alone, and Wisconsinites need support so they can rebuild and be on the road to recovery. I hope my Republican colleagues will join me in calling on the Trump administration to step up to the plate and be here for Wisconsin communities left in the lurch.
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, Democrat of Milwaukee, also expressed  frustration. “Our state was forced to wait nearly two months for the Trump administration’s ill-advised and disappointing decision,” Moore said in a statement. “Communities in Milwaukee, which are still recovering, are counting on federal assistance to help fund critical repairs to public roadways, buildings, vehicles, and equipment that were severely damaged.” Nevertheless, Moore said, “Wisconsinites do not give up.” 
Rep. Kalan Haywood (D-Milwaukee) also issued a statement condemning the denial. Haywood said that the Trump administration “is sending a clear message to the people of Wisconsin – ‘we do not care about you’.” Haywood added that, “these funds are so badly needed to repair infrastructure, businesses, and schools. These are all essential to reverse the trend of President Trump’s faltering economy. Our residents pay millions in federal taxes and they should not face these hardships alone.” 
Haywood added  that Wisconsin’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) “is on the verge of drying up.” while  “communities are left to rebuild major infrastructure on their own, it is disappointing that the White House is choosing a $300 million ballroom ego-project over the well-being of the people of our state. It is my hope that FEMA reconsiders this decision to ensure that Wisconsin residents have a chance to recover and prosper. Wisconsinites deserve better and should demand better.”
Two bills related to disaster relief (AB-580 and AB-581) have been introduced to the Wisconsin Legislature as communities process the news. One bill would require the Department of Military Affairs to create a program to award grants to individuals and businesses severely impacted by disasters related to a state of emergency declared by the governor. Grants of no more than $25,000 could be awarded under the bill to an individual to help repair a residence, and grants of no more than $50,000 would go to businesses. The other bill would also work through the Department of Military Affairs, and would appropriate $10 million in  disaster assistance grants for individuals, and $20 million in grants for businesses in the 2025-26 fiscal year.

John Jagler (L) and Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R). Republicans scolded State Superintendent Jill Underly for not appearing at a hearing prompted by a Cap Times investigation of teacher sexual misconductU.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, the leading Republican candidate for governor of Wisconsin, held a press conference on the steps of the state Capitol Thursday to declare his outrage over a Cap Times investigation that tracked more than 200 cases of alleged child sexual abuse by Wisconsin teachers and suggested a lack of accountability and transparency by the state Department of Public Instruction. 
Bolstering Tiffany’s case, State Superintendent Jill Underly decided to skip Thursday’s Senate hearing on the controversy. Instead, Underly traveled to Indiana to accept an award from her alma mater, leaving DPI staff to endure questioning by members of a state Senate committee eager to hang child sex abuse allegations around the necks of DPI, Gov. Tony Evers and other Democrats.
Recognizing an opportunity, Tiffany parachuted in to add his voice to the chorus. “You will never have to wonder if I will show up,” Tiffany declared. “I will always be there for Wisconsin and our children, even when state Democrat leaders fail to do so.” He drew a tenuous connection between the accusation that DPI has provided insufficient oversight of predatory teachers to bashing the state agency for “lower standards” in schools and for embracing diversity, equity and inclusion. ”DPI spent two hours a week creating a DEI plan, but couldn’t find the time to investigate these cases,” Tiffany declared. He promised that if he’s elected governor he will ensure proper misconduct investigations of teachers and create a public dashboard showing why they lost their licenses, “most of all,” he added, “we’re going to educate kids, not indoctrinate.” 
As soon as Tiffany finished converting the story about abuse by teachers into red meat for his campaign, state Democrats jumped into the mosh pit, accusing him of hypocrisy because he voted against releasing the Epstein files. 
None of this mud-slinging sheds any light on what’s happening to kids in Wisconsin schools or how the state can better protect them.
Several of my daughters’ friends at Madison East High School were targeted by David Krutchen, a popular teacher who had close relationships with many of his students and who, it turned out, spent years spying on girls during overnight field trips, placing hidden cameras in hotel bathrooms and bedrooms. The Krutchen case took a heavy toll on those kids and their families. It was a shocking, disgusting betrayal of the students by a trusted adult. For years the court hearings dragged on, and traumatized students had to keep showing up to testify. Finally, Krutchen went to prison.
According to the Cap Times story, which includes interviews with some of Krutchen’s victims, DPI “shielded” more than 200 cases of teacher sexual misconduct from the public. That frame could lead you to believe that DPI was protecting pedophile teachers the same way the Catholic Church spent years shuffling pedophile priests around to avoid. But that’s not the impression I got from DPI’s testimony. In a video Underly posted on Facebook, and in her deputies’ testimony to legislators, the agency insisted that allowing teachers to voluntarily give up their licenses is not a “loophole” to end embarrassing investigations but ensures teachers who face misconduct charges are entered into a national database that can be accessed by other state education departments.
The Cap Times story, aided by a successful open records request, does give the sense that DPI has a slipshod system for keeping track of misconduct investigations, with just two staff people in charge of hundreds of cases, information stored on a Google spreadsheet, and 20% of cases where it’s unclear what type of misconduct was investigated. 
In its defense, DPI points out that the Legislature cut the agency’s budget by millions of dollars and they are doing their best. That point would have sounded better coming from Underly herself, instead of her deputies who had to fill in because she couldn’t bother to appear in person to demonstrate she actually cares about these horrible cases. 
Underly’s failure to show up and address the repercussions of the story is inexcusable. As the top educator in the state, she needs to reassure students and their parents that she cares about them and is on their side.
But the Republicans rushing to connect Underly’s weak leadership to all of their talking points about schools are equally unhelpful.
Ever since former Gov. Scott Walker began heaping scorn on teachers, painting them as lazy, overpaid and incompetent while ramming through his explosively controversial union-busting Act 10 law, the GOP has weaponized divisive distrust of teachers and public schools. Aided by a powerful private school choice lobby, they’ve hammered away on the idea that private schools are better and siphoned millions of dollars in taxpayer support for public education out of public classrooms and into the private sphere.
“We are going to make sure that Wisconsin goes back to the top of the game,” Tiffany declared Thursday, adding, “We are behind Mississippi in educational attainment. Less than one in three kids can read at grade level in the fourth grade in the state of Wisconsin. Is that not a disaster? That will not be the case if I’m elected as governor, we will have accountability and we will have higher standards.”
But the defunding of Wisconsin public schools that began under Walker and continues today is directly tied to the decline in quality. It’s not laziness or pedophilia that plague our school system. It’s deliberate neglect.
Republican calls for “higher standards” and “accountability” have, over the past two decades, been accompanied by disinvestment and the steady expansion of a publicly funded private voucher school system.
Ironically, the private schools Republicans champion in the school choice program have no teacher licensing requirements and DPI has no way to oversee or investigate their employees. Nor are private schools subject to Wisconsin’s open records laws. We will never get to see how they handle cases of employee misconduct.
There’s a reason it’s a big story when adults abuse the trust of children. It’s despicable behavior. Politicians who ignore or capitalize on that crime for political gain do us no good.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)As the regulatory conservation associate for the Idaho Conservation League, I have reviewed hundreds of pollution control permits for industrial facilities across Idaho. These permits allow facilities like factories and mines to conduct operations while being protective of public health, clean water and clean air. In particular, I have closely followed and pushed back against the development of Perpetua Resource’s Stibnite Gold Project. 
At central Idaho’s Stibnite Gold Mine, crews start initial construction 

I was encouraged by my colleague Dr. Ian von Lindern’s informative and expert-based commentary regarding the troubling health effects this mega-mine presents. I was surprised to see former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, Andrew Wheeler, join the debate and directly address Dr. von Lindern’s comments in a rebuttal commentary. 
While engaging in tit for tat op-ed commentary might normally be unproductive, I feel it’s important to address the hypocrisy of his conclusion that “Idaho families deserve decisions grounded in science, transparency and truth,” as his opinion is neither scientific, transparent nor truthful. 
Mr. Wheeler’s “science” comments echo Perpetua’s testimony before the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. I heard these same arguments as both Dr. von Lindern and I testified during the same administrative hearing process Mr. Wheeler references. While I am unsure how much Mr. Wheeler familiarized himself with the complex air quality “science” of the issue, I am sure Idaho families should not trust Mr. Wheeler’s opinion on this matter. 
Mr. Wheeler’s claims are startling coming from an EPA director who consistently undermined science and transparency. As the Union of Concerned Scientists outlined back in 2019, during his time as EPA director, Mr. Wheeler sidelined and ignored scientists, proposed restricting scientific data, recommended unsafe levels of drinking water contaminants, and rolled back environmental protections. His rebuttal commentary is simply a continuation of uninformed and misleading attacks on science and the health of Americans in the interest of industry. 
Within his commentary, Mr. Wheeler touts his former work as the head of the EPA in “protecting Americans from toxic exposures” but fails to mention his current connection to Perpetua Resources. In 2024 Mr. Wheeler joined the west coast law firm, Holland and Hart as an expert in regulatory affairs. Holland and Hart currently represents Perpetua Resources and their proposed mine in no less than four environmental permit appeals including three brought by ICL and our partners. 
One involves a Clean Water Act permit under Idaho DEQ administrative appeal (Agency case number. 0102-24-02), one involves the U.S. Forest Service’s Record of Decision in federal court (see case number 1:25-cv-00086-AKB), one involves the same air permit referenced in Mr. Wheeler’s and Dr. von Lindern’s commentary that is now being appealed within state court (see case number CV01-25-13306). The fourth major litigation is an appeal of the same U.S. Forest Service Record of Decision by the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho in federal court (see case number 3:25-cv-00498-AKB). 
With four active legal cases, it’s fair to question if Mr. Wheeler is acting on behalf of the public, Holland and Hart or Perpetua Resources. 
While Perpetua Resources has recently announced it has started on initial construction of its mine, it’s important to note that the above permit appeals present serious unsettled questions regarding the environmental impact of the mine. Until these appeals are concluded, the outcome of the mine is far from certain.
As Dr. von Lindern and I both testified during the administrative hearing process, the special concessions that Idaho DEQ granted to Perpetua have never been provided to any other Idaho air quality permit. They create a precedent that represents legitimate threats to air quality and human health for all Idahoans moving forward. 
There is no dispute that Idaho DEQ’s Stibnite Project Specific Adjustment factor increases cancer risk to any children exposed to arsenic from operations at the Stibnite Gold Project, the question is whether that insult will “average out” over the remainder of the child’s life. Whether Idaho DEQ violated state rules in issuing Perpetua Resources this air pollution permit will now be determined in state court, a venue where personal interest and hypocrisy can be shed from “truth.”

(Emma Davis/Maine Morning Star)Flags will be flying at half-staff across Maine Saturday in remembrance of the victims of the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston. 
Saturday marks two years since the state’s deadliest mass shooting at Just-In-Time Recreation and Schemengees Bar and Grille that killed 18 people and injured 13 others. 
“Although nothing can lessen their loss, we grieve with the families of the victims and the survivors of the Lewiston tragedy so that no one feels alone,” said Gov. Janet Mills. “We open our hearts to those who were injured and to those who are still struggling with the aftermath of that night. And we offer unending gratitude to the people whose heroic actions saved lives and set us on the long and winding road to healing.”
There are several events planned in Lewiston to mark the anniversary.
On Friday, community members gathered on Longley Bridge, where many held homemade signs on posters that said, “We Remember.”
“By leaning on our collective love for Lewiston, we will build a safer, more connected, and resilient future,” said Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline in a statement.
On Saturday afternoon, the Yes on Question 2 campaign, which is backing a statewide ballot initiative to adopt a red flag law, is hosting an interfaith event at 3 p.m. at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Lewiston. 
In addition to faith community leaders, Arthur Barnard, the father of Lewiston victim Artie Strout, and Joe Anderson, a doctor who worked in the emergency room the night of the shooting, will speak at the event. 
In early September, survivors and victims’ family members filed a lawsuit against the United States for negligence in failing to respond to warning signs and an explicit threat to commit a mass shooting. The lawsuit points to many of the findings of state and Army investigations, which concluded multi-agency failures related to the handling of perpetrator Robert Card II’s deteriorating mental health in the months leading up to the shooting.

(Zhang Mingming/VCG via Getty Images)The high-profile heist at the Louvre in Paris on Oct 19, 2025, played out like a scene from a Hollywood movie: a gang of thieves steal an assortment of dazzling royal jewels on display at one of the world’s most famous museums.
But with the authorities hot in pursuit, the robbers still have more work to do: How can they capitalize on their haul?
Most stolen works are never found. In the art crime courses I teach, I often point out that the recovery rate is below 10%. This is particularly disturbing when you consider that between 50,000 and 100,000 artworks are stolen each year globally — the actual number may be higher due to underreporting — with the majority stolen from Europe.
That said, it’s quite difficult to actually make money off stolen works of art. Yet the types of objects stolen from the Louvre — eight pieces of priceless jewelry — could give these thieves an upper hand.
At 9:30 a.m. local time on Oct. 19, 2025, four thieves reportedly used a lift mounted on a vehicle to enter the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery. (Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images)
 
A narrow market of buyers
Pilfered paintings can’t be sold on the art market because thieves can’t convey what’s known as “good title,” the ownership rights that belong to a legal owner. Furthermore, no reputable auction house or dealer would knowingly sell stolen art, nor would responsible collectors purchase stolen property.
But that doesn’t mean stolen paintings don’t have value.
In 2002, thieves broke into Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum through the roof and departed with “View of the Sea at Scheveningen” and “Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen” in tow. In 2016, Italian police recovered the relatively unscathed artworks from a Mafia safehouse in Naples. It isn’t clear whether the Mafia actually purchased the works, but it’s common for criminal syndicates to hold onto valuable assets as collateral of some sort.
Other times, stolen works do unwittingly end up in the hands of collectors.
In the 1960s in New York City, an employee of the Guggenheim Museum stole a Marc Chagall painting from storage. But the crime wasn’t even discovered until an inventory was taken years later. Unable to locate the work, the museum simply removed it from its records.
In the meantime, collectors Jules and Rachel Lubell bought the piece for US$17,000 from a gallery. When the couple requested that an auction house review the work for an estimate, a former Guggenheim employee at Sotheby’s recognized it as the missing painting.
Guggenheim demanded that the painting be returned, and a contentious court battle ensued. In the end, the parties settled the case, and the painting was returned to the museum after an undisclosed sum was paid to the collectors.
Some people do knowingly buy stolen art. After World War II, stolen works circulated on the market, with buyers fully aware of the widespread plunder that had just taken place across Europe.
Eventually, international laws were developed that gave the original owners the opportunity to recover looted property, even decades after the fact. In the U.S., for example, the law even allows descendants of the original owners to regain ownership of stolen works, provided they can offer enough evidence to prove their claims.
 
Jewels and gold easier to monetize
The Louvre theft didn’t involve paintings, though. The thieves came away with bejeweled property: a sapphire diadem; a necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense; an opulent matching set of earrings and a necklace that belonged to Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife; a diamond brooch; and Empress Eugénie’s diadem and her corsage-bow brooch.
These centuries-old, exquisitely crafted works have unique historic and cultural value. But even if each one were broken to bits and sold for parts, they would still be worth a lot of money. Thieves can peddle the precious gemstones and metals to unscrupulous dealers and jewelers, who could reshape and sell them. Even at a fraction of their value — the price received for looted art is always far lower than that received for legitimately sourced art — the gems are worth millions of dollars.

While difficult to sell stolen goods on the legitimate market, there is an underground market for looted artworks. The pieces may be sold in backrooms, in private meetings or even on the dark web, where participants cannot be identified. Studies have also revealed that stolen — and sometimes forged — art and antiquities often appear on mainstream e-commerce sites like Facebook and eBay. After making a sale, the vendor may delete his or her online store and disappear.
 
A heist’s sensational allure
While films like “The Thomas Crown Affair” feature dramatic heists pulled off by impossibly attractive bandits, most art crimes are far more mundane.
Art theft is usually a crime of opportunity, and it tends to take place not in the heavily guarded halls of cultural institutions, but in storage units or while works are in transit.
Most large museums and cultural institutions do not display all the objects within their care. Instead, they sit in storage. Less than 10% of the Louvre’s collection is ever on display at one time — only about 35,000 of the museum’s 600,000 objects. The rest can remain unseen for years, even decades.
Works in storage can be unintentionally misplaced — like Andy Warhol’s rare silkscreen “Princess Beatrix,” which was likely accidentally discarded, along with 45 other works, during the renovation of a Dutch town hall — or simply pilfered by employees. According to the FBI, about 90% of museum heists are inside jobs.
In fact, days before the Louvre crime, a Picasso work valued at $650,000, “Still Life with Guitar,” went missing during its journey from Madrid to Granada. The painting was part of a shipment including other works by the Spanish master, but when the shipping packages were opened, the piece was missing. The incident received much less public attention.
To me, the biggest mistake the thieves made wasn’t abandoning the crown they dropped or the vest they discarded, essentially leaving clues for the authorities.
Rather, it was the brazen nature of the heist itself — one that captured the world’s attention, all but ensuring that French detectives, independent sleuths and international law enforcement will be on the lookout for new pieces of gold, gems and royal bling being offered up for sale in the years to come.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)As farmers say at the Hedgeapple cattle farm in Frederick County, their cows live a good life, with one bad day.
All day, the cows graze on the Buckeystown farm’s grassy hills: Two herds with 45 pairs of heifers and steers, plus their calves. And even as autumn settles in and cold temperatures arrive, the cows still have months of grazing in front of them. Their pastures will stay grassy — by design.
The farm uses a practice called rotational grazing — moving the herds from pasture to pasture, then allowing grazed areas to re-grow over a period of 30 days or more.
The practice allows the farm to continue cattle grazing through January, said farm manager Chris Zook, saving them about $200 a day that would be needed to buy bales of hay to feed their hundreds of Black Angus and red/Akaushi Wagyu cattle.
“Take care of your grasses, and they will take care of you,” Zook says.
The practice was highlighted during a tour of the farm Thursday, one of several farm visits in the region led by the nonprofits Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Mobilize Frederick. The tour, focused on regenerative agriculture, attracted a combination of farmers, elected officials and environmentalists.

That’s because in addition to the economic benefits cited by Zook, the practice has a host of ecological perks, too.
By allowing the grass to regrow, quadrant by quadrant, the farm anchors its soil in place, reducing the amount of runoff during rainstorms from its fields into the nearby Monocacy River, which flows into the Potomac, which empties into the Chesapeake Bay.
So the farm is just one of many cogs in the overall effort to reduce the flow of harmful pollutants — including the nitrogen and phosphorus from manure — into the nation’s largest estuary.
Reducing agricultural pollution was one of the more stubborn pieces of the multistate plan to improve the bay by 2025, which fell short. The agreement is currently undergoing a reconstruction process that some have maligned as unambitious. Discussions are ongoing, and the leaders of the bay states are expected to sign off on a finalized agreement in December.
Policymakers have found success in other areas, including updating sewage treatment plants and planting thousands of filtering oysters. But as the population of people and animals in the bay’s watershed expands, slowing pollution from city streets and farm fields has proven to be a challenge
Though they may sound simple, regenerative practices like rotational grazing can actually require considerable extra labor — and capital. For example, Hedgeapple Farms had to ensure that it could transport water to all of the pastures used for grazing, either using water lines or portable tanks.
Hedgeapple largely funded the changes itself, but there are some funds that farmers can tap into, including from state and federal government sources, like the USDA’s Natural Resource Conservation Service.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Farmers also have a host of other worries, including drought conditions and rising costs for fuel, equipment and animal feed. Many have side jobs that make additional work too cumbersome, Zook said.
But a big challenge is also spreading the word, said assistant farm manager Seth Young.
“A lot of people, they’re told about it. But they never actually show the results,” Young said.
Some farmers also struggle to adopt new practices because of an adherence to tradition. They farm just as their grandparents or great-grandparents did, said Mark Townsend, a farmer who also serves as treasurer for the Maryland-Delaware Forage Council. Maybe that means they follow an old adage: “plant in the dust, and your bins will bust,” which urged farmers to plant seeds during dry, dusty conditions.
But conservationists urge farmers to plant “cover crops” during the off season. In Maryland, the Department of Agriculture provides compensatory payments to farmers to plant barley, rye and clover after they harvest their crops, to hold their fields in place during the off-season. It can be an intimidating change, Townsend said.
“To drive your planter through 8-foot tall rye? It’s like, ‘Oh my God.’ It’s horrifying,” Townsend said. “You’re like: ‘This is so against everything that I’ve ever known. And so, there’s a huge mental barrier, rightfully so.”
The farm’s commitment to sustainability runs deeper than just the rotational grazing. The farm also used grants from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation to plant more than 2,400 trees around the pastures, which will also help to reduce runoff into the Monocacy.

Initially, Zook said he feared that the perimeter of trees would cut the amount of space in each pasture, but ultimately they did not. Now, he’s more focused on the benefits, including the opportunities for cattle to seek shade during hot summer days. The farm’s practices are also a benefit to other living creatures, such as honeybees, said John Gardner, a local resident who cares for six hives on the property.
Hedgeapple is a quality home for the bees, who frequently venture from their hive boxes to forage, because its fields have more plant diversity than other farms.
“I tell people, when I see huge, golden, vast acres of corn, from the bee’s standpoint, I’m looking at a desert,” Gardner said.
Corn is wind-pollinated, and doesn’t need to attract pollinators. And pesticides and herbicides used on corn fields also endanger bees’ efforts to collect pollen, Gardner said.
The gangly tall grasses on the fields at Hedgeapple also are an ideal habitat for grassland birds, which rely on pasture habitats but are threatened by urban sprawl and changing farming practices, said Gabriel Foley of the Maryland Bird Conservation Partnership.
The Partnership uses nesting boxes to attract both American kestrels and barn owls to these habitats, where they can feed on insects and small mammals, Foley said.
Perhaps the most popular tool to show off the value of regenerative practices like cover crops and reduced grazing is a rain simulator: essentially, a shower head pointed at a variety of soil samples to show the effects of plantings on runoff.
Glass jars hang from each sample area, so viewers can see just how muddy the rainwater runoff becomes. Thursday’s selections included tilled soil, soil that hadn’t been tilled, allowing a small amount of vegetation to grow, and soil with cover crop planted.

But the winner was, perhaps unsurprisingly, the patch of dirt and long grasses dug up from a corner of Hedgeapple Farm that morning. The water in that jar was nearly clear.
When the simulator runs, rain spews from the spigot, sending about an inch of rain onto the small plots in a matter of minutes. It’s an outlandish — but not impossible– rate. Yet, it still shows the importance of snaring soils with a diverse array of plant life, Townsend said.
“If you weren’t necessarily prepared to take in all that water at that one time, you’re kind of left sitting — irony intended — high and dry, right?” Townsend said. “You’re not getting the water that you actually need into that soil, because you don’t have the mechanisms by which to absorb it.”
Amanda Grev, a forage and pasture specialist at the University of Maryland Extension, said that the practices aren’t just meant to save the bay, but to save farmers money, including on fertilizer, that would otherwise wash away during intense storms.
“The goal of these practices is, in the long run, to save you money, right? We’re not trying to spend thousands and thousands of dollars purely for the sake of being regenerative,” Grev said. “We may have a little bit of expense initially, but how much are we saving in terms of soil and nutrients?”

(Photo by SimpleImages/Getty Stock Images)Thirty-four people died from heat-related causes in Maryland during the late April to early October “heat season” this year, the second-highest number of heat-related deaths since records became publicly available in 2012.
Since deaths hit 46 in 2012 — when a July storm disrupted the power and air conditioning to many Maryland homes for days as a heat wave hit — the number had never been above 30, and has been as low as five in a year.
Of the 34 people who suffered heat-related deaths this summer, 24, or about 71%, were 65 or older, according to state data. Six people who died from heat-related causes were between ages 45-64, two were 18-44 and two were under age 18.
“Older adults often have chronic medical conditions, such as cardiovascular or respiratory, that can increase their susceptibility to excessive heat,” according to a statement from the Maryland Department of Health.
Despite that, 18- to 44-year-olds had the highest number of emergency department and urgent care visits this year, accounting for 688 of the total 1,672 this summer. Those 65 and older recorded 416 emergency room visits, followed by the 399 for the 44-65 age group, as of the Oct. 8 report.

Emergency department visits were significantly higher than the 1,206 recorded last year. The number of calls for emergency medical service was also up sharply this year, from 1,502 in 2024 to 1,645 this year.
The number of heat-related emergency room visits spiked during a heat wave in late June that saw 379 emergency department or urgent care visits and 400 EMS calls, according to state data. Almost two-thirds of the deaths, 21 of them, occurred over a two-week period in June and July that saw extremely high temperatures and heat indices, according to the health department’s statement.
“Daily heat indices during this time exceeded 100 degrees with some areas exceeding 110 degrees,” the statement said.
The region that includes Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard counties and Baltimore City had the most emergency department or urgent care visits this season. Their total of 688 surpasses other regions’ totals by at least 250 visits and past years’ totals by at least 200.
Of the 34 deaths, half were reported to be indoors. Some of the indoor deaths were related to non-functioning or non-existent cooling systems, such as fans or air conditioning units. Other reports indicated “hoarding or cluttered living conditions which can cause a decrease in air flow reducing the effectiveness of cooling systems,” according to the health department’s statement.
The other eight and nine deaths were in vehicles and outdoors, respectively.
Baltimore City and Baltimore County had the highest number of heat-related deaths this season, reaching eight and six, respectively. Montgomery and Prince George’s counties both had three heat-related deaths, and the 10 other counties that recorded heat-deaths had one or two each this heat season.
The Baltimore City Health Department issued four extreme heat alerts during this heat season — with one late July alert lasting almost a week after two extensions, according to department statements The press releases reference multiple instances of daily high temperatures that reach over 100 degrees, and “dangerously high temperatures and high humidity.”

“The sustained heat wave continues to pose a serious threat to public health, particularly for our most vulnerable residents,” Mary Beth Haller, Baltimore City’s interim health commissioner, said in a July 30 press release concerning the second extension of an extreme heat alert.
Montgomery County issued two heat emergency alerts during this heat season, warning citizens of high “feels-like” temperatures and heat indexes.
“Extreme heat affects the body’s ability to regulate temperature, which can create dangerous conditions if appropriate safety measures are not taken,” a July 24 Montgomery County press release said. “Heat may affect air quality, especially in urban areas, and may have a stronger impact on the elderly, children and sick persons.”

WASHINGTON – The sounds of destruction echoed around the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue Wednesday afternoon.
“Where is the outrage?” asked Nadine Seiler, a Waldorf, Maryland, resident and activist. “There is no way that … Republican voters would have been OK … with Obama or Biden or Clinton demolishing part of this building.”
“I’m like, really really angry,” she said.
Despite President Donald Trump’s promise that his plans for a massive, $300 million ballroom would not “interfere with the current building,” demolition of the East Wing began Monday and was largely complete by Friday. The destruction has sparked widespread alarm from the public, Democratic lawmakers and historic preservationists.
The first lady’s offices and a visitors’ entrance were located in the East Wing. Originally, the space of a terrace during Thomas Jefferson’s presidency, the East Wing was built in 1902 under President Theodore Roosevelt and expanded in 1942 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, providing both office space and housing for staff.
Trump’s ballroom, which is intended as an entertaining space that he claims will be able to host 999 people, is planned to be 90,000 square feet. The White House itself is currently an estimated 55,000 square feet.
The National Trust for Historic Preservation on Tuesday urged the Trump administration and the National Park Service “to pause demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes.”

“We acknowledge the utility of a larger meeting space at the White House, but we are deeply concerned that the massing and height of the proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself…and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings,” Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the organization, said in a statement.
Seiler, a former employee of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said that it is not possible to get approvals to do any renovations on a historic building such as the White House in fewer than nine months.
“The fact that he could come … and demolish this building, he is number two-ing and peeing all over the Constitution,” Seiler said.
John Sentena, a Colorado resident, views the president’s actions as “pushing the boundaries,” which is what he said he believes the president should do. He also commented on the lack of legal pushback, saying that nobody has pursued legal action over the demolition.
“If someone sues him for it, then there’s probably something to it,” Sentena said.
He said he has supported Trump’s presidency thus far and especially appreciates the impact of his actions.
“It’s only been not even a year … and all these people that are riled up. I wonder how long it can last,” he said.
But Cathy Raines, a Washington resident, said that the “president of the country should be a role model for following protocols.”
Raines said that Trump’s actions are unsurprising because she believes that every department of his administration has failed to follow legal guidelines.
“The White House is a longstanding symbol of our country, meant to be the people’s house,” Raines said.
Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, blistered Trump Wednesday for the destruction of the East Wing.
“President Trump’s desecration of the White House is an insult to the American people and a betrayal of his obligation to safeguard our history and heritage,” King said in a statement.

The senator is the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee’s national parks subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over, among other things, national historic sites and historic preservation.
“The White House does not belong to President Trump; it belongs to the American people – he is but a temporary resident with no right to despoil this iconic landmark on his personal whim,” King said. “The house was purposefully never intended to be a palace, but rather a residence befitting a democratically elected leader, and an important symbol of our rejection of the trappings of royalty.”

Demand for electricity -- mostly from power-hungry data center springing up in the region -- are a prime factor behind rising electricity costs, but progressives and conservatives have different ideas on how to solve the problem. (Photo by Don Nichols/Getty iStock image)Maryland lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said this week that it’s time for a multistate coalition to focus on reducing energy costs for strapped utility customers.
Don’t get your bipartisan hopes up: Each side announced its own coalition, with completely different strategies.
One, announced by Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), wants to shield consumers from power infrastructure costs associated with the rising number of data centers in the region. The group convened its inaugural meeting this week, featuring legislators from many of the 13 states, including Maryland, that are part of the electric grid operated by PJM Interconnection.
It comes as PJM is in the midst of a consequential process to decide how to handle projections that the grid’s “peak load” could grow by 32 gigawatts from 2024 to 2030, with about 30 gigawatts of that total attributable to data center demand.
Costs from increased demand could be near $100 billion, Hester said. The current default setting is for all ratepayers to share the burden of new transmission lines and upsets in the balance of supply and demand, said Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery).
“You have to have a proposal that explicitly protects ratepayers in order for ratepayers not to bear the brunt,” Charkoudian said. “So, if a proposal is silent on who’s paying, then it is our residential ratepayers.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The other coalition, announced this week by House members in the Maryland Freedom Caucus, seems focused instead on bolstering energy supply to address high bills, which Del. Brian Chisholm (R-Anne Arundel) blames on “a delusional climate cultist ideology” for shuttering Maryland fossil fuel power plants.
The group, which currently includes legislators from Pennsylvania, said it will host a series of “Powering the Mid-Atlantic” hearings across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia, according to a Wednesday news release.
Del. Robin Grammer (R-Baltimore County), another member of the coalition, called on the Democratic majority in the General Assembly to ditch policies focused on reducing greenhouse gases in the face of the state’s energy challenges. He also urged leaders to end the EmPOWER Maryland surcharge on ratepayers’ bills, which funds energy efficiency programs for Maryland households and efforts to transition away from fossil fuel heating.
“We’re trying to fill this gap of leadership, where, frankly, we’re seeing absolute silence,” Grammer said. “The legislature should be stepping up and saying: ‘We all care about sustainability, but we’re at the point where we’re seeing blackouts.'”
Hawley takes charge at MABE
Cecil County Board of Education President Diana Hawley was sworn in Monday as the new president of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education.
Hawley, who will lead the organization for the 2025-26 term, took the helm during MABE’s annual conference this week in Annapolis. She replaces Karin M. Bailey, who currently serves as chair of the St. Mary’s County Board of Education.
Hawley has served on the Cecil County school board since 2018 and served on MABEs board of directors since 2021.

“At MABE, we’ve seen up close Diana’s rock-solid commitment to Maryland students and public schools,” MABE Executive Director Milt Nagel said in a statement released Wednesday. “Her extensive experience in Maryland’s education community means she brings a valuable first-hand perspective to MABE members’ collective work championing excellence in Maryland public education. Despite such challenging times for public education as a whole, we see great things ahead under her collaborative, innovative leadership.”
Besides selecting a new president, the conference also elected new officers with Brenda Wolff of Montgomery County as president-elect, Karen Yoho of Frederick County as the new treasurer and Jolene Mosley of Howard County as the new secretary. The nonprofit organization founded in 1957 advocates on behalf of the state’s 24 local school boards.
State Superintendent Carey Wright took the opportunity of this week’s MABE conference to provide school leaders with updates on literacy and math policies, nearly $21 million in philanthropic support for various programs and initiatives and a summary on test results.
According to a PowerPoint document from Wright at the conference, she also highlighted a plan to request funding for instructional coaching from the General Assembly during the 2026 legislative session. The legislature did approve what educators call a “coaching program” within the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, but without the funds.
Teachers choose from among their own for board
The Maryland State Department of Education and the state school board will hold a two-week election to choose a new educator to serve on the board.
Twenty educators are seeking the teacher position on the board that came open when Rachel McCusker stepped down in August, after she became an assistant principal in Carroll County. McCusker was the board’s first official teacher member after being chosen by educators in December 2019.
Voting is open to any teacher who has an active state educator certificate or license in at least one teacher area as of Oct. 10. Voting will take place from Nov. 3 through Nov. 17, with a second round of voting Dec. 1-15 if there’s a tie.

During her time as president, Yam saw the university through the COVID-19 pandemic and oversaw a $52.6 million fundraising campaign, the school’s largest, to support students, increased NDMU’s endowment by 40% and the renovation or construction of several campus facilities.
Her tenure also saw the launch of NDMU Online, a doctoral program in higher education, and the state’s first bachelor’s and master’s programs in art therapy. NDMU also started the state’s first doctorate in occupational therapy at a private institution and the first master’s degree in physician assistant studies at a private institution. She also led the launch of a new School of Integrative Health after a recent merger with the former Maryland University of Integrative Health.
“President Yam has worked 24/7 to put NDMU on a path of success – whether it be in increasing the endowment, creating new programs and schools, creating a new energy and growth in the school through taking the university all-gender, raising our visibility in the city and state and increasing our rankings in so many categories,” said Cathryn Curia ’69, chair of the NDMU Board of Trustees.

The state has received more than 940 applications for state individual assistance, according to a statement from the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. Applications are open on the state’s website, through Nov. 9. 
As many storm evacuees left or lost identification or essential documents, the Alaska Department of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Health have booths at emergency evacuation shelters in Anchorage to assist with replacements. The Association of Village Council Presidents is offering tribal IDs in the shelters. State caseworkers and a Yup’ik speaking public notary are helping with documentation, the state update said.
Residents must prove they are from the designated disaster area, and provide proof of identification and a mailing address where checks can be mailed. 
As of Thursday night, there were 302 evacuees staying in emergency shelters in Anchorage, with 178 at the Egan Center and 124 at the Alaska Airlines Center. 
The state’s assistance program provides financial assistance for storm damage to homes, vehicles, essential personal property and medical, dental or funeral needs directly related to the disaster. Applicants will be eligible for $21,250 in home repairs and another $21,250 for “other needs.”
The state’s individual assistance program also includes a housing assistance program that provides renters with up to three months and homeowners with 18 months of financial assistance, according to the state’s website. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced Friday that he amended the state’s disaster declaration to waive state fees associated with replacing documents, including licenses and registrations. It also waives late fees for state-administered loan and payment programs.”
Federal disaster assistance approved
On Wednesday, the Trump administration authorized a federal disaster declaration for the Western Alaska storm. The president said that he has authorized an immediate $25 million in federal aid for the state to cover costs as the recovery effort is underway.

Trump also approved the state’s request for federal assistance, including federal individual assistance, public assistance and the hazard mitigation grant program. 
Residents can apply on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s website at DisasterAssistance.gov or on the FEMA app. Applicants must file a claim and are required to go through a FEMA inspection to qualify. 
Federal disaster assistance provides up to  $42,500 for home repairs and up to $42,500 for other items.
The U.S. Small Business Administration is also offering low interest loans to small businesses, non-profits and individuals impacted by the storm, to help pay for losses not covered by insurance. Applications can be submitted on their federal website. 
Financial donations pour in for Western Alaska communities
Individual and business donations have come pouring in for the families and communities devastated by ex-Typhoon Halong, including food, supplies, and financial assistance.
The state has a list of resources and links to assistance on its website.
The Western Alaska Disaster Relief Fund has raised $2.5 million to date, said Ashley Ellingson, director of communications with the Alaska Community Foundation, with mostly corporate donors pledging an additional $1.5 million more. She said an advisory committee of regional and state leaders meets at least weekly to consider requests and how to best allocate funding. 
The Alaska Community Foundation has already distributed roughly $575,000 to five organizations: the Association of Village Council Presidents, the Maniilaq Association, the tribal councils of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok — the communities hardest-hit by the storm — and the Alaska Native Heritage Center. Ellingson said that is to ensure funding goes to immediate needs. 
“Local organizations can distribute to individuals and families affected the most,” she said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/500h_q95-2.jpg,,,2025-10-24 23:56:41.600991

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Cameron the Cat, the unofficial mascot of the Nebraska State Capitol, is about to become even more famous.
Cameron, a frequent visitor to the stairs outside the Capitol, is being featured in a new book by photographer and author John Shaw. The book captures the “Capitol Cat” as well as the unique architecture of the Capitol, the unique “Tower on the Plains” that has won acclaim for its design.

On Saturday and Wednesday, Shaw will be signing copies of his book, “Cameron the Capital Cat: A Portrait in Light, Stone, and Fur,” at the Capitol Gift Shop on the building’s first floor. The signings are scheduled from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Wednesday.
The Gift Shop, which is operated by the Nebraska State Historical Society, re-opened in June and is the official home of Cameron the Cat merchandise.
Cameron, who has been mistaken more than once for a stray cat, visits the outside of the Capitol frequently, greeting workers and visitors at the South Entrance.

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune)Just as the second and final day of complicated map-drawing expert testimony came to an end late Friday, another twist cropped up in Utah’s court-ordered redistricting legal battle. 
An attorney for Utah’s top election official, the lieutenant governor, told Third District Judge Dianna Gibson that the bid for an indirect initiative to repeal Proposition 4 — the 2018 voter-approved law that calls for an independent redistricting process — had been withdrawn. 
“We are withdrawing this effort prior to initiating a direct initiative effort on the same issue,” Utah Republican Party Chair Rob Axson wrote in an email to the state’s elections director, Ryan Cowley sent at 4:15 p.m., just as Friday’s evidentiary hearing was wrapping up.
Now, rather than seeking about 70,000 signatures to require the Legislature take an up or down vote on repealing Proposition 4 — an approach the plaintiffs in the state’s anti-gerrymandering lawsuit have challenged in court as unable to undue Proposition 4, which was approved by more than 500,000 votes in 2018 — Axson and other members of the group Utahns for Representative Government are shifting gears. 
Utah lawmakers and plaintiffs accuse each other of gerrymandering with dueling redistricting experts

Instead, they’ve submitted an application to pursue the same method that the group Better Boundaries successfully pursued to get Proposition 4 on the ballot in 2018 and look to repeal that law by another statewide vote. 
In a statement issued Friday evening, Utahns for Representative Government — the group supporting Proposition 4’s repeal — said legal filings opposed to their effort “made it clear that the Lt. Governor’s Office would likely be forced to deny the indirect initiative application.” 
“While we would have preferred to continue under the process provided by law, the time required to defend our rights and appeal flawed judicial decisions would have made it impossible to meet statutory deadlines,” the group said. “The Utah Constitution is clear: the authority to draw congressional districts rests with the people’s elected representatives — not with the courts and not with an unaccountable commission. We again call on all Utahns to stand against judicial overreach and defend the separation of powers outlined in our state constitution.”
Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, issued a statement Friday characterizing the withdrawal of the indirect initiative as a victory — for the time being. 
“Once again, political insiders’ attempts to undermine the people’s voice and repeal Proposition 4 have fallen flat, at least for now,” she said. “This is a win in our ongoing fight to give Utahns the reforms they voted for in 2018. Proposition 4 remains the law of the land. Moving forward, we will continue to strongly oppose any and all efforts to undermine fair maps and the ability of voters to choose their politicians.”
Katharine Biele, president of the Utah League of Women Voters, one of the redistricting case’s plaintiffs, told reporters outside Gibson’s courtroom Friday that it was “wise” of Proposition 4’s opponents to abandon their indirect initiative effort — but she warned pursuing a ballot initiative is no easy task. 
“They will find out just how difficult a real initiative is,” she said. “We went through that in 2018, and it was hard.”  
Utah Legislature picks congressional map supported by Republican party

In order to successfully get their repeal on the ballot, the GOP group will need to collect at least 140,748 valid signatures from registered voters across Utah while meeting specific thresholds in at least 26 of Utah’s 29 Senate districts. 
Utah Democratic Party Chair Brian King, in a statement, called the group’s withdrawal an “embarrassing end to a pathetic last-ditch effort by the Utah GOP to create chaos.” 
“Even with millions of dollars, the backing of Donald Trump, Jr., and support from high-profile elected Utah Republicans, they realized they still didn’t have the competence nor the public support to pull this off,” King said. 
King was referring to Trump Jr., in a post on X earlier this week, urging people to sign up as signature gatherers for the indirect initiative effort. 
“The Utah Republican Party may continue to try to ignore the will of the voters next year using other tricks. But Utahns will continue to see through the corruption, abuse of power, and overall disrespect,” King added. “We will be there to support everyday Utahns when it is time for that particular fight, but today we celebrate another win for voters.” 
The GOP’s strategy shift comes as the state’s Republican leaders continue to protest Gibson’s earlier ruling that determined the 2021 Utah Legislature overstepped when it undid Proposition 4. As a result, she struck down the congressional map lawmakers adopted that year as a product of an unconstitutional process and she ordered a process to pick a “remedial” map in 2026.

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune)
In court, the Legislature’s attorneys and the redistricting lawsuit’s plaintiffs have submitted to Gibson their preferred maps — one known as map C that the Legislature advanced in a special session earlier this month, and two submitted by plaintiffs as alternatives. The judge faces a Nov. 10 deadline to pick a map in order for it to be ready in time for the 2026 elections. 
In the courtroom, experts clash over mapping methods
Thursday and Friday, attorneys grilled each other’s redistricting experts while building their cases for why Gibson should pick their preferred maps.
Plaintiffs have argued in court documents that the Legislature’s retained map-drawing experts used methods unfit for a state like Utah that is dominated by the Republican Party while Democrats are concentrated in the densely populated area of Salt Lake County.

The Legislature’s experts, however, defended their methods during hours of testimony and cross examination on Friday — while also questioning the plaintiffs’ experts’ methods and whether they were evaluated for partisan slant with tests that favored allowing a Democratic-leaning district. 
Friday, the Legislature’s attorneys called three experts to testify: Michael Barber, political science professor at Brigham Young University and director of the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy; Sean Trende, senior elections analyst for Real Clear Politics; and Jonathan Katz, professor of social sciences and statistics at the California Institute of Technology. 
Trende explained how he drew the Legislature’s map C, saying he based it on the 2021 map’s original boundaries but he sought to correct it to bring it more in line with Proposition 4’s neutral redistricting criteria. 
However, because he said Proposition 4’s language explicitly calls for “measures of partisan symmetry” to be considered among the “best available” scientific methods, he said he felt he had no choice but to use what he sees as the only way to measure partisan symmetry: the partisan bias test.

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune)
The plaintiffs argue the partisan bias test is among the worst methods to use to measure fairness in a “lopsided” state like Utah where statewide races are won by Republicans with wide margins. 
Trende anticipated there would be controversy over the method — saying he wished Proposition 4’s language didn’t call for it because he knew it would inevitably lead to a challenge and he didn’t want to end up in a courtroom like he has for many other redistricting legal battles. He went as far as calling it a “tragic addendum.”
Plaintiffs’ expert in Utah redistricting case calls Legislature’s map an ‘extreme partisan outlier’

“This is a trainwreck I saw coming the moment I read (Proposition 4),” Trende said. “I think the person who drafted this should be put in a cage and paraded around Salt Lake City.” 
Nevertheless, Trende and another one of the Legislature’s experts, Barber, argued that their analysis of map C compared to thousands of map simulations showed the map wasn’t an “extreme partisan outlier,” as the plaintiffs’ expert Jowei Chen testified Friday. Instead, they argued it passed multiple tests analyzing for partisan fairness, while they said plaintiffs’ maps appeared to be the true outliers. 
Barber said his analysis of Chen’s map simulations showed that “his algorithm is almost always producing a very Democratic district located in the northern half of Salt Lake County.” He said his own simulations produced comparatively more variety while using data that’s publicly available and peer reviewed, while Chen’s isn’t. 
“To me this is a tell-tale sign of a biased algorithm,” Barber said. “The algorithm should be producing a representative sample of maps. We’re seeing a single orientation over and over and over again.”
While the plaintiffs have accused Trende of using a map simulation set that wasn’t programmed to prioritize Proposition 4’s neutral criteria, Trende argued he did his best to follow Proposition 4 while creating map C’s boundaries. 
“I didn’t want to be here (in court),” he said with a laugh. “I was trying to draw maps that would easily comply with at least the structural requirements of Utah law.”

But while cross examining Trende, the plaintiffs’ attorney, Mark Gaber with the Campaign Legal Center, pointed out that multiple times Republican legislators expressed misgivings with accepting maps drawn on a platform called Dave’s Redistricting Tool with a partisan data view turned on. 
During questioning, Trende acknowledged he drew maps using the tool, but he said the political data was “set to a useless composite” with data from 2012 to 2020. 
What’s next?
The judge now has hundreds of pages of court documents with extremely complicated statistical analysis to wade through before picking a new map sometime before Nov. 10. 
She has scheduled another hearing to consider oral arguments in the case on Nov. 4, Election Day. 
That day, the parties are scheduled to debate another complaint filed by the plaintiffs urging the judge to block a law that lawmakers passed alongside their map submission that requires the use of three specific statistical tests that the plaintiffs argue lead to maps that favor Republicans over Democrats. 
Another hearing scheduled for Nov. 5 was previously expected to debate the plaintiff’s legal challenge of the GOP’s indirect initiative, but given that issue is now moot, it’s likely that hearing will be canceled.

Mariannette Miller-Meeks, speaking to supporters at a fundraiser Friday, claimed credit for her involvement in the firing of an Oskaloosa teacher over remarks about slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Miller-Meeks, speaking at her fifth annual tailgate fundraiser, said there’s “a lot at stake” in the upcoming election.
To show voters why they should support her, she brought up her involvement in a case where an Oskaloosa school teacher was fired after making a controversial social media post in response to Kirk’s assassination. When the post was brought to her attention, Miller-Meeks said she contacted the principal and superintendent of the school district and told them to investigate the situation.
“People need to know that we are working for them, that we are looking out for them, and that we are protecting children,” Miller-Meeks said. “… That teacher was fired after an investigation, after the board met, they had due process, they were terminated. That’s what your congresswoman, who’s working for you, does.
“Our state Legislature decided to have a Center for Intellectual Freedom here at the University of Iowa campus. Your congresswoman made a suggestion that they name that Center of Intellectual Freedom after Charlie Kirk. So it matters who’s in this office, it matters who has this seat.”
‘You are not leverage’
As the federal government shutdown hit day 24, the Iowa Republican also blamed Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for the impasse and said Iowans need to elect Republicans to Congress again in 2026. While the U.S. House passed a short-term federal funding bill in September, Senate Democrats have blocked such a measure from passing unless Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire at the end of the year.
Miller-Meeks told supporters about things she doesn’t like, such as “the Chinese Communist Party buying up Iowa farmland” and “California telling us how to raise hogs in Iowa.” She said she also does not like Democrats making demands through a shutdown after they lost control in the 2024 election.
“I don’t like Democrats shutting down the government over something that they could not get done when they had the House, the Senate and the White House, and now they expect us to do their job for them,” Miller-Meeks said. “They expect us to extend something that they couldn’t do themselves.”
Miller-Meeks referenced a comment made by House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, a Massachusetts Democrat, who said Thursday there will be negative impacts from the shutdown. Clark said in an interview with Fox News the shutdown was the only “leverage” available for Democrats to get Republicans to negotiate.
“I mean, shutdowns are terrible and, of course, there will be, you know, families that are going to suffer,” Clark said in the interview. “We take that responsibility very seriously. But it is one of the few leverage times we have.”
Miller-Meeks said as she meets with Iowans across the state and in D.C., she wants to tell voters, “you are not leverage.”
“That’s disgusting and revolting,” she said. “So we’re going to work hard to open this government. We’re going to work hard to have people have their needs met. And we are not going to do the Democrats’ dirty work for them.”
Miller-Meeks has also taken other steps criticizing Democrats on the impacts of the shutdown, like leading a letter Monday from the all-GOP Iowa U.S. House delegation to Schumer calling for an end to the shutdown, and introducing legislation earlier Friday to allow the U.S. secretary of Agriculture to access emergency funds to maintain Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) operations during the shutdown.

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota joined Miller-Meeks at the fundraiser Friday, as did fellow Iowa Republicans including U.S. Reps. Ashley Hinson, running for U.S. Senate in 2026, U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra who has an “exploratory” committee for Iowa governor, state House Majority Leader Bobby Kaufmann and Attorney General Brenna Bird.
Emmer told the crowd Democrats were disingenuous by framing the shutdown as being about health care, claiming the minority party wants to provide health care for undocumented immigrants and would remove funding included in the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation law for rural health care providers.
“It’s not above health care,” Emmer said. “How do we know? Because they filed a counter-proposal in the Senate. You know what? It says, they want us to spend $1.5 trillion more, and they want to put illegals on taxpayer-funded health care, while at the same time gutting the $50 billion fund that we all created in the bill that we passed in July for rural health care. This ain’t about health care.”
Democrats have proposed reversing some cuts made for “lawfully present” immigrants available through federal health care programs. The minority party’s funding proposal would not change federal law that prohibits undocumented immigrants from receiving taxpayer-funded health coverage.
The race for Iowa’s 1st Congressional District is expected to be one of the most contentious matches in the 2026 election season, with Cook Political Report rating the district as a “toss-up.” The race for Iowa’s 3rd District represented by Republican Rep. Zach Nunn is also predicted to be competitive in 2026.
Miller-Meeks won her initial election to Congress in the 2020 by a margin of six votes. She won reelection in 2022 and 2024 against Democratic challenger Christina Bohannan, who is running for the seat again in the upcoming election. Miller-Meeks’ margin of victory in 2024 was by 798 votes after Bohannan requested a recount.
Alongside Bohannan, there are two other Democrats running to become the 1st District party nominee: Travis Terrell, a University of Iowa Health Care employee, and Taylor Wettach, a former attorney. Miller-Meeks also faces a primary challenge from David Pautsch, who also ran against her in 2024.
Though Republicans have seen major victories in recent election cycles, the GOP speakers called for Iowa Republican voters at the fundraiser to stay engaged heading into the 2026 election season. Emmer called Miller-Meeks “the key” for Republicans’ victory across the country in 2026.
“Mariannette Miller-Meeks winning means we’re winning everything that you’re fighting for in Iowa,” he said.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)As the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to block President Donald Trump’s plans to deploy National Guard soldiers to Chicago, Trump’s attorneys are arguing that federal personnel are needed to prevent crime.
But an analysis of federal and state crime data by the Alaska Beacon, building upon a larger analysis by Stateline, shows almost all of Trump’s deployments have targeted cities with lower violent crime rates than Anchorage and other places in Alaska.
Among large American cities — those with 250,000 or more residents — Trump has ordered soldiers deployed to just one whose violent crime rate is among the 15 worst in the United States. 
Anchorage’s 2024 violent crime rate, 1,015 per 100,000 residents, is the 15th worst in the United States, according to figures published by the FBI in an annual report.  
Under the FBI’s definitions, violent crimes include murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.
When considering Trump-targeted cities, only Memphis, Tennessee, which has a worst-in-the-nation 2024 violent crime rate of 2,501 per 100,000 residents, is worse than Anchorage. 
Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Chicago all have lower crime rates than Anchorage.
They have the 19th, 32nd and 54th highest violent crime rates among large cities, respectively.
Statewide, the FBI tallied 5,392 violent crimes within Alaska in 2024, giving the state an overall violent crime rate of 728 crimes per 100,000 residents. That’s almost exactly the same rate as Los Angeles. 
The Alaska Department of Public Safety has yet to publish its 2024 report on crime within the state of Alaska, but a spokesperson for the department said its report will mirror statistics already published by the FBI in its online data system.
Using those FBI-published statistics and population estimates published by the state of Alaska, Fairbanks had a violent crime rate of 730 per 100,000 residents in 2024, higher than Los Angeles or Chicago. 
That applies only within city limits, because it’s based upon statistics reported by the Fairbanks Police Department, which operates within the city and not in the whole Fairbanks North Star Borough.
In Juneau, which has an almost identical population to Fairbanks city, the violent crime rate in 2024 was 519 per 100,000 residents.
The Bethel Police Department reported 104 violent crimes to the FBI in 2024, enough for that town’s violent crime rate to stand at 1,727 per 100,000 residents, slightly worse than Detroit, which had the third-highest violent crime rate in the nation in 2024.
Within the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the Wasilla Police Department reported 52 violent crimes in 2024, a rate of 541 — almost exactly Chicago’s rate. The Palmer Police Department tallied 10 violent crimes during the same time period, a rate of 169 per 100,000 residents, the lowest among Alaska towns and cities examined by the Beacon.
The North Slope Borough Police Department reported 63 violent crimes last year, a rate of 595 per 100,000. In Ketchikan, where the police department recorded 32 violent crimes, the rate was 418 per 100,000.
Spokespeople for Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy have repeatedly said that the governor has not requested a crime-fighting National Guard deployment for Alaska and has not approved the use of Alaska National Guardsmen for crime-fighting deployments in other states.
They reiterated those positions on Friday, a day when dozens of Alaska National Guardsmen were actively aiding in relief efforts following the arrival of Typhoon Halong in western Alaska.
Nationally, the state of Alaska has joined other Republican-led states in backing Trump’s claim that he has the legal authority to deploy the National Guard, even in cases when states and local governments oppose the deployment.
In September, Attorney General-designee Stephen Cox signed a brief alongside other Republican-led states in support of Trump’s ability to deploy the National Guard to Washington, D.C.
Alaska didn’t sign briefs in support of deployments to Los Angeles, Portland or Chicago.
Asked whether that absence represented a change in viewpoint or a nuance between the rights of states and the District of Columbia, Cox said no — it was simply a matter of timing.
“We have a process to review state amicus briefs and we receive dozens of requests every week, typically with several days to review them and make decisions, but on these two briefs,” he said, referring to ones related to Illinois, “we had less than 24 hours’ notice and not enough time. Had we had more time, we would’ve signed on.”
Meanwhile, former Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles joined a bipartisan group of more than a dozen former state governors in arguing against the Trump administration’s deployment to Chicago.
In a friend-of-the-court brief, they wrote that allowing the federal government to deploy soldiers to states for police purposes violates the U.S. Constitution.
“The present deployment of military resources, based on an assertion of nearly unfettered federal authority, is unlawful,” they wrote.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/National-Guard-DC.jpg,,,2025-10-24 21:01:15.727297

(Photo by SageElyse/Getty Images)Instead of getting paid as they normally would on Friday, many of Utah’s federal employees were figuring out how to stretch their budgets for as long as it takes Congress to reopen the government. 
“The anxiety is starting to really rise in a lot of people,” said Robert Lawrence, president of the union representing Ogden’s IRS employees. “They’re starting to wonder, you know, how they’re going to pay their bills, how they’re going to pay their mortgage.” 
Lawrence said many of his colleagues did not get a full paycheck earlier this month and some have applied for unemployment, but those benefits probably won’t meet their needs. The IRS employs about 6,500 people in Ogden, Lawrence estimated, and the majority are furloughed because of the shutdown — unable to work or get paid.

The possibility of layoffs has exacerbated their stress. Roughly 100 were among thousands of U.S. government workers across the country who received notices earlier this month saying they’d be laid off, Lawrence said. A judge temporarily blocked the terminations, which were set to happen in December. 
Lawrence said the shutdown is holding up the agency’s work ahead of the coming tax season, all while it’s still trying to recover from a slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“What makes it so frustrating is that, you know, we have nothing to do with what’s going on in D.C. We have a job to do. We do that job. We do it proudly, and we expect to get paid for it,” Lawrence said. “I’m not siding with either side. Change has to come from both sides.”
Some of the agency’s employees in Ogden are longtime staffers who moved up the ranks, but the majority are getting paid somewhere near $15 per hour, said Lawrence, president of the National Treasury Employees’ Union chapter 67.  
“You can’t support a family on that,” Lawrence said. “So to miss a paycheck is potentially devastating.”

Rangers at Zion National Park are also feeling the pressure of another week without pay, according to the Zion Forever Project, a nonprofit supporting the park and its workers. 
“On a typical day, you would see rangers kind of everywhere, and that’s not the case anymore,” said Tiffany Stouffer, the organization’s development director. “Very few of them are working, and even less of those who are working are working with pay.”
The organization launched a push Friday to raise more money for a fund helping to cover counseling and mental health support for the park’s employees and its own staff. Stouffer said many park rangers fear that they’ll be called back to work when the government reopens, only to be laid off a short time later. 
“These are career professionals with sometimes multiple degrees, or lifetimes of knowledge and experience,” she said. 
At the nonprofit Switchpoint, which operates a food pantry in St. George, spokesperson Zachary Almaguer said four federal employees — two working for public lands agencies — have gotten in touch about food assistance, expressing concern about making ends meet. 
Stouffer fought tears as she thought about Zion employees in similar situations. 
Said Stouffer: “They’re Utahns, they’re part of the fabric of our communities, and they’re suffering.”

Melanie Stansbury, as a state official says NM is ""evaluating the USDA's ever-changing guidance.""","Food bank officials said they intend to increase distribution sites—as they did during the COVID-19-pandemic—in response to lost Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits expected on Nov. 1, 2025. (Courtesy The Food Depot)Federal and state officials said Friday they are working on a plan to shield 450,000 New Mexicans from pending lost federal food assistance benefits.
The United States Department of Agriculture informed states earlier this month that due to the federal shutdown, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program had insufficient funding to run after this month, and ordered states not to submit SNAP recipient info to state vendors.
U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-NM) said an “emergency food plan” is emerging that tasks charitable organizations and schools with counteracting the expected loss of $90 million in SNAP benefits for 250,000 New Mexico households.
“As I understand it, it’s a combination of looking at opportunities to scale up food deliveries through school lunch and breakfast programs, as well as increasing the food supply through our food banks and food pantries,” she said. 
USDA won’t shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan

She directed reporters at a virtual news conference Friday afternoon to contact state officials for more details.
Late Friday, Jodi McGinnis Porter, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s deputy communications director, told Source New Mexico in an emailed statement that the state is “closely evaluating the USDA’s ever-changing guidance and exploring every available option to maintain food assistance for New Mexicans.”
While she did not provide full details of an emergency food plan, she offered a few more details about what will and won’t happen Nov. 1. 
For example, she said recipients who have existing balances on their electronic benefit cards from previous months can still use their cards on Nov. 1 or after. 
But she said the state is limited in its ability to use its own funds to pay for November SNAP benefits. The $16.6 million lawmakers recently passed during the special legislative session to offset SNAP cuts “cannot be used,” she said, “because most of the funding was appropriated for specific purposes rather than replacing federal SNAP benefits.”
The state is also expediting the delivery of $8 million to food banks the Legislature passed during the special session, she said, but that is only a fraction of the estimated $90 million the benefits are expected to cost, McGinnis Porter noted.
Members of the state’s congressional delegation wrote to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins this week contending the agency could use contingency funds to make up the shortfall. The USDA in a memo on Friday discounted that idea and also said states would not be reimbursed if they funded the benefits themselves.
Stansbury also said Friday that because the USDA’s Oct. 10 order prohibited states from sending recipient information to vendors, “many states” have interpreted the order to mean they can’t use state funds to refill the Electronic Benefit Transfer cards used by SNAP recipients. 
That means, supplemental SNAP funding New Mexico lawmakers passed earlier this month can “flow to our food banks, but it will not be funding that can get loaded on to individual EBT cards,” she said. 
NM food banks say they have no time to prepare for Nov. 1 SNAP stoppage 

To prepare for the loss of SNAP, New Mexico food banks say they are purchasing extra food and gearing up for additional food distributions that resemble those during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stansbury also compared the expected demand on food banks to what they saw in early 2020. 
“I do anticipate this is going to be very similar to the beginning of the pandemic, where you saw thousands of families having to line up at food banks and food pantries to get access to food,” she said. “It is a full scale crisis that the White House is manufacturing that is going to affect millions and millions of children.”
Along with members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez on Friday joined a group of 23 attorneys general denouncing the impending SNAP halt in a letter to USDA Secretary Rollins.
The letter calls on the USDA to account for any contingency funds it has available, what plans it has for those funds and how states should regard the Oct. 10 letter ordering states not to submit SNAP recipient info to state vendors.
The letter also says states have already taken steps to delay November benefits, “which will significantly harm millions of people who depend on SNAP to put food on the table, including children, seniors, veterans, disabled persons, and other vulnerable individuals struggling to meet their basic food needs.” 
The letter also argues USDA has no legal basis to prohibit states from sending already-calculated November benefits to EBT vendors, and it says contingency funds remain available to keep benefits flowing. 
“It is irresponsible to direct states to withhold this contingency funding, a decision which, if upheld, will devastate and cause irreparable harm to families,” Torrez said in a statement. “My office will do everything in its power to ensure these funds continue to be distributed and keep meals on the table for New Mexicans.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Client-food-basket-Santa-Fe-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 19:57:02.359480

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Hundreds gathered outside the federal Whipple Building at Fort Snelling Friday to protest the presence of Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who is leading the Trump administration’s efforts to detain and deport millions of immigrants. 
Noem held a press conference to tout the administration’s arrests of immigrants who have committed crimes. She spoke behind a table piled with seized firearms and bags of marijuana, meth and fentanyl. 
Many protesters feared Noem’s presence signaled the beginning of a large-scale immigration enforcement effort like the one launched in Chicago last month.
But Noem’s appearance focused instead on celebrating arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s St. Paul field office.  
“I’m here today to ask all of the people in Minnesota, all of the people in the Midwest and throughout our country, to support your law enforcement officers, to support them and help protect them as they go out and do their job,” Noem said. 
Dozens of clergy members attended the protest, leading demonstrators through songs like “This Little Light of Mine” and “We Shall Not Be Moved.” 
Craig Loya, a bishop at Episcopal Church in Minnesota, preached a message of inclusion.
“As long as I have breath, I will continue to preach and proclaim that diversity makes us stronger and that there is no clearer moral imperative than standing with the immigrant and the outsider, because that is how God has embraced every single one of us,” Loya said.

Protesters demonstrated right up to the Whipple Building’s glass doors, with many holding signs and shouting anti-ICE chants.
“No more Minnesota nice. We won’t want your fascist ICE,” the protesters chanted.
The chants did not reach the windowless room of the Whipple Building where Noem spoke. 
When asked whether President Donald Trump would deploy the National Guard or other federal law enforcement to the Twin Cities, Noem said “it’s up to the president.” 
But thousands of newly-trained ICE officers are expected to join field offices in the coming weeks, including in St. Paul, paid for by funding approved in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July, Noem said.
Under Noem, DHS has bucked precedent by requesting troves of personal data from states and other federal agencies to assist in deportation efforts; arresting people at courthouses; sending immigrants to countries they have no ties to and in some cases known for human rights abuses; and ignoring court orders.
Immigration agents detained a roofing crew in St. Paul on Oct. 3. The officers arrived in unmarked vehicles and refused to show their identification, according to advocates. Some wore masks. 
Asked about the incident, Noem said “our agents always follow exactly what the law is and what the regulation and the protocol is for every single operation that they’re out on, so they are always identifying themselves and making sure that people know who they are.”
A handful of Minnesota Democratic lawmakers also attended the protest, including DFL state Rep. Samantha Sencer-Mura, who said she was at the protest to send a message to Noem that she and ICE weren’t welcome in Minnesota.
“We know a lot of what they do — the point is just fear,” Sencer-Mura said. “Always trying to combat that with love and community is a good way to just show up.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MG_5354-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 19:17:29.934396

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is seen here signing the lawl on March 8, 2023. (Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ third-largest school district asked a federal court Friday to let it intervene in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the state’s school voucher program.
In a motion filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, the Little Rock School District also argued that the Educational Freedom Account program hurts public schools by diverting public funds “to support a separate system of private sectarian schools to the detriment of LRSD and other Arkansas public school districts.”
The district’s motion says that “for each student who leaves LRSD for a private school, or who is home schooled, because of the Voucher Program, LRSD loses resources necessary to educate its remaining students.” The district’s enrollment this school year is 18,964, according to the state education department’s website.
The EFA program was created by the LEARNS Act of 2023, a wide-ranging overhaul of the state’s public education laws that also raised annual teacher salaries to a minimum $50,000 and prohibited so-called “indoctrination” of students.
The LRSD motion supports arguments made in the original complaint filed by parents in June that the EFA program violates both the First Amendment’s provision prohibiting establishment of a state religion and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection clause.
The EFA program became available to all students this school year after being phased in two years ago. A recent estimate put the total cost in the 2025-26 school year at $326.1 million, more than the $277.4 million budgeted by the Legislature this spring.
“The provision of such significant sums of public money to support a system of private, mostly sectarian schools, violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution,” the motion argues.
The voucher program also discriminates against low-income families who can’t pay private school costs, students in rural areas who have no access to private schools and children with disabilities who “are not acceptable to many private schools,” in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the motion adds.

The school district also argues that instead of maintaining a robust system of free public schools as required by the Arkansas constitution, “the state has violated that obligation by creating a separate and competing system of publicly funded private religious schools, and providing vouchers to encourage students to attend those schools.”
In supporting its argument to intervene, the district says it “enrolls, on average, students with greater educational needs than the students in the private, sectarian school [system] supported by the LEARNS Act Voucher Program. LRSD has an interest in this case because the outcome will significantly impact these students and educators.”
“An outcome which allows the state to continue to invest in a separate private school system for more affluent students will inevitably work to the detriment of the constitutionally required free public school system,” the district argues.
Sam Dubke, a spokesperson for Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, directed the Advocate to a statement issued in June when parents and guardians of public school students — Gwen Faulkenberry, Special Sanders, Anika Whitfield and Kimberly Crutchfield — filed the lawsuit against Sanders, Education Secretary Jacob Oliva, the Arkansas State Board of Education and Department of Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson.
“This suit has no merit. More than 44,000 [now 51,000] students have applied for EFAs for next school year and far-left activists are playing politics with those kids’ futures to try and protect a failed status quo.”
Jeff LeMaster, a spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin, said, “We are reviewing the filing and will continue to proudly defend the LEARNS Act.”
The Little Rock district is being represented by Christopher Heller, Khayyam M. Eddings and Liz K. Harris of the Friday, Eldredge & Clark firm in Little Rock.

(Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)As a group of stakeholders and Idaho lawmakers prepare to address the state’s housing issues, a number of priorities have risen to the top: water and sewer infrastructure, incentives for affordable housing, zoning, and the impact on local government of House Bill 389. 
The Idaho Land Use and Housing Study Committee on Friday discussed its priorities for a final report on recommendations to improve housing affordability and availability in the state. The report is expected within the next month or two, and the committee will likely not meet again, according to one of the co-chairs.

The  committee, which is co-chaired by Sen. Jim Woodward, R-Sagle, and Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene, met five times since May to discuss subjects such as high land costs, permitting delays, zoning, building regulations and solutions from other states as it prepares to recommend legislation to address the issue in the 2026 legislative session, which begins in January. 
The group — created through legislation sponsored by Boise Democrat Sen. Ali Rabe — comprises lawmakers, building officials, local government representatives, and developers. 
 Committee members underscore high cost of infrastructure to support housing growth 

Discussion for the group’s top priorities repeatedly emphasized the need for funding for water and sewer infrastructure, so communities can absorb the high growth, especially in smaller communities. 
“Sewer, water infrastructure is massive,” said Trevor Chadwick, of the Association of Idaho Cities and the mayor of Star. “We’ve got several communities just in this valley that are struggling right now.” 
Many Idaho cities must ask voters to approve bonds to pay for water or sewer upgrades, which can be difficult to pass. Valley County Commissioner Sherry Maupin, of the Idaho Association of Counties, said the requirement to achieve a supermajority of 66.67% of the vote to pass bonds for construction can create hardship when those fail to pass but the need for the service remains. 
Rabe emphasized a need for “gentle density,” to avoid urban sprawl, which she said would cause even more expensive infrastructure investments to expand and maintain. She said less-restrictive zoning that may allow for smaller starter homes on smaller lots and infill in existing lots rather than expanding outside developed city areas. 
Sen. Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, also said it was his understanding that infilling in undeveloped or underdeveloped areas within cities that are already attached to water and sewer lines, is less expensive on infrastructure than expanding those services to suburban areas through sprawl. He, Redman, and others on the committee expressed support for expanding the rights of property owners to build accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, which are smaller, independent housing units on the same property as an existing home. 
Chadwick, of the Association for Idaho Cities, said he would caution against giving every property owner the right to create an ADU, as it could add strain on utility systems if too many additional users are added. 
“It’s the amount of sewage and stuff that goes into the system, regardless of where it comes from, it only can handle so much,” Chadwick said. “And so your systems, if you can’t expand those systems, we’re always going to be behind, and we will never be able to service and add the additional housing that we need.” 
City of Boise Building Official Jason Blais said the city’s public works department has not had issues with tying in smaller dwelling units to existing infrastructure. He highlighted that after Boise updated its zoning code in 2023 to allow for more ADUs, the city has seen permits for them go from 30 to 35 a year up to around 80 per year. 
 Many say tax incentives and ‘gap funding’ are needed to complete truly affordable housing 

Some members of the committee, such as Toews, argued that they mostly support free-market solutions to the housing issues. 
Others said that current high costs for land and construction made it impossible for developers to build housing that low and middle-income households could afford. 
“Developers, they build what the market can support, and then they build what’s feasible,” said Caleb Roope, CEO and president of the Eagle-based housing development company Pacific Companies. “… absent incentives, absent support from localities, those kinds of homes just won’t get built.” 
He and other committee members highlighted the state’s Workforce Housing Fund, which was created in 1992 but not funded until 2022, when the Idaho Legislature added $50 million. Rabe said it helped finance 1,200 units across the state. 
She and others expressed support for the state to make another investment in the fund.

Woodward, who also highlighted previous state investments in rural water and sewer infrastructure projects, said the state faced a “different budget picture” this year. In wake of back-to-back years of tax cuts, and increasing use of sales tax revenue, an October state budget report showed Idaho facing a projected $56.6 million deficit by the end of the fiscal year, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Committee members highlighted other ways to make affordable developments more financially feasible, such as property tax incentives or moral obligation bonds, which are tax-exempt government bonds with a moral but not legal obligation to pay back. 
Maupin, of the Idaho Association of Counties, said existing tax breaks for affordable housing came with too many restrictions to make them usable for many projects. 
Jason Kreizenbeck, a lobbyist representing a large workforce housing developer, said the firm plans to bring another version of House Bill 406 — a bill that it proposed during the 2025 session that would amend the property tax exemption for low-income units. The bill did not receive a public hearing. 
 Cities and counties still feeling damage from 2021 property tax bill House Bill 389 

Multiple representatives of city and county government said budgets continued to be hampered by 2021 legislation House Bill 389 — which capped the growth of local governments’ budgets and reduced how much they could collect from taxes related to new construction. The bill was meant to ease the property tax burden on residents. 
Chadwick said as a result of the bill, the Star region’s budget has been limited to a point where it can’t keep up with growth, leading to issues such as an empty fire station that’s been left unstaffed since local fire districts failed to pass levies to pay for the additional fire and emergency personnel needed to keep up with population growth, the Idaho Press reported previously. 
Rabe said that continuing to work on the legislation should remain a priority. 
“We do need to tackle the challenges that House Bill 389 has created for our cities, and not allowing growth to pay for itself,” Rabe said. “I think that has really been what I’ve heard as the root of the problem in all of this related to infrastructure. And I love the ideas that we have here, but I think because of House Bill 389, we are trying to plug holes in a sinking ship, essentially.”

A Bureau of Land Management auction planned for next summer could test the state’s migration policy to an unprecedented degree.
The post ‘Energy dominance’ meets migration: All Wyoming corridors overlap with proposed oil and gas leases appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal auction scheduled for June proposes leasing tracts of all three protected Wyoming migration corridors to oil and gas drilling, and it also opens the door to rigs within a now-unprotected pronghorn corridor that’s eyed for protections of its own. 
The potential for industrial incursion into habitats that prized ungulate populations depend on to reach their seasonal ranges in the Platte, Little Snake and Green River basins comes via the Bureau of Land Management’s lease sale of more than 250,000 acres in Wyoming. It’s a sale that’s now in the early “scoping” phase and could still change, but what’s been proposed is to auction more than five dozen parcels totalling 88,000 acres that overlap the state’s first three deer migration corridors and its in-the-works pronghorn corridor. 
The possibility of well pads and industrial infrastructure on the horizon within Wyoming’s most famous migration paths has environmental advocacy groups calling on the BLM to make responsible leasing decisions. 
“We simply can’t lease and allow development in our big game migration corridors if we want our kids and grandkids to have the same hunting and wildlife viewing opportunities that we’ve enjoyed,” said Julia Stuble, the Wyoming state director for The Wilderness Society.

That’s a premise Steve Degenfelder, a landman for Kirkwood Oil and Gas, disagrees with. He’s seeking to acquire at-issue leases in the Green River Basin that intersect with migration paths used by the Sublette herds of pronghorn and mule deer, but says he intends to use horizontal drilling and existing roads to minimize damage to the corridors.
“Wildlife folks can have their cake and eat it, too,” Degenfelder said. “They can have the activity occur far from these critical spaces and still enjoy the tax revenue.” 
Industry assurances and the potential for lease stipulations down the road haven’t placated groups that lobby on behalf of wildlife and wild places. The sheer number of conflicts with valuable habitat in the lease sale is of “great concern,” and it’s unclear whether BLM will listen to those concerns at a time when the federal government is shut down, said Alec Underwood, conservation director for the Wyoming Outdoor Council. 
“While there are places that are appropriate for oil and gas development, potentially fracturing our iconic big game migration corridors is an affront to all those who value Wyoming’s wildlife,” Underwood said.

The Bureau of Land Management’s Wyoming staff were unreachable for an interview. Because of the lapse in appropriations, the agency is only responding to “urgent” media inquiries related to visitor access, safety and essential operations, according to Kristen Peters, a U.S. Department of Interior spokeswoman. 
Underwood’s colleagues at the Wyoming Outdoor Council completed an analysis and compiled maps that show where and how many parcels intersect with designated, identified and known-to-science migration paths. 
The breakdown shows: 

In designated migration paths (those protected by Wyoming’s policy), there are 32 parcels in the lease sale that overlap corridors. Collectively, those parcels encompass 38,727 acres. There are seven parcels totaling 13,749 acres in the Sublette Mule Deer Corridor (AKA, Red Desert to Hoback), three parcels totaling 4,293 acres in the Platte Valley Mule Deer Corridor and 22 parcels totaling 20,685 acres in the Baggs Mule Deer Corridor. 
There are 31 parcels totaling 49,329 acres in the Sublette Pronghorn Corridor, which has been “identified” by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and is in the process of being assessed for designation by Gov. Mark Gordon. Notably, significant overlap occurs in a disputed portion of the pronghorn corridor located east of Farson. 
The Wyoming Outdoor Council also analyzed parcels in the lease sale that bisected migration routes mapped by the U.S. Geological Survey. There were 23 parcels totaling 29,775 acres that overlapped the Shirley Basin Pronghorn migration (12 parcels, 11,896 acres), Elk Mountain pronghorn migration (five parcels, 6,725 acres) and the Wyoming Range mule deer migration (six parcels, 11,154 acres).

In total, BLM’s second-quarter 2026 sale proposes leasing roughly triple the acreage of what’s slated to be offered during upcoming auctions in December and March. The sharp increase in potentially leased ground comes in the wake of President Donald Trump’s pledge of “energy dominance” — he even declared October to be “National Energy Dominance Month.”

The federal budget reconciliation bill, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by Trump, also requires land managers to make more ground available to oil and gas drilling — at least 50% of all public land nominated by industry, according to the Center for Western Priorities. 
Degenfelder, at Kirkwood Oil and Gas, said that many of the parcels he’s interested in leasing in the Green River Basin, including in the migration corridors, were originally nominated via an “expression of interest” he submitted back in 2021, during the Biden administration. The BLM considered offering some of those leases in 2023, but they never materialized in an auction, he said.
“The Rock Springs Field Office authorized them to be offered, and then the state office reversed that,” Degenfelder said.

Stuble, at The Wilderness Society, said federal land managers should pull back leases that are in the migration corridor. The BLM, she argued, has a “statutory obligation” to inventory the migration routes and design management around them. 
“That has not happened for the vast majority of the corridors that are in this lease sale,” Stuble said. “The bottom line for us is allowing gas rigs and well pads in places where the migrating animals forage and rest puts those herds at risk.” 
If the parcels in migration paths do go forward to auction, there’s a likelihood that at least the 32 tracts in designated routes will be affixed with a migration stipulation. Language would be added at the request of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, according to Will Schultz, the agency’s habitat protection supervisor.
“The lessee or designated operator will be required to work with the BLM and state of Wyoming to take reasonable measures to maintain corridor functionality,” Schultz said.

Schultz is in the process of compiling Game and Fish’s comment letter in response to the BLM lease sale. The state’s migration policy, he said, does not allow for stipulations in the “identified” corridors — like the Sublette Pronghorn herd’s migration.  
“There aren’t the same protections that are afforded to designated routes,” Schultz said. “However … it allows for us to have that opportunity to have a discussion with the operator on voluntary measures that they can take.” 
In an earlier era, Wyoming Game and Fish sought complete lease deferrals when more than 90% of a parcel overlapped with a migration corridor. During a lease sale in the first Trump administration, for example, BLM pulled more than 7,500 acres in the Sublette Mule Deer Migration Corridor path from an auction at the request of the agency. Still, 32 parcels totaling nearly 13,000 acres that overlapped the corridor went to auction and they generated lukewarm interest: Bids topped out at $9 an acre, far below the statewide average of $202 an acre during the 2018 sale.

 “We were hoping that we were gonna be able to get that declaration. It's very hard for a town like ours to pay that kind of money,” said Burke’s town administrator, James Sullivan. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trump denies federal disaster aid for Vermont’s July 2025 flooding.","In the past two years, the town of Burke has relied on federal funds to recover from floods, but this year, Burke will be cut off from a key source of that funding.
On July 10, rainfall and flooding significantly damaged public infrastructure in Burke and other towns in Caledonia and Essex counties. In August, Gov. Phil Scott submitted a request to President Donald Trump for a major disaster declaration, citing more than $1.8 million in statewide damages, exceeding the $1.2 million threshold that states need to meet to qualify for a declaration.
But Wednesday night, Trump denied the request. 
A federal disaster declaration would have unlocked Federal Emergency Management Agency funding to reimburse municipalities for 75% of the costs, including debris removal, road and public building repairs, and staff overtime during and after the storm.
The declaration would have also made available funds from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which provides 75% reimbursement for projects that reduce the risk of damage to public infrastructure during future disasters.
Other blue states, Illinois and Maryland, were also denied their requests, while states such as Alaska, Nebraska and North Dakota, and the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe in Minnesota, were approved for major disaster declarations.
Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland responded to the President’s decision in a press release saying, “FEMA has a responsibility to weigh the merits of each emergency request objectively. Instead, President Trump and his Administration have politicized disaster relief, and our communities are the ones who will pay the price. While we disagree with both this process and outcome, our resolve is unbroken. We will continue to support Marylanders recovering from these storms, even if Washington won’t.”
Eric Forand, Vermont Emergency Management director with the Department of Public Safety, said the letter from FEMA on Wednesday night didn’t provide any specific reasons about why the funds were denied.
“All we know is that there’s a threshold (of damage costs) that we crossed, but in the end, it is the discretion of the president, so we did submit it, and we were denied,” Forand said.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson called the federal government’s response “non-political” in a response to VTDigger’s request for comment. 
“The law and regulations require FEMA to review each request closely and consider the unique circumstances of disaster-caused damages as well as state and local capacity. This request was determined that the damage from the event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state and affected local governments to recover,” the spokesperson wrote.
Burke’s town administrator, James Sullivan, said Burke received disaster declarations after the 2023 and 2024 floods.
“We were hoping that we were gonna be able to get that declaration. It’s very hard for a town like ours to pay that kind of money,” he added, explaining that the town had between $400,000 and $500,000 worth of damage to public infrastructure from this year’s flooding.
Now, Sullivan said, the town will work closely with the Vermont League of Cities and Towns and the Northeastern Vermont Development Association to explore other options, but if they can’t find any solution, costs could fall on taxpayers.
Forand said state officials are still evaluating different courses of action and haven’t decided whether to appeal the government’s denial of federal funding.
A recent analysis by the Pew Research Center shows that without federal assistance after the most significant disasters, many states would see their reserves depleted.
Vermont was among the most vulnerable states to federal funding cuts, according to the analysis. The study looked at the highest amount a state received in a single year for disaster aid, then compared it against the state’s reserves. Vermont received its highest tally of disaster aid — more than $421 million —  in 2011, following Tropical Storm Irene, according to Peter Muller, one of the authors of the research. In 2024, the state’s reserves were just slightly more than that, at $465 million. 
The only states with higher aid-to-reserve ratios were Louisiana and Mississippi — which received billions of dollars in funding from the federal government following Hurricane Katrina,  and were therefore considered outliers in Pew’s analysis. 
Muller highlighted that if states have to use those funds for disasters, they would not be able to use them for other unexpected demands. 
“The really important thing to keep in mind is: Those reserves for Vermont, and every other state, are often intended for more than one purpose. They’re not just sitting there waiting for disasters,” he said.

“No new SNAP benefits will be issued for November unless federal guidance changes,” the department said in a press release. 
This move comes more than three weeks into the federal shutdown, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it would not tap into its $6 billion contingency fund to cover food assistance next month.
Nearly 400,000 Mississippians receive food assistance through SNAP, and the vast majority are families with children or elderly people. That is about 13% of the population, slightly higher than the 12% nationwide who use SNAP to help buy groceries.
 The Associated Press reported that officials in Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia pledged Thursday to keep food aid flowing to recipients in their states, even if the federal program is stalled next month because of the government shutdown.
The Mississippi Department of Human Services encourages members to use up their current benefits before the end of October to buy shelf-stable foods, such as canned goods. It’s not clear whether SNAP clients will be able to use pre-existing benefits beyond Oct. 31, the department said. 
The department will continue to process new applications. Current enrollees are also reminded to fulfill all requirements to remain eligible. 
New work requirements for SNAP are slated to fall into place next month, as well, as a result of a federal budget law that President Donald Trump signed during the summer. Work requirements already exist, but the law increases the upper age limit on those from 54 to 65 and extends the requirement to those previously exempt: veterans, those facing homelessness, and young people aging out of foster care. There is still a caregiver exemption, but parents must have children younger than  14 – down from 18.

But Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New […]","Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, is backing bills to move back dates on Louisiana's 2026 election calendar to allow for a possible U.S. Supreme Court decision that could reshape the state's congressional districts. (Photo by Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)A state lawmaker behind the effort to move back Louisiana’s election calendar next year says legal experts have told him there is a chance the U.S. Supreme Court could rule on a key congressional redistricting case in time for the legislature to draw new boundaries for the 2026 midterm elections.
But Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, said there is no firm date or guarantee that justices will issue their decision in time to justify the calendar change he’s proposed. Two identical bills that adjust next year’s election dates have advanced from their respective chambers through two days of a special legislative session on election laws. 
The measures move next year’s primary election schedule back roughly one month. Instead of an April 18 party primary for Louisiana’s congressional races and some municipal elections, the new date would be May 16. Primary runoffs would be moved from May 30 to June 2. 
The qualifying period for the election would be adjusted from Jan. 14-16 to Feb. 11-13 in the bills Beaullieu and Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, R-Port Allen, have both co-authored.
Beaullieu said these new dates would allow Louisiana to “take advantage of a window of time” that would be created if the Supreme Court rules before the end of the year on Callais v. Louisiana. The case involves a group of white voters who sued the state over a map created in January 2024 with a second majority-Black district in the U.S. House of Representatives out of the state’s six spots. 
The plaintiffs have called into question a portion of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, created and amended over decades to protect the electoral strength of Black citizens. They argue Section 2, which prohibits voting laws or procedures that discriminate based on race, color or membership in a language minority group, now conflicts with the 14th and 15th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Those amendments cover, in part, representation in Congress and racial discrimination in voting.
Gov. Jeff Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill, both Republicans, originally supported the version of a congressional map with two Black-majority seats. They now stand with plaintiffs and hope the Supreme Court rejects the current map that includes the 6th Congressional District, held by U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields, D-Baton Rouge, that covers a winding stretch between Baton Rouge and Shreveport.
Beaullieu, who chairs the House and Governmental Affairs Committee, confirmed he was part of a state contingency that went to Washington. D.C., for the Supreme Court’s Oct. 15 hearings on the Callais case. Justices heard from both parties in March but later asked for further arguments on the Voting Rights Act provisions.  
The Louisiana group also met with Trump administration officials Oct. 15, but Beaullieu said there was no discussion of when the Supreme Court might rule on Callais.  
“There was a visit at the White House, but it was more to make sure that what we were doing was giving our legislature the most flexibility [for a possible redistricting],” Beaullieu said in an interview. “They weren’t saying anything about dates or anything.” 
Rep. Ed Larvadain, D-Alexandria, disputed Beaullieu’s account Friday morning during a House and Governmental Affairs hearing on the election calendar bill. He speculated, without evidence, that Landry already has been given word that the Supreme Court will throw out Louisiana’s current congressional map and will allow lawmakers to draw a new version with one or no majority-Black districts.
“The governor wouldn’t call us in and spend all this money if there wasn’t an opinion coming,” Larvadain said. “I think an opinion has already been written. It just hasn’t been dropped yet.”
Beaullieu stressed to the committee there’s no official forecast when the Callias decision will be issued. He later acknowledged to a reporter the election calendar changes he backs would become pointless if the Supreme Court doesn’t rule before the end of the year.
“We’re not going to second-guess ourselves,” Beaullieu added. “It would be the opposite if we had not had the session, and [justices] come back early enough [with a decision]. Then our hands are tied because we didn’t push the dates back. I think that would be the worst-case scenario, so I think us being proactive is the best thing for the state and the legislature.” 
Black Democrats on the House and Governmental Affairs Committee pressed Beaullieu to explain his optimism for an earlier-than-usual Supreme Court ruling on the Callais case. He said lawyers have told him that because justices have heard two sets of arguments in the case, they could be inclined to rule this year instead of waiting until the spring when they typically issue their decisions after fall arguments. 
Pressed to identify those lawyers, Beaullieu said they included Attorney General Murrill and House Speaker Pro Tempore Mike Johnson, R-Pineville, among others.
“I don’t know that that’s a scientific answer,” Beaullieu said. “That’s just the thoughts that are out there.”
Rep. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, raised concerns with Beaullieu that a Supreme Court decision on Callais, followed soon by an anticipated redistricting session, might run afoul of what’s called the Purcell principle. It comes from a 2006 ruling when justices said election laws should not be changed too close to an election because it could lead to confusion among officials.
First Assistant Secretary of State Catherine Newsom told the committee her agency is prepared to move forward with next year’s elections whether they stay on their current dates or get pushed back one month.
If the legislature does revisit redistricting later this year, the secretary of state would need data from the new maps by mid-January to begin the revised three-day qualifying period Feb. 11.
The Louisiana Senate will meet Saturday and is expected to advance Kleinpeter’s versions of the Beaullieu election calendar bill and a proposal that moves five state constitutional amendments from the April ballot to May. 
The House returns Monday.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden and a group of legislators — including one seeking his job — made rival proposals this week to shift millions in state housing infrastructure funds to other purposes.
On Wednesday, a legislative task force working on property tax reduction advanced 19 ideas that could become legislation this winter. The ideas include taking the roughly $65 million remaining in the state’s housing infrastructure fund and pairing it with money from the state’s budget reserves to provide $500 individual property tax credits to homeowners.
On Friday, Rhoden said he wants to use $30 million of housing infrastructure money to offer interest-free loans of up to $15 million each for expansion projects at the Sioux Falls and Rapid City airports.
“We’ve seen huge increases in travelers coming through these airports,” Rhoden said while making the announcement at the airport in Sioux Falls. “With more gates, more flights, and more destinations, we’ll be able to draw more visitors.” 
The plans require approval from legislators, who will gather in January at the Capitol in Pierre for their annual lawmaking session.

Both plans target the Housing Infrastructure Financing Program, which legislators and Rhoden’s predecessor, Kristi Noem, created in 2023. They used a mix of state and federal money to create a $200 million fund.
Awards from the program cover up to a third of a developer’s cost for things like roads, water-and-sewer lines, and sidewalks. The fund has supported 83 projects statewide, helping to create 7,360 single-family housing lots and 5,754 apartment or other multi-family units.
Half of the fund went out as grants. About $65 million remains from the other half, devoted to loans.
Rhoden wants to move the $65 million from the housing infrastructure fund to the state’s Revolving Economic Development and Initiative Fund, known as the REDI Fund. The $30 million could then be loaned to the airports. 
Rhoden did not specify a use for the rest of the money, but in the REDI Fund it would be available for low-interest loans to start-up firms, businesses that are expanding or relocating in South Dakota, and local economic development corporations. REDI Fund loans are awarded by the state Board of Economic Development, whose members are appointed by the governor.
When asked about the shift in purpose for the money, Rhoden’s spokeswoman, Josie Harms, responded with a statement.
“It wouldn’t have been right to use these dollars sooner, before they had the opportunity to be used for housing development — but by now they have,” the statement said. “Most of the original $200 million was invested into housing, and what remains is currently sitting unused; therefore, adding no value to South Dakotans. It’s only right to invest these dollars so that they are actively adding value to our great state.”
Rhoden has not yet formally declared himself a candidate to keep his job next year, but he has published a campaign website and is seeking campaign contributions. 
The idea to use remaining housing infrastructure money for property tax credits is from state House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, one of several declared candidates for governor in next year’s elections and a co-chairman of the property tax task force.
Rhoden criticized Hansen’s plan Friday. 
“That proposal, quite frankly, has no merit,” Rhoden said, arguing that one-time credits would be a bandage approach to the ongoing problem of rising property taxes.
Hansen responded in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight.
“Families are getting hammered by high property taxes, and they remain my top priority,” Hansen said. “They need relief now — no more delays, no more excuses, and definitely no more of these budget swaps to fund pet projects.”

Rhoden has his own proposal to lower property taxes by giving counties — which currently can’t impose sales taxes — the option to levy a half-percent sales tax while using the revenue to lower or replace homeowner property taxes.
Meanwhile, an economic development official thinks the remaining housing dollars should stay where they are.
“We’re disappointed that the administration has turned away from the business of investing in housing infrastructure,” said Julie Johnson, an Aberdeen-area lobbyist for various economic development and housing groups. “These are very important funds in the world of housing development across the state.”
Last week, the president and CEO of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, Neel Kashkari, told a Rapid City audience that the best thing local governments can do for housing affordability is encourage more home construction.
“Localities need to look at what can you do locally to try to remove some of the barriers that are preventing more supply from coming in,” Kashkari said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0959-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 18:56:50.412075

Summer nuclear site near Fairfield. (Provided by S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s state-owned utility is entering negotiations with a New York investment firm to finish partially built nuclear reactors abandoned eight years ago.
Santee Cooper’s governing board voted unanimously Friday to allow the power company’s management team to officially begin negotiating with Brookfield Asset Management on an agreement to restart construction of the failed expansion project at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County.
Brookfield, which boasts a $1 trillion global investment portfolio, was among more than 70 companies to express interest after Santee Cooper put a call out nine months ago. It was a partner on one of 15 proposals Santee Cooper ultimately reviewed.
Negotiations will continue over the next six weeks, CEO Jimmy Staton said. Santee Cooper will name the other partners on the project at a later date.
Santee Cooper did not make public the potential terms of the deal, expected to be valued in the billions.
But Staton said Santee Cooper would use any cash proceeds it may earn from the agreement to pay down debts still owed on the abandoned nuclear facility. Customers could also benefit from the power the reactors would produce if finished.
“I feel pretty confident that our customers will realize some fairly significant value, both rates wise and otherwise, in this process,” Staton said.
Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.
Final executive punished for VC Summer failure to spend at least 10 months in prison

The utilities abandoned the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before jointly spending $9 billion on the reactors that never produced a single megawatt.
Santee Cooper’s share of the debt was $3.6 billion, which customer continue to pay for on their monthly bills. Those payments could continue, in part or in full, through 2032, depending how much money Santee Cooper can secure for a buy down in any final deal with Brookfield.
If the two companies manage to ink a contract, Staton pledged that Santee Cooper customers will face no new costs associated with the project. All of that will be borne by Brookfield, as well as big tech companies, such as Google or Meta, that could buy the nuclear power a finished plant would generate.
“We’ve protected the rate payers of South Carolina, and quite frankly, I think we’ve shifted the paradigm of how nuclear energy gets built here in the United States,” Staton said.
After the firms mothballed the reactors eight years ago, SCE&G’s parent company, SCANA, spiraled into bankruptcy, as did the reactors’ designer, Westinghouse.
Virginia-headquartered Dominion Energy bought up SCANA.
Dominion is not part of the deal, so it won’t at all pay down debt saddled to its 800,000 South Carolina customers. They’ll continue to pay over the next 14 years for $2.3 billion worth of debt from the abandoned expansion.
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

And it was Santee Cooper’s potential new partner, Brookfield, that took over Westinghouse in 2018.
To restart construction, Santee Cooper and Brookfield will need to find a construction firm. Westinghouse, which remains a part of Brookfield’s investment portfolio, won’t be the builder this time, Staton said.
It will take a year or more of due diligence, licensing and permitting before any construction on the inactive plants can restart, Staton added.
Among the funds Brookfield manages is a portfolio focused on clean energy and decarbonization. Earlier this month, the firm announced it had raised $20 billion for the effort.
The move to restart V.C. Summer follows calls by Gov. Henry McMaster earlier this year for a “nuclear power renaissance” in the state.
Sen. Graham on SC’s proposed nuclear reboot: ‘We’re going to finish these reactors’

And U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has vowed his support for the effort, which will ultimately have to make its way through the federal regulatory process.
Staton also pointed to a May executive order signed by President Donald Trump, which calls on the Department of Energy to prioritize approvals for 10 large-scale nuclear reactors under construction by 2030.
“South Carolina is going to have number one and number two in that process,” Staton said. “You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear in the United States.”
Still, nuclear power projects are expensive and take years to complete.
Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, operated by Southern Co. in Georgia, started construction around the same time as V.C. Summer. Work on the expansion wrapped up last year. Today the site is the nation’s largest nuclear plant, with four reactors.

Gov. Phil Scott released a set of initiatives that he says will help address public safety in Burlington, ranging from increasing law enforcement presence to expanding substance use treatment. 
Details of how the proposals would be rolled out remain under ongoing discussion, officials said Friday, with state and city leaders adding that, despite past tensions, working together and combining resources would be key to the plan’s success.  
The governor announced the steps of the 14-point “short term action plan” in a press release Thursday. 
“I believe this collaborative effort will help Burlington turn the corner, so residents, students, visitors, business owners and their employees feel safe, so they can enjoy all the attributes this historic city has to offer,” Scott said in the announcement. 
He also underscored that the proposals would be put into effect over a three to four month period, with more long-term efforts to come. 
The outline does not go into great detail about many of the proposals — most are laid out in only a sentence. The initiatives also do not include projected cost estimates or provide information about how they would be funded. 
Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, wrote in an email Friday that the plan will be funded “within existing resources.”

It is unclear what the projected price tag for each part of the plan would be and how that would be funded. Wheeler did not immediately respond to a follow-up email requesting more details.
Scott’s announcement comes more than a month after he declared he would develop a plan to address public safety concerns in Burlington. Previously, Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak said that Scott wasn’t doing enough to help the Queen City. 
In turn, Jennifer Morrison, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Safety and Burlington’s former police chief, said at an August press conference with the governor that Burlington was the one that needed to step up. “The city has made their bed, and they are going to have to ask for specifics to help turn the corner,” Morrison said at that time.  
Speaking on the governor’s new plans, Mulvaney-Stanak said Friday that the city is grappling with more complex problems than a municipality could possibly handle on its own. 
She sees homelessness, mental health issues and the opiate crisis as the main “trifecta” of issues the city is grappling with, she said. While those problems are certainly suffered statewide, she said that Burlington has been “the canary in the mine” for some time. 
Mulvaney-Stanak said that as the governor’s plans get underway in the coming months, it’s time to start looking at medium and long-term solutions. 
“How do we get to the deeper issues here that underpin a lot of the folks who are truly suffering in the center of all this?” she asked. 
A special court docket
One part of Scott’s plan — the establishment of a special docket aimed at reducing a backlog of cases pending in Chittenden County Superior criminal court — was already announced earlier this month and is now up and running. Its launch came after public defenders saw a large recent uptick in criminal cases in the county over the summer. 
That plan included the governor appointing a special prosecutor, the judiciary assigning a judge, and the defender general’s office naming a lead defense attorney to help move cases of people with five or more cases through the court system. 
A retired judge, Martin Maley, has been specially assigned to preside over the docket, according to Chief Superior Judge Thomas Zonay. 
Zonay added in an email Friday that the governor’s office has “indicated” it will cover the costs associated with operating the additional courtroom during the 90-day pilot docket period. 
“We project that the additional costs, including a judicial officer, court personnel and security personnel to approximate $150,000,” Zonay wrote. 
Police cooperation
In his latest announcement, Scott said that a number of policing initiatives will accompany the court. He offered state law enforcement resources to assist city police with “foot patrols, marked unit presence, and greater visibility in Burlington,” the announcement said. 
Scott also directed local service providers that work with the Agency of Human Services to use law enforcement “when appropriate for violent and disruptive behaviors in and around their premises.” 
Adam Silverman, a state police spokesperson, referred specific questions about the law enforcement agency’s role in the plan, and how the plan would be funded, to the governor’s office. 
Wheeler, the governor’s spokesperson, stated in an email that the administration would be in “close communication” with Burlington Police Chief Shawn Burke “to coordinate the operational details.”
Details of collaboration between city and state police are yet to be determined, Burke said Friday. Burke said he’s meeting soon with the director of the state police and Zach Weight, the special prosecutor, to iron out the details. 
Burke said he doesn’t see Scott’s plan as an “enforcement only” strategy.
“Any notion that enforcement is the only way out of this is completely false, but policing is important,” Burke said. And sometimes police presence and response is necessary to keep people safe, he said. 
Burke doesn’t expect Scott’s plan to change the way his officers police, he said. It really augments resources, he said. 
Mulvaney-Stanak said that she’s grateful for the resources in the court system, but that it’s necessary for the court and the police to also be connecting people with the resources they need, rather than just incarcerating them. 
Prison is a “non-solution” — both her Burke share that opinion, Mulvaney-Stanak said. People should only be sentenced to prison if they’re violent or an acute threat to the community, she said. 
Pre-trial supervision
For people who are sentenced to prison, Scott’s plan calls for the corrections department to expand prison substance use treatment as well as the “immediate implementation” of a pre-trial supervision program in Burlington.
Haley Sommer, a corrections department spokesperson, said Friday that the department already provides substance treatment to incarcerated individuals, such as medication assisted treatment. 
The proposal calls for the corrections department to “intensify” substance use treatment in facilities to provide services more like a person would receive in a residential treatment facility available in the community, Sommer said. That would include, Sommer said, increased hours, enhanced assessments and additional types of treatment. 
The pretrial supervision program will build on a pilot program already underway in Essex and Orleans counties, and expand it into Burlington and Chittenden County, according to Sommer.
“It serves those who have been charged with a crime and that are awaiting trial and they are in the community,” Sommer said. 
According to Sommer, the program targets “certain high-risk” people who may have previously violated their conditions of release or have multiple dockets and need more support services as they await resolution of their cases. 
Sommer said money to pay for the pretrial supervision initiative in Burlington would come from funds in the state budget already approved for the previously planned expansion of the program.  
Mulvaney-Stanak said that she and Weight, special prosecutor of the new court, have already noticed a gap in services between when someone is cited for a crime and when they appear in court. “That’s an immediate break in a system that often will push people right back out into the street,” she said. They are considering how to close that gap, she said. 
Scott’s creation of the new court comes at a time when corrections facilities in Vermont are oversubscribed, with male facilities almost 60% above the recommended threshold, according to department data. Sommer said it’s not clear at this point whether the overall plan would lead to an increase in people incarcerated.
“It’s challenging to predict what those numbers will look like,” Sommer said. “We do also have some outlet for sending individuals out of state as we’re currently contracted for around 300 beds, but only have 128 men out of state.”

He's seen here speaking in 2024 at the Colorado Bar Association office in Denver. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said he would support a state constitutional amendment that would allow the state to redraw its congressional districts to offset partisan gerrymandering in other states.
Weiser, a Democrat who is also running for governor next year, is the first statewide official to support such an idea. He first shared his support during a Thursday interview with 9News. On Friday his campaign announced his position in a statement.
“When states like Texas and North Carolina redraw their maps to stack the deck in favor of Republicans, Colorado must be prepared to respond. If we want to stop this dangerous power grab, we must remove the incentive for these tactics in the first place — that means being ready to act,” he said in the statement.

President Donald Trump has urged Republican-led states to redraw their congressional lines so the party can pick up more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives next year. Texas, Missouri and North Carolina completed that mid-decade redistricting to give Republicans an advantage. California voters will decide on a ballot measure to redraw the state’s maps in November.
“When other states break long established norms and do mid-decade redistricting, Colorado can’t stand idly by and just watch,” Weiser said.
An independent redistricting commission draw congressional maps in Colorado, and the panel redrew the maps for the first time in 2021. Colorado has eight congressional districts, with four represented by Democrats and four represented by Republicans.
A proposed state constitutional amendment for next year’s ballot, however, would give the governor emergency redistricting power to offset “national redistricting imbalances.” That ballot measure has not yet been filed with the secretary of state’s Title Board, but it underwent a review by Legislative Council Staff in September.
Weiser is calling for a “narrowly-drawn” constitutional amendment to allow mid-decade redistricting. The earliest any new maps could be drawn under that amendment would be for the 2028 cycle.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, the other high-profile Democrat running for Colorado governor, said in a statement to Newsline that Democrats need to focus on flipping House seats to put pressure on Trump.
“All options should be on the table to defend our democracy, but changing the maps in 2028 is too late,” he said. “We can take on Republicans like (Rep.) Lauren Boebert and win House seats here in Colorado — from Adams and Weld Counties to the Western Slope and El Paso County.”

Gov. Kelly Armstrong remains steadfast in his refusal to reappoint incumbent Murray Sagsveen. Sens. David Hogue, R-Minot, and Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, adamantly maintain he should be one of the three appointees to minimize turnover on the board. 
“The learning curve for new people on this commission is probably two to three years because it’s a very complex commission,” Hogan said. “I’m concerned about continuity, and that’s part of the reason why I’m hesitant to replace Mr. Sagsveen.”

Hogue and Armstrong believe the Ethics Commission has been trespassing upon executive branch authority and that needs to be addressed. But they differ on whether Sagsveen can be part of the solution. 
Armstrong also said he strongly disagrees with Sagsveen’s assertion in a candidate questionnaire that the Legislature has passed laws to limit the authority of the Ethics Commission, violating the state constitution.
Hogue suggested the committee appoint one candidate to a four-year term to replace Ward Koeser and then continue to work toward a compromise on the remaining two vacancies. Koeser isn’t seeking reappointment.
“I don’t think any one of us would lose any bargaining position if we fill that position today,” Hogue said. 
Armstrong, a Republican, said he prefers to appoint candidates to all three vacancies simultaneously instead of making piecemeal selections. 
“I want the weekend to think about it,” Armstrong said. 
Sagsveen and Koeser continue to serve on the commission until replaced or reappointed by the selection committee even though their terms expired on Aug. 31. Cynthia Lindquist and Ron Goodman’s terms expire in 2027. The fifth seat is vacant following the May death of former Chair Dave Anderson. 
Sagsveen was initially appointed to the commission last September to fill a vacancy after Paul Richard retired. Sagsveen has nearly five decades of experience in state government and has served under multiple Republican leaders. 
The appointment of an ethics commissioner requires the consensus of the governor, Senate majority leader and Senate minority leader, not a majority vote. 
Armstrong adjourned the meeting after 11 minutes of discussion. No appointments were made. The committee will reconvene early next week. 
Governor wants ‘reset’ from North Dakota Ethics Commission as committee deadlocks on candidates

Cathy Bliss, a member of the League of Women Voters who routinely observes Ethics Commission meetings, said she is mystified by the governor’s refusal to reappoint Sagsveen. 
“I was really quite shocked. Apparently I’m still naive at this age,” Bliss said in an interview. 
But she is encouraged by the bipartisanship of Hogue and Hogan who have presented a united front. 
“Take your time. Get it right because this is really important,” Bliss said. “We’re at a critical juncture.”
Ellen Chaffee, one of the private citizens and activists behind the constitutional amendment that created the Ethics Commission, took issue with Armstrong demanding a “reset” from the watchdog agency.
She said the tenor of the discourse around and with the Ethics Commission by other parts of state government needs to change. 
“There’s a certain level of maturity and respect and civility,” Chaffee said. “That’s what needs to be reset.” 
Hogan said after the meeting she is worried about delaying the appointments for too long because the Ethics Commission has been “tentative” about taking action until the new members of the board are appointed.
“I’m not sure if we can get to consensus,” Hogan said.

(Photo via Getty Images)The Iowa Freedom of Information Council is arguing against the award of damages in a libel case where the plaintiffs showed no evidence of harm to their reputation.
In June 2021, a Polk County jury awarded $8 million to a Polk County man and his daughter in a defamation case against their neighbor, former Des Moines lawyer Jaysen McCleary. The plaintiffs had alleged McCleary had wrongfully claimed the man sexually molested his own daughter.
The Iowa Court of Appeals reversed that decision when it found the district court erred by denying a trial continuance McCleary had sought for health reasons. The case was remanded to district court for a new trial to assess damages, resulting in the father and daughter being awarded a combined $57,000 in compensatory damages for emotional distress, plus $570,000 in punitive damages. The district court then reduced the punitive-damage award to $55,000.
That decision is being appealed and cross-appealed, and this week the Iowa Freedom of Information Council weighed in through a friend-of-the-court brief, arguing that such damages shouldn’t be permitted in libel cases that involve non-media defendants and where there’s been no showing of reputational harm.
“The juries that tried this matter were instructed to assess damages for (McCleary’s) speech,” the council argues in its brief to the court. “So, unlike most any other tort case, plaintiffs’ injury was presumed, and jurors were charged only with calculating how much to give them in damages for libel. Yet the evidence demonstrated these plaintiffs had incurred no injury to reputation. The resultant awards accordingly arose without proof of an otherwise essential element of a defamation claim and provided compensation for hurt feelings only.”
The council argues the two jury awards in the McCleary case contradict the directive of the Iowa Civil Jury Instructions on libel damages, which tell jurors that “damages must be limited to those which naturally result from the defendant’s statement.”
The council argues the district court’s own rulings in the case “establish the irrefutable fact that the plaintiffs did not incur any injury to reputation from the statements they claim defamed them.”
As evidence of that conclusion, the council cites post-trial rulings in which the district court asserted that “there was no evidence that either plaintiff suffered any reputational damage,” and that there was “no testimony that any individual believed” any of the statements made by McCleary.
“The district court made findings and rulings that the record lacked proof of the very essence of a libel action, which is injury to reputation,” the council argues in its brief.
As part of that same brief, the council says it hopes to add a “distinct public policy voice to the debate” on free-speech protection that is “afforded everyday Iowans sued for defamation, especially now that libel per se verdicts in the state regularly surpass the $1 million mark.”
The council argues the district court’s decision — confirming no injury to the plaintiffs’ reputation while endorsing the recovery of damages — “defies logic and offends the widely accepted principle that courts redress injury rather than reward favored litigants with a windfall.”
In its friend-of-the-court brief, the council also notes that it is acting “in support of free speech generally, rather than for or against any speaker or subject.” In fact, the council says it “renounces the conduct of the parties, including how each has used libel law and the judicial system as armaments to wage personal war.”
The council also notes that McCleary unsuccessfully pursued lawsuits against the Des Moines Register, one of its founding members, and former Register reporter Clark Kauffman, now with the Iowa Capital Dispatch, for a series of stories about McCleary’s use of the court system.
Editor’s note: Jaysen McCleary filed a defamation suit against Clark Kauffman, currently Iowa Capital Dispatch deputy editor, and his former employer, The Des Moines Register, related to a story the Register published in 2017.

The October survey also found that public opinion around Scott’s return-to-office mandates, and his refusal to send National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., ran clearly along party lines.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
The latest University of New Hampshire Green Mountain State Poll results released on Friday indicate that the majority of Vermonters approve of Gov. Phil Scott’s performance in office and want him to run for reelection next year.
The October poll outlined political positioning leading up to next year’s statewide elections, according to professor Andrew Smith, an author of the poll and director of UNH’s Survey Center. It draws on 880 survey responses collected last week, which are weighted according to demographic information from U.S. Census data and recent election results, Smith said.
The governor has remained relatively popular with Democrats and “mitigated some of the anger” from those farther to his right since the presidential election, Smith said. “He’s in a pretty good spot for reelection.”

Over 60% of Vermonters approved of Scott’s work as governor, with 57% to some extent in favor of him running for reelection. Slightly less than half believed he actually deserved to be reelected, the survey said.
Scott’s consistently high standing in polling is particularly noteworthy given the state’s strong blue leanings in other areas of politics, Smith said. The survey found 80% of Democrats and over half of all Vermonters describe Scott as far or slightly to the right of their own views. Yet in a question that allowed poll-takers to say they wanted multiple potential candidates to run, Scott registered only slightly lower support, 47%, among Democrats than the 50% garnered by liberal State Treasurer and rumored gubernatorial hopeful Mike Pieciak. An even lower 38% of Democrats said they wanted State Attorney General Charity Clark — another possible challenger for governor — to run. 
But Scott’s potential Democratic opponents also registered high rates of “don’t know/no opinion” responses to this query. “The major reason for Vermonters’ ambivalence about Pieciak and Clark is they are largely unknown,” the survey authors observed.
For more than 70% of Republicans, Scott sat far or slightly to their left. Just 20% of all Vermonters thought that Scott’s politics are “close to (their) own views,” the survey estimated.

U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, I-Vt., continued to demonstrate strong appeal among the state’s Democrats, with just over half the state saying she deserves reelection, according to the survey.
Mark Coester, a Republican who ran against Balint in 2024, has filed to repeat his challenge next year. Just 6% of Vermonters had a favorable opinion of Coester, and more than three-quarters didn’t know enough about him to say, the survey found.
The survey also had several questions about current state policy decisions, determined by taking a “look at what issues are in the news, what people are paying attention to,” Smith said.
The poll asked respondents about the Scott administration’s much-discussed return-to-office plan for state employees, which has drawn pushback from the Vermont State Employees Association, among others. Overall, 51% of Vermonters supported the policy to some extent, with 13% remaining neutral, the survey found.
But public opinion on the governor’s policy ran heavily along party lines — 80% of Republicans and 64% of Independents strongly or somewhat supported the measure, compared with just a third of Democrats. 
The governor’s refusal to send Vermont National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. at the request of President Donald Trump was met with relative popularity across the state, Friday’s poll said. The move was opposed to some degree by 70% of Republicans, but affirmed by 98% of Democrats. With all responses combined, 72% of all Vermonters approved of the decision, the survey found.

(USDA photo / Preston Keres)Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, as well as all four members of the state’s federal delegation signed on to a letter last month claiming American Prairie’s bison restoration project is at odds with the state’s economy.
The five men sent the letter to Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota. The Interior Department holds decision-making power over grazing rights on Bureau of Land Management land, which under former President Joe Biden were granted to American Prairie in 2022. 
The state, along with livestock industry groups, appealed the federal decision. Some ranchers have also expressed concern about added costs of having bison near their cattle, including fears of brucellosis, a bacterial disease that can spread between the animals. 
“For us, a decision in favor of APR will re-shape the entire landscape of our state,” the letter reads. “Montana’s most profitable economic industry, for decades, has been agriculture. Agriculture drives our economy, sustains our small rural towns, and is the cultural epicenter of our state.”
While there’s no question agriculture is a cultural hallmark of the state, as a percentage of the state’s real gross domestic product, the industry ranked 12th in 2022. That year, Montana generated around $4.6 billion in agricultural cash receipts.
The letter goes on to argue removing “vast swaths” of land from agricultural production will harm the state and allowing American Prairie those grazing rights “threatens the economic vitality of our most important industry.”
American Prairie has sought to reintroduce bison to parts of Montana and owns more than 500,000 acres in the state. They own and manage 900 head of bison across 46,000 acres. The organization leases much of its land to cattle producers, supporting about 7,000 head and 25 ranchers, the organization spokesperson Pete Geddes said in a statement. There are almost a half million cattle in the seven counties they work, he added. Including calves, there are about 2.1 million head of cattle in the state.
“The claim that American Prairie ‘threatens the economic vitality’ of the state, is on its face absurd,” Geddes said. “American Prairie has little influence on the long-term demographic and economic trends in Central Montana. Extended drought, market fluctuations, international trade policies, personal family decisions, and global integrated agricultural markets have much larger impacts.”
Geddes went on to say that since 2020, the organization has paid $7 million in payroll, supporting 23 local jobs in Fergus and Phillips Counties, which infused $17 million into those economies, he said. They’ve also paid $877,000 in property taxes and $345,000 to ranchers participating in a wildlife abundance program, he added.
 
Some ranchers, including Gilles Stockton, an author and former president of the Montana Cattlemen’s Association, have other concerns. 
“If you’re ranching in a brucellosis designated area, which they have in southwestern Montana, it’s hugely expensive,” Stockton said. “And it’s doubly expensive if one of your cows happens to become brucellosis positive.”
Some elk and about 60% of female bison in Yellowstone National Park test positive for brucellosis, a disease that attacks the reproductive system and causes abortions in pregnant cattle, elk, and bison. It’s a nonnative disease to the area, brought into Yellowstone by cattle in the 1900s and can also cause sickness in humans, though human infection is uncommon and the state hasn’t reported an official case since 2017.
“One of the primary mechanisms of historical transmission to people is through the milk, but pasteurization has made that a nearly obsolete pathway,” Dr. Tahnee Szymanski, State Veterinarian, said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “In the 1930s and ’40s, here in the United States, we had a much higher incidence of brucellosis in our cattle herds all across the country, and they started the national brucellosis eradication program.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has what’s called Brucellosis Class Free status, a tool used to maintain compliance so infected animals aren’t being moved around or consumed. 
Montana has a “Designated Surveillance Area” for the disease in southwestern Montana — stretching from Dillon to past Livingston, and down to Gardiner and the Wyoming and Idaho borders. 
Those borders are built through a partnership with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Szymanski said. FWP will go out, capture, tag and test elk and track their movement. Park County and Madison County elk have tested positive for brucellosis, she said. 
That said, Montana is considered brucellosis free.
“The only population of infected animals in Montana is Yellowstone National Park, bison or elk in the Greater Yellowstone Area, we have a couple of livestock herds that are under quarantine for past detections, but any other domestic bison or cattle herd in the state of Montana is considered to be free of brucellosis,” Szymanski said. “That includes tribal populations of bison, APR, bison, people should not be concerned about those animals because of potential disease risk.”
About 100,000 brucellosis tests are administered in that area each year to keep the state’s class free status, according to the Montana Department of Livestock. Cattle vaccinations do have hurdles and have to be performed by a licensed veterinarian. 
“If a human accidentally injected themselves with it, that it would make them kind of substantially sick,” Szymanski said.
That costs about $630,000 per year, according to the agency. Losing the status would incur even more testing costs by places that receive bison and cattle from the state.
“Loss of Class Free status would lead to required testing of livestock exported from anywhere in the State (not just southwest Montana) and cost the livestock producers millions of dollars for testing as well as revenue from lost sales due to a negative stigma,” a Department of Livestock information sheet reads.
American Prairie tests their animals regularly, Geddes said, and brucellosis is not present in their bison.
 
Grazing permits have also been a source of contention for American Prairie, and the letter states the organization is violating federal law.
The letter mentions the Taylor Grazing Act, legislation dating back to 1934 that created stipulations for grazing cattle and eventually led to the creation of the Bureau of Land Management. 
Challenges to the Bureau of Land Management over American Prairie grazing their bison say the act doesn’t allow for conservation grazing. American Prairie asserts that’s not true and Geddes said nowhere in Taylor Grazing Act does it limit grazing permits to production livestock. 
“The BLM is authorized to issue grazing permits to ‘stock owners.’ American Prairie qualifies as both a ‘stock owner’ and ‘engaged in the livestock business.’  AP bison are livestock and we are operating as a non-profit business,” Geddes said. “American Prairie’s primary purpose for obtaining grazing permits is for grazing livestock.”
One of American Prairie’s goals is returning the land to a state more similar to when hundreds of thousands of bison roamed free before colonization and westward expansion.
The Taylor Grazing Act was in part intended to preserve and protect that same grassland, Stockton said, who feels ranchers have done a pretty good job of that.
“The results of that is that we were able to take land that had been really badly overused and restore it across eastern Montana,” Stockton said. “So, you know, the grasslands that you have in eastern Montana are really in the best shapes that they’ve ever been.”
Stockton ranches near Grass Range, is close to American Prairie holdings and feels the Bureau of Land Management overstepped their authority. There’s frustrations with who gets to graze when, fencing problems — keeping cattle away from bison, in a ranchers eyes — and costs associated with vaccinations if brucellosis does spread further.
But, even then, other concerns for Stockton trump issues with the bison nonprofit.
“We got a feeling that the APR, when they moved in here, they were at war with our culture, I guess, our communities and our cultures,” Stockton said. “But the fact of the matter is that in terms of actual impact, say, for me, personally, I’ve got more trouble with my billionaire neighbors.”

(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)State Senate President Cameron Henry said Friday that he does not believe the National Guard needs to be deployed in New Orleans, but he can see a need for it in Baton Rouge.
“My thought is not to have them come to New Orleans because we have State Police there and they are doing a good job,” Henry, a Republican, said during an interview with the LSU Manship School News Service.
The New Orleans Police Department announced a 20% overall decrease in violent crime incidents so far in 2025 compared to 2024. Despite this decrease, President Donald Trump has talked about sending the National Guard to New Orleans. 
Gov. Jeff Landry has asked the Pentagon to send 1,000 National Guard members to fight crime in New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Shreveport. 
Henry, who represents parts of Jefferson and Orleans parishes, believes the National Guard should be sent elsewhere. 
“Downtown Baton Rouge has a significant homeless population problem,” Henry stated. “Though the National Guard can’t do anything about the homeless population, what they can do something about is the fights and arguments that the homeless are getting into on the street.” 
He adds that Baton Rouge brings in a lot of out-of-state guests for LSU football games. The money from tourists is necessary to continue to fund programs and services that Louisiana residents need.
“To have a group of homeless people fighting in the middle of the street is not a good message for anyone,” Henry said.
Last month, Landry also addressed the homelessness problem during an interview on Unfiltered With Kiran.
“I think that (majority) of the homeless population is really a group of mentally unstable people that need some institutional care,” Landry said. “Another 10% are, quite frankly, a bunch of criminals that use the homeless population to basically camouflage or to carry out their illegal drug activity, their human trafficking. They prey on those people. And it really is inhumane, and it doesn’t do us any good to have people out there.”
The Pentagon has not responded to Landry’s request. Political leaders in New Orleans, which depends on tourism, have voiced their opposition to having guard troops in their city. 
“The National Guard actually doesn’t help toward crime reduction,” said New Orleans Mayor-Elect Helena Moreno during a debate on Sept. 16. She believes that if federal resources were to be used in New Orleans, then the city’s police chief and local leadership should be consulted as to what the city needs. 
Landry sent his request to the Pentagon in late September, leaving the state legislature without any answers. 
“Since he mentioned that, we haven’t heard anything from anybody about it,” Henry states.
While the state continues to wait for a response, there are no current plans for deploying the National Guard into these cities.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Fall yard work and maintenance can be a key time to remove and prevent the spread of invasive species and diseases, according to guidance from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. 
Invasive species like bush honeysuckle are easy to spot and yank out during the fall and funguses like oak wilt can be best managed by pruning during cooler temperatures. Iowans should also be on the lookout for things like zebra mussels as they pull boats and other equipment out of the water.
The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship confirmed Friday that the invasive spotted lanternfly has been identified in Iowa. IDALS urged Iowans to keep an eye out for the insects that can be destructive to vineyards, orchards and forests.

These Asian-native insects like to cluster on the trunks of their favorite food, tree of heaven. The lanternflies have brown outer wings with dark spots and bright red and black inside wings that can be seen when the lanternflies open their wings. In nymph form, the lanternflies are black with white spots and turn red as they get older, according to photos from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. 
The insects excrete a sticky “honeydew” substance that can be seen near the plants that a colony has infected. They also create spots of mold that look like soot along the plant and its fruit. As nymphs, the insects gather in large clusters on a plant, which can make them easy to spot.
While the insect prefers tree of heaven, which IDALS said is common in alleyways, unkept urban areas and fence rows, they can feast on around 70 plant species. 
The spotted lanternfly was introduced in Pennsylvania in 2014 and is now present in 20 states. The insect was seen and confirmed in Des Moines County in September, but state entomologists have not seen signs of ongoing infestation in the area. 
IDALS encourages Iowans who identify the spotted lanternfly to contact IDALS at (515) 725-1470, Entomology@IowaAgriculture.gov or their local Iowa State University extension office. 
When bringing outdoor equipment inside, or transporting in the fall and winter, APHIS recommends scanning the items for “egg masses,” which look like smears of mud. These masses should be crushed and scraped into a sealable plastic bag and then thrown away to prevent the spread of spotted lanternfly.

Clean boats and water equipment for zebra mussels 
Boats, trailers, docks and lifts in Iowa’s lakes and rivers should be thoroughly checked and scrubbed down for zebra mussels before being stored for winter, DNR advises. 
DNR’s Aquatic Invasive Species Coordinator Kim Bogenschutz said the winterization process is “a great time” to check for new infestations. 
“As you bring each item out of the water, visually inspect areas that have been submerged for months,” Bogenschutz said in a news release from DNR. “Juvenile zebra mussels should be visible this time of year, but also run your hand over smooth surfaces to check for very small juvenile zebra mussels that feel like sandpaper.”

Zebra mussels are expert hitchhikers, which is why boat owners are instructed to clean, drain and dry all of their equipment before leaving a water body. Equipment like bait buckets should also be emptied and cleaned. According to DNR, it is also illegal to introduce any live fish, except for hooked bait, into public waters.
Zebra mussels, once introduced to a water body, can build up dense clusters, increase algal blooms and interfere with the aquatic food chain. 
DNR has confirmed the presence of zebra mussels in nearly 20 Iowa lakes and nine rivers. Most recently, the department found the mussels in Saylorville Lake. 
Pruners, herbicide and rakes 
As most plants and leaves turn brown in the cooler months, the plants that keep their leaves a bit longer tend to pop out of the landscape. 
DNR said this is the case with bush honeysuckle, a deciduous tree native to Eurasia that will outcompete Iowa native plants in a landscape and is therefore considered invasive. 
Bush honeysuckle plants will hold their leaves well into November, while native varieties’ leaves will drop off. The bush honeysuckle can also be identified by breaking off an older stem. According to DNR, bush varieties will have a hollow, brown core while native varieties will be solid. 
Smaller plants can be pulled out, while more substantial growths of bush honeysuckle will need to be chopped at the roots, or cut near the base and hit with an herbicide solution. 
Removing bush honeysuckle:



Glossy buckthorn is also easy to spot in the cooler months when surrounding vegetation drops its leaves. This small tree or shrub has a brown-gray bark with lighter colored pores and a bright yellow and orange sapwood, the wood just inside the bark. 
These plants can similarly outcompete native species and cause shaded forest floors where other plants have difficulty surviving. According to Iowa State University, the plants are also a host to soybean aphids. 
Iowans can remove glossy buckthorn by chopping it at the base of the plant and coating the exposed stem with herbicide, or by coating the lower 12 to 18 inches of the stem with an herbicide. If the herbicide is dripping off of the plant, it has been over applied, which can be damaging to the surrounding environment. 
Identifying and removing buckthorn: 



DNR also recommends pruning oak trees during colder temperatures to prevent the spread of oak wilt, a fungus that can cause oak trees to wilt and eventually die. 
Tivon Feeley with DNR’s forest health program said pruning outside of the oak tree’s growing season is the best way to prevent the spread of the disease. 
Black oak, pin oak, and red oak trees are most susceptible to the fungus and will typically die within the same season they are infected, according to DNR. White and bur oak varieties can live with the fungus for a number of years before the disease takes over. 
Open wounds in the tree during the growing season can easily be infected by small beetles that carry the fungus spores from one tree to another, which is why DNR recommends pruning outside of the growing season. 
“It’s best to wait until after Oct. 15 to start pruning oak trees,” Feeley said in a news release. “You can prune your oaks all winter long with the goal to stop pruning by March 1.”
Trees can also be infected by root grafts that connect to nearby, infected trees. 
Infected trees will have leaves that bronze along their outer margins and defoliation will begin at the top of the tree. 
Pruning trees and dealing with invasive species in the yard might sound like a lot of work, but DNR said these chores could replace one of the most dreaded fall activities: raking and bagging leaves. 
According to the department, leaving some leaves and yard waste in strategic areas can provide insulation for trees and wildlife and benefit the soil. 
A newsletter from DNR suggested leaving an unmown area of the yard, away from the house, to collect leaves and branches that will provide shelter for critters during the winter. As the leaves sit there, they will break down into a loam that can be beneficial for flower beds or planters come spring.

The initial examination by the Bolivar County coroner and the autopsy completed by the Mississippi medical examiner’s office concluded the death of the 21-year-old Black man was a suicide, and no foul play occurred.
The independent autopsy, conducted later, was paid for by civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick, a former NFL quarterback.

Reed’s body was found hanging in a tree. Some members of his family and activists say they believe he was lynched, and they point to Mississippi’s racist history of lynchings of Black people.
Jeremy Marquell Bridges, an activist from Alabama, said he’s been in recent contact with Reed’s mother, Sophia, and Ben Crump, a nationally prominent attorney representing Reed’s family.
Bridges said this week that Crump needed more time to complete a reenactment as part of the independent investigation. Crump did not specify when that would be complete.
Bridges said the independent investigation revealed injuries sustained from a recent attack by white male students, but he did not provide any proof to Mississippi Today as of Friday.
Delta State University confirmed that Reed had listed his grandmother, Sharon Candy Tillman, as his emergency contact. Tillman said she is waiting to see what the independent autopsy says about claims that Bridges and others are making. 
In an interview with The Chicago Crusader, Bridges said preliminary findings from the independent autopsy alleged that Reed lacked significant bruising around the neck consistent with a suicide by hanging. Bridges also claimed to Mississippi Today that the state crime lab was late supplying Reed’s organs and X-ray imagery to Nebraska pathologist Dr. Matthias Okoye, who the Reed family retained to conduct the independent autopsy.
On Oct. 16, Mississippi Today reached out to Bridges to ask for proof of these claims. Bridges had also claimed that Reed had defended a Black female student who was harassed by white students, and that the buckle was missing from the belt that hung him.
Bridges was unable to provide proof, but he and a member of the Reed family said they were expecting the independent autopsy last week.
Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesperson Bailey Martin did not address Bridges’ claims that Reed’s organs were delivered late to Okyoe, but confirmed the funeral home had them as of Oct. 17, she wrote in an email to Mississippi Today.
Reed’s funeral was held at Abundant Life Assembly church in his hometown of Grenada on Sept. 27. 
Reed’s mother joined members of the New Black Panthers Party at a protest Oct. 18 on the Delta State campus in Cleveland. They alleged that his death was the result of a lynching. They repeated claims that Reed suffered “blunt force trauma to the back of the head,” which was not found in the coroner’s examination or the autopsy completed by the Mississippi medical examiner’s office.

Rumors have swirled online in the weeks since Reed’s death with videos and posts on social media sites like TikTok and Instagram echoing the allegation that he was beaten before his hanging. Some garnered more than 130,000 likes.
One TikTok user with nearly 30,000 followers removed his September video echoing many of the allegations surrounding Reed’s case. He attributed his decision to a Facebook post by Tillman, Reed’s grandmother. She clarified that the second autopsy was not yet released – and the initial findings have not yet been substantiated.
“I don’t usually respond to social media, but I’m tired,” Tillman wrote in an Oct. 3 Facebook post.
Security footage from campus is still with law enforcement agencies and can’t be shared due to the active nature of the investigation, according to the university.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday confirmed that the Hillsborough County state Senate seat that has been vacant since he appointed Republican Jay Collins to be lieutenant governor will likely not have representation during the regular 2026 legislative session.
The governor announced that the primary election for the Senate District 14 seat will take place on Jan. 13, 2026.  The general election will take place on March 24, 2026.
That’s 11 days after the 2026 Florida legislative session is scheduled to end. The session is slated to begin on Jan. 13 and end on March 13. 
He announced those same election dates for the House District 87 seat in Palm Beach County, vacated when he appointed Republican Mike Caruso in August to serve as clerk of the circuit court and comptroller for Palm Beach County.
DeSantis’ delay in calling an election date in the SD 14 seat led the ACLU of Florida to file a lawsuit in a court in Leon County on Sept. 30, contending the governor had violated his duty under the Florida Constitution and state law. 
The lawsuit noted that, in more than 25 instances, the governor took fewer than five days to call for an election upon a vacancy in a congressional or legislative seat. When then-GOP state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia resigned from his Senate District 11 seat on July 18 after DeSantis named him chief financial officer, the governor took just four days to call a special election for that seat.
SD 14 was considered a swing seat in the 2022 election, but Collins defeated Democratic incumbent Janet Cruz by nearly 10 points. Caruso won re-election to the HD 87 seat by 19 points in 2024.
Among the Republican candidates rumored to be considering a run for the SD 14 seat are former Rep. Shawn Harrison along with HD 65 Rep. Karen Gonzalez Pittman and Melanie Griffin, now secretary of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.
Democrat Brian Nathan, a Navy veteran and union leader, has already filed to run for the seat.

,Kansas Reflector,2025-10-24 21:30:59+00:00,Kansas Reflector,Kansas Supreme Court delves into implications of a slightly askew license plate,Tim Carpenter,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/10/24/kansas-supreme-court-delves-into-implications-of-a-slightly-askew-license-plate/,Kansas Supreme Court issues opinion justifying law enforcement's search of a vehicle as it explores a range of cases raising constitutional issues.,"The Kansas Supreme Court affirms the conviction of a person arrested in a 2021 traffic stop in Jackson County that was predicated on officers observing an allegedly unsecure license plate. This photograph of the tag admitted into evidence, which is held by one bolt and leaning to the right, is useful in digesting constitutional question raised in the case. (Submitted)TOPEKA — The Jackson County traffic stop at 3:30 a.m. Aug. 25, 2021, prompting arrest of passenger Tashara Yeargin-Charles, was an unlikely route to a divided decision by the Kansas Supreme Court on constitutional interpretation of reasonable searches and seizures.
Yeargin-Charles, who engaged in peculiar conduct at the scene along U.S. 75, sought a place in the Supreme Court’s docket to suppress evidence and reverse her district court convictions for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana and drug paraphernalia, interference with law enforcement and transportation of an open liquor container.
A Supreme Court majority considering the appeal rejected her constitutional claims but took the opportunity to further define boundaries on roadside behavior by Kansas law enforcement agencies.
The decision written by Justice Melissa Standridge affirmed Yeargin-Charles’ guilt. In 2024, the Kansas Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion.
Standridge wrote the majority was convinced state law mandated a Kansas license plate had to be securely fastened to the vehicle, positioned at least 12 inches from the ground and clearly visible and legible. The opinion says Jackson County Deputy Justin Dobler and Sergeant Travis DeBarge made a constitutional stop after observing the plate on the Yeargin-Charles vehicle sagged to the right.
“Upon review, we find substantial competent evidence supports the factual underpinnings of the district court’s conclusion that Deputy Dobler had reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle for a suspected violation,” her opinion said.
Standridge pointed to officers’ testimony that the plate was “loosely secured by a bolt or a screw on the left side in the manufacturer’s hole and was tilted downwards to the right,” the tag was “not secured by anything” on the opposite end and the plate was visibly “flapping in the wind.”
The 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Kansas Constitution’s Bill of Rights protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. Traffic stops have been determined to be constitutionally permissible when law enforcement officers had facts supporting reasonable suspicion someone was committing, had committed or was about to commit a crime.
 
Dissent on hanging tag
Justice Caleb Stegall, in a dissent joined by Justices Eric Rosen and K.J. Wall, said the majority chose not to adhere to a “strict reading” of Kansas statute.
Each word of K.S.A. 8-133(c) should be considered, Stegall wrote, because the case hinged on whether the tag on the Honda carrying Yeargin-Charles was “flapping” as officers claimed or “swinging” in terms of what state law banned.
Stegall argued state law articulated a vehicle license plate had to be “securely fastened … to prevent the plate from swinging.” He said Kansas courts had an duty to conclude a Kansas plate was in violation of state law only when it was observed swinging.
The Supreme Court recently adhered to strict reading of state law to decide Beck v. State, which involved determining whether obstruction of the state name on a Kansas license plate justified a traffic stop. The Supreme Court reversed lower courts and rejected the claim that Geary County officers had reasonable suspicion to make a stop because the state name wasn’t legible. In that case, the Supreme Court said the traffic stop was forbidden because state law addressed only visibility of the plate’s alphanumeric display and registration decal.
Stegall said the majority’s reasoning in Kansas v. Tashara D. Yeargin-Charles conflicted with the approach to Beck v. State. He said state law defined the degree to which a license tag had to be fastened by emphasizing the connection must prevent swinging.
Jackson County law enforcement officers testified the plate was flapping — not swinging.
“One does not need to be a legal scholar or even dissect these dictionary definitions to understand that flapping and shaking are not factually identical terms to swinging,” Stegall wrote. “We abandon our duty of independent review when we simply defer to an officer’s testimony about what counts as secure. Is a plate with two bolts secure if an officer thinks it isn’t?”
In Standridge’s majority opinion, she said dissenting justices focused narrowly on the phrase in state law requiring motorists “to prevent the plate from swinging” and overlooked broader requirements that plates had to be “securely fastened.”
“Even if we were to accept the dissent’s flawed interpretation — that a license plate meeting all other requirements violates K.S.A. 8-133(c) only when it is actually swinging — the touchstone of our analysis is whether it was reasonable for the officer to think the law was being broken, not technical perfection in statutory parsing,” she said.
 
Peach vodka and a joint
In the Court of Appeals decision affirming Yeargin-Charles’ convictions, judges offered details about the Jackson county traffic stop.
DeBarge observed an open container of alcohol inside the vehicle and instructed the three occupants to exit so officers could search the vehicle. Dobler examined Yeargin-Charles’ purse and found an open bottle of peach vodka, a marijuana joint and a pipe with burnt meth residue.
While the purse was being searched, the Court of Appeals said, Yeargino-Charles dropped to the ground and claimed she was about to give birth. As medical staff arrived, Yeargin-Charles was observed “screaming, farting and trying to force herself to throw up.”
Yeargin-Charles also informed the Jackson County officers that she had COVID-19 and was a paranoid schizophrenic. She was transported to a Topeka hospital, where medical staff reported she wasn’t pregnant.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Supreme-Court-case-tag-search.png,,,2025-10-24 18:02:08.674927

League of Women Voters hosted Mark Gordon, who fielded questions about everything from new property tax law impacts to the well-publicized beef between him and Secretary of State Chuck Gray.
The post Governor talks election bill flood, eroding civility and tyranny at Lander town hall appeared first on WyoFile .","Shortly after Mark Gordon became Wyoming’s governor, he bought a house on a handshake deal. 
“There was no contract or anything,” Gordon told a crowd gathered in a Lander hotel Thursday afternoon. “[We] just came to an agreement. Everything he said he was going to do, he did. Everything I said I was going to do, I did. 
“That’s the state I grew up in.”
But that implicit trust and sense of civility, Gordon said, has eroded in recent years, at least in government. Election attack ads, public name-calling and refusals to participate in public debates are all examples of shifting norms of Wyoming politics. 
“I think we have lost a sense of decorum,” Gordon said. “I think that’s harmful, because now meetings where the important topics are being discussed, they kind of devolve into spectacle as opposed to principled conversation about what the right thing to do is and listening to one another.”
Civility was among the topics Gordon spoke to during the town hall. The League of Women Voters event presented the governor with a series of questions about Wyoming’s political atmosphere and challenges.
Over the one-hour conversation, Gordon addressed the definition of tyranny, cited the U.S. Constitution, talked about the value of serving in office and framed answers in the context that as a conservative, he believes in small government.
The event offered insights into the governor’s priorities and beliefs as he heads into the final year of his term. 
Election integrity 
Moderators kicked the event off with the topic of election integrity, which Secretary of State Chuck Gray and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus have made a priority despite few documented cases of voter fraud in the state. 
“Governor, does Wyoming have a voter election fraud problem?” Moderator Steff Kessler asked.

“I have consistently said that the people that Wyoming folks elect to be their clerks … do a very credible job,” Gordon said. “And I consistently have maintained that we can always improve what we’re doing. But in terms of a lot of fraud, I don’t see it.”
Wyoming’s constitution put the power to manage elections at the local level, which is where Gordon thinks it belongs. “We have a system that works,” he said, and one that includes provisions for examining anomalies and detecting fraud. 
Moderators then asked about the wave of election-related legislation introduced in the 2025 Legislature — which signifies that lawmakers are concerned about the security of Wyoming elections. A slate of election-related draft bills are also expected to dominate an upcoming legislative meeting Nov. 3-4. 
“Can you help us understand why the Legislature is treating our county governments as if they are untrustworthy and incapable, requiring state oversight in an intervention?” Moderator Linda Barton asked. 
Gordon reiterated his beliefs about the system working and opportunities for improvements. 
“Now, is there overkill?” he asked. “Perhaps. I mean, if you look at the Legislature today, they all got there by a supposedly flawed system, yet now we’re really quite anxious to make sure that we correct that.”
Gordon brought up the critical function of separation of powers in government and noted that Wyoming lawmakers are seeking ways to pull power into the legislative branch.

“That’s the definition of tyranny” as set out by James Madison in the Federalist Papers, Gordon said. It’s important to keep an eye on the division of powers, he said, adding later, “I am concerned that the Legislature is trying to take to itself the powers that aren’t accorded to it in the Constitution of how to run elections.” 
In all his years in Wyoming politics, Gordon continued, he has never seen such high levels of distrust. 
While moderators asked specifically about critical comments Gordon has exchanged with Gray in public forums, the governor declined to go into detail about the feud.
Gordon did acknowledge that with increasingly ugly campaigns, he can see why people would not be encouraged to run for office. 
“It’s hard for me to try to convince somebody to put yourself through that,” he said, even when there’s “a terrific reward on the other side.
“On the other hand, if we don’t get engaged, we surrender the field, and that is not a good option, in my mind.” 
Tax confusion 
Next, Barton asked: “Is there any policy that you believe has been passed by the Legislature that has not been fully understood by the voting public, such as consequences of reducing property taxes in the downstream impacts to our small towns and counties?” 
She was referring to a law passed in March amid concern about rising property taxes that authorized a 25% exemption on the first $1 million of a single-family home’s fair market value. The law resulted in shrinking property tax revenues for towns, counties and hundreds of special districts across Wyoming — which fund everything from hospitals to 4-H and county road and bridge departments.

“I think that particular issue is one that Wyoming communities are beginning to wrestle with,” Gordon said. “You’re hearing out of Casper that parks aren’t as neat as they used to be. You’re hearing out of Basin, we’re having to close libraries. And these consequences are going to be larger and larger.”
What’s especially unfortunate about it, Gordon said, is that many people misunderstood how property taxes are levied and allocated. 
“There was a notion that property tax was going to the state,” he said, “and it goes to local governments. It’s how fire departments are funded, it’s how parks are funded, it’s how roads are funded, senior centers, all of that stuff is funded from local taxes.”
Gordon remembers a legislator on the powerful Joint Appropriations Committee saying, “the state doesn’t need that property tax.” 
“A member of the Joint Appropriations Committee did not understand, the state doesn’t collect that property tax,” he continued. “And so by that misrepresentation, I think we are not doing what is the right thing for Wyoming.”

More than a year after being named president-elect of Loras College, Doyle was inaugurated as the university’s 27th president officially Friday with a Mass, reception and activities for students and visitors. During his speech, Doyle said he welcomes Loras College’s new chapter with the knowledge of its strong foundation and forward movement.
Doyle was selected by the Loras College Board of Regents as president-elect in July 2024 and worked alongside then-President Jim Collins until Collins retired in the spring. He previously worked at Loras for 14 years in different roles, including vice president for institutional advancement and chief financial officer, and returned to the college after more than two years of working as president of Steele Capital Management, Inc.

It was “the pull of the students” and the higher education environment that had Doyle missing Loras, his alma mater. He said he’s excited to be back even as higher education faces challenges with enrollment and finances. Loras has to be “nimble” as it and other colleges navigate changing federal programs, the enrollment cliff, rising costs and more.
“We pay attention to what’s going on, and we have to adapt and adjust based on … federal and state legislation,” Doyle said. “But we’re not going to make excuses, and we’re just going to move forward and do what we need to do to have success.”
Part of moving forward has been implementing strategies developed during his time as president-elect, Doyle said, aimed at increasing enrollment, fundraising and lowering institutional debt.
In the fall of 2024, Loras “implemented a fundamentally sound strategic enrollment plan” that resulted in an “11% increase in first year transfer and graduate enrollment” — a metric Doyle said he hopes will continue to grow over the next five years.
Loras also ended its fiscal year in May with the highest annual cash fundraising total in the college’s history and more than double what was raised the previous fiscal year, at more than $15.6 million. Momentum is also growing for the college’s current $20 million fundraising campaign, to which donors have already committed more than $13.7 million.
Payoffs are coming in from efforts to decrease the university’s long-term debt as well, Doyle said, with a plan launched last September culminating in one-quarter of debt already eliminated. Loras reached this point more than two years ahead of schedule.
Five years down the line, Doyle said he sees a thriving Loras College that has met and exceeded the goals set before he fully stepped into the role as president. Even as two Catholic universities, St. Ambrose University and Mount Mercy University, move forward in a strategic combination, Doyle said “Catholic higher education is strong” and Loras being rooted in faith and its legacy will help keep that strength going.
“We’re facing strong headwinds, there are challenges, but we’re going to lean into those challenges and meet those challenges head on,” Doyle said. “And we feel we’re well positioned to move into the future and raise Loras to new heights.”

Gov. Phil Scott filled two leadership positions at the Vermont Department of Economic Development on Friday, positions that have been in flux since the departure of a longtime administrator this spring.
Lyle Jepson, head of the Chamber and Economic Development of the Rutland Region since 2020, will be the new department’s new commissioner. Nick Grimley, currently the department’s Director of Entrepreneurship and Tech Commercialization, will be deputy commissioner. 
Both will begin their new jobs on Nov. 4, according to a press release from Scott’s office.

The department operates within the Agency of Commerce and Community Development and oversees a number of programs related to promoting economic development and job growth in Vermont.
Jepson is stepping into a position filled by two interim commissioners since the departure of longtime department head Joan Goldstein in April. Her deputy, Brett Long, initially stepped in as interim commissioner. Upon Long’s retirement, the interim post was filled by Tim Tierney, who will now be returning to his previous role as director of business recruitment and international trade for the department, said Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott, in an email.
Prior to his regional economic development role in Rutland, Jepson spent 30 years in public and technical education across the state, the announcement said. Grimley, with the department since 2017, had previously co-founded the business accelerator LaunchVT.
“Growing the economy has been one of my top priorities since being elected governor,” Scott said in the release. “I believe Lyle’s decades of experience as an educator, as well as Nick’s proven track record supporting the business community, will serve Vermonters well.”

(Andrea Tinker/Alabama Reflector)Statues of civil rights activist Rosa Parks and disability rights activist Helen Keller were unveiled at the Alabama State Capitol Friday, the first Alabama women to be depicted there. 
The dedication ended six years of work by the Alabama Women’s Tribute Statue Commission to get the statues installed. 
“Today we gather to lift two legacies, Rosa Parks and Helen Keller. Two women born in Alabama on the soil of this great state with the grit and grace that changed the trajectory of not just our state, but our nation,” Commissioner Tracey Morant Adams said at the ceremony Friday.

The commission consists of six members with Rep. Laura Hall, D-Huntsville, serving as chair. In 2019, Hall sponsored HB 287, which began the project. 
“For the very first time, the grounds of our Capitol will feature statues of women, and what finer examples could there be than Rosa Parks and Helen Keller?” Gov. Kay Ivey asked at the ceremony. “These are two Alabama daughters who were born in small towns who faced extraordinary challenges and yet rose to shape history through quiet strength and unwavering and unwavering conviction.”
The statue of Parks is placed at the front of the Alabama State Capitol near the steps, and near a statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, and J. Marion Sims, an obstetrician who experimented on enslaved women.

The statue of Keller is seen behind the building facing the current Alabama State House. That building is set to be demolished and replaced with green space after the completion of the new Alabama Statehouse,  expected to be completed in the fall of 2026.
Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, also spoke at the ceremony. In 2018, Figures sponsored SB 365 which made Dec. 1, the day Parks was arrested for not giving up her seat in the whites only section of a segregated bus to a white man, a state holiday.
“This is such a historical day for Alabama. For us to unveil the first two women’s statues, but those two women are an African American and a caucasian Alabamian, and that just shows you how far we have come as a state,” Figures said.
The Helen Keller statue sits on a limestone bench and depicts Keller reading a book in Braille with her left hand extended as if she is doing tactile lip reading. The plaque on the statue tells Keller’s life story in English and Braille and features the American Sign Language finger spelling alphabet and the Braille alphabet.
“This translation, this opportunity for students to learn is something that must be noted and it is so exciting for all of us to think about the potential of what is to come because of this effort,” Commissioner Annie Butrus said Friday at the unveiling.
The Rosa Parks statue at the front of the State Capitol shows Parks in motion walking up the steps of what would be the bus she was taking nearly 70 years ago on Dec. 1, about a mile from the Capitol down Montgomery’s Dexter Avenue.
“I want you to be reminded of her resolve and commitment to step up, take action, powerfully communicating the thinking behind that action,” Julia Knight, the creator of the statue, said at the unveiling. “Rosa Parks was not a tired seamstress, she was a dedicated activist.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7717-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-24 17:18:06.695696

""I was kind of surprised that Vermont would recognize New Hampshire certifications, but New Hampshire wouldn’t recognize Vermont,” said New Hampshire Rep. Thomas Oppel.

This story by Liz Sauchelli was first published in the Valley News on Oct. 23, 2025.
WEST CANAAN — A Mascoma-area state legislator has proposed a bill that would make it easier for Vermont-licensed school bus drivers to become certified in New Hampshire.
New Hampshire state Rep. Thomas Oppel, D-Grafton, decided to introduce the bill after learning about the challenge of finding bus drivers to serve the Mascoma Valley Regional School District. As the school year began in August, Mascoma was forced to make some last minute changes to its bus routes because of the shortage of drivers.
One difficulty is the licensing requirements in Vermont and New Hampshire, Steve Landon, location manager at Butler’s Bus Service branch in White River Junction, said in September. People licensed to drive in New Hampshire can easily drive in Vermont because the Green Mountain State recognizes New Hampshire licenses, but in New Hampshire, drivers with Vermont licenses must go through the Granite State’s process as if they are a new bus driver.
“I hadn’t thought about it and I was kind of surprised that Vermont would recognize New Hampshire certifications, but New Hampshire wouldn’t recognize Vermont,” said Oppel, whose district includes Canaan, Dorchester and Orange.
He spoke to New Hampshire Department of Transportation officials and asked Legislative Services in Concord, which assists lawmakers with research, to put together a side-by-side comparison of Vermont and New Hampshire requirements. They are similar in that both states require that bus drivers have a commercial driver’s license and an added bus driver certification.
“If you’re certified in New Hampshire or Vermont, you can drive in either state if my bill passes,” said Oppel, who has found co-sponsors for his bill, including NH Rep. David Fracht, D-Enfield, and NH Rep. Henry Giasson, R-Goffstown.
Before signing onto the bill, Giasson, a member of the House Transportation Committee, wanted to confirm that the two states’ requirements were similar, he said. Giasson was satisfied with the research Oppel did. “If a New Hampshire bus company can employ a Vermont bus driver with no safety risk to the public, I don’t see why we wouldn’t allow it at this point,” Giasson said.
Even though Goffstown is more than an hour from the Vermont border and the bill would not necessarily affect Giasson’s constituents, he said, “I think it’s a good call to expand our market to people in border states.”
While the bill won’t necessarily alleviate the challenge of finding more bus drivers for rural routes like those in Mascoma — which includes Canaan, Enfield, Dorchester, Grafton and Orange — it could make it easier for Butler’s Bus Service to move drivers around as needed to serve other school districts, especially those that are located along the Connecticut River.
“It may not help with recruiting drivers necessarily, but it certainly would help us be able to spread the drivers that we do have around to different customers for sure,” Landon said.
Currently, if a bus driver certified in Vermont wants a New Hampshire certification, they have to go through a background check and — once that’s cleared — they have to do 10 hours of training in New Hampshire by a state-certified instructor, then take a written test to get school bus certificate, said Landon.
Getting the original Vermont certification takes eight hours and also requires a background check and written test. It can take between 30 and 60 days for a certified Vermont bus driver to go through the New Hampshire certification process.
“It would help us because the locations that we have that are on the border of Vermont and New Hampshire, I could possibly share drivers quicker than I can now,” Landon said. For example, a driver based in White River Junction could then drive a route in Plainfield or Cornish, which Butler’s also serves, without having to redo their training in New Hampshire.
Mascoma Valley Regional School District Superintendent Amanda Isabelle called Oppel’s proposed legislation “exciting.” Mascoma is still in need of one more bus driver and while there are currently people in training to fill that spot, the legislation would allow Vermont bus drivers to fill in on a substitute basis. The dual state process “is absurd to me,” she said. “You’re already on a bus. You don’t need to come here to be trained to drive a bus.”
Mascoma now has three employees — the district’s special education director, a social worker and an administrative assistant in the special education department — going through the training process to be able to transport students in vans in case of an emergency.
Another Mascoma employee is in the process of obtaining a commercial driver’s license so that they can become a substitute bus driver. “We’ve had a lot of our employees step up and it’s much appreciated,” Isabelle said.
Oppel’s legislative service request for the bus driver bill has not been drafted into formal legislation and does not yet have a bill number.

(Photo courtesy Harry Reid International Airport)U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford on Friday sent a letter to Gov. Joe Lombardo urging him to do “everything within his power” to ensure Nevadans continue to receive food stamps during a prolonged federal government shutdown.
That should include the possibility of Lombardo calling a special legislative session, read the letter, which was also signed by Horsford’s fellow Democratic peers, U.S. Reps. Dina Titus and Susie Lee.
“Whether through official actions or by simply picking up the phone and telling his fellow Republicans to end this cruelty, the Governor must act,” said Horsford in a press release announcing the sending of the letter.
In any given month, approximately 500,000 Nevadans — 15.5% of the population — receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP or food stamps. Lombardo’s office has confirmed that, if the federal government shutdown extends beyond Oct. 31, federal funding would be insufficient to cover the cost of SNAP for November and beyond.
Independent of the government shutdown, Nevada SNAP is already expecting budget turmoil. Administrators of the program in August told state legislators that a new federal requirement that states pay them to use an income verification system will force the state to reallocate $19 million in the current fiscal biennium, and will cost the state $25 million annually in future biennia.
At the same time, local food banks have reported seeing increased demand.
Lombardo did not respond to the Nevada Current‘s request for comment by publication time.
His office earlier this week did say it is working with the state departments of human services and agriculture to “secure supplemental resources for SNAP beneficiaries in the event the shutdown extends beyond October 31.”
Horsford’s letter acknowledged and applauded those efforts but added the governor should “use every tool and resource available.”
Also on Friday, Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine publicly called on state elected officials to step in. He noted Nevada currently has the highest Rainy Day Fund balance in state history.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)School board directors and parents sued Washington state Thursday to block a Democrat-backed law overhauling rights for public school students and their parents.
The policy has become a flashpoint in the national debate over gender inclusivity and diversity, equity, and inclusion in schools. A conservative political group has a separate push underway to get it overturned through the legislative process or at the ballot box. 
This week’s lawsuit, filed in Thurston County Superior Court, argues House Bill 1296 violates state and U.S. constitutional rights guaranteeing the free exercise of religion and ensuring parents can raise their children without state interference.
The debate over House Bill 1296 was one of the most contentious of this year’s legislative session in Olympia. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson signed the law in May.
Republicans argued that it undermines Initiative 2081, which lawmakers passed last year. 
The earlier initiative enshrined certain rights for parents of public school children, specifically around issues like reviewing classroom materials, obtaining medical records, and opting children out of assignments involving questions about their sexual experiences or their family’s religious beliefs.   
Let’s Go Washington, the group that spearheaded Initiative 2081, is collecting signatures to get a measure before lawmakers next year that would repeal this year’s rewrite. If the group is successful, and lawmakers don’t approve it, this new measure could end up before voters in 2026. 
Republicans and other critics of this year’s law argued that it undermined last year’s initiative.  
Democrats countered that changes were necessary to protect vulnerable children. 
One of the most significant changes removed parental access to their children’s school-based medical records. The complaint claims these revisions violate the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, known as FERPA.
Other changes include pushing back the deadline for parents to receive copies of their child’s school records from 10 days to 45 days. 
One of the plaintiffs, Gabriel Galbraith, is a Kennewick school board member. In March, the board pleaded with the Trump administration to force the state to comply with the president’s executive order seeking to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports.
“We’re being told not to share information that parents have a right to know,” Galbraith, who is up for re-election next month, said in a statement Thursday. “That’s not education — that’s state interference in the family.”
The more than half-a-dozen other plaintiffs include school board members from Lynden, Darrington, Woodland and Deer Park, and parents from Olympia and Tumwater. 
One parent reported taking her son out of Olympia public schools because she couldn’t opt him out of instruction about gender identity.
The state Legislature, Ferguson, the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction and state Superintendent Chris Reykdal are named as defendants in the lawsuit.

A spokesperson for Reykdal said the agency is reviewing the complaint. 
“OSPI is charged with implementing, upholding, and enforcing the law and will continue to do so unless or until the law changes,” spokesperson Katy Payne said in an email. 
The parents and school board members are represented by the conservative Citizen Action Defense Fund and Joel Ard, a Washington lawyer who has challenged Democratic-backed policies and represented the state Republican Party.
The lawsuit also argues the law violates the state constitution’s “single subject” rule as the legislation deals with both parental and student rights.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)As many as 1.4 million Georgians who rely on federal food assistance could face the abrupt loss of benefits starting Nov. 1 if the government shutdown has not ended.
The Georgia Department of Human Services announced Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture informed the state that there is “insufficient funding” to cover November payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is 100% federally funded and provides food assistance to about one in 10 Georgia residents.
If the shutdown is not resolved soon, SNAP electronic benefit transfer cards will not work beginning Nov. 1, according to DHS. Even if a shutdown deal were reached immediately, the time required to process the payments and make them available to recipients would likely delay benefits. The state agency advised recipients to use existing funds on their cards now and plan ahead. 
The federal government shutdown began on Oct. 1 after lawmakers failed to approve a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year. U.S. House Republicans passed a stopgap spending bill that would have funded the government until November, but that is stuck in the Senate, where Democrats say they won’t vote for a continuing resolution until Republicans agree to extend tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. 
The Georgia Budget and Policy Institute urged the USDA to take immediate steps to release available contingency funds to cover at least partial payments for the program, which serves more than 640,000 children in the state.
“If the administration can cover full or even partial SNAP benefits for November, it provides some certainty that families and individuals can go to the grocery store and buy the essentials and maybe something for Thanksgiving,” Ife Finch Floyd, the institute’s director of economic justice, said Thursday.
But the USDA on Friday announced that it would not use contingency funds to provide food assistance benefits, stating that the government shutdown occurred before SNAP funding for the new fiscal year was enacted.
The USDA has about $6 billion in contingency funds, enough to cover about two-thirds of one month’s national SNAP benefits. GBPI also suggested that the USDA use its discretionary authority, as it did in early October for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC, to secure additional resources to fully fund November benefits.
SNAP provides more than $3 billion annually to Georgia’s local economies and is critical for retailers statewide, according to GBPI. Usage is higher in rural areas, where about 17% of the population relies on the assistance, compared to 11% in metropolitan areas.

Sept. 9, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceEnvironmental advocates, community leaders and members of the Michigan Legislature will gather on Detroit’s east side Sunday for food and festivities while demanding accountability from the state’s largest energy providers. 
The East Side Community Network’s Stoudamire Wellness Hub will host state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), state Reps. Tonya Myers Phillips  (D-Detroit) and Donovan McKinney (D-Detroit), and Detroit Action Political Director James Johnson alongside Detroit residents and representatives from multiple organizing groups, as they call out the state’s largest energy providers over high rates and poor reliability.
The speakers will also offer information about the ratepayer bill of rights, a slate of bills which aims to address these issues alongside concerns that political spending is stymying additional regulations on energy providers. 
The “Our Bills Are Too Damn High!” block party runs Sunday from  2 p.m. to 4 p.m. with speeches set to begin at 3 p.m. In addition to remarks from lawmakers and residents calling for greater accountability from DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, Michigan’s largest energy companies, the event will feature food and performances.
In recent years, both utilities have faced repeated criticism for high energy prices and poor reliability, with the Citizens Utility Board, an energy utility watchdog, noting that the companies have “some of the highest outage durations among all investor-owned utilities in the nation.”
Ballot initiative seeks to ban political contributions from monopoly corporations, like utilities

While both companies have each pledged to improve their services, customers and advocacy groups have remained frustrated with the utilities’ near yearly requests to increase their rates, with DTE requesting a $574 million rate increase earlier this year, while Consumers Energy requested a $436 million increase for its electrical rates. 
Dana St. Couer, a senior communication strategist for DTE said customers saw 70% improvement in time spent without power in 2024 due to $1.5 billion in investments in the electric grid last year coupled with less extreme weather. 
In a statement on Jan. 14, Consumers Energy said the average customer spent 21 fewer minutes without power in 2024, with 93% of customers seeing their power restored within 24 hours. 
Katie Carey, Consumers Energy’s director of media relations, emphasized in an email to the Michigan Advance that the company’s rate requests fund future investments. 
“For example, clearing trees away from power lines is critical to our plan, addressing the #1 cause of outages. We are proposing a five-year timetable to clear all of our system’s low-voltage lines, which serve homes and businesses directly,” Carey said. “We had previously been working toward a seven-year effective cycle. We plan to clear 8,000 miles of high- and low-voltage power lines this year. We expect a 30% reduction in tree-related outage incidents by 2030.”
In the interim, lawmakers have offered their own solutions through legislation seeking greater accountability from energy providers, while providing customers additional protections. 
The ratepayer bill of rights includes legislation sponsored by McKinney that would increase the outage credit customers receive on their bills to $5 an hour, gradually increasing to $15 an hour after 24 hours without service and $25 dollars per hour in interruptions longer than 72 hours. 
The current credit offers customers $42 if their outages last 16 hours or longer under normal conditions, 48 hours if skies are gray and 96 hours under catastrophic weather conditions, with customers receiving an additional $42 for each day they are without power. 
The package also includes Myers Phillips’ House Bill 5047, which would ensure winter shut off protections for households with seniors 65 and older, and children 16 and younger. 
The ratepayers bill of rights also includes legislation to allow for the establishment of community solar energy programs, and to ban utility companies and businesses seeking government contracts from making political contributions. 
Chang told the Michigan Advance on Thursday that the event is aimed at raising awareness and getting more community members engaged on issues of energy affordability and reliability, while providing those affected with concrete solutions they can take action on. 
Oftentimes when there is a major storm, Chang said her office will hear from residents and see the resulting power outages firsthand. While the outage credit has increased in recent years, it does not match the impact felt by those facing the outage Chang said, pointing to individuals losing the food in their refrigerator as one example. 
When looking at the ratepayer’s bill of rights as a package, Chang emphasized that these policies focus on what ratepayers need. 
“When we talk about reliability, when we talk about energy policy, when we talk about outages, ultimately, it’s about people,” Chang said, noting that these outages weigh the heaviest on those who are already struggling to pay their bills and keep food on the table.”

Former state Rep. Robin Smith, R-Hixson, was sentenced Friday to eight months in federal prison for her role in a corruption conspiracy described as a scheme to steal from Tennessee and its citizens through the General Assembly’s taxpayer-funded constituent mail program.
Smith, 62, “failed the trust of the public” and has “been a failure,” she said during her sentencing hearing in Nashville federal court.
“My mom and dad raised me to be much better than this,” Smith said. “I ask for the forgiveness of the public.”
Smith pleaded guilty in March 2022 to one count of honest services wire fraud, a charge regularly used in corruption prosecutions, and agreed to “full, complete and truthful” cooperation with the federal government.
She was fined $7,500 and will be on supervised release for one year after incarceration. Smith cried while addressing the court Friday morning, frequently referencing her Christianity and the debt she said she owes to her family, friends, God and the public.
“There isn’t a day that goes by where that reality doesn’t confront me in a real way,” she said.
Smith, ex-Speaker Glen Casada, R-Franklin, and his one-time chief of staff, Cade Cothren, all played a part in a scheme to illegally profit off the General Assembly’s taxpayer-funded constituent mail program from October 2019 to early January 2021.
As part of Smith’s plea deal, she testified against Casada and Cothren during their May federal trial. It was the right thing to do, and she was simultaneously hoping for leniency in her sentence, she said at the time.
A Nashville jury ultimately found Casada guilty of 17 counts and Cothren guilty of all 19 counts of bribery, conspiracy, fraud, money laundering and theft, according to federal court records.
Both men were sentenced in September.
Casada is expected to serve 36 months in federal prison, one year of probation and pay a $30,000 fine, court records show. Cothren was sentenced to 30 months in prison, one year of probation and a $25,000 fine.
Casada, Cothren and Smith allegedly all helped to create a fake company called Phoenix Solutions, which designed and sent mailers to constituents on behalf of politicians through the use of taxpayer funds.
The group intended to do the work they were hired to do, Smith testified, but they also intended to profit.
The group received nearly $52,000 from the state in payments related to the postage and printing allowance over the course of 2020, according to a trial brief, which stated that Cothren paid Casada and Smith more than $35,000 in bribes and kickbacks during that time.
The scheme allegedly went on into early January 2021.
FBI agents raided Smith’s home that same month.
District Judge Eli J. Richardson said at sentencing that Smith was more involved than Casada in really propping up Phoenix Solutions, pressuring public officials and “spinning a web of fabrications.”
“We have these public officials,” he said. “We elect them to do the right thing.”
Former Tennessee rep says identities had to be “masked” in kickback scheme

And then, in this case, they turn around, lie and deceive, according to Richardson.
“It’s pretty callous stuff, and it’s not a great look,” he said.
Smith led the Hamilton County Republican Party from 1998 until 2002 and was unanimously elected to lead the state GOP in 2007.
She was elected in 2018 to represent state House District 26, which includes parts of central Chattanooga and extends north along Chickamauga Lake, encompassing, among other communities, Hixson, Lakesite, Middle Valley and Sale Creek.
Smith resigned from her seat in March 2022 amid her plea deal.
Her life has been defined by doing good things for others besides this one “stain on her life,” her attorney William David Bridgers said.
She’s dedicated time to nonprofits and the public, has a strong presence within her religious community and cares for her sick mother, he said.
Their crimes began after Cothren resigned in 2019. He allegedly sent sexually explicit and racist text messages and admitted to using cocaine in a legislative office on one occasion, according to reporting by the Associated Press. Casada, who allegedly received some of those messages and sent his own lewd remarks, resigned shortly after.
Smith was part of this scheme to help both men rehabilitate their lives after their “really bad scandal” rather than to scam legislators, Bridgers said.
She knew her actions were morally wrong but didn’t know she committed a crime until the FBI came knocking at her door, he said. She quickly began cooperating with the federal government once she realized the gravity of her actions.
“She had sinned against her God,” Bridgers said. “She had sinned against her family. She had sinned against her government.”
Richardson, apparently in response to Bridger’s arguments, said Smith wouldn’t have taken 25% of the profits if she only wanted to help Casada and Cothren.
“The one way I don’t help out other people is by taking a cut of what they have,” Richardson said.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Casada-4-29-25-004-scaled-e1761360698548-1024x619.jpg,,,2025-10-24 22:56:38.320342

In this image from Jan. 13, 2025, Schwab performs ceremonial duties at the Kansas Capitol. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab received praise from President Donald Trump for making Kansas one of the first states to commit to use of a federal database to confirm U.S. citizenship of people registered to vote.
Schwab, who is a Republican candidate for governor in 2026, had previously lauded the president for taking steps to help states screen voter registration lists through sharing of federal data. As secretary of state, Schwab is Kansas’ top election official.
In March, Trump signed an executive order making the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements program available to states for free. SAVE exists as an online platform enabling local, state and federal governments to electronically check a federal database for immigration and citizenship status of applicants for public benefits.
“You were one of the first leaders to step up and protect the integrity of our elections by using the SAVE system,” Trump said in a letter sent to Schwab on Oct. 8 and shared publicly several days ago by Schwab. “As you know, safeguarding our elections is a dual responsibility of the states and federal government. This vital mission requires our partnership to be based on mutual trust and a shared commitment to our constitutional responsibilities.”
Trump said in correspondence to Schwab the “right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted, without illegal dilution, is a prerequisite for our government to truly be representative.”
The president said “many states” were failing to enforce basic and necessary election laws. The executive order, and wider reliance on SAVE, could be useful to states working to “reverse this dereliction,” Trump’s letter said.
Trump has claimed without evidence President Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election due to voting misconduct.
In July, Schwab attended a White House meeting with other state elections officers to discuss sharing of federal data. He said at that time it could be beneficial if Kansas could have routine access to the Social Security Administration’s death index and data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to identify individuals who were deceased or noncitizens and ineligible to vote.
Schwab, who has repeatedly declared Kansas elections fair and accurate, said reliance on up-to-date databases could improve voter confidence in the state’s election system.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1132223-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday it will install election monitors in Passaic County, acceding to a request from Republican Party officials there.
The announcement comes 11 days before Election Day, when the governor’s race and all 80 Assembly seats will be on the ballot. Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who has President Donald Trump’s endorsement, is vying against Democrat Mikie Sherrill to become our next governor.
“We will commit the resources necessary to ensure the American people get the fair, free, and transparent elections they deserve,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.
The announcement follows a request for federal intervention from GOP officials who have sought greater scrutiny of mail voting in Passaic, a heavily Democratic county that flipped to support Trump in last year’s presidential race. Federal officials did not provide a justification for the deployment of monitors.
New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the federal deployment “highly inappropriate.”
“DOJ has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions,” he said in a statement. “The Constitution gives states, not the federal government, the primary responsibility for running elections, and our state’s hardworking elections officials have been preparing for months to run a safe and secure election. We are committed to ensuring that every eligible voter is able to cast their ballot and make their voices heard.”
Platkin’s office said he is weighing options to prevent voter intimidation and election interference as a result of the federal deployment.
A spokesperson for the Passaic County Board of Elections, whose membership is split equally between Republicans and Democrats, said it is aware of the feds’ plans and will cooperate.
“The Board is committed to ensuring that the election is administered fairly, securely, and smoothly and will cooperate with the USDOJ to achieve those objectives while ensuring that eligible voters are able to cast their vote,” said Lindsay Reed, a spokesperson for the board.
She added that the board would accede to the department’s request to observe the transfer and counting of mail ballots. Democrats vote by mail at far greater rates than Republicans.
Voting fraud allegations are not unheard of in Passaic County. In 2020, Paterson Councilmen Michael Jackson and Alex Mendez, who had not yet taken office, were charged with mail ballot fraud and related charges for allegedly acting as ballot bearers for more than three ballots — the maximum allowed under state law — and for failing to identify themselves as ballot bearers.
A Superior Court judge ordered the May election be rerun that November, and both men won the do-over race. Neither has been convicted, and both were reelected last year.
The judge’s order made no finding of voter fraud, leaving that to criminal courts, but ordered a new race because of various procedural violations related to mail voting.
The Department of Justice said it would also deploy election monitors to five California counties. Four of those counties are politically competitive, and one is overwhelmingly Democratic.

New research suggests cities could significantly reduce childhood poverty by creating their own child tax credit programs. (Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Community Change)Child tax credits are becoming more popular across the country, with more than a dozen states offering them as financial relief toward the cost of raising kids.
But new research suggests cities could significantly reduce child poverty by offering child tax credit programs of their own.
An analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University and the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that municipal programs could move the needle with relatively small amounts of money: offering $1,000 or less per year to low- and middle-income families could cut child poverty rates by 25% in several cities.  
Researchers say this sort of new assistance would not only boost household finances, but also likely create more demand for local businesses, stabilize housing markets and increase local tax revenue.
The study focused on 14 cities: Baltimore; Charlotte, North Carolina; Chicago; Denver; Houston; Jacksonville, Florida; Los Angeles; Minneapolis; New York; Oakland, California; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Seattle; and the District of Columbia. The analysis found that most of those cities could make significant gains by spending less than 15% of municipal revenues on new child credit programs. 
Red states pushed child tax credits this year, but the broadest plans fizzled

In Minneapolis, for example, researchers said a new program that cost less than $30 million per year would cut the city’s poverty levels by half when accounting for existing state and federal credits. (The mayor there has recommended spending about $2.03 billion in the 2026 fiscal year budget.) 
The prospect of creating new tax credit programs would likely pose financial and logistical challenges. Cities already are juggling many other priorities including public safety and housing affordability, while at the same time facing what some experts have characterized as a “fiscal crisis” from growing climate change costs, federal funding cuts and declining downtown activity.
Some cities, including Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia, have city income taxes that could incorporate a child tax credit. But, the research noted, cities without that tax managed to distribute pandemic recovery funds through basic income programs. That experience shows cities could create their own standalone applications, leverage IRS data-sharing agreements or  work with third-party administrators.
“So you could use a similar sort of outreach approach, which wouldn’t necessarily be as comprehensive or systematic as a city that already has its own income tax system in place, but it’s a potential option,” said Ryan Vinh, an author of the study and a research analyst at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. 
State interest in creating or expanding child tax credits boomed after the pandemic-era expansion of the federal child tax credit delivered cash directly to millions. That move quickly lifted millions of children out of poverty, researchers found. But the expanded tax credit expired in 2021 — leading to a doubling in the nation’s childhood poverty rate in 2022.
Advocates favor refundable tax credits that provide money directly to families. While parents must still file tax returns to receive the benefit, refundable credits give parents funds even if they earn too little to owe income tax, providing financial relief for groceries, medical care or rent. 
This year, several conservative-led states explored new child tax credit programs, though proposals offering the biggest benefits to families fizzled in Indiana and Ohio. So far, no city has implemented its own credit. 
While many cities and states are facing tight budget constraints, Vinh said a reduction in federal support will likely put more pressure on local governments to tackle challenges like poverty. The federal government has slashed funding for safety net programs including Medicaid and the nation’s largest food assistance program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
“A lot of these things will either lead to the erosion of benefits over time, a loss of benefits, or kind of a decline in what families are able to receive,” Vinh said. “We don’t fully know the number yet, but we do know that child poverty will most likely increase as these program restrictions increase.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti joined a filing Friday in the U.S. Supreme Court supporting President Donald Trump’s order to end automatic birthright citizenship.
The brief brought by Skrmetti and 24 other states’ attorneys general urges the court to clarify that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause doesn’t grant automatic citizenship to people born on American soil regardless of their parents’ residency and immigration status. 
The American Civil Liberties Union, multiple state attorneys general and immigration rights groups challenged the executive order. But Skrmetti sided with the president even though his order was blocked in early October by a federal appeals court in Boston.
“The idea that citizenship is guaranteed to everyone born in the United States doesn’t square with the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment or the way many government officials and legal analysts understood the law when it was adopted after the Civil War,” Skrmetti said in a statement.
The Fourteenth Amendment says, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”
Yet the attorney general said the brief provides evidence from the 1860s through early 1900s backing his interpretation that citizenship required parental domicile and allegiance to the United States, not temporary or unlawful presence.
About 4.4 million U.S.-citizen children under 18 lived with at least one person without permanent legal documentation as of 2018, according to the American Immigration Council.

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Richard Lindsay said Friday that he wants to hear more about the legality behind Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s order to deploy hundreds from the West Virginia National Guard to Washington D.C. 
Lindsay listened to more than an hour of legal arguments on Friday related to a lawsuit brought by the West Virginia arm of the American Civil Liberties Union and the West Virginia Citizen Action Group against the state due to the National Guard deployment. 
Following some testimony and arguments from attorneys on the case, Lindsay ruled that the hearing will continue on Nov. 3. By that date, he said, he wants to see more information from the state regarding how Morrisey’s decision to send troops to D.C. following a request from President Donald Trump is legal.
The hearing was held due to the ACLU and CAG requesting a temporary restraining order to halt the deployment of West Virginia troops in D.C.
Morrisey announced in August that he would be sending 300-400 members of the West Virginia National Guard to Washington D.C. after Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the nation’s capital. That declaration ended in September, but troops have remained in the district.
In late September, a spokesperson for the state’s National Guard said members could remain in D.C. through November.
Lindsay said the question of legality is “the central issue” to the case.
“Because if what the governor has done in the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., if that is lawful, that cures — at least in this court’s mind — whether or not a [temporary restraining order] is necessary, whether or not an irreparable harm has been suffered and whether or not there’s standing,” Lindsay said.
The ACLU and CAG argue in their lawsuit that the deployment is unlawful and an abuse of state powers that allow the governor to activate National Guard troops for matters outside of the state under limited circumstances. Attorneys for the ACLU further argued Friday that the ongoing deployment is causing real and irreparable harm to people in West Virginia, specifically at CAG. 
CAG executive director Dani Parent testified Friday that members of CAG — both employees and other community partners — are being tasked with fighting against and learning more about the National Guard deployment. By undertaking that work, Parent said, other critical work done by the organization related to defending democracy, government transparency and more is going undone. 
“Here we have a member-driven organization that is dedicated to this purpose, that is having to spend their time and money differently than they would have to were it not for the actions of [the state, in deploying the National Guard],” said Aubrey Sparks, legal director for the ACLU, during arguments to Lindsay. “That is harm. That is harm in a legal sense as well as in a practical sense.”
The state, represented by Chris Etheredge, who is a lawyer with the Attorney General’s Office, countered that this harm isn’t clear and it isn’t real. CAG, Etheredge argued, spends less than 25% of its resources on work related to democracy and government transparency. Etheredge continued that the only parties who could claim to be “directly harmed” due to the National Guard deployment are residents of D.C. or members of the Guard themselves.
Lindsay asked Etheredge to clarify.
“You’re not saying that the only possible plaintiff that could bring this type of action would be a National Guard member? You’re not saying that, are you?” Lindsay asked.
“I’m saying that the only theoretical harm [the ACLU and CAG] have even alleged that could possibly give them a right to relief would be harm by a National Guard member,” Etheredge responded.
Sparks, however, argued that the harm is very real — especially if it was caused by an illegal action from the governor. 
“Transparency and accountability isn’t something that just happens once, you get it, and then you’re done,” Sparks said. “It’s built. It’s a norm. And when that norm is eroded, it doesn’t erode in just one area. It erodes it in all areas.”
Sparks, speaking after Friday’s hearing, said the case raises questions about what it means when set and established norms are threatened by potentially unlawful actions. It shouldn’t be a problem, she said, to prove that something done by the government was done legally and within all appropriate parameters of set law.
“This represents a real deviation from the norm that we have come to expect living in a democracy — that the government follows the rules that the government is bound by,” Sparks said. “I think when we deviate from that norm, when we erode it, it hurts a number of other democratic processes and principles, and in some ways, it’s a canary in a coal mine that we should all be really concerned about.”
Sparks continued, saying she believed it was “objectively a good thing” that Lindsay continued the hearing in order to ensure the court reaches “the right ruling.”
“And we’re confident that the right ruling is finding that the governor’s acts, and the [state’s] acts more broadly, were unlawful,” Sparks said.

Prospect filed for bankruptcy protection in January, and the sale of its hospitals around the country is being overseen by the court. The company did not receive any other bids for the two Connecticut facilities. 
Deborah Weymouth, president and CEO of Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals, said in an emailed statement that the organization is pleased to have received court approval.
“This marks an important milestone and we look forward to closing the transaction as quickly as possible,” Weymouth wrote.
Tina Varona, a spokesperson with Hartford HealthCare, said the health system is “uniquely positioned to deliver on our promise to these communities.”
“We are actively working to provide resources to stabilize and grow the workforce, enhance quality and safety, and make strategic investments in people, programs, technologies, facilities and community partnerships,” Varona wrote in an emailed statement.
The deal still needs to receive state approval, known as a “certificate of need,” the process health care entities must clear before engaging in major transactions, like mergers and acquisitions.
OHS and the Lamont administration faced criticism over the time spent evaluating a failed $435 million deal signed in 2022 for Yale New Haven Health to acquire the three Prospect-owned hospitals.
During the state legislature’s 2025 session, earlier this year, lawmakers passed a measure that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy. Under the newly-established emergency certificate of need process, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete.
OHS spokesperson Wendy Fuchs confirmed that Hartford HealthCare has yet to file for an emergency certificate of need.
Some of the proceeds from the $86.1 million sale will go towards paying the towns of Manchester and Vernon for outstanding real property taxes. Lawyers for Manchester and Vernon claim the towns are owed $4.2 million and $1.1 million in real property taxes, according to court documents.
A lawyer with Medical Properties Trust, Prospect’s landlord and the company that owns the hospital buildings, declined to confirm how much the towns were owed, but said that any real estate taxes would be paid.
“I’m not going to opine on the precise number because I don’t think we have a view on the number. I leave that to the debtor. But we don’t dispute that, whatever the real estate taxes that the debtor and the buyer agree to with the townships, those will be paid at closing,” the attorney said.
A spokesperson for MPT did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
The towns’ attorneys also claim Manchester and Vernon are owed an additional $692,288 and $330,316 in personal property taxes. 
But Prospect has other debts to pay off that take priority over the municipal personal property taxes, including a loan from MPT that has a current balance of roughly $248 million. Unlike the real estate taxes, the outstanding personal property tax dispute would likely remain unresolved when the transaction closes, the judge said.
In addition to Manchester Memorial and Rockville General, Prospect also owns another Connecticut facility: Waterbury Hospital.
The state plans to acquire Waterbury as part of a broader plan to expand its own struggling flagship medical institution, UConn Health. The state is also in talks to acquire two independent hospitals, Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam and Bristol Hospital. 
On Oct. 3, the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees and the UConn Health Board of Directors voted to approve a $13 million bid to acquire Waterbury Hospital. However, the health system had not submitted an offer as of Oct. 24.
The deal will also consist of some level of forgiveness of the outstanding taxes Prospect owes the state, Connecticut officials confirmed. 
Earlier this week, The Connecticut Mirror reported that Prospect owes the state more than $127 million in unpaid hospital provider taxes going back more than three years, according to court documents.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023_0927_SR_Hospitals_004-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236

Gov. Greg Gianforte promoted Montana products and the Treasure State’s partnerships with South Korea and Japan on a trade mission this week.
On the trip, Gianforte, a Republican, touted, wheat, beef, coal and technology — and opportunities for future growth in trade — to business leaders, such as Chairman Jin-Sik Yoon of the Korea International Trade Association, one of Korea’s top five private economic organizations representing more than 70,000 companies.
In 2024, Korea was Montana’s second largest trading partner, with $335 million in exports, according to a series of news release from the Governor’s Office about the trip.
“Montana is open for business, and we are eager to partner with Korea’s most innovative companies,” Gianforte said in a statement. “From agriculture to advanced technology, Montana offers the talent, resources, and business climate needed to grow and succeed in the global market.”
In Korea, Gianforte highlighted an existing partnership with a couple of companies, UP Chemical and Advanced Material Solutions, and their recent investment in a manufacturing facility in Stevensville, the news release said.
It said SemiLink Materials recently established a facility in the Bitterroot and serves as a worldwide supplier of specialty gases for the semiconductor industry.
Industrial machinery exports, largely for semiconductor applications, were Montana’s largest export to Korea in 2024, accounting for $103 million in sales, and wheat is the state’s most consistent export to both Japan and Korea, at $38 million last year, according to a news release.
In Japan, Gianforte promoted wheat, beef and technology, and he outlined opportunities for collaboration in photonics, quantum, semiconductors, advanced manufacturing and clean energy, according to a news release. He also invited the Japan External Trade Organization to lead a delegation to Montana.
Gianforte highlighted Montana’s “strong business climate” and interest in encouraging innovation and more trade, a news release said.
He touted Montana’s work in bioscience and growth in academic research including in photonics.
“Globally, the photonics industry is estimated to be worth $1.75 trillion and is an enabling technology that contributes more than $16 trillion to global GDP,” a news release said. “Montana has one of the highest per capita concentrations of companies in the United States specializing in optics, photonics, and quantum technology and a strong history of working with Japan and Korea with some business partnerships having been established for over 30 years.”
In a statement, he said Montana and Japan share a deep history rooted in “respect, innovation and opportunity.”
“We’re building on that foundation by expanding our collaboration in technology, energy, and agriculture to create more good-paying jobs and investment in Montana and Japanese communities.”
He also met with representatives in the beef industry to highlight Montana as one of the top ten beef-producing states in the U.S. and the more than $41 million in beef exports sent to Japan last year.
The governor touted Montana coal and energy as well. A news release said roughly half of the 26 million metric tons of coal mined in Montana each year are exported to Asian markets through Canada.
“Montana has long been a global leader in providing dependable energy,” Gianforte said. “We’re committed to ensuring a stable supply of coal and to growing the partnerships that power communities here in Japan and back home in Montana.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GG-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236
,DC,2025-10-24 20:31:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Pay for Trump and Congress continues in shutdown, unless they ask it be held",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pay-trump-and-congress-continues-shutdown-unless-they-ask-it-be-held,,"WASHINGTON — Some members of Congress are asking for their salaries to be withheld during the government shutdown, while federal workers on Friday missed their first full paycheck since many operations closed on Oct. 1.With no movement toward a deal to end the shutdown, the House remained on a prolonged break from Capitol Hill, the Senate left for its usual long weekend and President Donald Trump prepared to depart for a trip to China, where he will likely focus much more on foreign policy and tariffs than the funding lapse. The president, lawmakers and federal judges all receive their regular paychecks during government shutdowns, unlike the 2 million civilian federal employees and thousands of staffers who work in the legislative branch. Members of Congress are paid $174,000 a year and leaders are paid more.Active duty military members would also normally miss their paychecks, but the Defense Department reprogrammed $8 billion earlier this month to avoid a missed payday for U.S. troops. It’s unclear if the Pentagon can do that again ahead of the Oct. 31 pay date or if there was enough money left to cover those salaries. Pay for CongressUnlike most federal workers, members of Congress have the option to receive their pay as normal, donate their salaries to charity, give the money back to the Treasury, or have their checks withheld during this shutdown.  Rhode Island Democratic Rep. Gabe Amo posted a letter Thursday evening from House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine L. Szpindor confirming that House members’ salaries can be held back until after the funding lapse ends. Szpindor wrote that legal requirements, including the 27th Amendment, entitle members of Congress to their pay and that any lawmaker who has their check withheld during a shutdown can request it be distributed at any time. Szpindor did not respond to a request for comment.A spokesperson for Ohio Republican Sen. Jon Husted said the Senate Financial Clerk told their office that while senators are required to be paid, officials can withhold his check until after the shutdown ends, at his request. The Senate disbursing office will continue to cut the check, but Husted will not pick it up until after Congress funds the government, the spokesperson said. Husted doesn’t believe members of Congress should receive their salaries on time when other federal workers cannot, the spokesperson said. A different Senate staffer, speaking on background about the issue, told States Newsroom the salary for another senator was transitioned from direct deposit to a physical paycheck so it could be held by the disbursing office for the duration of the shutdown, at that senator's request. Members of Congress who have asked for their salaries to be withheld include Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet, Florida Republican Rep. Kat Cammack, New Jersey Democratic Sen. Andy Kim, Oklahoma Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice and Oregon Democratic Rep. Janelle Bynum, among others.  Spokespeople for Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., did not respond to a request for comment about whether they are having their salaries withheld during the shutdown. A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he is having his paycheck held back.Can lawmakers’ salaries legally be withheld?Congress has voted several times over the years to officially withhold members’ salaries during a shutdown, but none of the bills have ever become law. There have been questions during past funding lapses about whether members’ paychecks could legally be withheld.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office wrote in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst just before the shutdown began that member pay “is required by the Constitution and is considered mandatory spending.” “Thus, Members of Congress would continue to be paid during a lapse in discretionary appropriations,” CBO Director Phillip L. Swagel wrote. That assessment lines up with a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, updated in August, that says “Members of Congress continue to receive their pay during a lapse in appropriations for a number of reasons.”Lawmaker salaries “have been provided by a permanent, mandatory, appropriation since” 1981, the report says.The U.S. Constitution, in Article I, Section 6, Clause 1, says: “Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.”And the 27th Amendment to the Constitution says: “No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.”The CRS report quotes the Government Accountability Office’s principles of federal appropriations law as saying, “The salary of a Member of Congress is fixed by statute and therefore cannot be waived without specific statutory authority.”But the report also points out nothing prevents a member of Congress from accepting the salary and then donating all or part of it back to the Treasury.No options and no paychecks for fedsThat same choice isn’t available for the people who work for members of Congress or those at departments and agencies throughout the executive branch. They must go without their paychecks until after Congress and the president broker a deal to fund the government and end the shutdown. Any worker who manages national security issues, or the protection of life or property, is considered exempt and continues working until the shutdown ends. Any federal employee not in that category is placed on furlough. The Senate was unable to advance multiple bills Thursday that would have provided salaries to some federal employees and contractors during the shutdown. Absent new congressional action, both exempt and non-exempt federal workers are supposed to receive back pay under a 2019 law once government reopens, though Trump and administration officials have cast doubt on whether they will do that for employees in the executive branch. Guidance from the House Committee on Administration says that all employees who work within the legislative branch will receive back pay once a funding bill becomes law. “Neither essential nor furloughed employees are authorized to receive compensation during a lapse in government funding,” the report says. “Federal law statutorily requires retroactive pay for furloughed and essential employees following the end of a lapse in government funding.”",,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236

Patrick Morrisey. (Photo by Kristian Thacker/West Virginia Watch)A resident of John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center, represented by Sen. Joey Garcia, has filed a lawsuit against West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey seeking to stop the sale of the state-run facility. 
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion
The lawsuit comes as Morrisey’s sale of four long-term care hospitals, including the John Manchin center, is expected to close next week. 
Garcia, D-Marion, filed the complaint Thursday in Marion County Circuit on behalf of Mary DeVito, a 94-year-old widow who has lived at the facility since 2019 and requires 24-hour care, according to the lawsuit. 
The lawsuit names as defendants Morrisey and Michael Caruso, secretary of the state Department of Health Facilities, in their official capacities. 
Morrisey announced in August the state had reached a deal to sell four state-run long-term care facilities to New York-based development group Marx Development Group for $60 million. Besides the John Manchin facility, they include Hopemont Hospital in Preston County, Lakin Hospital in Mason County and Jackie Withrow Hospital in Raleigh County. 
Together the facilities are licensed for about 500 beds. The facilities typically serve elderly patients using Medicaid. 
In the complaint, Garcia argues that Morrisey and Caruso don’t have the authority to divest Caruso of his duty to manage and operate the John Manchin facility. 
According to the lawsuit, House Bill 2006, legislation from 2023 that reorganized the state Department of Health and Human Resources into three departments, required the new Department of Health Facilities to operate the facility. Garcia believes the Legislature’s permission is required to sell the facilities. 
The case is assigned to Marion County Circuit Judge Matthew S. Delligatti.
Delligatti on Friday granted a temporary restraining order stopping the sale of the John Manchin facility. He scheduled a hearing in the case for 3:30 p.m. Tuesday in Marion County Circuit Court. 
The sale is scheduled to close Oct. 31. 
In an email Friday, Drew Galang, Morrisey’s press secretary, said his administration has received the complaint and is aware of the temporary restraining order.  
“The contract to sell these facilities is based on very strong legal authority, and we look forward to communicating our arguments to the court at Tuesday’s hearing,” Galang wrote.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced the news Thursday at the state Capitol in Charleston, West Virginia.
This is a technological leap forward for our state as West Virginia becomes the 12th state in the country to adopt this technology,” Morrisey said. “This is a first step toward a broader rollout aimed at making everyday life easier for West Virginians.”
The rollout, done in collaboration with the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles, is ongoing, and Morrisey said they hope to expand the use of the digital ID to include businesses and more. 
Right now, West Virginia residents can present their ID using their iPhone and Apple Watch at 250 TSA checkpoints at airports across the U.S., including West Virginia International Yeager Airport in Charleston and Huntington Tri-State Airport. 
“It’s only going to grow,” Morrisey said, adding that some of the smaller airports in the state are still waiting for scanners that can recognize digital ID. 
A news release from the governor’s office said that, “ID in Apple Wallet uses the privacy and security features that are built into Apple devices to help protect a user’s identity and personal information.” Users do not need to unlock or hand over their device to present their ID.
To add a West Virginia driver’s license or state ID to Apple Wallet, tap the + button at the top of the screen in Apple Wallet, select “Driver’s license or State ID” and follow the on-screen instructions to start the set-up and verification process.

(Screenshot via Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Montana)On the same day Montana’s insurance commissioner announced an investigation into a massive data breach by the state’s largest health insurance company, a group of attorneys filed a class-action lawsuit in Helena alleging that the corporation failed to notify customers and didn’t take standard precautions to safeguard the data, which could include birth dates, Social Security numbers and data on the health conditions of individuals.
The class action lawsuit, filed in Lewis and Clark County District Court, says that Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Montana should be held responsible for as many as 462,000 Montana customers’ private and healthcare information being taken. That is approximately one-third of the state’s residents.
Moreover, it accuses the insurance giant of knowing about the data breach for months, but failing to notify any of its customers that their information was at risk.
Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield said that it doesn’t comment on pending litigation.
However, in a story about Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance James Brown opening an investigation, a spokeswoman for the company told the Daily Montanan that a third-party vendor was responsible for the data breach, but it would not confirm the breadth of the leak.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of two Montana residents.
“This type of personal and sensitive data is highly targeted and sought after by hackers who seek to exploit that data for nefarious purposes,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit asks Lewis and Clark District Court Judge Christoper Abbott to certify it as class action, meaning that Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield’s customer base of more than 460,000 could be named and eligible for any settlement. Attorneys for the group include Raph Graybill and Rachel Parker of Graybill Law Firm in Great Falls; John Heenan of Heenan and Cook in Billings; and David Paoli of the Paoli Law Firm in Missoula.
On Friday, a notice about the data breach was placed on the company’s website. It said that the breach was caused by third-party vendor, Conduent, and that notices about the breach were being sent to customers, beginning on Oct. 24.
The lawsuit also alleges that even though the data breach was discovered and known about in January 2025, Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield didn’t act quickly. Brown’s office confirmed with the Daily Montanan that it didn’t learn of the data breach till Oct. 8, nearly a year after it said the breach started. According to court documents, it lasted from October 2024 until January.
Montana law requires reporting of breaches “without reasonable delay.”
The lawsuit alleges that the data breach has resulted in several harmful results including an invasion of privacy, lost time and costs associated with the breach, and spam and fraud calls as well as identity theft.
The lawsuit also seeks several dozen remedies in seven counts being brought against Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield. Those counts include negligence, breach of contract, violating the Montana Consumer Protection Act and breach of fiduciary duty.
Attorneys argue that Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield did not take adequate precautions in protecting the sensitive personal and health information, which should have included encrypting the information as well as deleting it when it was no longer needed.
The lawsuit also outlines how data obtained by hackers can be used and sold on the dark web.
“Private information can be sold at a price ranging from $40 to $200. Criminals can also purchase access to entire company data breaches from $900 to $4,500,” the suit said.
The lawsuit then explains how a few personally identifying data points can be parlayed into a larger and nearly complete identity theft of a person.
“Because a person’s identity is akin to a puzzle with multiple data points, the more accurate pieces of data an identity thief obtains about a person, the easier it is for the thief to take on the victim’s identity — or track the victim to attempt other hacking crimes against the individual to obtain more data to perfect a crime,”  the lawsuit said.  “With (complete) packages, cybercriminals can cross-reference two sources of private information to marry unregulated data available elsewhere to criminally stolen data with an astonishingly complete scope and degree of accuracy in order to assemble complete dossiers on individuals.”
The lawsuit also warns that cybercriminals often hold the data for some time before they use it, or victims don’t discover the theft until well after the fact, after financial damage is done.
“A study by Experian found that the average cost of medical identity theft is ‘about $20,000’ per incident and that most of victims of medical identity theft were forced to pay out-of-pocket costs for health care they did not receive to restore coverage. Almost half of medical identity theft victims lose their health care coverage as a result of the incident, while nearly one-third of medical identity theft victims saw their insurance premiums rise, and 40% were never able to resolve their identity theft at all.”
The lawsuit also pointed out that a 2007 General Accounting Office report said that fraudulently obtained data may be held for as long as a year before cybercriminals use it.
“As a result, studies that attempt to measure the harm resulting from data breaches cannot necessarily rule out all future harm,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit estimates that identity and credit theft monitoring will cost around $200 per year per class member.
“This is a future cost for a minimum of five years that plaintiffs and class members would not need to bear but for defendant’s failure to safeguard their private information,” the lawsuit said. “Through its failure to provide timely and clear notification of the data breach…(Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield) prevented plaintiffs and class members from taking meaningful, proactive steps to secure their private information and mitigate the impact of the data breach. (They) could have taken action earlier had they been timely notified of the data breach.”
As part of the lawsuit, attorneys for the plaintiffs are asking the court to impose a host of protections and punishments, including more encryption, destruction and purging of personally identifying information after its use, prohibiting keeping information on cloud-based services, ordering periodic security checks by both staff and independent auditors, as well as more comprehensive education and alert programs to inform staff and customers.
The suit also asks for actual damages, compensatory damages and punitive damages, as well as a 10-year third-party monitoring firm to report on whether Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield is complying with the court order.

The news comes as voters are already casting ballots on Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposal to redraw the state’s congressional districts to favor Democrats. Early in-person voting is set to begin this weekend in many counties.
Federal personnel from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division will be sent to Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties. Harmeet Dhillon, the former vice chair of the California Republican Party and a Republican National Committee chairwoman, leads the division. 
It’s unclear whether the federal monitors will be onsite during early in-person voting or just on Nov. 4. The Justice Department has not said whether monitors will be stationed at polling places in addition to county elections offices. 
A spokesperson for the department did not respond to an emailed request for comment in time for publication. 
The request for election monitors came from the California Republican Party, the Associated Press reports. Chairwoman Corrin Rankin wrote a letter to Dhillon’s office on Monday, according to the AP. A spokesperson for the state party did not respond to multiple requests for comment via email and text. 
Election observers are nothing out of the ordinary, and both parties regularly deploy poll watchers to ensure voting sites abide by state and federal election laws. 
The Justice Department also has a long history of monitoring jurisdictions that have track records of civil rights violations. Last November, leaders in some Republican states denied the Biden administration’s Justice Department personnel entry into some polling sites. 
“It’s entirely normal for the California Republican Party to request election integrity resources wherever they may be available,” said Bryan Watkins, a former senior adviser to the state party and its former chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson.
Watkins said the state GOP during his tenure welcomed poll monitors from the House Administration Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican National Convention. 
“If federal oversight gives voters confidence that their ballots will be secure and counted, I fully support it,” said Millan Patterson in a statement. She now is leading the campaign against Newsom’s Prop. 50.
California Democrats immediately denounced the request as a weaponization of the Justice Department against the state’s voters. 
“No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters,” said Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, in a statement. “Sadly, we’ve come to expect it from a so-called party that operates as more of a Trump fan club.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/030320_SF_Voting_AW_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C721&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-24 16:01:30.992327

The event was attended by political and higher education figures from across the state. (Photo courtesy of FIU)Former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez took her oath of office Friday, cementing her (semi-)new title: president of Florida International University. 
The FIU community and Nuñez’s network gathered for her presidential investiture ceremony in Miami, complete with video comments from Gov. Ron DeSantis. She’d served at FIU on an interim basis since she left the governor’s office in February, 
“To lead FIU as its seventh president, and as the first alumna, is both the greatest honor and the greatest responsibility of my career,” Nuñez said during the ceremony at the Ocean Bank Convocation Center. Having earned a bachelor’s degree in 1994 and master’s in 1998 from FIU, she’s not only the first graduate to preside over the institution, but also the first woman to serve. 
“President Nuñez is a visionary leader, a dedicated public servant and a trailblazer whose lifelong commitment to excellence and innovation perfectly aligns with the bold future the Board of Trustees has laid out for her,” FIU Board of Trustees Chair Carlos Duart said. 
Nuñez’s network
Present at the ceremony were Attorney General James Uthmeier, Education Commissioner Anastasio Kamoutsas, Supreme Court Justice John Curiel, U.S. Reps. Byron Donalds (R-Naples), Mario Díaz-Balart (R-Miami), Carlos Jiménez (R-Miami), and Frederica Wilson (D-Miami Gardens), and director of the U.S. Marshal Service Gadyaces Serralta.
A number of State University System figures attended, including Chancellor Ray Rodrigues.
Rodrigues, who served in the Legislature alongside Nuñez, pointed to her stint as chair of the Higher Education & Workforce Subcommittee in the House from 2012-2014, pointing to that committee’s efforts to establish preeminence classifications and performance-based funding.
“These two pieces of legislation, preeminence and performance-based funding, are what has driven the transformation and elevation of higher education in the state of Florida,” Rodrigues said. 
Florida International University follows through, votes for a Nuñez presidency

“FIU, I tell you this morning, that your president’s service to this institution began long before she was ever employed by you, going all the way back to the vision and foresight she had as a representative and then later as lieutenant governor,” Rodrigues said. 
DeSantis and U.S. Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio both recorded video messages congratulating Nuñez that played during the ceremony. 
“She served with distinction and she served ably” as lieutenant governor, DeSantis said, “but she is now in her element as the president of Florida International University down in Miami.”
Nuñez, 53, served in the Florida Legislature from 2010-2018 before serving six years as lieutenant governor, starting in 2019. 
She was named interim president in February and was permanent president in June.

Remarks
Nuñez spent part of her remarks honoring the six former presidents of FIU: Chuck Perry, Harold Crosby, Greg Wolfe, Modesto Maidique, Mark Rosenberg, and Kenneth Jessell. 
Maidique, for whom the main campus is named, Rosenberg, and Jessell were in attendance. 
“Each of these leaders fought their share of giants, convinced the naysayers, silenced the detractors and endeavored diligently to build the university I now have the privilege of leading,” Nuñez said.
Nuñez’s presidency was met with opposition, with the Faculty Senate representative Noël Barengo voting no, citing “deep concern about what we see as another effort by the governor’s office to interfere with public higher education.” He did vote in her favor for the permanent presidency. 
About a dozen public speakers appeared in the virtual meeting approving her as interim president in February, questioning the need for Jessell to step down before his contract expired and her partisan political involvement. One called Nuñez “a yes-woman for DeSantis’ dangerous agenda.”
FIU, 60 years old, was founded on the site of an old airport. Earlier this year, it received the highest rank for performance metrics among Florida’s public universities. 
“Looking forward to FIU’s next 50 years, I see boundless opportunity. I see the inevitability of FIU, a world-class university, a research powerhouse, but also a thriving marketplace of ideas. I see a place of intellectual inquiry and of academic rigor. A place where new ideas are born and students learn and challenge each other,” Nuñez said. 
Nuñez said her administration would double the university’s research expenditures. She also said she believes FIU will be a top 30 university by 2030. This year, U.S. News & World Report ranked it No. 46 among public universities and No. 97 among national universities. 
“Academic freedom is one of the pillars of higher education, and FIU is proud of the work we’ve done to honor this long-standing tradition,” Nuñez said. “But we must be vigilant in ensuring that our faculty fosters open dialogue and viewpoint diversity.”
Lawmakers and the governor have passed various pieces of legislation related to topics that may be taught in schools and which initiatives, particularly those related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, may be funded with state dollars. State law also mandates a survey that tracks ideological moods on campus.
“Rather than telling our students what to think, faculty should welcome rigorous debate. Under my leadership, FIU will uphold diversity of thought, academic freedom, and civil discourse. FIU will never be a place where hateful and violent rhetoric devolve into chaos, nor will it be a place where a select few ideas will be tolerated,” she said.

Free.,"USDA won't shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan","Shauneen Miranda, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/usda-wont-shuffle-funds-extend-snap-during-shutdown-about-face-earlier-plan,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a memo Friday the agency’s contingency fund cannot legally be used to provide food assistance benefits for more than 42 million people in November, as the government shutdown drags on.The position is a reversal from the department’s earlier stance, according to a since-deleted copy of the USDA’s Sept. 30 shutdown plan that said the department would use its multi-year contingency fund to continue paying Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits during the ongoing shutdown. SNAP has about $6 billion in the contingency fund — short of the roughly $9 billion needed to cover a full month of the program, putting November benefits in jeopardy. Because of a stalemate in Congress over a stopgap spending bill, the government shut down on Oct. 1 without new SNAP funding enacted.The memo, which was first reported by Axios on Friday, said states would not be reimbursed if they use their own funds to cover the cost of the benefits.“There is no provision or allowance under current law for States to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed,” the memo says, while also noting that “the best way for SNAP to continue is for the shutdown to end.”Discrepancy with shutdown planThe memo also says the contingency fund is meant for natural disasters and similar emergencies, not for a lack of appropriations.But USDA’s Sept. 30 contingency plan contradicts that and appears to greenlight the use of SNAP’s contingency fund during a lapse in funding.“Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue since the program has been provided with multi-year contingency funds that can be used for State Administrative Expenses to ensure that the State can also continue operations during a Federal Government shutdown,” according to the plan. “These multi-year contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year.”USDA’s contingency plan is no longer online, but is accessible through an internet archive.After providing States Newsroom with the memo Friday afternoon, USDA did not immediately respond to a follow-up inquiry about the discrepancy between Friday’s memo and its contingency plan.In the memo, USDA said transferring money toward SNAP from other sources “would pull away funding for school meals and infant formula.” The agency said it has shuffled funds to cover several nutrition programs during the shutdown, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, as well as the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Dems call on Rollins to tap into fundU.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said last week the government would run out of funds to deliver November SNAP benefits as a result of the ongoing shutdown.  Friday morning, U.S. House Democrats, like nearly all of their Senate counterparts and the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, urged Rollins to not only use the contingency fund, but to reprogram other money to cover a $3 billion shortfall. “A potential lapse in benefits would be felt by Americans of all ages and affect every corner and congressional district in the country,” according to the letter from more than 200 House Democrats.In a separate letter, 46 Senate Democrats sent to Rollins on Wednesday, voiced concerns that USDA told states to hold off on sending in SNAP benefits to be processed for November. “We were deeply disturbed to hear that the USDA has instructed states to stop processing SNAP benefits for November and were surprised by your recent comments that the program will ‘run out of money in two weeks,’” according to the letter. “In fact, the USDA has several tools available which would enable SNAP benefits to be paid through or close to the end of November.” The chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Republican Susan Collins of Maine, also urged Rollins in a Thursday letter to “consider all available options in accordance with federal law to ensure that this vital nutrition assistance continues, including the use of contingency funds and looking at the viability of partial payments or any transfer authority you may have.” Benefits could be slow even if a deal reachedStates have been told by the agency to hold off on submitting SNAP benefit requests to processing centers. Food banks and pantries are already bracing for the increased need, including in Iowa, where more than 270,000 Iowans rely on SNAP each month.However, even if Congress immediately reached a deal to end the shutdown, the time needed to process the payments and make them available for recipients means SNAP benefits would likely be delayed. State officials have warned SNAP recipients of the possibility of delays.In West Virginia, officials said delays are expected and told residents to seek assistance at local food pantries. Roughly 1 in 6 West Virginia residents rely on SNAP each month. Legal requirement citedSharon Parrott, a White House Office of Management and Budget official during the Obama administration who now leads a left-leaning think tank, said in a Thursday statement that USDA is legally required to use its SNAP contingency funds.Parrott, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the multi-year contingency fund is “billions of dollars that Congress provided for use when SNAP funding is inadequate that remain available during the shutdown — to fund November benefits for the 1 in 8 Americans who need SNAP to afford their grocery bill.”Parrott said the Trump administration could use its legal transfer authority, just as it did with WIC funding, to “supplement the contingency reserves, which by themselves are not enough to fund families’ full benefits.”",,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. Allina Doctors Council SEIU — comprising over 600 doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners — announced Friday that union members are calling a one-day unfair labor practices strike on November 5. 
“We’ve shown them that we’re really serious about this contract, that we need to see a contract that’s going to improve primary care,” said Matt Hoffman, a family doctor and union member. 
The strike will include all 61 primary care and urgent care clinics across Minnesota and western Wisconsin at Allina Health, one of the largest health systems in the Upper Midwest with a $5.8 billion in revenue in 2024. 
The strike could make Minnesota history as the first of its kind, union organizers said during a Friday press call. 
Doctors have not historically seen themselves in need of unionizing, but the broad trend of health care consolidation — hospitals and clinics combining into sprawling health systems like Allina — has led to worsening labor conditions even for physicians and other well paid practitioners. 
Allina doctors voted by a wide margin to unionize in October 2023 and picketed in June to voice frustration with what they called the “factory style” of modern medicine. 
The union is demanding a contract with higher wages, employment benefits written in ink and safe staffing levels, among other issues. The union says Allina has cut wages around 5% on average for physicians, though the precise number is hard to pin down due to variation across physician agreements. 
Allina released a statement, saying in part that “the union’s request for significant compensation increases and extreme benefits proposals are simply not realistic or sustainable,” citing rising costs and cuts to Medicaid passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump in July.
“The bargaining table is where a responsible path forward for all parties can be found, and we have two bargaining sessions scheduled before the one-day strike is planned to occur,” the statement says.
The statement also says Allina is prepared to continue providing safe care during the one-day strike and will contact patients about changes to appointments.
Of particular concern to the doctors: Allina’s physicians do not have employment contracts, instead working for the health system under an employment agreement without time limits, said Nick VenOsdel, a pediatrician at Allina Health Hastings Clinic. The agreement includes a non-compete clause and “a lot of language in there [that] just says that Allina is allowed to change any components of that agreement at their discretion,” he said. 
Non-compete agreements were banned in Minnesota for contracts made after 2023, and the Minnesota Attorney General’s office is actively investigating another multistate health system for imposing non-competes on its physicians. 
Allina is closing four clinics in November, exacerbating the short-staffing of primary care clinics. Cora Walsh, who works at Allina’s West St. Paul clinic, said that the Inver Grove clinic closing has caused “a lot of concern at our clinic. We already have patients waiting to get in with providers here.” 
VenOsdel said the doctors and other providers “are just at our breaking points collectively. We feel like we’ve done everything we can to avoid getting up to this point even prior to unionizing,” he said. The union has engaged, he said, in “years of people trying to use appeal to logic, appeal to emotion, beg and plead to change things.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/P1151760-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 16:01:30.992327

Then she was moved to a rehab unit, then transferred to a nursing home, which was supposed to have been her final destination.
There had been a big meeting of her doctors, social workers, and her family — the city mice who had flown in from points all over the country. They all agreed that Donna would never go home again. After all, she was now 87 years old and had serious health problems.
Her son and daughter-in-law showed up and drove away with her car.
“Don’t you let them put a ‘For Sale’ sign up in front of my house,” Donna said when I visited her in the nursing home. “I’m coming home.”
I remained silent.
“This place is costing me a fortune and doesn’t even have wastebaskets.”
“Wastebaskets? Really?”
Donna sat in a recliner chair in a large, clean room, fully equipped with a kitchen, bathroom, hospital bed, TV, and even a small patio out the sliding glass door. But apparently, no waste baskets.
“They will provide one, but they charge extra. Or, you can bring one from home. So, I might as well just go home.”
“How much extra for a wastebasket?”
“I don’t know, but for $400 a day, you’d think you’d get a waste basket. And a washcloth and towel.”
“They don’t provide those either?”
“Nope.”
What the facility did provide was three square meals a day, two delivered to her room and one served in the communal dining room. Donna had to get there on her walker on her own.
“They only lay eyes on me twice a day, once when they bring my breakfast, and again when they bring my supper. I could die between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. and no one would know.”
“But what about physical therapy and occupational therapy?”
“Very little. And they’re in and out in 10 minutes. The physical therapist gave me a list of things I had to be able to do before I can go home. Stand up, sit down unattended. Check. Walk to the bathroom. Check. Heck, I’m walking to the dining room. Wash your face. How am I supposed to do that without a washcloth? I’m working my way down the list with the rest. Check, check, check.”
I knew what her family had decided, so I didn’t want to encourage this homeward movement, but frankly, it did sound better than lying in bed dead for hours at $400/day sans wastebaskets.
“And I’m so bored here. What’s happening to the lawn at home?”
Uh, oh. Donna’s mind had turned to lawn mowing. She loved mowing the lawn and had a state-of-the-art John Deere riding mower sitting in her garage. Through the years, I’d noticed that whenever she was stressed or wanted space from her husband, Stu, she mowed the lawn. All three acres. In the heat of the day. 95 to 115 degrees. It didn’t matter the temperature. She kept on mowing. Various neighbors had offered to help, but she refused any aid.
“Oh, don’t worry about your lawn,” I told Donna. “The neighbor guys have it covered.”

Three different neighborhood men were rotating through on their riding mowers. The men ranged in age from 13 to 60. One mowed each week, sometimes twice. The summer had been rainy, hot, and steamy, the grass growing fast. There had been no particular order to the rotation. The men would drive by on their way to somewhere else, notice the grass had gotten a little high, and within a couple of hours, it was cut. Sometimes, one neighbor would show up and mow on Monday, and another on Wednesday. I knew who was on the other side of the fence by the distinct sound of their Walker mowers.
I had covered Donna’s outside chores all summer. Once the gates were secured, Donna’s lambs grew nicely in her pasture, and her geese were waddling in and out of her pond. A Mennonite neighbor had brought in a crew to clean the whole house. A third young neighbor scrubbed down Donna’s garage so well that you could have eaten off the floor. Then he kept up with her garden that was cascading with ripening tomatoes.
“I’m almost done with the list,” Donna called me on the phone to alert me of her progress. “Coming home soon.”
Her daughter appeared later that same day. “She’ll never be able to go home. They won’t discharge her with a catheter.”
Good fences aren’t always what make good neighbors

The next week, I got the word. “Come and get me.”
Really? Oh, OK. I showed up in Donna’s nursing home room. She’d packed all her belongings in seven or eight large grocery bags. I went up to the nurses’ station to see if I could find a cart, but I was left to my own devices.
“Looks like I’ll make several trips,” I told Donna.
I carried all the bags out to my car, tucked in Donna’s small suitcase, and a couple of boxes of food that had been in the refrigerator. Finally, I helped Donna maneuver into the front seat, her catheter bag hanging from her walker. I figured that some arrangement had been made for maintaining this device. A visiting nurse, perhaps, was coming to the house. Surely, someone would be there that afternoon. Doors closed and locked, we headed out of the parking lot.
“Geez, the nurses weren’t too helpful about finding a cart.” I said.
“That’s because they’re mad I’m going home.”
“What? You didn’t have clearance for this move?”
“No.”
“Not from the doctors either?”
“No.”
“What about your family?”
“They are all against it.”
“What?”
“‘I hope you get along OK at home,” they said.
Oh, no, I thought. But get along OK at home she did. The first thing to go was the catheter.
“I was a nurse for 40 years,” Donna said. “I put in a million of these things. I certainly know how to take one out.”
Next, the physical and occupational therapists showed up at home and both forbade her from walking on the uneven grass.
“It just needs to be mowed,” Donna reassured them.
Then an Amish neighbor appeared in her black bonnet to start making meals. I’d defrosted some venison I’d found in Donna’s freezer, and the neighbor made enough small meals to last a month.
Next, Donna’s church sent a home health aide with two black crosses wired to the grill of her car. The aide took Donna to all her medical appointments. She got Donna up a high step and into the tiny shower in the mudroom. Once she was dry, Donna called the local plumber, telling him to rip out the bathtub and install a large walk-in shower in her regular bathroom.
Little by little, over the course of the next couple of months, Donna improved. The aide took Donna to Walmart for groceries. She took her to the bank, and around town to buy gift certificates for all the neighbors who had helped her. Soon, Donna was at the rec center walking around the track.
“I only made it around once,” Donna said, determined to do more laps.
Still, tiredness plagued her. Some days she woke up in the morning, had breakfast, then fell back in bed asleep. Her blood pressure plummeted and I tried to take her back to the hospital, but she refused.
“Oh, my blood pressure goes up and down,” she said.
Finally, she had a long-awaited appointment with a cardiologist and was fitted with a heart monitor. A week later, she swallowed a pill to address a heart arrhythmia issue.
Then suddenly, her car reappeared in her drive.
“What’s this?” I asked.
“I’ll just drive to church and back,” she promised.
What she didn’t mention was dealing with the lawn. One late afternoon, I was cleaning up my garden, readying it for winter, when I heard the distinct sound of a mower drifting over the fence. And not a Walker mower. A John Deere mower. Donna’s John Deere mower.
“Hey, what’s going on over there?” I called.
But Donna didn’t hear me. She sat in the mower seat, earphones on her head, blocking out all other sound. Back and forth, she mowed the front yard, around the mailbox, around the bird feeder poles, and the flower beds. She mowed through the backyard, the racket shooing her geese toward the pond. Back and forth, and back and forth, Donna mowed, the sun shooting its descending rays down through the trees.

A federal judge ordered them to be removed. (Screenshot from court documents)A federal judge on Friday ordered Ten Commandments posters be removed from Lakeside School District, two days after he permitted the Garland County district to be added to a lawsuit challenging a new state law requiring the displays. 
Following passage of Act 573 of 2025 this spring, public schools are now required to “prominently” display a “historical representation” of the Ten Commandments in classrooms and libraries. The posters must be donated or bought with funds from voluntary contributions. The law also requires them to be displayed in public colleges and universities and other public buildings maintained by taxpayer funds.
Seven Northwest Arkansas families of various religious and nonreligious backgrounds filed a lawsuit in June challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The families allege the state law violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” and its Free Exercise Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law … prohibiting the free exercise [of religion].” 
Supporters of the law have argued the tenets have historical significance because they influenced the country’s founders in creating the nation’s laws and legal system.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks granted a preliminary injunction in August that blocked implementation of the statute in four districts — Bentonville, Fayetteville, Siloam Springs and Springdale. 
Brooks later allowed the Conway School District to be added to the suit as a defendant and district families as plaintiffs. He also ordered Ten Commandments posters be removed from the district’s schools and converted a temporary restraining order against the district into a preliminary injunction. 
A temporary restraining order temporarily halts an action and may be issued immediately, without informing all parties and without holding a hearing. It’s intended to last until a court holds a hearing on whether to grant a preliminary injunction, according to Cornell Law School. 
After Brooks granted permission Wednesday to add Lakeside School District as a defendant and Christine Benson and her minor child as plaintiffs in the case, attorneys for the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction on Thursday. 
Brooks granted the temporary restraining order Friday and held the preliminary injunction in abeyance. He also temporarily blocked Lakeside from complying with the law and ordered the district to remove Ten Commandments displays from its schools by 5 p.m. Monday. 
“A temporary restraining order should issue as to Lakeside School District No. 9,” Brooks wrote in Friday’s order. “Lakeside Plaintiffs are identically situated to the original Plaintiffs: They advance the same legal arguments, assert the same constitutional injuries, and request the same relief.”
Defendants and the attorney general’s office, which intervened in the case, have until Nov. 3 to submit briefs to address why the existing preliminary injunction should not be modified to include Lakeside School District as a defendant, according to Friday’s order.

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)Two former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency leaders joined students and community members at Duke University to speak on advancing environmental goals in the face of federal resistance to climate change regulation.
At an event celebrating the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability’s 20th anniversary on Thursday, former EPA Administrators William Reilly and Michael Regan discussed finding climate solutions. 
Regan, who is now a distinguished fellow at Duke’s Sanford School of Public Policy, served from 2021 to 2024 under former President Joe Biden, who signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. This measure encouraged private sector, public sector, local and state governments, as well as households to invest in clean energy, electric vehicle tax credits and decarbonization efforts. 
As a North Carolinian who also formerly served as secretary of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, Regan emphasized the importance of working with state leaders. 
Regan said 70% of the EPA’s budget is passed through to the states. As a result, the agency is closely tied to state environmental departments, because the officials work together on strategic planning, setting priorities and measuring results. 
“Most of those individuals at the state levels are the ones where the rubber meets the road, and they’re the ones that are having conversations with the private sector, with local communities, with environmental justice communities,” he said. 
Former President George H. W. Bush appointed Reilly, who led the EPA from 1989 to 1993. Reilly now serves as chair of the Nicholas Institute’s advisory board. 
Notably, Bush signed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, a major revision to the original 1970 law. The amendments targeted three major threats to the environment and public health: acid rain, urban air pollution and toxic air emissions, according to the EPA’s website. 
In 1990, perception among members of Congress was that the EPA was “excessively oriented” toward regulation, Reilly said.
While the agency was initially popular during its inception in 1970, public support waned under the Reagan administration, which imposed budget cuts. EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch resigned in 1983 because of an administrative scandal and another EPA official, Rita Lavelle, was convicted of lying to Congress.
To combat this and restore faith, the agency needed a new perspective, he said. The Bush administration worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to develop the clean air amendments and incorporate new ideas. 
“We need to be more resourceful, more open to those kinds of approaches which have not really been tried before,” Reilly said. 
A Duke student asked the pair how EPA leaders can continue to carry out their mission effectively while working under more narrow legal documents, such as West Virginia v. EPA. In that 2022 ruling, the Supreme Court limited the agency’s ability to regulate carbon emissions in the power sector, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. 
Regan said these Supreme Court cases force the EPA to be more creative in terms of protecting public health, and place restrictions on the level of authority the agency can give to regulators. 
“We don’t need a ton of new regulations,” Regan said. “We need smart regulations that give flexibility so that markets and technologies can achieve those environmental goals.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4387-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-24 16:01:30.992327

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The House speaker stripped an Oklahoma City Democrat of her committee assignments Friday following a lawsuit against her from the Oklahoma Ethics Commission. 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said he removed Rep. Ajay Pittman from four committees, including tourism, agriculture, energy and natural resources, and the health budget subcommittee, at the recommendation of his chamber’s Democratic Caucus.
House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, confirmed Friday that her caucus has recommended the temporary suspension. She said that the House Democratic Caucus has also suspended Pittman from its membership and activities pending the outcome of an Attorney General investigation. 
Pittman did not immediately return messages seeking comment. 
The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office is also investigating Pittman and recently served a search warrant for her office at the Capitol, but a spokesperson said Friday the warrant is sealed. He did not respond to a question about the subject of the investigation. 
The Ethics Commission lawsuit alleges that Pittman committed fraud and breach of contract by filing fake documents to settle a previous ethics investigation. The Commission is seeking civil relief through the Oklahoma County District Court.
Pittman previously settled with the Ethics Commission for improperly using campaign funds for personal use and agreed to pay $35,000. She failed to comply with the settlement agreement, leading to further investigation by the Commission and the eventual lawsuit, officials said. 
A court filing alleges Pittman provided the Commission a letter from her landlord that was actually created by her mother, former state lawmaker Anastasia Pittman, indicating that her campaign records had been destroyed by water damage. 
The lawsuit also alleges Pittman submitted a falsified check to the Commission as proof of a payment from her personal funds as outlined in the settlement agreement.
“These are serious findings from the Ethics Commission, in addition to an ongoing criminal investigation, so I feel this additional step is warranted,” Hilbert said in a statement. 
Hilbert previously removed her from the State Tribal Relations Committee. 
Munson said the allegations against Pittman are “severe enough” to warrant action.

Ron DeSantis dismissed a slate of proposed constitutional amendments from House Republicans to lower or eliminate property taxes, a South Florida Democrat has unveiled his own ideas for the 2026 legislative session.
“As property tax bills arrive for families around Florida, living in our state feels more expensive than ever,” said state Sen. Mack Bernard, D-West Palm Beach, in a press release Friday. “That’s why I’ve filed these property tax relief proposals — because voters should have a chance to decide on what the best financial relief is for themselves.”

Bernard’s legislative package includes one bill and four joint resolutions. A joint resolution needs to be approved by three-fifths of each chamber in the Legislature to become a proposed constitutional amendment, which then needs 60% support from the public to become law. Bills need simple majority votes and approval by the governor.
These are the five proposals:
SJR 270 — Would exempt the non-school portion of property tax for Florida seniors aged 65 and older who have claimed a homestead exemption for a minimum of five years and whose annual income does not exceed $350,000.
SJR- 274 — Would provide additional homestead property tax benefits for long-term homeowners. It says that assessed value cannot increase after 20 years of ownership and residency; and it would provide homeowners after 30 years of ownership and residency with an additional homestead exemption equal to 50% of the property’s assessed value.
SJR-278 — Would cap the assessed value increase of new homestead properties after a change in ownership at 150% of the property’s prior year assessed value, provided the assessed value was under $500,000, for ad valorem purposes.
SJR 282 — Would limit the assessed value of real property to 3% or the percentage change in the consumer price index, whichever is lower, if the property is owned and used for commercial purposes by a small business.
Bernard is also sponsoring a bill (SB 286) that would allow Florida residents to make changes, additions, or improvements to their homestead without increasing the assessed value of the property if the total just value of changes, additions, or improvements is less than $100,000.
In offering his proposals on Friday, Bernard becomes the first Democrat in the Legislature to weigh in substantively on property tax reform. Property taxes have become a leading issue for DeSantis and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, who have promised that Floridians will have the opportunity to vote to either severely reduce or outright ban property taxes on homesteads.
However, they have not stated exactly what would come before the voters next year.
To fill that void, seven Florida House Republicans offered their own joint resolutions to reduce property taxes a week ago. But DeSantis essentially dismissed their substance on Wednesday night, noting in a social media post that “placing more than one property tax measure on the ballot represents an attempt to kill anything on property taxes,” adding that it was “a political game, not a serious attempt to get it done for the people.”
That irked House Speaker Daniel Perez, who responded in a statement Thursday asking where were DeSantis’ proposals?
“So when the Governor says he wants to ‘abolish’ property taxes. How? We don’t have any details,” he said.
“But what the House does have is a proposal that reflects the Governor’s comments in the media and can garner the support of voters in November — the elimination of non-school property taxes on all homesteaded properties, in addition to a range of possible ballot initiatives — some to offer tax cuts, and some to fix broken parts of the system. We offered multiple proposals in good faith because it is unclear to us what — if anything — any other party is willing to do.”
Bernard, an attorney, was elected to represent Senate District 24 in Palm Beach County in a special election in 2024. He previously served in the Florida House between 2009-2012.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan, who is running an independent campaign for Michigan governor in the 2026 election cycle, is gaining traction among voters, according to a new poll released Friday from Schoen Cooperman Research. 
The poll of 600 likely November 2026 voters in Michigan shows Duggan with the support of 26% of voters — while top Democratic candidate Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson sits at 30% and top Republican candidate U.S. Rep. John James having 29% of voter support. 
A statement from Duggan’s campaign called the poll a demonstration of him “rapidly closing the gap on the top Republican and Democrat candidates statewide.”
The margin of error for the poll is 4%, placing Duggan within that margin. 
“We are building a coalition of support unlike anything this state has seen before, pulling unprecedented support from Democrats and Republicans. We’re winning unions, chambers of commerce, clergy and elected officials,” said campaign manager Ed Duggan in a statement from the campaign. 
The statement also pointed to Duggan’s job approval statewide as the mayor of Detroit, where 63% of Democrats — the party that he ran under for all three of his mayoral terms — and 47% of Republicans approved. 
The poll also showed Duggan with a higher net favorability rating compared to Benson, James, and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist — though all did have net positive ratings among voters. 
“Another poll, another lead for Jocelyn Benson,” Benson’s campaign manager Nikki Goldschein wrote to the Advance in response to the polling. “Michiganders want leaders who can take on broken systems and fix them to make life easier for people across the state — not politicians who attack and divide. That’s why voters keep putting Jocelyn on top, while John James and Mike Duggan are left fighting to keep up.” 
Internal Benson campaign polling also shows Duggan much further behind Benson or James, over 15 points behind either of those candidates.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)With just over a month before its lease is set to expire, the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) has been given the state’s OK to remain at its downtown Providence headquarters for another decade.
The State Properties Committee voted 4-1 Thursday to approve a new 10-year, $24 million lease keeping the department in its converted factory headquarters in Providence’s Jewelry District, much to the frustration of the more than dozen current and former workers who attended the two-hour meeting inside a Department of Administration conference room.
For months, workers organized under SEIU Local 580 have claimed the office building at 101 Friendship St. has poor ventilation, leaks, heating issues, and infestations by insects, mice and other rodents populating the building’s five floors — along with recent bat sightings.
Speaking to the committee, the department’s director, Ashley Deckert, acknowledged that the building “has not been without its challenges,” but that officials have been working with the building’s owner to address issues as they arise.
“While not every challenge can be solved overnight, I’m confident that the building is in a strong operational position,” Deckert said. She added that the department had gone “above and beyond” to make the building safe, functional and welcoming. 
But Matthew Gunnip, president of SEIU Local 580, said that’s not the reality his 300 union members face — showing the committee enlarged photos of buckets filled with brown water, rotting wood, and soot-covered pipes.
“DCYF’s representations were insincere,” he said in an interview after the meeting. “There’s not much transparency.”

Tensions over the building caused the department to miss a key deadline to renew its lease. Under the previous 10-year agreement, the state had to sign a new deal by July 31 to extend it for another decade.
The State Properties Committee was initially set to vote on the renewal July 22, but union pushback prompted the panel to delay the decision pending results from an air quality test. A second vote, scheduled for July 29, was postponed again to allow for a public hearing — a rare step for the committee that reviews state leases.
“Even though we meet in public, we do not normally meet with public comment,” Committee Chairman Marco Schiappa said in his opening remarks.
And in another deviation from the norm, the committee posted years of documentation, including air quality and pest control reports, for the public to view and submit questions to the panel.
Schiappa said the public didn’t submit any questions ahead of Thursday’s meeting. But when the committee opened up for comment, current and former employees spoke of the building’s poor conditions that they say remain and have contributed to health problems among employees.
Diane Winckelium, a former social worker who worked in the building from 1997 to 2009, said she was sick “at least on a monthly basis.”
“I had constant sore throats, sinus infections, [and] severe fatigue,” she said. “Ulitimately I had to undergo a procedure to have tube placed up my ears just to cope.”
It wasn’t until she left the department, she said, that her symptoms finally disappeared, except for her sinusitis. 
“I am stuck with that for life,” Winckelium said.
Debra Bonner, a retired child protective investigator, said she had never had allergies until she worked in the Friendship Street offices between 2002 and 2020. She told the committee she has since been diagnosed with cancer, which she believes came from working in the office building.
“All the vents in that building had black soot,” she said.
State and building officials maintain the air quality is safe, citing recent reports — including a Sept. 5 analysis by R.I. Analytical Laboratories, Inc. — that measured particulates, carbon dioxide, dander, and mold, all found to be within normal levels for an office environment.
“The bottom line is that we found a generally clean, maintained building,” Kenneth Davis, a senior environmental scientist for the lab, told the committee.
But Gunnip said the union was not alerted to the findings of that report until Oct. 14. He requested the committee again delay action until the union could get a third-party look at the building.

Nicholas Vaz, representing Attorney General Peter Neronha on the panel, called the request reasonable and worth exploring. He was the lone vote against the extension. But public member Robert Donovan, who moved to approve the lease, warned it would lead to “analysis paralysis” and push a final decision even closer to the Nov. 30 lease expiration.
“All the parties have been given ample time to present experts,” he said.
With the new lease, officials promised improvements including new carpets and paint throughout the majority of the building, new flooring in the lobby and main entrance area, new window blinds, and water fountains with filtration units installed on each floor.
Deckert said the department is also working with building manager Provident Property to establish a maintenance request system that lets employees track when a request is made, who it is assigned to, and when it is completed. 
“Creating a better communication pathway is a priority,” she said.
Gunnip still remains skeptical that this will be the case, adding that he was appalled by the State Properties Committee’s vote.
“There was no acknowledgement of what was reported by the workers,” he said. “It seemed like the vote was taken even before we had the hearing.”

Alex Mercer)New Mexico environment officials announced Friday that approximately 100 homes in Curry County will have a new water source to lessen their exposure to toxic PFAS in their drinking wells from nearby Cannon Air Force Base.
The state environment department said it will be awarding a $12 million state legislative appropriation for the project to EPCOR, which runs water and wastewater services in Eastern New Mexico, and is a major utilities provider in the U.S. and Canada. The company operates more than 41,000 connections in Clovis, according to the state’s drinking water website.
The move comes in response to the state’s PFAS blood testing initiative in the area that found that 99.7% of the 628 participants had PFOS — the form of PFAS (per and poly fluoroalkyl substances) widely used in military firefighting foam — in their blood. The state’s report also found New Mexicans working or living closer to the PFAS-contaminated groundwater plume under Cannon had PFAS levels that were three times higher than residents not working or living near the plume.
Studies on PFAS’ health impacts remain ongoing, but exposure has thus far been linked to kidney and reproductive cancers, decreased fertility, fetal developmental delays, disruption of immune responses and liver functions in people.
The project will extend EPCOR’s existing water system east of the base to include members of Curry County. The connections will be voluntary, requiring households to opt-in, according to a news release on the project. In a statement, state Environment Secretary James Kenney said that connecting to EPCOR’s water lines would be “the best way for Curry County residents to receive drinking water that meets or exceeds all state and federal standards.”
In a joint statement, Republican lawmakers from the Clovis and Broadview areas said they were “excited” to see movement on the $12 million project they set funds aside for in the 2025 legislative session.
“PFAS contamination has impacted the health and wellbeing of our families near Cannon Air Force Base and finding real solutions is critical,” Minority Whip Sen. Pat Woods, Sen. Pat Boone, Rep. Martin Zamora, and Rep. Andrea Reeb said in a joint statement.
New Mexico remains embroiled in several lawsuits with the U.S. Department of Defense over PFAS contamination, and is part of multi-state litigation in South Carolina.
The state is also involved in separate litigation in the federal court system, after the U.S. Department of Defense sued the state’s environment department, claiming New Mexico overstepped its authority in mandating cleanup.
In yet another case filed this year, state officials alleged Cannon Air Force illegally barred state inspectors entry to the base to test for PFAS, violating a new state law. A Department of Defense’s request to move that case forward in federal court remains on hold pending a ruling on whether the case should be incorporated into the multi-state litigation in South Carolina.

Incumbent GOP Chair Paul Dame is facing a challenge from Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex, while current Democratic Chair Jim Ramsey isn’t seeking the job again.

Vermont’s state chapters of the Republican and Democratic parties could both see new leadership next month after the parties hold their biennial reorganization meetings.
Paul Dame, the incumbent chair of the Vermont Republican Party, is running for a third term but facing a challenge from a somewhat unconventional opponent: a sitting state senator. Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex, is vying to lead the party with a pitch that it could do more to recruit down-ballot candidates and deepen its ties with younger voters. 
Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Jim Ramsey — who’s served as interim party chair since February — said Wednesday that he will not be seeking the job on a permanent basis. Ramsey was elected to the role after former chair David Glidden resigned.
“Over the course of the past few months, my work commitments outside of the VDP have been increasing, and much of it is occurring away from Vermont, particularly in Washington, DC.,” Ramsey wrote in an email to other party leaders last week.
Vermont Democrats will elect a new chair on Nov. 15, while the GOP will elect a new leader on Nov. 8. Both chairs will be chosen by the members of each party’s state committees, which largely consist of delegates selected at the county level. 
The Democratic state committee is slated to have about 45 members this year, while the GOP state committee will likely have about 110, party leaders said. 
‘A winning team’
Dame was first elected GOP chair in 2021, and he was reelected to the two-year post in 2023. Like Ingalls, he said he’s running to build on sweeping gains the party made in the Vermont House and Senate in last fall’s elections that dismantled Democratic supermajorities in both chambers.
For Dame’s part, though, he thinks a leadership change won’t help win more seats. He acknowledged that the party’s gains were largely thanks to campaigning by Republican Gov. Phil Scott, though believes his relationship with the governor played a role, too. 
“I think when you’ve got a winning team, you want to be very careful about mixing things up,” said Dame, who lives in St. George and runs a retirement planning company.
Despite those gains, recent history gives Republicans some reason to be wary. During the last midterm elections in 2022, the party lost substantial ground to Democrats after winning a handful of new seats in 2020 — albeit, not the wave they won last year. It’s not entirely clear what impact President Donald Trump’s popularity, or the popularity of policies backed by Trump’s GOP allies in Congress, might have on the 2026 race. 
The state Republican Party has also faced a scandal over the past two weeks that could factor into the chair race. State Sen. Sam Douglass, R-Orleans, resigned from his seat after he was exposed in a Politico report as a member of a group chat with other young Republicans from around the country that exchanged racial slurs and other derogatory messages.  
Gov. Scott issued a press release calling for Douglass to resign the evening of the day the Politico report was published. The following day, Ingalls was the lead signatory on a statement signed by several Northeast Kingdom legislators calling for the same, adding, “these comments have no place within our society as a whole and will not be tolerated.”
Douglass formally submitted notice of his resignation to Vermont’s Senate secretary, John Bloomer, on Wednesday.
For his part, Dame had not immediately called for Douglass to resign from his Senate seat. He called the group chat “shocking and grotesque” in a statement the following day but suggested that remarks attributed to Douglass in the Politico story were not bigoted or racist. Hours later, however, the executive committee of the state GOP issued a press release with a “full, complete retraction” of Dame’s statement.
“The Vermont Republican Party (“VTGOP”) Executive Committee stands united with Governor Phil Scott and the Republican Senate and House leadership and calls for the immediate resignation of Senator Sam Douglass,” they wrote in the release.
The party’s executive committee includes Dame as well as the party’s vice chair, treasurer and secretary, along with Republican state legislators and other members appointed by the larger state committee, according to the party’s governing rules. 
In an interview on Vermont Public’s midday radio show, Vermont Edition, on Monday, Dame, who served in the House from 2015 to 2017, pushed back on the notion that his values were not aligned with those of the rest of the committee. He said he was hesitant to jump to conclusions about Douglass’ intentions, and that he issued the statement he felt comfortable with given all the information he had at the time.
“Part of what I’ve been trying to do in my term as chair is, trying to find what is a standard that we can hold all of our elected officials to — and, how do we begin to apply that equally, in a nonpartisan way?” he said on the radio.
A senator’s challenge
Ingalls has served in the state Senate since 2019 and currently chairs the chamber’s Agriculture Committee. He is well-known as one of the chamber’s most conservative voices. 
Ingalls faced criticism from the state’s Democratic Party in April when he was one of a handful of members of the chamber to vote against a resolution condemning the arrest of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student activist and years-long Upper Valley resident, by masked federal immigration agents in Colchester. The Columbia University student, who was a prominent leader of pro-Palestinian protests on campus, was later ordered released by a Vermont federal judge.
To be sure, Ingalls also represents some of the state’s most politically conservative areas. In Essex County, which makes up most of his district, 55% of voters supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election, compared with 33% on average statewide. 
“I have spoken to far too many of you who feel disenfranchised with the direction of our Party and its leadership,” Ingalls said in a social media post announcing his candidacy last week, a day before the Politico story was published. “I hear you and commit to making sure that your values and ideals are reflected in the Party that you love.”
In addition to serving in the Legislature, Ingalls owns a real estate business and operates a group of radio stations in and around his Northeast Kingdom district. Over the summer, Ingalls decided to switch the brief newscasts that play at the top of the hour on his stations from stories produced by Associated Press or the major broadcasters ABC, CBS and NBC to Fox News.
Dame, in an interview, questioned whether Ingalls would be able to devote his time fully to serving as party chair in addition to all those different roles.
“I think that he’s too important in the role that he’s in to have his attention divided with everything that comes with this job,” Dame said, referring to Ingalls’ Senate seat. Republicans have a minority of seats but enough to sustain vetoes by Gov. Scott.
For a moment this month, a third candidate also had his hat in the ring for state GOP chair: Joe Gervais, the current chair of the Bennington County Republicans who has run, unsuccessfully, for both the House and Senate. Gervais announced his bid for chair on Oct. 2, but last week, he reneged on that idea and endorsed Ingalls’ bid instead, he said in an email.
Ingalls did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
A new Democratic chair
While Republicans will be focused on maintaining — and attempting to boost — the number of seats they have in both chambers next year, Ramsey, the outgoing Democratic chair, said his party will focus on messaging to voters that characterizes Scott, and other Republican leaders, as an inadequate safeguard against the Trump administration. 
It’s not clear yet whether any of Vermont’s statewide Democratic incumbents — namely, Treasurer Mike Pieciak or Attorney General Charity Clark — will announce a bid for governor for 2026. Scott has not said yet whether he plans to seek what would be his sixth term in the office.
Ramsey said his increasing work commitments in Washington, D.C., stem largely from his and his wife’s work with organizations that advocate for research on brain health. He said that work has taken on new urgency amid the Trump administration’s efforts to slash public health research. The couple plans to move to Washington, D.C. full time but keep a second home in Manchester, Ramsey said.
Glidden, the former Democratic chair, announced he was resigning from the job in November 2024, triggering a midcycle election for the role. Ramsey beat out Andy Julow, who was appointed to a state Senate seat in May 2024 but then lost in the general election that fall to a Republican challenger. The party chair vote was 38-7, according to Ramsey.
Julow said in a text message Wednesday that he does not plan to seek the job again. Ramsey said he wasn’t immediately aware of other candidates who had publicly declared their intention to run.
Ramsey appeared to receive at least some scrutiny during his time as chair over fundraising efforts. A report from the Vermont Democratic Party’s treasurer last month, which was reviewed by VTDigger, stated that staff added a specific line for party fundraising tied to the chair. Between January and August, the chair had raised “$0 against a budgeted (expected) revenue of $6500,” the report states. The line was added “in response to requests for more fundraising transparency,” it states.
Ramsey said he was aware of that line item but pushed back on the idea that it was a criticism of his work as chair. He said he did not think it painted a complete picture of the work he’d done since taking on the role. He compared the $6,500 figure to the party’s total revenue over the same time period which, per the report, was about $227,000, saying the former would have been a small drop in the bucket.
“I’ve done a lot of work with emails, letters, meetings, calls, other stuff,” Ramsey said. “There has been quite a bit of activity on my part.”

This story was originally reported by Errin Haines and Amanda Becker of The 19th. Meet Errin and Amanda and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
When bulldozers began to tear down the East Wing of the White House this week to clear the way for President Donald Trump’s $250 million ballroom, historians raised alarms that important American history was being buried in the rubble, including chapters about previous first ladies and their roles uplifting women going back nearly a century.
Among the offices housed in the East Wing is the Office of the First Lady, first professionalized by Eleanor Roosevelt during her husband’s administration. Roosevelt used the East Wing for official functions, as a base of operations for her activism and as a space for interacting with groups representing the American people, from the Girl Scouts to the Women’s Trade Union League.
Betty Ford argued to increase pay for her staff in the East Wing. Rosalynn Carter became the first first lady to keep her own office there, in 1977. It was also in the East Wing that Laura Bush launched her literacy efforts, and where Michelle Obama oversaw her “Let’s Move” campaign.
Katherine A.S. Sibley, a professor of history at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, said that before Carter, first ladies had offices in the presidential residence, often in their bedrooms. Roosevelt establishing a staff and presence in the East Wing — and subsequent first ladies having dedicated staff and their own offices there — were acknowledgements of the significant role presidential spouses play on key initiatives.

“To me, this demolition suggests that the current White House does not think that the first lady does anything of value,” Sibley said. “I’m not talking about [Melania Trump] particularly, but the office itself — they’re not cognizant of the history.”
The demolition of the East Wing took many by surprise. In July, when Trump signed the executive order authorizing the construction of the ballroom, he said: “It won’t interfere with the current building. … It’ll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of.”
The ballroom is being financed by contributions from private companies with business before the Trump administration, including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Lockheed Martin and OpenAI, according to news reports. At a dinner with donors last week, Trump said: “Everything out there is coming down and we’re replacing it with one of the most beautiful ballrooms you’ve ever seen.”

The National Capitol Planning Commission, an Executive Branch agency that Congress tasked with having a “comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated plan for the National Capital,” is now chaired by a top Trump aide, Will Scharf. He has said the commission does not have oversight over demolition, it only approves construction.
The agency’s website states that it is closed due to the ongoing government shutdown. The 19th received an automated response to its email to the White House press office, saying there are staffing shortages and they are unable to respond to all inquiries, also citing the government shutdown.
In a statement released Monday night, the White House characterized the response to the East Wing demolition as the “latest instance of manufactured outrage, unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies … clutching their pearls over President Donald Trump’s visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom.”
Former East Wing staffers told East Wing Magazine that seeing the offices where they once worked torn down was “jarring,” a “gut punch” and “revolting.” Members of the Nixon administration asked the White House to stop the renovation or at least allow them to provide input on the preservation of artifacts. One said they feared a “time capsule” they had installed near a window would be destroyed.

Historian Alexis Coe told The 19th that “serious work would happen” in the East Wing, “on issues that were significant to the American population.”
From the East Wing, Roosevelt expanded the role of first lady, working to highlight women with intention. Her first news conference, on March 6, 1933, featured 35 reporters, all of them women. During her tenure, she held nearly 350 news conferences, helping to elevate the role of women in national and political life, as well as in journalism.
People have also historically chosen to protest outside the East Wing as a way of making themselves seen and getting the attention of the first lady, including on the issue of civil rights in the 1960s, which Lady Bird Johnson supported.
“Serious work is not going to happen there anymore. This is another instance in which Trump has said one thing — that the East Wing would not be altered — and he’s altering it,” Coe said.

(Photo: Wes Muller/LA Illuminator)A Canadian mining company plans to build a facility in Calcasieu Parish to refine rare earth metals used in a variety of motors and electronics in the consumer, technology and defense industries.
Aclara Resources Inc., headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, announced a $277 million investment to construct the first U.S. heavy rare earth separation facility at the Port of Vinton, according to a Friday news release from Louisiana Economic Development. 
The company plans to mine deposits of rare earth metals in South America and ship them to Louisiana for processing at its proposed facility in Vinton. The facility will use hydrochloric acid to extract and separate the metals from the clay mineral deposits. 
Rare earth elements — such as dysprosium, neodymium, praseodymium and terbium — are considered critical materials for many industries. Some are used as high-powered magnets in wind turbine motors, vehicle alternators and heat-seeking missiles, according to ScienceNews. Others are used as high-temperature alloys in aircraft engines and nuclear reactors, or as signal amplifiers in fiber optic cables, among other applications. 
Aclara’s Louisiana facility is expected to directly employ 140 people. It will occupy an LED Certified Site at the Port of Vinton, prequalified for industrial development through environmental and engineering reviews. 
“Louisiana provides ready access to the key reagents we depend on, helping ensure operational reliability and lower transportation costs,” Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa said in the news release. “The state’s world-class chemical industry and highly skilled workforce made the decision even more compelling. Simply put, Louisiana has everything we were looking for.”
The state is giving Aclara a $3 million grant to pay for infrastructure and an additional job-creation grant for as much as 22% of wages paid. Additionally, the company will be eligible for the state’s lucrative Industrial Tax Exemption Program through which it will be largely exempt from property taxes in Calcasieu Parish. 
Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and be completed in 2027. 
Aclara boasts what it calls a sustainable mining process that uses no explosives, milling or wastewater ponds. The company says it recirculates 95% of the water it uses for mining and plants trees after razing the land. It plans to begin its mining operations in Chile in 2027 and in Brazil in 2028, according to the company’s website.

(Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)McCOOK, Neb. — The process of converting a state prison in McCook into a state-run, federal immigration detention facility is allowed to proceed for now as a district judge considers a motion seeking a temporary injunction filed by McCook residents and a former state lawmaker.
Red Willow County District Judge Patrick Heng heard arguments Friday on the temporary injunction motion, as well as the state’s subsequent motion to dismiss filed earlier this week. He did not make an immediate ruling on either but indicated he would rule “soon” on the motion to dismiss.
The 24-page lawsuit argues Gov. Jim Pillen’s in-progress plan to convert the Work Ethic Camp in McCook would “usurp” legislative authority and violate separation of powers under the Nebraska Constitution and state law. The case names Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of Nebraska’s correctional system.

“This case is not about immigration, it’s about our constitutional Republican form of government,” said Nick Grandgenett, attorney for Nebraska Appleseed, which is leading the lawsuit on behalf of the plaintiffs.
Nebraska signed a two-year 183-page contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Sept. 30 to convert the camp into an ICE detention facility.
The lead plaintiff, former State Sen. DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, served in the Nebraska Legislature between 1989 and 2009, including as chair of the Nebraska Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee. She was one of 41 lawmakers who approved the Work Ethic Camp in 1997 at the request of then-Gov. Ben Nelson, a McCook native and the state’s last Democratic governor.
The facility was meant to reduce prison crowding by moving out low-risk offenders and making space for more violent offenders elsewhere. The Work Ethic Camp opened in 2001, and the Legislature has repeatedly appropriated state funds to keep up the facility.
Schimek and the 13 McCook residents argue that without legislative approval, Pillen, Jeffreys and other officials can’t convert the facility or use state funds other than how lawmakers have specified. The lawsuit also states the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services has authority over state prisoners, not non-citizens awaiting civil proceedings seeking to deport them.
Pillen has previously argued state law gives him authority through the creation of the Corrections Department, plus a clause in the Nebraska Constitution that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”
Arguments Friday largely centered around a provision of the state Constitution that reads, “The general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory, and penal institutions shall be vested as determined by the Legislature.”
Each side of the case had different interpretations of the provision. Lincoln Korell, an attorney representing the state, argued the Legislature had already granted this authority to Corrections, granting the state — or in this case the administration — the ability to enter the contract.
Robbie McEwen, legal director of Nebraska Appleseed, argued that Corrections was granted the power to house incarcerated people within state law. Because the agreement pertains to Nebraska housing immigrant detainees for ICE, he argued that it requires separate legislative approval.

Grandgenett further argued that Pillen and Jeffreys entering the contract violates the Legislature’s authority to appropriate state funds. State senators often refer to the Legislature’s jurisdiction being “the power of the purse.” He cited Nebraska’s unlawful expenditure doctrine, which refers to taxpayers’ ability to sue to prevent the illegal expenditure of public funds.
Korell noted that the federal government plans to reimburse Nebraska on many expenses related to the project. The contract states that ICE plans to pay Nebraska at least $2.5 million each month to house federal detainees — adult males and females — at the camp. It includes a daily bed rate of $269.17 per detainee. In the second year, minimum ICE payments to Nebraska would rise by 3%.
The Work Ethic Camp previously had an annual operating cost of $10.2 million and a daily bed rate of $199.50 per inmate. It housed only males.
Pillen’s office estimated the contract would net Nebraska about $14.25 million per year. ICE agreed to also pay Nebraska a one-time lump sum of $5.9 million for “facility renovations.” Work has already begun to make adjustments to the property. Corrections contracted with Outback Fence, a Lincoln-based fencing company, paying $750,000 to install a 12-foot razor wire-topped fence at the prison by the end of the month.

Grandgenett countered that it doesn’t matter if the feds will reimburse Nebraska, because the state will still have to make the initial expenditures that he contends will cause “irreparable harm.”
“It’s the ‘unlawful expenditure doctrine,’ it’s not the ‘unlawful expenditure unless you make a profit doctrine,’” Grandgenett said.
Joe McKechnie, another attorney for the state, argued that even if the state backs out of the agreement, there still would be plenty of expenses Nebraska would have to shoulder, including the fencing updates.
“The immigration detainees in Nebraska will still have to be detained somewhere,” McKechnie said.
Korell argued Heng should dismiss the case for several reasons. He said the Red Willow County District Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case, because the lawsuit excludes several parties with interest in the project. Korell argued that if the plaintiffs are successful, that would effectively terminate the contract, which would impact both the federal government and Outback Fence.
McEwen said this perspective could lead to a slippery slope in which every associated organization to the project would need to be included in the case, like food vendors and other contracted businesses. He argued the case concerns the state’s authority to enter the contract, so the state should be the primary party.
Korell also argued plaintiffs used broad justifications about their motives for bringing the case. To get their feet in the courthouse door, Schimek and the McCook residents argue the case concerns an unlawful expenditure of public funds and a “matter of great public concern.”
While Korell acknowledged these are legitimate reasons to file a suit, he argued they are meant to be interpreted narrowly. He said plaintiffs need to show they face an imminent injury as a result of the project, which could apply to federal detainees or state inmates relocated for the project, but not McCook residents.

“Nebraska courts aren’t a stage just for any person to air their grievances against any other person,” Korell said.
In separate affidavits, Schimek and the 13 McCook residents attested to their concerns about the state-federal plan, expressing concern about not having an opportunity to participate in the policy decision before Pillen and others acted.
Some McCook residents expressed concern for McCook children and the “toxic public dialogue” or “fear” the decision had already caused. Ronda Graff said she worried the prison’s repurposing would undermine long-time efforts to create a “welcoming, friendly and engaging community.”
Heng did not offer a timeline as to when he expects to make his rulings, but indicated he would rule on the state’s motion to dismiss first.

You can read more about the section here.

Few topics in education stir as much passion as school choice.
On the surface, the idea sounds simple and appealing: Give families state dollars and let them decide where to send their children to school. But beneath that slogan are serious consequences for Mississippi’s children, communities and future—consequences we cannot afford to ignore.
As Mississippi’s public education system experiences its most impressive gains in decades, we must ask an important question: Why now? Why introduce a policy that would destabilize a system that is clearly working?
Over the past decade, Mississippi has seen remarkable growth, with 87% of districts now earning a C or higher, according to the Mississippi Department of Education.

Notably, eight of the 19 districts rated D, F or not rated at all are charter schools. Our state’s national ranking for K–12 achievement has climbed from 50th to 16th, and Mississippi now leads the nation in early literacy gains and fourth-grade reading growth. These results were not achieved through privatization or vouchers. They were  achieved through focus, consistency and intentionality by teachers and administrators across our state.
When a system is continuously improving, research is clear—now is not the time to blow it up. It is the time to double down on what works.
The path forward for Mississippi lies in refining and strengthening our current educational system, not  abandoning it for one that lacks accountability or proven results. 
Accountability should apply to everyone  
Public schools in Mississippi operate under one of the most transparent and rigorous accountability systems in the nation. Every school and district receives an annual letter grade — A through F — based on clear, publicly reported indicators such as student  achievement, academic growth, graduation rates and college and career readiness.
Those results are not hidden in a report or spreadsheet. They are published statewide each year, tied directly to state and federal funding decisions and used to guide support and improvement efforts.
When schools fall short, the state steps in. The Mississippi Department of Education provides targeted assistance, professional development and intervention strategies to help struggling schools improve.
Local school boards are required to discuss results in open meetings, and the public has full access to performance data by school, grade and subgroup. In short, the public knows exactly how their schools are performing and can hold leaders — like me — accountable for results.
Private schools receiving taxpayer-funded vouchers, however, face none of these same expectations. They are not required to administer state assessments aligned with Mississippi’s academic standards, report graduation rates or publish any data showing whether students are actually learning. They are not required to have certified teachers.
There are no annual report cards, no performance frameworks and no transparency measures that allow parents or taxpayers to see results.
That lack of oversight raises a serious question. If public money is funding private education, how are families — or lawmakers — supposed to know whether “school choice” is actually working? Without data, there is no way to compare outcomes or determine whether students receiving vouchers are gaining ground, standing still or falling behind.
If public dollars are going to private institutions, the public deserves to know what they’re getting in return. Accountability should not stop at the schoolhouse door simply because the sign out front doesn’t say “public.”
Transparency is not a punishment. It’s a promise. It’s the reason Mississippi’s public education system has achieved record gains in the last decade.
We turned years of stagnation into a story of improvement precisely because we were willing to measure results, confront reality and act on what the data showed. If accountability has helped strengthen our public schools, shouldn’t it be expected of any school that receives public funds? 
The cost of disruption  
Universal school choice would drain critical resources from public schools – the very institutions that anchor our communities.
When public dollars follow students out the door, the schools left behind still carry the same responsibilities: Teaching every child who walks through their doors, keeping class sizes manageable and providing programs in the arts, athletics and career-technical education. What disappears are the resources to sustain that work.
Unlike public schools, private schools that receive vouchers are not required to serve all children. They can – and often do – set admissions criteria that exclude students with disabilities, English language learners or those with behavioral or academic challenges.
Private schools may decline to provide transportation, limit access for low-income families or charge additional fees beyond the voucher amount. That’s not freedom or fairness; that’s selective access.
Public schools, by contrast, open their doors to every child, every day. They are the great equalizer – places where opportunity is not limited by income, background or ability. Public schools don’t get to choose their students. They simply choose to serve  them all.
In every community, the public school is more than a building. It’s a gathering place, a unifying symbol and a promise that every child deserves a fair start. To weaken that promise by diverting funds to institutions that operate without the same responsibility or transparency is to risk unraveling one of the most essential threads in the fabric of our state. 
A better path forward 
At its core, education is a public good, not a consumer good. It exists not to serve individual preference but to ensure the collective well-being of our communities and the strength of our democracy.
Public education thrives on shared responsibility,  transparency and inclusion – values that cannot be reduced to marketplace competition or transactional choice. 
When we begin to treat education as a commodity to be bought and sold, we risk eroding the foundation of equal opportunity and civic unity that has anchored this nation for more than a century. Public schools are where our children learn not only  academics, but empathy, cooperation and the responsibilities of citizenship. 
Mississippi’s recent success story proves what’s possible when we invest in what works — early literacy, teacher development, career pathways and continuous  improvement.
Rather than expanding programs that siphon resources away from public schools, we should continue building on the practices that have moved Mississippi from the bottom of national rankings to one of the most improved states in the country.
The future of Mississippi’s children depends on the decisions we make today. If we want every child, in every community, to have a fair shot at success, we must protect and strengthen our public schools. Let’s continue to refine what’s working instead of dismantling a system that is finally moving in the right direction. 
Education is not a marketplace — it’s a promise. And that promise belongs to every child in Mississippi.

Attorney General Dave Sunday announced seven people have been charged with violations of the Election Code and Voter Registration Law and related offenses stemming from an investigation that started in Lancaster County last October. Sunday took office in January.
Guillermo Sainz, 33, of Sierra Vista, Arizona, was charged with three counts of soliciting registrations, which is a misdemeanor violation of the Election Code regarding offering financial incentives for achieving registration quotas. Sainz worked as director of a company’s registration drive efforts in Pennsylvania, the Attorney General’s Office said. It did not identify the company in a news release.

Also charged are Amos Clay, Anya McCurdy, Meghan McDevitt, Richard Perez and Samantha Szukiewicz. Each is charged with felony tampering with public records and unsworn falsification, forgery and two crimes under the state’s Elections Code and Voter Registration law, all misdemeanors. Szukiewicz is also charged with identity theft.
Court documents detailing the charges were still being processed Friday afternoon, according to an official at the district court in Lancaster County where the charges were filed.
“We are confident that the motive behind these crimes was personal financial gain, and not a conspiracy or organized effort to tip any election for any one candidate or party,” Sunday said. “Pennsylvanians should have peace of mind that the election process worked in this case.”
Election workers in Lancaster County flagged about 2,500 applications last year that appeared to have the same handwriting and were filled out on the same day. Some of the applications were for previously registered voters and the signatures on the documents did not match those the county had on file, Lancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams said at the time.
Officials in Berks, York and Monroe counties also noticed inconsistencies in voter registration forms submitted shortly before the Nov. 3, 2024, election. While county election offices processed the forms and found some legitimate registrations, a significant number were rejected because the information could not be verified as belonging to real people, the Attorney General’s Office said.

The Attorney General’s Office reviewed several thousand forms and interviewed people across the state and country in collaboration with officials from the Berks, Lancaster, and York counties. It also assisted with a similar prosecution by the Monroe County District Attorney’s Office.
“The Office of Attorney General determined that the crimes were not motivated by efforts to sway any election or voter rolls for any specific party or candidate. Rather, the charged defendants were motivated to maintain employment and income by reaching quotas,” the Attorney General’s Office release said. “The voter registration forms collected by Sainz’s operation included all party affiliations.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0679-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-10-24 14:57:19.695375
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-24 18:33:15+00:00,CT Mirror,Mimi Torres-García case prompts lawmakers to mull policy change,Ginny Monk and Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/24/new-britain-girl-death-dcf-policy-changes/,Her case sparked debate about changes to the way DCF confirms children’s identities during interviews and whether it has enough resources.,"The case of an 11-year-old found dead earlier this month in a plastic storage container involves circumstances that the state Department of Children and Families has “rarely, if ever,” seen before, the interim commissioner said Thursday.
Those circumstances now have legislators talking about whether the agency has enough resources and considering potential changes to state law regarding the way DCF confirms children’s identities during interviews.
Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres-García was severely abused and starved. Her mother, aunt and her mother’s boyfriend have all been charged in connection to her death. DCF had a history with the family, and in January of this year responded to a report about maltreatment of Torres-García’s younger sister.
When DCF staff conducted their investigation, they were told that Torres-García was being homeschooled out of state and would return, although the date initially provided by the family to caseworkers for her return changed. DCF staff then had a video call with a child who Karla García, Torres-García’s mother, said was her daughter, DCF interim Commissioner Susan Hamilton said. 
But court documents show that Torres-García died in September 2024, months before DCF staff had the video call with the girl who posed as her.
“The circumstances in this case outlined well-orchestrated efforts by adults, one rarely if ever seen before in our Agency, to conceal the whereabouts of a child by being intentionally deceptive and producing a completely different child to pose as the child in question,” Hamilton said in a statement.
Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday that state agencies, including the Office of the Child Advocate, are working together with law enforcement to find out what happened.
“We’re doing everything we can, no stone unturned,”  he said. “I’m not sure it was dereliction. I think you had a parent, some family members, that tried to cover up a crime.”
The video call wasn’t standard practice, but the agency made an exception because the child was out of state and wasn’t the one who had reportedly experienced maltreatment, Hamilton said in her statement.
“They made an exception, and we have this terrible outcome,” said Children’s Committee ranking member Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton. “I don’t think that’s acceptable. We put policies and practices in place to keep people safe, and we follow them. Failure to do that is absolutely unacceptable.”
DCF policy is to conduct visits in-person, Hamilton said.
“We don’t have virtual visits with clients,” she said previously at a public meeting.
Asked Thursday about the well-being of the child who was made to pretend to be Torres-García, Lamont said he didn’t know, although it appeared he had been briefed on the details of the case.
“I don’t know the answer to that, except that that kid was looking pretty good in the video,” he said with a chuckle. A spokesperson from his office said the governor has not watched the video.
The agency recently implemented a policy change that requires staff to ask for photo identification of adults involved in investigations, and that policy will be formalized in policy books soon, Hamilton said.
“Through the engagement process with the parents or guardians, we interview all children in the household, relying on parental or guardian identification because children under the age of sixteen do not typically possess photo identification,” Hamilton said.
Children’s Committee co-chair Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, said she’s considering legislation for next session that would require DCF to maintain photos of all children involved in the system so they can be identified.
She said she’s also considering measures that would prevent anyone convicted of child abuse from moving into a home where children live after they have been released from prison on parole. In the Torres-García case, her aunt, Jackelyn García, had been convicted of risk of injury to a child and been incarcerated for 18 months. 
Jackelyn García appeared to be living with Torres-García’s family and has been charged in connection to her death.
“What are the policy pieces we can put in place to make sure that we are looking at things holistically to see not just immediate fixes, but a bigger picture?” Maher said.
DCF dealt with this case in the face of staff turnover challenges, an issue that exists at child welfare jurisdictions across the country. Online data shows that the agency has about 2,800 full-time employees, a drop from closer to 3,000 during the last gubernatorial administration.
“Social Work is a ‘calling’ and our staff are often immersed in some of the most complex forms of violence, child maltreatment, and family dynamics in our communities as part of their daily job functions and responsibilities,” Hamilton said in her statement. “As such, the work may result in extreme emotional, psychological and physical challenges for our employees.”
DCF has tried to improve turnover rates with internal office support, an Employee Assistance program that offers counseling, an Employee of the Month program, mentoring and training, among other initiatives.
At a recent conference in which DCF employees met to brainstorm strategies for improving challenges at the agency, Hamilton also spoke about the issue of worker turnover.
“We do pay. We do what we can to pay to attract people. The work is hard, no matter what. But we do have to, as a system, figure out ways to retain people. Because we’re putting a lot of effort, training and support in that first year,” Hamilton said. Although she didn’t have the numbers she said “people are deciding to leave after a year, and then you have to sort of start over.” 
At that conference, DCF employees also discussed the severity and complexity of their cases post-COVID pandemic. They said that the caseloads of workers is not the best metric for the amount of work they are doing, because the complexity of cases has risen significantly. 
Sarah Eagan, executive director of the Center for Children’s Advocacy and a former child advocate, said staff turnover has been “a dominant concern,” for DCF over the past few years.
She added that the conversation should be about DCF resources and whether there are enough services for families. Other systems, including Torres-García’s legal representation in her custody case, should be considered, she said.
Children’s Committee co-chair Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford, said staff turnover and caseworker loads is something he’s having conversations about, although he didn’t disclose details of legislative proposals he’s considered.
“I am thinking of a number of things, of how we might be able to better position and enable DCF with more resources and with better oversight to better run their agency,” Paris said.
Paris wants to see more of the facts of the case before he makes decisions about legislative proposals, but there is a “history here with other cases that we can point to in terms of how we need to focus on procedural and policy changes.”
Children’s Committee ranking member Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly, said she’s also not ready to make decisions or advocate for legislation until she has all the facts, but that she thinks DCF has an “astronomical number” of staff.
“I think until we actually lay eyes on all of those reports, we’re not going to really be able to, I think, make any suggestions or kind of come up with any conclusions of where this all went and what went wrong,” Dauphinais said.
She added that she doesn’t want to see solutions that introduce too much government involvement in people’s lives.
“I don’t think anybody wants big government oversight over themselves merely because some individuals have created some horrific crimes, but we want to make sure that the agencies in place are doing their jobs correctly,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/90-1024x683.webp,,,2025-10-24 14:57:19.695375

It feels innovative and urgent, despite being written 20 years ago by Tarell Alvin McCraney, Academy Award-winning writer of Moonlight. It’s set in the Louisiana bayou, but all I could think about was Missouri.
Too little has changed for formerly incarcerated people since the play was written. There was a moment during the first Trump administration when Republicans, Democrats and faith leaders worked together on criminal justice reform. That moment ended without a true reckoning on mass incarceration in this country and its terrible ripple effects. 
Now, we’ve entered a “tough on crime” era where anything and anyone can be criminalized. Still, there are bipartisan, achievable steps that we can take to make things a little bit better at the state level.
Sandra Keely is the founder of 3 Daughters and 1,000 Sons, a St. Louis organization that runs free legal clinics and connects people with low-cost legal services to get their criminal records expunged. Keely also works on criminal justice reform in Missouri more broadly, inspired by her brother’s incarceration.
“When one person is in jail, the whole family is in jail,” she says.
Keely never went to law school, but she’s an expert in Missouri law. 
“Poverty has its benefits,” she told me of her self-acquired legal education. “Because I had poverty, I couldn’t afford an attorney. I looked for any way to glean information.”
Keely can tell you how to navigate the Missouri court system, specifically, how to represent yourself pro se (that is, without a lawyer). She can tell you how to handle a divorce or real estate issue pro se, but her focus is on criminal justice. Her organization is named for the fact that she’s the mother of three daughters, but also considers herself mother to thousands of men in the criminal justice system. She wants them to have a real chance at a new life when they get out.
Having a record of a conviction, or even an arrest that never led to charges, can keep a person  from finding work, housing or accessing food benefits. Those kinds of obstacles increase recidivism. If you can’t take care of yourself or your family, you’re more likely to commit further crimes, especially crimes of poverty.
Jerika White’s brother was convicted of multiple felonies as a teenager because he was in possession of a gun when his friend shoplifted. White is now the criminal justice policy manager at Empower Missouri, where she leads the campaign to pass Clean Slate legislation, which would automate the process for eligible individuals to have their records expunged. 
Clean Slate has had bipartisan bill sponsors and support. But it hasn’t made it across the finish line in the last several legislative sessions. It’s a pretty small ask — the bill doesn’t expand who is eligible for expungement, a group limited to those who have committed particular non-violent and non-sexual offenses, who have completed their sentences and not re-offended for a set number of years. 
It doesn’t help people whose records are on paper, rather than electronic. It doesn’t help people convicted of multiple felonies, though it’s typical to charge multiple felonies for one incident. 
What the bill would do is take what is already a right on paper in Missouri and make it a reality. There are over half a million Missourians who qualify for expungement under our current law, but only an estimated 1% of them succeed in having their records cleared. The petition process is complicated and lawyers are expensive.  
It makes more sense for the state to use the information it already possesses to automatically clear eligible records than to expect half a million people, many of them living in poverty, to hire lawyers in order to have the second chances they are entitled to under the law.
The only objections to the bill have involved concerns about administrability. This is a concern I take seriously given Missouri’s ongoing failure to administer public benefits in accordance with the law. But the bill that will be re-introduced this session allocates funding for technology upgrades and has generous implementation deadlines.
They teach you in criminal law 101 that there are four reasons we incarcerate people: incapacitation, deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution. We are currently taking people who aren’t dangerous and don’t need to be incapacitated, who have every reason to be deterred by their past excessive punishments, and we are making their rehabilitation impossible. 
The ball and chain that we force formerly incarcerated people who have served their time to carry is ongoing and unjustifiable retribution.
The Brothers Size is not a play about the law. It’s about the bond between siblings. But the plot turns on a brother’s assumption that his former felon brother will not be treated fairly. 
It’s a fair assumption. 
In Missouri, we can take a step towards letting people who have done their time truly have a chance to be free.

(Courtesy of Scott Lopez)With growing energy demands in New Mexico for developments ranging from housing to data centers, a new advocacy group posits nuclear power as a solution.
The New Mexico Nuclear Alliance, a registered trade industry group promoting nuclear power, will make its official debut Friday afternoon before lawmakers at an interim Science, Technology and Telecommunications committee meeting in Las Cruces.
Founder Scott Lopez started the New Mexico Nuclear Alliance in July. A former marine and longtime investor and business consultant, Lopez doesn’t have a background in nuclear power, but says he has “dozens of family members” from his hometown in Española either working or retired from nearby Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Lopez told Source NM he was “driven to start the alliance” after moderating a panel discussion on nuclear power by officials from LANL; Urenco, the uranium processing facility; and Kairos Power, a start-up planning to construct a testing laboratory in Albuquerque, during last May’s two-day New Mexico Energy Policy Symposium.
“We realized there was no trade association, there was not the kind of voice, so to speak, to advocate for work on policy, economic development  for New Mexico’s nuclear industry, which is cradle-to-grave in the life cycle,” Lopez said.
He said the group’s vision is not “big stack Three-Mile Island or or Palo Verde type nuclear reactors,” but smaller reactors that are still in the testing or design process that he hopes will be “commercially viable and available” within a decade.
Lopez said the alliance has no plans to back legislation in the 2026 session. However, he said the group would consider supporting a bill similar to a Colorado law, HB25-1040, signed by Gov. Jared Polis in 2025, which redefines nuclear as a “clean energy resource” because it doesn’t release emissions that drive climate change.
Since the start of the year, the Trump administration has initiated plans to accelerate nuclear power production, and launched proposals to fasttrack new uranium mines in New Mexico, despite roadblocks from states; objections from tribal and environmental groups; and ongoing cleanup for abandoned mines.
Lopez said the New Mexico Nuclear Alliance supports new uranium mining, as long as there’s tribal consultation, but also funding for “funding, monitoring, and long-term reclamation,” from legacy mines. The Nuclear Alliance, he said, has a “moral obligation to acknowledge the legacy,” of uranium mining for nuclear power on New Mexico’s Pueblos and tribes.
“By cleaning up, doing right by our tribal communities that have uranium legacy issues is core to what the Nuclear Alliance believes in and will support,” Lopez said.

(Photo via Google Earth)The administrator of an Iowa nursing home that dumped an alleged rape victim at a homeless shelter after evicting her from the care facility will be allowed to keep her license, a state board has ruled.
State officials say Amanda Nobles, the former administrator of Correctionville Specialty Care, accused the alleged rape victim of paying for sex before the woman was evicted from the home and dropped off at a homeless shelter with no notice and no medical records.
The nursing home employee who the resident accused of rape was the focus of sexual-impropriety complaints at two other Iowa care facilities. He was later convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor in a separate incident.

In July 2025, the Iowa Board of Nursing Home Administrators charged Nobles with violating an unspecified state or federal regulation or law related to practice of the profession of nursing home administration. Recently, Nobles and the board agreed to resolve the disciplinary case with a settlement agreement and final order that doesn’t disclose the nature of any of the alleged violations.
The public order indicates only that while Nobles was working as the nursing home administrator at Dunlap Specialty Care from October 2022 to January 2023, and at Correctionville Specialty Care from August 2023 to November 2023, the facilities were cited for unspecified “deficiencies, some of which were attributable” to Nobles.
As part of the settlement agreement, the board has allowed Nobles to keep her license subject to two years of probation. She will also be required to complete 10 hours of educational training on ethics and nursing home administration.
The agreement notes that Nobles “does not admit to any wrongdoing but agrees to enter into this settlement agreement to avoid the cost and uncertainty of a contested case hearing.”
Alleged rape victim evicted from facility
State inspection records and court filings show that in November 2023, the Correctionville home was cited for an incident in which a female resident of the home alleged that a staff member, Martell Guider, sent her a video of himself masturbating and then sexually assaulted her by forcing her to perform oral sex inside his car in the facility’s parking lot.
Guider was also accused of accepting money from the woman as payment for cigarettes he procured for her.

According to the inspectors’ written reports, the administrator of the home — which would have been Nobles, according to state inspectors and licensing board records — reported that after she saw evidence of the electronic payment from the resident to Guider, she “confronted” the resident and “accused” her of providing sexual favors to the employee in return for cigarettes — an allegation the resident denied.
According to the inspectors, the alleged victim of the sexual assault was “very upset by the allegations,” stating that she “would never do anything so vile.”
After the woman reported the alleged rape, Correctionville Specialty Care evicted the woman from the facility and dropped her off at a homeless shelter with no notice to the shelter and with no medical records, according to state inspectors.
Guider, a state-certified nursing assistant, was fired from the Correctionville home, but state inspectors say the facility’s parent company, Care Initiatives of West Des Moines, continued to provide work for him in other Iowa nursing homes that it operates.
Guider was never criminally charged in the Correctionville case. He was, however, criminally charged for his conduct while working at Kalona’s Pleasantview Home in 2024.
Allegations made at Audubon and Kalona homes
According to police and prosecutors, officials at Pleasantview Home confronted Guider sometime in January 2024 after multiple employees raised concerns that he was being inappropriate with a 17-year-old minor who was present at the home but not a resident.
Police allege that after his supervisors talked to him about the complaints, Guider shared an explicit photo of the minor with his employer. According to the police, Guider had threatened the minor to induce her to send him the photos via the social-messaging platform Snapchat.
Guider was charged with sexual exploitation of a minor by causing the minor to engage in a sex act, sexual exploitation through the use of photographs, possession of material depicting a minor engaged in sex, and first-degree harassment.
A jury convicted Guider of sexual exploitation by causing the minor to engage in a sex act. He was acquitted of the remaining charges and was sentenced to five years of probation.
In April 2023, prior to working at either the Correctionville or Kalona homes, Guider was working at Audubon’s Friendship Home when a female colleague filed a complaint with the state inspections department and police, alleging Guider had been making suggestive remarks to female coworkers, sent them photos of himself masturbating, had recorded video of one worker as she provided care for a resident, and had invited some of his female colleagues out to his car where he kept a bottle of Seagram’s Crown Royal.
Audubon police later acknowledged they didn’t pursue the matter, and the state inspections department acknowledged it rejected the complaint it had received, saying the situation was best addressed by management since it didn’t impact resident care.
Nobles has been an Iowa-licensed nursing home administrator for at least eight years. Some Board of Nursing Home Administrators records indicate she was granted her license in August 2009, while other board records give the date as March 2017.

Greenwood Leflore Hospital, plagued by financial hardship for years, saw a bright spot this spring when it was selected for a new federal payment status. But a dispute with Mississippi Medicaid could jeopardize the public Greenwood hospital’s ability to keep services open if a resolution is not reached, its leader says. 
“Access to services will be reduced for residents of the central Delta region,” Interim CEO Gary Marchand told Mississippi Today. He said no decisions about service changes have been made yet. 
The Mississippi Division of Medicaid informed the hospital in June it is recouping $5.5 million overpaid last year to Greenwood Leflore Hospital in state-directed payments, Marchand said. These amounts beef up low Medicaid reimbursements. The payments were high because they were calculated using old data, which did not take into account the hospital shuttering its labor and delivery and intensive care units in 2022. 
The amount is not insignificant. The hospital’s total operating expenses were $74.7 million in the 2023 fiscal year, according to an audit performed that year. 
Mississippi Medicaid has withheld $2 million so far this year and will continue recovering payments at a rate of $900,000 a quarter beginning in December, Marchand wrote in an Oct. 20 memo sent to hospital employees and board members. 
“Supplemental payments withheld to date along with the scheduled quarterly Recoupments will place a significant strain on hospital operations,” Marchand warned. 
Additionally, the hospital’s Medicaid tax assessments should have been lower to reflect the reduced service levels, which could have offset about half of the total recoupment, he added.
Greenwood Leflore Hospital proposed several options for repayment to the Division of Medicaid that would buy it time to first begin receiving higher payments for Medicare patients, said the memo. The anticipated larger payments are the result of the hospital’s acceptance to the federal Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program, which allows selected hospitals to be reimbursed based on their actual costs for inpatient care instead of a fixed amount. The higher payments are expected to begin by the end of the year and retroactively reimburse services provided since May 1. 
Next month, the hospital will begin providing skilled nursing care for people recovering after hospital stays, but will not begin receiving the higher payments for these services until late 2026. 
The Division of Medicaid advised the hospital in September that it did not agree with the solutions proposed by the hospital, Marchand said in the memo. On Oct. 9, the hospital appealed the decision and requested an administrative hearing on the matter, which has not yet been scheduled. 
The Division of Medicaid did not respond to a request for comment. 
Greenwood Leflore is one of 30 hospitals overpaid a total of $48 million during the state’s 2024 fiscal year, Marchand said.
Greenwood Mayor Kendrick Cox said he has been working with state and federal lawmakers to resolve the dispute. 
“We desperately need our hospital,” he said. “… There’s a lot of people in our community that aren’t financially able to transport themselves or their relatives to other towns or states for health care services.”  
The state-directed payments helped to stabilize Greenwood Leflore’s finances after it was forced to close valued services. But now, the closure of those services could put others at risk, and the new payment model hasn’t yet provided the relief it’s expected to. 
This is just one piece of what Brock Slabach, chief operations officer of the National Rural Health Association, called the “brutal mix of issues” that rural hospitals, which often have low patient volumes and high overhead costs, face when trying to break even.
“These are different environments than some of our larger, urban facilities,” he said.  
Rural hospitals across the U.S. are struggling. Over half of Mississippi’s rural hospitals are at risk of closure or have experienced losses on services, according to a recent report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform.  
Greenwood Leflore Hospital serves approximately 300,000 patients in the Mississippi Delta, a region of the state with limited access to medical care, according to its website. The 35-bed hospital operates a physician-staffed emergency room and offers general, vascular and outpatient orthopedic surgery, cancer care and a full suite of diagnostic services. 
The hospital has faced a litany of financial challenges over the past several years. Before the COVID-19 pandemic began, the hospital was losing $7 to 9 million a year, Marchand previously told Mississippi Today.
The pandemic only worsened the hospital’s precarious financial condition. To keep its doors open, the hospital shut down departments and clinics, went up for lease multiple times, drew down millions of dollars in credit, applied for grants from the state Legislature, and pursued a more lucrative hospital designation. In 2023, the hospital suspended the use of 173 beds to control costs, according to an audit. 
Marchand, who will step down at the end of the year, repeatedly warned local leaders and state lawmakers that the hospital was on the verge of closure. 
To become more financially secure, the facility vied in 2023 to be designated a critical access hospital. These facilities are reimbursed by Medicare at a rate of 101%, theoretically allowing for a 1% profit. But its initial application was denied because critical access hospitals must be located 35 miles from the nearest hospital, and South Sunflower County Hospital in Indianola is closer, at 28 miles away. 
Greenwood Leflore was one of three hospitals in the state chosen for the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program in April. 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson called the designation a “meaningful victory” in a statement.

“For far too long, rural hospitals have operated at a disadvantage, being underfunded, understaffed, and overburdened,” he wrote. “This program is a step toward leveling the playing field.” 
The program’s payment model can help stabilize rural hospitals, but it only increases reimbursements for inpatient care — even though many hospitals are seeing higher outpatient volumes, said Slabach.
And the reimbursement challenges rural hospitals face are worsened by workforce shortages, since rural hospitals often have to offer higher pay to attract providers — money they don’t have due to low reimbursement rates.
“It’s a vicious circle,” Slabach said. 
State-directed payments like those recouped from Greenwood Leflore Hospital, which were championed by Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, have been a vital source of cash for Mississippi’s struggling rural hospitals, especially in a state that has gone a decade without expanding Medicaid.
But those payments are set to be reduced over time beginning in 2028 as a result of federal cuts to Medicaid included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump in July. 
Mississippi is expected to receive at least $500 million over the next five years as a part of a major federal investment meant to offset the cuts’ impact on funding for rural health care. States must submit applications for the funding to the federal government by Nov. 5. 
The funding aims to strengthen access to health care by investing in lasting improvements to preventive medicine, collaboration between health care facilities, workforce development and innovations in care and technology.
“It could well be a lifeline for a lot of hospitals that are struggling,” said Harold Miller, the director of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.
But the money is a one-time, lump sum of money, and there is no telling how states will choose to spend it or if it will go to struggling rural hospitals, he said. 
Reeves is responsible for the state’s one-time application for the funding, which is due in less than two weeks.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/06091022/3-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-24 14:04:34.086817

(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)Louisiana political leaders are preparing to use around $150 million monthly in state funding to help continue food assistance benefits while the federal government shutdown in Washington D.C. continues, Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said Friday. 

“I mean, it’s a choice between using money that we have or people going hungry,” Henry said in an interview. “That’s why we have the fund balances that we have.” 

Gov. Jeff Landry issued an executive order Friday helping the state to cover the costs of food assistance for most, but not all, of the people enrolled in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, for a short period of time. Legislators also plan to approve an “urgent request” that will allow state money to be released for the program next week. 

Landry’s order is more restrictive than what Henry said lawmakers are willing to support. It only extends benefits to children, elderly and disabled people – but not other adults in the program – for a short period of time, from Nov. 1-4.  

The legislators want to preserve SNAP benefits for everyone who is already enrolled in the program for multiple months if necessary, according to the Senate President. 
In Louisiana, 793,000 people receive SNAP benefits that help them purchase food every month. Landry’s executive order only covers 565,000 of those people. 

Henry said it’s not clear yet whether the state will be able to find enough money in the short term to avoid a break in benefits for everyone who receives SNAP assistance, but that is the goal of the legislative leaders.
A priority is to ensure seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in the program – and receive their benefits on the first of the month before others – see no delay, he said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

Louisiana will be paying for the food assistance to continue, even if the federal government doesn’t reimburse the state for its missed months of service. Henry said it could require the state to dip into its savings accounts, and he added Republicans and Democrats have agreed they are willing to do so. 

“We are sending a clear message that the people of Louisiana are the priority,” said Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, head of the Senate Democratic Caucus, agreeing with Henry. 

The House will vote on the urgent request Friday and the Senate will take it up on Wednesday, Henry said.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld the disbarment Friday of a former Dodge County Attorney who was convicted of misusing his authority, three drunken offenses and found to have stalked the boyfriend of his estranged wife.
Oliver Glass, who resigned as Dodge County Attorney in 2021 after 10 years in office, had argued that the permanent loss of his license to practice law was excessive. Glass admitted that he had violated his oath of office and rules as a practicing attorney but sought a suspension of his license and the opportunity to practice law eventually.
But the Supreme Court, in its ruling, upheld the recommendation of the Counsel for Discipline that Glass lose his license.
The court pointed out that lawyers who are in public office are held to a higher standard than attorneys in private practice and that Glass had a third drunken driving offense in July 2024 while on probation for misusing his office.
His case generated several stories in the Omaha World-Herald, and his legal and drinking problems were detailed in the court’s order on Friday.
In 2018, his wife filed for a legal separation. Glass, upon learning that she was dating another man in 2020, looked up the boyfriend’s criminal record in a national database that is supposed to be used only for official law enforcement purposes.
Glass enlisted other attorneys in his office and local law enforcement personnel to also look up the boyfriend’s record. Glass also began surveilling the homes of the boyfriend and his estranged wife and sending threatening social media messages to the boyfriend.
In 2021, Glass resigned from office after a second DUI arrest, and his law license was suspended — a suspension that remained in effect into 2025. In addition, he was indicted by federal prosecutors for cyberstalking the ex-wife’s boyfriend.
He struck a plea bargain and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in federal court, which resulted in a 9 month prison term as well as supervised release. Prosecutors noted that the “weaponization of law enforcement and criminal investigations for personal benefit” by Glass had undermined “respect for the law.”
The Supreme Court, in a 13-page opinion, said the case generated negative publicity for the practice of law and “endangered public confidence in the legal profession and the justice system.”
The court agreed with a referee’s conclusion that there was a need to deter other attorneys from similar conduct and that a permanent disbarment was warranted.

The State Elections Enforcement Commission voted this week to refer two recent complaints about Castillo to state prosecutors for potential criminal charges.
The complaints were filed by Jazmin Cooper, who is the daughter of Bridgeport city councilwoman Eneida Martinez, and they accused Castillo and three other political operatives of “manipulating voters” and illegally taking possession of absentee ballots, which is a felony in Connecticut. 
Cooper, who is deeply involved in Bridgeport’s politics, accused Castillo of taking possession of a voter’s absentee ballot at the Crescent Crossings housing complex, and she alleged that she personally witnessed Castillo stuff several absentee ballots into the front pocket of his hooded sweatshirt at the Harborview Towers, another public housing facility, on Oct. 11.
“I personally watched and recorded Alfredo stuff ballots in his sweater,” Cooper wrote. “He then disposed of them then came back at night to finish his job of [harvesting] ballots from voters.”
“He was going to units and sending them down to their mailbox to retrieve their ballots, had them sign and he did the rest,” Cooper wrote. 
Cooper also accused Castillo, who previously worked for Park City Communities, Bridgeport’s public housing authority, of using an old badge in order to gain access to the public housing facilities and its residents. 
“Alfredo Castillo has been using his housing authority HUD badge from years ago … and using it to impersonate a HUD worker,” one complaint said.
Cooper provided state officials with videos and photographs of Castillo outside the public housing facilities with a sweatshirt on, but the images don’t show Castillo handling ballots.
Castillo, who is already facing more than 30 criminal charges involving abuse of the state’s absentee ballot system during Bridgeport’s 2019 and 2023 elections, declined through his attorney to comment on the latest complaints.
Meanwhile, some of the other political operatives whom Cooper accused of assisting Castillo denied that they ever interacted with voters at the Crescent Crossings and Harborview Towers.
Tony Barr, who is the chairman of Bridgeport’s New Movement Party, said he did go to Harborview Towers, but he said it was to meet up with a friend.
And Wilfredo Martinez, the chairman of Bridgeport’s Independent Party, who is running for a city council seat, said he had never even been to the Crescent Crossings property.
“If they want to waste their time filing SEEC complaints, they can,” Martinez said. 
Ismael Sanchez, the fourth political operative named in the complaint, could not be reached for comment.
The new election complaints highlight the combative nature of Bridgeport’s municipal politics, even during off-year election years when there isn’t a citywide race for mayor.
This year’s general election in Bridgeport features several races for city council as well as a referendum on whether the city should change its charter to eliminate the local sheriff offices and allow the mayor to appoint the town and city clerk.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)A heavy hitter in municipal financing has been tapped to help close the sale of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital.
The Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corp., the quasi-public agency issuing the debt on behalf of buyer The Centurion Foundation, brought on Bank of America this week to co-manage the bond sale, according to Christopher Hunter, an agency spokesperson. The update was first reported by WPRI-TV 12.
Centurion, an Atlanta-based nonprofit, has struggled to lure investors to back the $150 million in taxable and tax-exempt bonds needed to buy the pair of safety-net urban hospitals. Already, Rhode Island Attorney Peter Neronha, who reviewed the transaction under the state’s Hospital Conversations Act, has eased up on the conditions imposed on the deal four times to make it easier for Centurion to finalize its purchase. 
As the nation’s largest underwriter of municipal bonds, Bank of America was brought on to assist Barclay’s, the existing bond underwriter, to market the bonds to inventors, Hunter told the Rhode Island Current in a text message Thursday night. And, now the bond will move from a limited public offering to private placement, a move that further limits the investor pool but avoids more stringent federal registration and regulation requirements.
“A private placement will allow additional flexibility in marketing and selling the bonds to a group of highly specialized investors,” Hunter said.
Bank of America was one of eight companies that responded to the Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corp’s request for proposals seeking manager and co-manager for Centurion’s bond financing, according to Oct. 16, 2024 meeting minutes. Barclays, another respondent, was chosen as the senior manager for the bond issue at the same meeting, while an option for a co-manager was deferred, with the agency’s executive director empowered to make a decision. 
Hunter said Friday that identities of the other companies that submitted proposals could not be shared without a formal public records request. Rhode Island Current submitted the records request Friday morning.
Executive Director Dylan Zelazo told the board at its meeting on Thursday that he had brought on Bank of America to serve as co-senior managing underwriter for the bonds. There was no discussion of the decision, Hunter said. A recording of the meeting was not immediately available.
A spokesperson for Bank of America’s Global Markets segment, which oversees municipal banking and investments, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment.
The bonds were previously scheduled to close by Oct. 31, after multiple delays and changes to the terms of the transaction. Now, that deadline has been pushed back, although a new date has not been set, Otis Brown, a spokesperson for CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, Centurion’s Rhode Island subsidiary, said in an email Friday morning.
“Centurion’s commitment to complete the sale has not changed,” Brown said.
Nor have the underlying financial and economic factors that are making it difficult to sell the bonds in the first place.
S&P Global Ratings Agency noted “significant uncertainty” in the financial and operational performance of Centurion’s bonds in a March 25 ratings assessment, giving the bonds a BB- rating which denotes relatively high-risk for a non-investment grade bond. The rating was affirmed by S&P in August.
The unfavorable credit assessment largely reflects the status of the hospitals’ current owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January. The LA-based hospital chain operator’s mismanagement of its hospitals is well-documented, largely attributed to former majority stakeholder Leonard Green, a private equity that drained the accounts of health care facilities nationwide to pay out investors and executives, according to a U.S. Senate Budget Committee report in January. 
Roger Williams and Fatima remain on the brink, posting a $60 million operating loss for fiscal 2023 with projections for multimillion-dollar losses in fiscal 2024, alongside staffing and equipment shortages and safety problems posed by overdue infrastructure repairs. 
And the bleak financial forecast doesn’t account for federal spending cuts, which are expected to hurt hospitals nationwide by reducing Medicaid enrollment and curtailing state aid and tax breaks.
Yet proponents of the sale insist Centurion is the only hope for keeping the critical health care services from closing — an outcome that would add even more strain to the state’s fragile health care landscape.
The two hospitals in Providence and North Providence, with 500 beds between them, account for more than 50,000 emergency room visits per year. Together they have 104 beds for behavioral health patients, representing more than 20% of behavioral health beds available statewide, and employ 2,700 people.
“The Attorney General understands that Centurion continues to work to close the deal, but believes that it must happen very soon to ensure that the plan endorsed by the bankruptcy court is not upended,” Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said in an emailed response Friday.
The return to nonprofit status under Centurion could let hospitals recoup donations given to a charitable foundation formerly tied to the facilities. Earlier this month, CharterCARE Health asked the similarly named, but distinct, Chartercare Foundation for a “return” of donations that were intended to support the hospitals. The two entities were initially linked, but separated in 2014 when Prospect bought the hospitals, shifting them from nonprofits to for-profit entities no longer able to accept tax-exempt charitable foundations. 
Paula Iacono, the executive director for Chartercare Foundation, said previously that the foundation’s board of directors would consider the request at an unscheduled time. Iacono did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.

Connecticut relies entirely on imported natural gas because the state has no natural gas reserves or production. 
Connecticut’s electric power sector alone used a record amount of natural gas in 2023, accounting for nearly 60% of total state generation.
Nearly all natural gas consumed in Connecticut comes from out-of-state sources, primarily the Appalachian region, including Pennsylvania, as well as the U.S. Gulf Coast, Canada, and the Mid-Continent region. The gas enters the state through three main interstate pipeline systems: Algonquin, Iroquois, and Tennessee, with almost all supplies passing through New York before reaching Connecticut. 
Local utilities, including Connecticut Natural Gas, Southern Connecticut Gas, and Eversource, distribute the fuel to homes, businesses, and power plants via over 60 city gate stations. The state also lacks underground storage, relying on nearby states to meet peak winter demand, making imported natural gas critical for Connecticut’s energy needs.

Gretchen Whitmer in the Michigan Court of Claims to argue for the unconstitutionality of a so-called “Pregnancy Exclusion” in state law that determines a person’s right to choose their end-of-life care. 
The lawsuit specifically concerns the Michigan Estates and Protected Individuals Code, which dictates the process for designating a patient advocate, who can determine a person’s medical care if they are not able to do so themselves. However, pregnancy creates an exception to this. 
“A patient advocate cannot make a medical treatment decision under [state law] to withhold or withdraw treatment from a pregnant patient that would result in the pregnant patient’s death,” the statute reads. 
Filed on Thursday, the lawsuit alleges that the statute is a violation of due process rights and of equal protection for pregnant people, as well as freedom of speech rights. 
The lawsuit, filed by Compassion Legal: The End-of-Life Justice Center at Compassion & Choices; If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice; Perkins Coie LLP; and Mogill & Lemanski, PLLC, also argues that this goes against Michigan’s constitutional protections for reproductive freedom, which includes “the right to make and effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy.”
“Denying individuals the right to refuse treatment because they are pregnant is fundamentally at odds with the Michigan Constitution,” said Jess Pezley, senior staff attorney at Compassion Legal, in a press release. 
Stacey LaRouche, a press secretary for Whitmer, wrote to the Advance in response to the suit, “Governor Whitmer has been a champion for reproductive freedom, and led the fight to protect and expand our rights following the repeal of Roe v. Wade, when other states did nothing. We cannot comment on pending litigation, but will be following this closely.”
Dr. Viktoria Koskenoja, an Emergency Medicine Physician in Skandia, Mich., and her husband, Sam Holcomb, are both plaintiffs in the case. Koskenoja designated Holcomb as her patient advocate, should she ever not be capable of making her own medical decisions — and included directions around potential pregnancy in her guidance to him. 
“I made the decision to include them anyway because I felt so strongly that my ability to control my own medical care shouldn’t depend on my pregnancy status,” she said in the press release, despite her lawyer encouraging her not to. 
“When I agreed to become my wife’s patient advocate, I made a commitment to speak for her if she could not speak for herself, and honor her most personal decisions,” Holcomb added.
The lawsuit has been assigned to Michigan Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel, who earlier this year struck down Michigan’s mandatory 24-hour waiting period for receiving abortions.

They added that Abrego Garcia, who has a wife and family in Maryland, has not expressed fear of being removed to Liberia.“Although Petitioner has identified more than twenty countries that he purports to fear would persecute or torture him if he were removed there, Liberia is not on that list,” according to the filing.Abrego Garcia’s attorneys in his Maryland case could not be immediately reached for comment.The new filing comes shortly after attorneys for Abrego Garcia in a separate case in Tennessee this week requested to subpoena Trump DOJ official Todd Blanche in connection with Abrego Garcia’s claim that his criminal case by the Trump administration is vindictive. That hearing is set to start Nov. 4.Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to those charges, which accuse him of the human trafficking of immigrants in an incident stemming from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Detention challengedAbrego Garcia, whose wrongful deportation cast a spotlight on the president’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is challenging his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal. Abrego Garcia has stated he is willing to be deported to Costa Rica, which has agreed to accept the longtime Maryland man as a refugee. Because Abrego Garcia has deportation protections from his home country of El Salvador, the Trump administration must find a third country that is willing to accept him and a country where Abrego Garcia believes he will not face harm or persecution. The Trump administration so far has floated sending Abrego Garcia to one of three nations in Africa —  Ghana, Eswatini and Uganda.Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis found little evidence the Trump administration has made any effort to remove Abrego Garcia either to the southern African nation of Eswatini or Costa Rica. At that hearing, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys told Xinis they have not received an answer from the federal government as to why officials won’t remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica. Detained in PennsylvaniaXinis is currently mulling whether or not to order the release of Abrego Garcia, who is detained at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Pennsylvania. Any indefinite stay would likely be unconstitutional, per a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that does not allow for immigrants to be detained longer than six months if the federal government is making no efforts to remove them.In March, Abrego Garcia was wrongly deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, where he detailed his experience of psychological and physical torture.",,,,2025-10-24 12:17:05.335891

The hours-long hearing Thursday marked the third meeting for a group of representatives tasked with studying school choice. This refers to a number of policies that provide families more options, in and outside of the public schools system, including using public tax dollars for private schools. State legislative leaders, including House Speaker Jason White, have said expanding school choice will be a top issue in the coming legislative session.
Mid-South Association of Independent Schools (MAIS) Executive Director Brett Donahoe spoke and answered questions from legislators during a meeting of the Education Freedom Select Committee at the State Capitol, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025 in Jackson. Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today
The first speaker, Barrett Donahoe, executive director of the Mid-South Association of Independent Schools, said repeatedly at the meeting that private schools would not make their students take state assessments, nor would they change their faith-based curriculum or their ability to turn some students away, even if the schools were to take state money through school-choice programs. 
It’s a popular argument among school-choice opponents — that voucher programs would allow private schools to accept tax dollars without being held to the same standards as public schools. But Donahoe did little to rebut it, instead doubling down on his stance.  
When Rep. Greg Holloway, a Democrat from Hazlehurst, questioned his logic, Donohoe replied, “I don’t think we have to compromise anything. I think our schools do a good job.”

Many lawmakers were curious about accountability standards for private schools. Donahoe said that, mostly, private schools are held accountable by parents who pay tuition, typically between $7,200 and $7,500 a year. 
Other representatives were less skeptical about private-school accountability.
“I don’t want to force our Christian schools to teach secular curriculum,” said Rep. Jansen Owen, a Republican from Poplarville and co-chair of the select committee, after the meeting. ”I don’t want the state’s involvement to infringe on that in any way.”
Owen and Donahoe suggested that private schools serve many low-income students, but data says otherwise. In 2016, just 8% of private school students lived in poor households, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
Donahoe predicted that if school choice laws are passed, private schools wouldn’t get an influx of students, calling it a “false narrative” perpetuated by opponents of the choice policies.  
It’s true that in other states, a majority of school-choice vouchers went to children who were already enrolled in private school, and school-choice programs don’t necessarily make private schools more accessible for low-income students or students with disabilities. 
Next, officials from the Mississippi High School Athletics and Activities Association told lawmakers that expanded school-choice policies would “completely upset” the competitive balance of high school sports and activities. 
“There’s no doubt in my mind we’re going to have movement based on academic needs, but I promise that the vast majority of our movement will be because of athletics,” said Chad Harrison, president of the association. 
He encouraged lawmakers to consider allowing MHSAA to maintain its eligibility rules for students. That means if a student living in one district transfers into another district, they wouldn’t immediately be eligible to play sports. 
Owen said the association’s concerns were addressed in a bill that failed last session, and they’d likely be able to find a compromise this year. 
Mary Werner, a Mississippi Board of Education member, and Sam Duell from yes. every kid., a pro-school choice advocacy organization funded by the Koch brothers, concluded the meeting. 
Werner, who said she wasn’t speaking to the committee on behalf of the board, suggested establishing a lottery would be the most equitable school-choice solution. 
Duell presented a number of polls and surveys that showed parent satisfaction is higher when they get to make choices about their child’s education.
House Education Chairman Rob Roberson, a Republican from Starkville, said the select committee on school choice would likely meet again once or twice before the legislative session begins in January.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/23165817/Education-Freedom-Select-Committee-1.jpg,,,2025-10-24 11:59:39.338975

Kansas officials have refused to turn over the data because of concerns it would be a privacy violation. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A California judge said states suing the federal government over demands for food program data are likely to win their claims and ruled program funding must continue while the case progresses. 
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and Department for Children and Families Secretary Laura Howard have been criticized and sued by state Republican leaders for refusing to turn over Supplemental and Nutrition Assistance Program data, potentially causing the USDA to withhold $10 million in administrative costs. The state has appealed that decision.
Although Kansas didn’t join the national lawsuit, state leaders are watching the outcome, as it may support their reasons for refusing to yield to USDA demands. 
A spokeswoman for the governor’s office said it wouldn’t comment about ongoing litigation.  
In a 25-page order filed last week, U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney considered the arguments of 21 states and the District of Columbia that have signed onto the lawsuit. 
The national case was filed in the Northern District of California in July, outlining why states believe the federal request for personal data of SNAP recipients and applicants violates privacy rules. 
Plaintiff states are likely to establish that they are not required by SNAP Act provisions to provide data and “consequently, have shown a likelihood of success on their claim that USDA, in demanding such data, acted in a manner contrary to law,” Chesney wrote.
To determine her ruling on the injunction, Chesney considered multiple factors, including whether the plaintiffs are likely to succeed based on case merits and whether they are likely to suffer irreparable harm.  
Howard told Kansas Reflector the state is concerned that turning over private data before the California lawsuit is settled could put the state at risk. 
“I honestly believe that if I were to release that data, then the courts find in favor of the states, then I’m putting the state at liability for releasing the personal information of more than 700,000 Kansans,” she said. 
At least 27 Republican-led states have turned over the data requested, according to NPR, while most the states resisting the USDA demands are led by Democrats.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Laura-Howard-20250820_135927-1024x661.jpg,,,2025-10-24 11:59:39.338975

The Iowa Board of Chiropractic recently charged licensee Ryan Bowman with violating the provisions of the Iowa law dealing with chiropractors’ health care agreements with patients.
The charges state that Bowman “specifically” violated Chapter 135N.1(2) of the Code of Iowa, which outlines more than a dozen different requirements for such agreements. The board has not publicly disclosed which of those requirements it feels Bowman failed to meet.

In its final order sanctioning Bowman, the board also says its “investigation revealed concerns about proper licensure” of Bowman’s staff, but the order does not identify those concerns or the staff.
To resolve the case, Bowman and the board have agreed to a settlement that requires Bowman to comply with the law, complete six hours of educational training on documentation, and, within three months, provide a copy of his chiropractic assistant’s certification.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)A second Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Maine dropped out of the race to endorse Gov. Janet Mills — but this time because of controversial past remarks from popular political newcomer Graham Platner. 
Daira Smith-Rodriguez, a union member and U.S. Air Force civilian contracting officer, announced Friday that she ended her bid. 
“As a survivor of military sexual assault, I cannot, in good conscience, indicate support or remain silent if there is even a possibility that someone who questions the reality of this crisis could be elevated to the United States Senate,” Smith-Rodriguez wrote in a statement on her website.
In Reddit posts from 2013, Platner downplayed the challenges service members face in reporting sexual assault and suggested people wouldn’t get raped if they weren’t inebriated around people they didn’t feel comfortable with, as the Washington Post first reported.
In one post, Platner wrote, “In today’s current climate, when every whisper of a misplaced hand brings down a feature length film, anyone who actually thinks the military is purposefully covering up rape to save the career of some god damn [captain], is clearly both an idiot and junior enough in rank or life experience to think it matters.”
Platner has disavowed the comments, telling The Post, “I don’t want people to judge me off the dumbest thing I said on the internet 12 years ago.”
Unearthed Reddit comments present first stumble in Platner’s rise

But given these past remarks, Smith-Rodriguez said that Platner’s candidacy poses “too great a risk to those who still need a voice to fight for them” and for that reason she’ll be backing Mills, who she said has a record of “courage, conviction, and an unrelenting drive to deliver results for all Mainers.” 
Dan Kleban, co-founder of Maine Beer Company, also suspended his campaign shortly after Mills entered the race earlier this month and subsequently endorsed her.
With the June 2026 primary still months away, it’s to be seen whether Mainers agree, though the first public polling on the Senate race shows apparent continued support for Platner over Mills. 
The survey captured responses while some of Platner’s past comments were being made public, but more controversies have surfaced since, including his now-covered Nazi-linked tattoo. 
Smith-Rodriguez’s exit from the race comes days after another Democratic Senate candidate Jordan Wood, a former congressional aide, called for Platner to drop out because of revelations about his past. 
In an interview with Maine Morning Star on Friday, Wood — the only gay candidate in the Senate race — doubled down on that call in light of additional comments reported by The Advocate on Wednesday that revealed Platner had a pattern of homophobic language and rhetoric that mocked or demeaned LGBTQ+ people in more recent Reddit posts, between 2016 and 2021. 
“Today I find that stuff abhorrent,” Platner told The Advocate. “And I am sorry that I ever used it.”
Wood said he finds how recent and prolonged these comments were to be alarming and questions how voters can trust that Platner is telling the truth today. 
Wood also worries about such remarks giving license to use homophobic language or symbols that indicate violence, which he said “is something that Donald Trump has really eroded for our country.” In Wood’s view, the worst thing the Democratic Party can do “in the opposition to Donald Trump is somehow give permission to looking lightly on what I believe are both offensive and threatening symbols and words.”
Where Smith-Rodriguez and Wood diverge is on whether a crowded primary will be beneficial as Democrats try to unseat long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. 
“It has become clear that Republicans are eager to see a crowded Democratic primary that divides our voices and strengthens theirs,” Smith-Rodriguez wrote Friday in her statement ending her candidacy. “I will not allow that to happen.”
Wood, who is staying in the race, said he consistently hears from Mainers at town halls that they want a primary process that affords them the opportunity to weigh in on who the best Democratic candidate is to put up against Collins. 
“Keep in mind that we have ranked-choice voting,” Wood added, which will allow Mainers to rank candidates in order of preference rather than choosing just one. “So Daira’s comments about exiting the race, I view it less of a problem because of how ranked-choice plays out.”

The governorship and all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]Early in-person voting in New Jersey’s gubernatorial and Assembly elections begins Saturday.
New Jersey’s 21 counties will stand up 173 polling stations where voters can cast machine ballots ahead of Election Day. They are open between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., or 6 p.m. on Sundays.
The state’s early-voting period runs through Nov. 2. Voters can cast ballots at any early polling station in their home county.
New Jersey’s leading gubernatorial candidates, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) and former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (R), are set to be busy this weekend.
Ciattarelli is holding a bevy of early voting rallies in North Jersey, including one in Clifton where he will be joined by Puerto Rico Governor Jenniffer González Colón. He is also hosting a tele-rally Friday night with President Donald Trump.
Sherrill is doing much the same, though with a focus on turnout in Camden and Middlesex counties. She will get a boost from some other prominent Democratic officials. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro will stump for her at a rally in Monroe Saturday, and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly will join her at a Blackwood rally later that day.
All 80 Assembly seats are also on the ballot this year.
See a list of early voting centers
Nearly 1.2 million residents cast early in-person ballots in last year’s general election, smashing turnout records and pulling past mail-voting turnout that had, until then, accounted for an overwhelming share of New Jersey’s pre-Election Day voting.
New Jersey law requires the state to reimburse counties for early voting expenses for up to five, seven, or 10 early polling sites, depending on a county’s number of registered voters, and counties are required to set up at least three, five, or seven sites, depending on their size.
Three counties — Hudson, Essex, and Union — have opted to erect more early polling stations than will be reimbursed by the state this year. Essex and Union counties will each have 11 early polling stations, while Hudson will have 34.
The 173 early polling stations set a new record for the state. Last year, counties had a total of 168 early voting sites.

The national movement is aimed at safely disposing of medicines that, in the wrong hands, could be dangerous. In April, during the last campaign, Kentucky collected 9,843 pounds of unused prescription drugs, according to Gov. Andy Beshear’s office. 
“Safely disposing of prescription drugs means we can create safe spaces for those in recovery,” Van Ingram, the executive director of the Office of Drug Control Policy, said in a statement. “Only together can we keep reducing overdose deaths and support treatment resources, and National Prescription Drug Take Back Day can be the first step for so many. If you or a loved one need help now, know there are resources out there for you to get help today.”
People who cannot make it to a drop-off location Saturday can do so year-round at Kentucky’s 200 permanent drug disposal locations in 87 counties. 
“One life lost to a drug overdose is one too many, and we have to do everything in our power to keep our loved ones safe and get them into recovery,” Beshear said in a statement. “National Prescription Drug Take Back Day is just one way we can make sure drugs are disposed of properly and prevent drug abuse, and I encourage every single Kentuckian with out-of-date or unused prescription drugs to take part.”

‘Use caution, no matter what’ 
Putting drug paraphernalia and nonprescription drugs in the hands of researchers can also reveal public health risks, a recent announcement showed.  
New testing of discarded syringes in Fayette County revealed substances that warrant community caution, the University of Kentucky’s Harm Reduction Hub and Lexington recovery organization Voices of Hope announced this month. 
Jimmy Chadwell, the president of Voices of Hope, said these substances aren’t new to Kentucky but they are new to Fayette County. And while the discovery is not necessarily an emergency, there are always risks involved when people are in active-use addiction, he said. 
“I think that people should always use caution, no matter what,” Chadwell said. 
The University of Kentucky’s Harm Reduction Hub recently started testing syringes from various communities, Chadwell said, to see how many different chemicals are in them. Any concerning results are then shared with the county where those syringes came from, he said. 
Chadwell did not have the specific location the recent batch — the largest tested yet — came from, but did say they were all from people who inject drugs in Fayette County. He also did not know how many syringes were tested. 
The substances found in a large batch of recently-tested used syringes from Fayette County include carfentanil, xylazine, medetomidine and BTMPS (a plasticizer) — which are linked to overdoses, severe wounds and medical complications, according to Voices of Hope. 
According to the organization: 

Carfentanil is an extremely potent fentanyl analog that may not always be detected by fentanyl test strips, greatly increasing overdose risk. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, carfentanil is “10,000 times more potent than morphine.” 
Xylazine is a veterinary sedative associated with severe skin wounds and tissue damage.
Medetomidine is a veterinary tranquilizer similar to xylazine, linked to rapid-onset
withdrawal symptoms requiring medical care.
BTMPS is a plasticizer used in the manufacture of plastics, which in animal studies has been associated with heart and lung damage and sudden death.

Kentuckians should take a few precautions, Chadwell said, to keep themselves and others safe. They include:

Never use alone. 
Always have Narcan available, which is available for free at a variety of places across Kentucky. 
Learn how to provide rescue breathing. 
Several organizations, including Voices of Hope, also provide free fentanyl test strips. Voices of Hope, located at 644 North Broadway in Lexington, also has  xylazine test strips and is working to get medetomidine test strips, Chadwell said.  

Chadwell compared Narcan to a “fire extinguisher.” 
“We don’t have a fire extinguisher in our office in hopes that a fire breaks out, but we have one just in case it breaks out,” he said. “It doesn’t mean I’m going to go start a fire and then put it out if I have a fire extinguisher. Same concept with Narcan. Even if you’re someone that’s never used drugs, you don’t even know anyone that used drugs, you can be an innocent bystander and see someone overdosing and have that and be able to respond.” 
Anyone needing recovery support in the Lexington area can reach out to Voices of Hope, Chadwell said. Call 859-303-7671, email info@voicesofhopelex.org, visit 644 N. Broadway or go to the website at www.voicesofhopelex.org. 
“We want to get the education out there,” Chadwell said. “It’s not necessarily that it’s so much more dangerous than it was a few weeks ago. It’s just another reminder there are new substances — and new substances we haven’t detected yet can also come around. If they do, we’ll be sure to let the public know.”

(Screenshot: FDA)A UNC researcher says the United States has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to informing consumers about the potential health risks of products they’re buying. 
Depictions of smoking-related health problems, including images of rotting teeth and tumors, are printed on cigarette packs sold in Canada. And inside, explicit health warnings are printed on each cigarette. 
Food product labels in most Latin American countries are on the front of packages and say whether they are high in salt, sugar or saturated fat. 
The U.S. is behind other countries in requiring easy to understand nutrition and warning labels that draw consumers’ attention, said Marissa Hall, a UNC-Chapel Hill behavioral scientist. 
“Warning labels are a surprisingly powerful tool for changing behavior when they are well-designed,” Hall said Thursday. Labels with icons or graphics are the most effective, she said. 
Hall gave a talk about useful labels on alcohol, tobacco and food as one of the recipients of a campus award recognizing achievements of junior faculty. 
As it happens, the United States is in the midst of a long process of updating its rules for tobacco labels to include graphic images and health warnings on packages and cartons of cigarettes. Tobacco companies have sued to stop the federal Food and Drug Administration rule, and litigation is ongoing. 
Studies have found that graphic cigarette package warnings help people quit smoking, she said. Other studies have found that graphic tobacco labels could avert thousands of deaths in the US over time. 
The FDA has also proposed a rule that would require packaged foods to have nutrition labels printed on the front, with information whether salt, sugar and saturated fat content is low, medium or high. 
Labels are important because they deliver information to consumers right when they need it, Hall said. It’s also important to get the labeling right, because weak labels are hard to change. 
Hall and a colleague created UNC Mini Mart, a research space that looks like a convenience store. One UNC Mini Mart study found parents were less likely to purchase sugary drinks for their children when the bottles had pictorial warnings about heart damage and type-2 diabetes.
Marissa Hall, behavioral scientist at UNC Chapel Hill, Oct. 23, 2025 (Photo: Screenshot)
Hall also said the U.S.’s required warning label on alcohol hasn’t changed since 1989, leaving plenty of opportunities for upgrades. 
Alcohol warning labels don’t follow best practices, she said. They’re on the back or side of the package, they’re long, hard to read messages with no images or icons. 
In a recent study that’s under review, researchers found that fewer than one-third of people who drink alcohol said they read the warning in the previous three months, Hall said. Only 4% were able to remember all five topics in the warning. 
Researchers are in the middle of a study where people bring their own alcohol containers to the study office to have more prominent labels attached to the front. People in the control group will have a barcode attached. 
“Ultimately, this will provide some of the strongest evidence of whether or not these new evidence-based warning labels would reduce drinking,” she said. 
In an interview, Hall said it’s a step forward for the FDA to require nutrition labels on the front of packaged foods, but the label design is not ideal. 
There’s evidence that people struggle to interpret numbers, she said. The proposed labeling would not include icons, images, or anything that conveys a warning. 
“It’s a missed opportunity to signal something in a different way,” she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-23-at-10.19.38-PM-1024x251.png,,,2025-10-24 11:22:53.346796

Changes to the program, made under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, take effect Nov. 1. Signed into law in July, the act cuts $168 billion of federal funding for SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, over the next decade. 
A recent report from DataHaven found that thousands of Connecticut residents will entirely lose coverage or see major monthly reductions in SNAP benefits.
[SNAP benefits poised to stop Nov. 1 despite CT hopes to continue]
Overall, Connecticut residents will receive $11 million to $15 million less in food assistance each month.
In Connecticut, Hartford, New Haven, Waterbury and Bridgeport will be hit the hardest, with thousands of SNAP recipients in each city losing at least $25 a month in benefits (both the Urban Institute and DataHaven used this threshold to focus only on families receiving substantial benefits).
Hartford is projected to receive between $1.2 million and $1.6 million less in SNAP benefits each month. New Haven, Waterbury and Bridgeport could see between $900,000 and $1.2 to $1.3 million less a month.
About 11% of Connecticut residents live below the federal poverty line but account for 41% of all SNAP recipients, according to DataHaven.
Before the new rules, adults without disabilities or without young dependents had to either work 80 hours a month or meet an exemption in order to receive SNAP benefits. The bill expands work requirements and removes numerous exemptions including ones for veterans, people aged 55 to 64, young adults 18 to 25 who aged out of foster care, homeless people and parents of children 14 to 17.
Additionally, noncitizen lawful immigrant groups such as asylum seekers and refugees will no longer qualify for SNAP benefits.
According to the Urban Institute, evidence shows that work requirements decrease SNAP benefits but don’t increase work or wages.
“People in every corner of our state are being crushed by the cost of living, and as this data shows, federal SNAP changes are only going to make that worse,” Meghan Holden, the director of marketing and communications for The Connecticut Project Action Fund said in an Oct. 20 DataHaven media advisory. “Right now, 58,000 Connecticut households are at risk of losing an average of $194 per month in SNAP benefits. That money is the difference between a child going to bed with an empty belly or full, between a veteran eating one meal a day or three, between hunger and survival.”
[Which CT social services could the government shutdown affect?]
Changes to the program also include stricter cost-of-living adjustments to the Thrifty Food Plan, which determines the cost of a nutritious and balanced meal. The plan serves as the basis for the maximum amount of money put into SNAP, but under the changes, reevaluation for the costs of a meal will be less frequent and cost-neutral, or will only take into account inflation.
Historically, SNAP benefits have not fully covered a “modestly-priced meal” as determined by the TFP, according to data from the Urban Institute. The DataHaven report found that major cost disparities exist between modestly-priced meals and the maximum SNAP benefits currently distributed in Connecticut, especially in the Western Connecticut Planning Region.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)The first legal challenge to North Carolina’s new congressional district lines came quickly. 
One day after the legislature approved a plan to change the 1st Congressional District from purple to red, voters have already told federal judges they want to contest it. 
The 1st District is already part of an unresolved lawsuit over racial gerrymandering. Some of the voters who brought that suit have asked the court to add the plan for the new district to it. 
The new district lines adopted this week dismantle a bloc of Black voters that has helped send a Black Democrat to Congress since 1992. 
North Carolina Republicans who redrew the lines this week said they were answering a call from President Donald Trump to increase GOP membership in the US House in next year’s election. Republicans have a thin majority in the House and could face losing it in the midterm election. 
The redrawn map would change the state’s congressional delegation from 10 Republicans and four Democrats to 11 Republicans and three Democrats. The Triangle and Charlotte would have the remaining Democratic districts. 
Republicans maintained they did not use racial data in redrawing the 1st District, but the amended complaint filed Thursday in the ongoing lawsuit said the new district violates the federal Voting Rights Act and the Constitution. 
The district as it was drawn for last year’s election is part of a federal lawsuit covering congressional and state Senate districts. It’s this lawsuit the voters want to update with a challenge to the new district. 
A three-judge panel heard arguments in the case this summer but has not issued a ruling. 
On Wednesday, the judges ordered lawyers to file briefs by Monday addressing what the new district lines mean for the existing case. 
Republican legislative leaders did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new challenge.
The 1st District has played an outsized role in the state’s civil rights history, the amended court complaint says. The district has elected a Black representative since 1992, when Eva Clayton became the first Black candidate since 1898 to win a U.S. House seat from North Carolina. US Rep. Don Davis narrowly won reelection to a second term in 2024. 
The new district boundaries dilute Black voting power in both the 1st District and the 3rd District, the complaint says, making it unlikely that Black residents will be able to elect the candidate of their choice in either of them. 
“Whatever the General Assembly’s partisan aims, they have—once again—chosen to target Black neighborhoods and communities to achieve them,” the complaint says. 
Also on Thursday, lawyers with the nonprofit group Forward Justice said they plan to sue over the new district, but they have not yet filed that suit.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4810-scaled-e1761277055148-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-10-24 11:00:24.867424

(Getty Images)Georgia’s SNAP administrators say they would need more than $60 million from state coffers to maintain their level of staffing after next year’s federal cuts to the program that more than one in 10 Georgians use for groceries.
The news from the agency that oversees the food stamp program comes after Republican Gov. Brian Kemp ordered state agencies not to ask for more money for their budgets. It also illustrates the difficulty that state agencies are facing with disruptions in federal funding.
The funding need was flagged in a form that the Department of Human Services sent to the governor’s budget office. The agency also informed its board of the funding need in September.


Shutdown means no aid in Georgia
SNAP recipients face a threat closer than next year: Georgia won’t send out November SNAP benefits unless the federal government reopens. Asked about contingency plans, Kemp’s office blamed minority-party Democrats for the federal shutdown. Georgia SNAP administrators say they have asked the state’s payment vendor for a plan on how quickly they can issue benefits once the shutdown ends.


Yet in compliance with Kemp’s budget instructions, the DHS did not make a formal request for more money in its full, formal budget request to the governor’s office.
Agency spokesperson Ellen Brown told The Current in an e-mail that “We continue to work closely with (The Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget) to determine any needs that may fall outside the parameters of the overall budget instructions.”
The governor’s office did not respond to written questions about whether he will consider the funding boost needed for the SNAP program, or his considerations as his office prepares spending plans. “The budget development process is still ongoing and our full recommendation will be released at a later time,” a spokesman wrote.
Kemp’s spending recommendations are expected in early January and his staff are already working on spending plans that will cover Oct. 1, 2026, when SNAP cuts passed in the Republican federal spending and tax law known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act cuts go into effect.
Georgia Budget and Policy Institute graphic
The cuts will decrease funding for state staff salaries who administer the food stamp programs from 75% to half. The amount necessary to fill that gap is about $62 million per year, according to early projections by DHS.
The new federal budget guidelines have rewritten multiple rules and procedures in the SNAP program. States must implement work requirement rules by Nov. 1 for working-age able-bodied people without dependents. Georgia also must pay a greater share of the salaries for staff working to upgrade the software system which determines eligibility for residents in the state. New rules mean that the federal government may withhold some federal funding from states that make too many payment errors in their SNAP programs.

Savannah state Senator Ben Watson, a Republican, will oversee the discussions about the SNAP program as the chair of the budgeting subcommittee that oversees the Georgia Department of Human Services.
In an interview with The Current GA, Watson said it’s a long time until the legislative session starts and the situation is fluid in Washington, D.C.
He said the federal government may yet look at things like the definition of the federal poverty level or at tax credits for low-income households.
Watson said the state will look at whether Georgia’s SNAP program might be “tightened up.”
“So will Georgia be a leader in this and see if we can make some exciting change? We’ll see,” Watson said.
All Democrats in Congress and a few Republicans voted against the federal tax and spending law passed last summer. Georgia’s delegation split on party lines.
The Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, an Atlanta-based nonprofit, notes that small towns and rural areas such as McIntosh County, tend to have higher SNAP utilization than the state average, and that their residents have the most to lose if Georgia decreases funding or changes eligibility to make it harder to get into the program.
States are still trying to assess all the impacts of the federal funding cuts, and are awaiting federal guidance from Washington, D.C. about how the changes will affect social safety net programs and state administration of those programs.
Much of any upheaval in the budget cuts will be faced by the new Georgia governor who will be elected next November. Kemp, who is limited to two terms in office, will be stepping down in January 2027.
Brown, the DHS spokeswoman, said that her agency remains committed to the best customer service for Georgians in need of such aid.
“We’re always focused on cutting down application and renewal processing times for the average SNAP recipient through better customer service and technology,” Brown wrote.

The minimum wage in the state is adjusted annually based on increases in the cost of living, as measured by the consumer price index published by the U.S. Department of Labor. South Dakota implements the annual increase due to a citizen-initiated ballot measure passed by voters in 2014.
The minimum wage for tipped employees will be $5.925 per hour effective Jan. 1, which is half the minimum wage for non-tipped employees. Wages and tips combined must equal at least the minimum wage.
These increases will apply to all South Dakota employers, with some limited exceptions. For more information, visit dlr.sd.gov/employment_laws/minimum_wage.aspx.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Relax. It’s just a “public education campaign.” 
That’s how some construction-related unions innocently describe how they’ll spend the million dollars they say they’ve raised to help pass the film tax credit bill state lawmakers are poised to consider in a special legislative session.
The unions’ money isn’t meant to be spent on next year’s election campaigns, Vince Saavedra with the Southern Nevada Building Trades Unions recently told the Nevada Independent.
That must be reassuring to state legislators who might be on a ballot next year. They’re free to vote their conscience without fear of deep-pocketed special interests air- and cyber-bombing attack ads on them.
Unless of course the unions change their mind.
During the regular legislative session earlier this year, by the slimmest of margins, the state Assembly approved granting $1.4 billion in tax credits to the film industry. The movie and video corporations in turn would sell the credits at a discount to taxpaying Nevada companies, which in turn would get a tax break as a result of buying the credits, all of which would deprive the state of $1.4 billion that would otherwise be spent on legitimate public expenses like schools and health care and public safety.
However, the state Senate failed to pass the measure, perhaps only because it ran out of time. 
The film tax credit won’t be on a special session agenda unless Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is sure it has enough votes to pass.
That means Lombardo, along with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and Democratic Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, need to know which way all the legislators will vote before Lombardo can even call the special session.
Hence the urgency of unions bragging about a million-dollar war chest. 
Which they say won’t spend on next year’s election campaigns. 
But they could change their mind.
Maybe they already did.
The federal government shutdown casts uncertainty on a lot of things, and the timing of a legislative special session is one of them. But if rumblings within the Nevada political-media-industrial complex are on the mark, and hold, the special session would be in mid-November, which is coming up fast. Lombardo and legislative leaders need head counts sooner rather than later.
Meanwhile, another leader of the coalition of construction industry unions pushing the plan, Tommy White with Laborers Local 872, told the Associated Press the group’s million dollars would be spent on TV and digital ads and mailers.
And yet has anybody seen any evidence — million-dollar evidence, to be specific — of a “public education campaign” from the unions in support of the movie studio giveaway bill?
Perhaps a skeptic, or a state legislator, can be forgiven for suspecting the million bucks isn’t for public education, but being brandished as a threat to spend heavily against noncompliant legislators next year.
Diversifying with the stars
Along with “because we said so” and “or else,” the film tax credit’s evangelizers insist Nevada politicians should hand out public money to movie studios because doing so will somehow magically transform Southern Nevada’s economy and prosperity will rain down on everyone.
The unions’ argument starts with the claim that the film tax credits will mean 19,000 construction jobs.
That estimate is from an analysis commissioned by the movie studios that stand to receive the $1.4 billion in public handouts and that, ably guided by Howard Hughes Holdings, have been leading about half of Nevada’s state-level politicians around by the nose for at least the last three years.
Yet even that project-friendly analysis estimates a much more modest 12,643 “direct” construction jobs, “or 1,580 jobs per year.”
It also estimates about 9,300 direct non-construction jobs “at stabilization,” less than 6,000 of which would be employed by “motion picture and video industries.”
The Las Vegas area workforce is currently about 1,140,000 strong. If a Nevada economic development plan attracted 6,000 highly trained scientific and technical research and development professionals and about 10,000 additional scientific and technical support jobs centered around a complex of research laboratories packed with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of sophisticated equipment, that might diversify the Las Vegas metro area’s economy a little. 
Another 6,000 people in the entertainment industry, eh, not so much. 
And in a workforce the size of Southern Nevada’s, “1,580 jobs per year” in impermanant construction work isn’t economic diversification. It’s another day that ends in y.
Beyond film and construction work, the bulk of the rest of the employment associated with the tax credits would be in retail, hotels, food service, and office services. In other words, more of the same.
And that’s from a report paid for by the film studios who are trying to make the project look good.
The state’s publicly funded economic development agencies charged with diversifying the economy may want to shop around. For $1.4 billion, we can probably do better.
The deciders
To reiterate, the Assembly already passed the studio handout bill and could be expected to do so again. 
So if there is enough resistance to make Lombardo stop pretending a film tax credits scheme warrants a special legislative session, the state Senate is where it’s at. And, to reiterate, the state Senate has never voted on it.
There are 21 Nevada state senators. Eleven of their seats are up next year: 

SD2: Edgar Flores, D
SD8: Marilyn Dondero Loop, D
SD9: Melanie Schieble, D
SD10: Fabian Donate, D
SD12: Julie Pazina, D
SD13: Skip Daly, D
SD14: Ira Hansen, R
SD16: Lisa Krasner, R
SD 17: Robin Titus, R
SD20: Jeff Stone, R
SD21: James Ohrenschall, D

Some of these people have announced they’re seeking reelection, some haven’t. But these are the people most likely to be the targets of the construction unions’ “public education campaign.”
One of them, Robin Titus, is the leader of state Senate Republicans. She also declared earlier this week that she’s a hard no on the studio bill. (This thing has always been a Democratic scheme.)
And one additional Democratic state senator will be on the ballot next year, in the primary and, she hopes, the general election. Cannizzaro, the Senate majority leader, is running for attorney general. She’s also recently declared full-throated support for the film tax credit scheme. It looks like the unions’ “public education campaign” already worked on her.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC06367-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 11:00:24.867424

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem will hold a press conference Friday afternoon to “discuss ICE operations and update on the Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement operations in the Twin Cities,” according to a media advisory that has circulated on social media.
Protests are expected in the Twin Cities on Friday, organized by groups that oppose the agenda of President Donald Trump.
Noem was the governor of South Dakota until Trump appointed her as the head of the Department of Homeland Security, where she is the face of Trump’s campaign to deport immigrants by the millions. (Longtime Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski, however, has been described as the “shadow secretary” by DHS staff, NY Mag reports.)
Under Noem, DHS has bucked precedent by requesting troves of personal data from states and other federal agencies to assist in deportation efforts; arresting people at courthouses; sending immigrants to countries they have no ties to and in some cases known for human rights abuses; and ignoring court orders.
On Trump’s orders, DHS has sent hundreds of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into American cities, where they have been accused of detaining people without due process, including at least 170 citizens. 
The media advisory provides no details of the contents of Noem’s “update.” But it comes amid the DHS’s push to send crews of ICE agents into blue cities — in some cases accompanied by the National Guard — and reports that ICE is in talks with private prison company CoreCivic to reopen a defunct Appleton prison as a 1,600-bed immigration detention center.
Protests are expected outside the federal Whipple Building Friday afternoon.

That high-court ruling is back in the spotlight after the arrests on Thursday of more than 30 people, including an NBA player and coach, in two cases alleging sprawling criminal schemes to rake in millions by rigging sports bets and poker games involving Mafia families.
What did the Supreme Court decide?
The court’s ruling struck down a 1992 federal law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, that had barred betting on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states.
Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion that the way Congress went about the gambling ban, barring states from authorizing sports betting, violated the Constitution’s Tenth Amendment, which protects the power of states.
“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” Alito wrote. The court’s “job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not.”
The trouble with the law, Alito explained, was that Congress did not make betting on sports a federal crime. Instead, it prohibited states from authorizing legalized gambling, improperly infringing on their authority. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy, Neil Gorsuch and Elena Kagan joined Alito’s opinion.
Dissenting justices said the court should have acted more narrowly
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that even if the part of the law regulating the states’ behavior should be struck down, the rest of it should have survived. In particular, Ginsburg wrote that a separate provision that applied to private parties and betting schemes should have been left in place.
Writing for Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer, Ginsburg said that when a portion of a law violates the Constitution, the court “ordinarily engages in a salvage rather than a demolition operation,” preserving what it can. She said that instead of using a “scalpel to trim the statute” her colleagues used “an axe.” Breyer agreed with the majority that part of the law must be struck down but said that should not have doomed the rest of the law.
But Alito, in his majority opinion, wrote that Congress did not contemplate treating the two provisions separately.
Opponents of gambling warned about corruption
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, a former college and NBA star, was a sponsor of the law that he said was needed to protect against “the dangers of sports betting.”
All four major U.S. professional sports leagues and the NCAA had urged the court to uphold the federal law, saying a gambling expansion would hurt the integrity of their games. They also said that with legal sports betting in the United States, they’d have to spend a lot more money monitoring betting patterns and investigating suspicious activity.
The Trump administration also called for the law to be upheld.
Alito acknowledged in his majority opinion “the legalization of sports gambling is a controversial subject,” in part for its potential to “corrupt professional and college sports.”
He included references to the “Black Sox Scandal,” the fixing of the 1919 World Series by members of the Chicago White Sox, and the point-shaving scandal of the early 1950s that rocked college basketball.
But ultimately, he wrote, Congress couldn’t require states to keep sports gambling prohibitions in place.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25135471977857-1024x702.jpg,,,2025-10-24 13:02:05.368922

(Nathaniel Herz/KYUK and Northern Journal)A note from Northern Journal publisher and KYUK collaborator Nathaniel Herz:
Here’s a second piece from Jeron Joseph, a resident of the Western Alaska village of Kwigillingok who was forced to evacuate after a remnant typhoon flooded his village and destroyed some 35% of its buildings. The storm caused significant damage in more than a dozen villages in the region, and this week, President Donald Trump approved a federal disaster declaration in response.
In his first piece, Jeron, 30, whose Yup’ik name is Anguterayak, recounted his harrowing departure from his home amid rising floodwaters, and his evacuation from Kwigillingok by military helicopter to the Western Alaska regional hub town of Bethel. 
In this new account, he describes his flight from Bethel to Anchorage in a military transport plane, reuniting with his friends, family, and dog, and the early stages of settling into an environment that feels deeply foreign even if it’s within the same state. 
A few facts about Jeron that are worth keeping in mind as you try to grasp the new reality for him and hundreds of other evacuees: He rarely left Kwigillingok, known as Kwig — just for things like medical appointments and getting his state-issued identification renewed. All of those trips were to Bethel; the only other place in Alaska that he’s been is a town in the southeast part of the state, where his aunt brought him to visit a relative as a teenager. And he’s never had a driver’s license, never having needed one in Kwig. 
A night in Bethel
To begin with: I have been hearing many things about the first article, and I and many people from my community are so overwhelmed by the support, the love, and the messages — the well-wishes of strength and welfare that are being sent our way. We couldn’t be happier for those messages.
To begin where I left off: After we were dropped off by the helicopter in Bethel, we were hosted for the night there by one of my aunt’s nieces. I had a humorous exchange with her niece, where she almost tripped on one of my bags — I said to her, ‘It would be funny if, after all this, you were the one who got hurt.’
We spent a lot of the night catching up. We talked about the things we wished we would have brought with us, including sentimental items. The following morning, we were taken back to the hangar where we’d initially landed, so that we could take the morning flight to Anchorage. When we got there, we had some exchanges with friends and family, and it felt like this was the first time we were truly away from home. Up to that point, it just felt like we were passing by. That moment in the hangar where we saw a lot of our community members truly felt like going away.
Getting on the transport plane
They began boarding us onto that big C-17. None of us in the village had ever seen very large planes like that, and we were enthralled by the breadth of the plane.
Walking towards the loading bay on the tarmac, I would describe it as my own version of crossing the River Styx. As much as I wanted to, I didn’t look back at the hangar. I didn’t look back at the hangar because I knew I was going to start crying. My thought was that this is going to be the first day of the rest of our lives.

They began loading us onto the plane. A few elders sat in chairs along the walls, but the rest of us, they sat us down on the floor, row by row, no seats, no cushions. We all had to sit down as they strapped very long individual straps to each row of passengers that were supposed to act as seatbelts, but I’m fairly certain are for securing cargo.
We took off, and everyone who wasn’t in the chairs during that ascent, a lot of us had to hold on to that strap because we were sliding back, feeling like we were going to fall. There were exclamations of surprise among the passengers.
I don’t know if it was because of the exhaustion following what happened, but during the pressure changes, I had to do some mental gymnastics and really try to get a hold of my focus and my breathing so I wouldn’t pass out, because I was very close on a number of times during that flight.
My brother was also on the flight — I had texted him a message asking him to maintain eye contact with me so that my focus would have an anchor point, to keep me from passing out. Maybe two-thirds of the way into the flight, I had to break out a classic Barbra Streisand movie, the 60’s Technicolor gem “Funny Girl,” on my phone, because I have memories of watching that as a young adult. I couldn’t hear it because of the flight, but I was able to recite along in my mind because I listened to and watched it so much. That was able to calm me down.
Landing in Anchorage
I had gotten maybe 15 minutes into the movie when we began descending, and I could feel the pressure changes. All over again, I had to re-strategize my breathing. When we landed, I felt another moment of relief, and I embraced my aunt. There was applause among the passengers, cheering the landing. I was glad that that experience was over. My aunt described as being ‘crammed together like sardines.’

At the military base where we landed, they lined everyone from the plane up to get into a shuttle so that we could go back to the shelter at the Egan Center. I started seeing sights that I hadn’t seen since I was a teenager.
Growing up in the flat, watery plain of the Kuskokwim Delta all my life, I had forgotten about how imposing the urban structures and the trees are — because the sky at home is totally open. Maybe folks here think that the sky is pretty open already in some places. But at home, it always felt like a planetarium without an edge. I remember winter nights where I would stargaze and I could see the entire sky, horizon to horizon, and just lie down there admiring the beauty.
Trees are beautiful. Mountains are beautiful. The city skyline is beautiful. I love admiring it all, but I just miss the beauty I used to see.
Being here inland, now, of course, I don’t dislike it. But it just feels like I’m an ant at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, and I have imposing structures all around me: trees, buildings, and mountains, all appearing to look down on me, and that certainly takes adjusting.

After landing, I’ve been experiencing the feeling of a whole new world where convenience is king. With our subsistence lifestyle, the relationship that we have with our resources is that they’ve always been rare and precious, and very tasty.
I don’t mean to disparage, but it feels like, here, everything’s so disposable. And I notice a mental complex where you can get everything at the snap of a finger. It creates this sort of detachment with resources, and it boggles me to see people wasting food and water, because that would actually be seen as a petrifying offense in the villages. That’s something that I might have to adjust to. Everybody is so nice and accommodating, but it’s still an adjustment.
Another thing that bewilders me, being before these palaces of convenience, is that, despite all that people have, they still plan for more. My assumption when I thought about this was, ‘Maybe there’s a brand of competitiveness here that makes people feel this way.’ Who could’ve put that feeling there? And why?
I’d like to say that when we were in our village, it felt like that was the entire world. That kind of insularity, though it may seem ignorant to some, is something that led to another feeling. It felt like we already had the world. That feeling created a neighborliness that is nigh unmatchable.
Reuniting with friends and family
At the Egan Center, where we were dropped off, we sat in the dining area and came across several of our friends and family who had also decided to come to Anchorage. I hadn’t realized this about other people’s faces until then, but it turns out that they can act as an anchor and a port for our emotions and feelings of home. Seeing those faces certainly eased the feeling of a whole new world.
We were talking amongst ourselves. We were talking about how we all missed our home, and a lot of us had gasped and ran up to other people we knew, being so grateful for each others’ safety. One of the ones that affected me the most, though, was seeing my own mom, who had been outside the village when the storm hit.

On the helicopter ride to Bethel, she had FaceTimed me and my family members, and we had all cried then. Thinking of the first time we’d be seeing each other in a new world, while saying goodbye to the place most precious to us that was in view of the helicopter window. How we wanted our feet to touch that ground one last time. When she saw us at the Egan Center, I was overwhelmed with another wave of tears.
The structures may be gone. Our home might have been declared unlivable. But I have the greatest assurance now that the people and the voices are still here. Those people and those voices that we have been through so much with, and that will go through so much more — through strangeness, through a lack of familiarity, and having to navigate a whole new concrete jungle. We’re still here.
After spending so much time talking and reuniting, my aunt and I were met by a relative who’d come to pick us up. We waited for our luggage. Then we were told it might not get there today. My aunt and I sighed, and then the relative took us to his home where we’d be staying, and he showed us around.
Getting settled
A number of things struck me as odd. The first was probably fences. I go back to how open everything feels in the tundra. Having to grasp property lines and stuff like that — of course, we want to be respectful, but it’s just still another new thing for us to adjust to.
We had the nicest time being able to settle ourselves in that relative’s home, but it was still hard. We could have been given the most comfortable parachute in the world, but it still wouldn’t be enough to alleviate our grief.
I had another moment of my own grief when I went out onto the deck and started crying again, because everything inside the house reminded me in some way of my home. That moment was actually catalyzed by seeing a towel rack that those relatives had brought back from the village. I hadn’t seen that towel rack since I was a child.
My aunt came out to the deck, and she had to console me for five minutes. I said to her, ‘Everything inside reminds me of home.’ And she said, ‘You’re crying. I know you’re hurting. But this is a whole new world for us, and you have to say goodbye and thank you to those times. We can’t get them back, but we’ll be able to make new ones when we can.’

I got inside to the room where they set me up. I didn’t have a change of clothes, other than some sweats that we had taken from the clothing drive at the Egan Center. Putting those clothes on made me realize how so many of us are so close to losing the things we’ve become accustomed to — the roof over your head, the clothes you wear, the food and water that are given to you. Being in that room and having no stuff gave me a whole new appreciation for the things that I used to enjoy in my little cave of a room at home.
The next day, or the day after that, we got our luggage, and we felt like we had gotten pieces of ourselves back. I know I mentioned my computer before — I got that, too. I set it up, I turned it on, and I was relieved to see that it still works. When I saw that my sheet music was still playable, that brought another whole new wave of relief, because I didn’t want to lose all of those years’ worth of work.
Finding friends and relatives
Someone I spoke to about the kinds of things I took from home — they thought it was interesting that I’d bring a dog and a computer. I told them, ‘I wanted to pack the village, but the luggage fee would’ve been disastrous.’
And I really wanted to. How I wanted to. But the more time we spent flying, the less we expected to see familiar faces, or familiar voices, in the place where we landed. Fellow Yup’iks who speak our language, Know our humor.
But my aunt and I were pleasantly surprised across these days of adjustment — meetings happened at the most unexpected times. You’re doing something mundane or habitual while out doing errands when out of the blue, a face from home or from neighboring villages surprises us. I’ve lost count of the number of times we’ve said or heard: ‘Aaah! Oh my gosh, haven’t seen you! My name’s…’ And they’d tell us their Yup’ik names and how we’re related to them or their friends.
These exchanges validate what we’re feeling, what we miss. If you can’t picture what it feels like, imagine you’re in the most foreign, alien, nowherest nowhere you can think of, out of the States. Then you take a wrong turn, and there’s that Starbucks in the middle of nowhere. That’s how I would describe it.
A blanket for my soul
One specific meeting I experienced was just like this, though it wasn’t a surprise. My childhood best friend moved out of our village when we were in middle school. I texted him that I was in town, though I wished it was under better circumstances. He’d said something like, ‘Oh my gosh, where!!??’ I told him, and he said he was coming as soon as he could. I waited. I waited. I kept asking where he was. He told me to hold my pantaloons. He’s coming.
I saw a newspaper dispenser on the way to meet him. The image on the newspaper was of a helicopter. You can imagine what I was thinking then, and what I was feeling. I wished he was here. I wished it was now. I didn’t want to have to cry before I cried meeting him.
We met in an indoor space, and I saw his back where he was seated in a waiting area. My heart felt like it was about to jump out of my mouth and meet him before the rest of my body. I sprinted up to him. He heard me, he turned around, and I embraced him. He hung on to me. I smiled so much I could feel it in my ears. Years and years of anticipation dropped when we hugged in that waiting area. He whispered a little friendly joke in my ear, ‘Your shoes were squishing.’ I chuckled, and I cried tears of joy.
For the eight or so hours after we met, we literally didn’t stop talking — about my experience, our boyhood memories, and our inside jokes with our immediate friend group. He took me to his place and he started making salmon soup. Wild caught. Here was a whole new world before me, and I was freaking out over Yup’ik soup. Homestyle, for us. Having that bowl of salmon soup was like a blanket for my soul, made from the feeling of home. I relished each spoonful, slowly, not knowing when I’d have it again.

Picking up the dog
Going back to the day when we evacuated from Kwig on the chopper — I’m still raw thinking about this. We were told that the last kennel plane was full, and that my dog, my Jack Russell terrier, had to go on the next one. The thing was, the next kennel plane was scheduled for the day after we left.
You might be able to imagine the hole in my heart that that development bore into me. Nearly in tears, I walked up to the reception area at the school that served as the village shelter and asked who I could entrust my dog to. I was pointed to an overseer who we knew we could depend on. I was given every guarantee that my dog would be okay, but be that as it may, I still wasn’t certain in my heart that she would come.
When it came time to take our bags and ourselves to the fourwheeler and its trailer to head to the helicopter, my heart sank. I knew what else I was going to leave behind, but to leave my dog, even temporarily? I felt guilt, shame, and sadness. That she couldn’t understand we’d get her back.
The fourwheeler started rolling toward the village airstrip, and she started whining. I started crying. I cried all the way there. When we got to the airstrip, my brother had to embrace me as I cried loudly into his ear. Every turn brought back memories of the village, my family, my friends, and my dog. And losing my dog from my sight as she disappeared further from the horizon just rendered me into pieces.
Fast forward to the evening of the reunion with my friend, we were informed that our dog made it to a cargo depot. When I heard, I felt like a little boy who’s going to see his dog for the first time in weeks or months.
I could not sit still for the entire drive over. I kept talking to my aunt about some of the things my dog used to do, and also some of the things that we’d have to do, like getting nail clippers and a brush for her. And of course, she’s going to have to be housebroken in a whole new way, and mind her manners.

There was a little confusion at the cargo depot. We spent probably 10 or 15 minutes knocking on all the doors, and we were about to leave when we got a text saying we should bang harder. But before we could bang on the gate again, it opened and we saw our dog, Maundy. I named her after a dog who had died, as it is Yup’ik tradition to name a baby after someone who has recently passed. Though Maundy’s namesake, my mother’s dog, had passed before I could remember.
I walked up to her. I was so happy. I was flooded with memories of her, and how much of a little fussy brat she is sometimes. But I still love her. And this time, when she whined when she came back to us, I felt lifted up onto cloud nine.
As we’d gotten out of the storm and were settling in at our relative’s place, it had felt like we were on a merry-go-round for days. Once we had our luggage and our dog, and got to see all the familiar faces, it finally felt like we were able to sit down and just do nothing if we wanted to — which is also a precious thing.
We have a roof, we have our things. We have the things that I now believe we ought to be grateful for, like food and water. And I know I will never not be appreciative of our next meal ever again.
An emotional church service
Some days after we settled in, we had a number of logistical things that we had to do back at the relief center. One of the things that they organized there was a church service that included Yup’ik singers who used to sing in the affected villages.
I was able to get through the opening and the prayer okay. But when they got to the Yup’ik singers and the Yup’ik songs, I was reminded of my grandmother, Lena, whose Yup’ik name was Kayungiar. She used to take me to our Protestant Moravian church at home, where they had open singing.
The church was in the south part of town, which experienced the worst flooding — I don’t know what happened to it, and in some ways that feels worse. I wish I could know now, so that I could at least have some closure for that special place.
I had managed to bring a little Bible that my mom gave me in 2010. Having that additional connection to home, combined with the singing, brought me to tears again.
Some of the members of the congregation came up to me. They wrapped their arms around my shoulders, and they started saying prayers for me. I was so overwhelmed with emotion that I actually had to get out of the service for a little bit, so that I could get my emotional equilibrium back.
There was a member of the Red Cross who asked me if I was okay. I explained my feelings to her. And she said, ‘I know it’s hard. You have so much you miss. But I know you can find some friendly faces here, so that you can make new church memories.’

Another person, in a blue vest, checked up on me as I went to go get some water; she told me she’s from an Episcopalian family on the East Coast, and couldn’t imagine how she’d feel if her own childhood church had been affected. It gave me great comfort to know that there were people who could sympathize with how I was feeling.
I said to the lady from the East Coast that my home is gone, the places I love are gone. But when I look at that church service, I know that the people and the voices are still here. And as far as I know, they will always be here, even if there’d be only one person left.
That is the sort of thing that I choose to think about when I’m in this alien world. For everyone reading, you could be that one person that I talk about. You could be the one to carry our traditions in your heart. You could be the shelter of our way of life. And as long as we have the people, as long as we have our language, I know that that lifestyle and that knowledge will never drift away. Typhoon or not.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A new online statewide directory has been launched to showcase and connect Alaska Native artists across disciplines.
The Alaska Native Arts Directory is the work of the nonprofit Alaska Native Arts Foundation. Listing is free. The directory went live last week, timing that coincided with the Alaska Federation of Natives annual convention in Anchorage.
As of Monday, about 200 artists were listed, most of them with photos and biographical information. The Alaska Native Arts Foundation said it is seeking to expand that number to more than 1,000 by next year.
The Anchorage-based foundation said it also has a goal of holding a first-ever Alaska Native Arts Economic Summit next year, bringing together artists, policymakers and other partners to work on building the Indigenous creative economy.
There are other artists’ directories in Alaska, some of them with a focus on Indigenous artists. One, the Collective49 Marketplace, enables member artists to promote and sell their work online. And there are numerous local artists directories, such as those in Ketchikan and Homer.
The Alaska Natives Art Directory, however, is intended to be more comprehensive. Along with being statewide, the directory includes writers, musicians and other performing artists along with those who create carvings, paintings and other physical works of art. It includes contemporary art forms as well as traditional Indigenous arts.
“The Alaska Native Arts Directory celebrates the full spectrum of Alaska Native creativity, visual and written arts, performance, design, and traditional practices, reflecting the diversity and vitality of Alaska’s Indigenous cultures,” Gail Schubert, chair of the Alaska Native Arts Foundation, said in a statement.
Launch of the Alaska Native Arts Directory represents a renaissance of sorts for the Alaska Native Arts Foundation.
The foundation was created in 2002 and for several years operated an ecommerce site and a gallery in Anchorage. But it shut down those operatioons in 2016 after losing state funding and encountering other financial problems.
The directory project and other new activities now have a variety of funding sources, according to the foundation’s statement. The effort is backed by grants and other support from organizations that include the Rasmuson Foundation, the U.S. Small Business Administration, the office of U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, the Alaska State Council on the Arts and the Municipality of Anchorage, among others, according to the statement.

(Photo courtesy Indiana State Fair Commission)Cindy Hoye, who has led the Indiana State Fair Commission since 2004, will step down in 2026 after a nearly 40-year career with the organization.
In a Thursday announcement, the commission praised Hoye’s “visionary service” and credited her with re-shaping the fairgrounds and state fair “into what (they) are today.”
“(Hoye’s) remarkable tenure leaves behind a legacy of excellence, innovation and unwavering dedication,” the commission said in a social media release. “Thank you, Cindy, for 40 incredible years of leadership and impact!”
Hoye, who became executive director in 2004 after serving 16 years as the commission’s marketing director, said serving as executive director was “an absolute honor and incredible privilege.” 
“With the State Fair’s roots deeply planted in its mission, this place will always hold a special significance for me and most importantly for Hoosiers across the state,” she said in a statement. “I am immensely proud to have worked alongside one of the greatest teams of people you’ll ever encounter. Their sense of pride, purpose, and relentless pursuit of excellence is truly remarkable.”
Hoye added that the State Fairgrounds are “in capable hands, guided by a clear and strategic roadmap for continued success.”
Her tenure is marked by a number of major initiatives and projects. 
Hoye oversaw renovation of the Corteva Coliseum and construction of the Indiana Farm Bureau Fall Creek Pavilion, as well as expansions of 4-H programming, She additionally helped attract high-profile track-and-field events — including the NCAA Division II National Championships, Big Ten Championships and the Hoosier State Relays — to Indianapolis and the fairgrounds campus.
Gov. Mike Braun described Hoye’s tenure as “remarkable” and said she “elevated” the commission.
“Her unwavering commitment to the State of Indiana, to her staff, and to leaving the Fair and Fairgrounds better than she found it, has set a standard of excellence that will continue to guide us for years to come,” the governor said in a statement.
The commission has initiated a search for Hoye’s successor, and she will assist in the transition ahead of her official retirement in March, agency officials said.

Some members of the Parole Working Group established by Gov. Mike Kehoe wanted to require more than the current system, which starts at 15% of a sentence for the lowest-level offenders and peaks at 85% for the most violent. Others urged a system with a standard that would lower the population of Missouri’s prisons — currently about 24,000 — with releases tied to personal growth.
Without agreement, the report highlights that it makes no recommendation on the question, Trevor Foley, director of the Missouri Department of Corrections, said in an interview with The Independent.
“I wanted the governor to understand that this was a big debate and that the working group did not land on consensus here,” Foley said. “Ultimately, (Board of Probation and Parole Chairman Tony Helfrecht) and I determined that any policy to get more people in prison or fewer people in prison wasn’t really the scope of the order.”
The group’s final report lays out how some practices, listed in a departmental policy book, will become formal department rules, and how other rules will be revised or reorganized. It also recommends changes to medical parole and sets a higher bar for decisions to revoke probation and return a person to custody.
It was silent on whether parole policies fixed in state law should be changed because members decided that was outside the scope of their study.

“Prior to doing this, the board could unilaterally alter those guidelines at any time they want,” Foley said of the policies being moved into formal rules. “Now, by moving them into rules, those become an open-forum, public policy debate of what should the minimum percentages be for eligibility or the maximums, or how should it apply to different offenses.”
Critics, both inside and outside the working group, weren’t impressed with the report’s conclusions. 
Newton County Prosecutor Will Lynch said he pushed for a rule requiring every person sentenced to state prison to remain in custody for at least 50% of their term.
“The recommendations and outcomes don’t necessarily fix what I believe is wrong with parole in Missouri,” Lynch said.
Amy Malinowski, Missouri director of the MacArthur Justice Center, said the working group ducked the toughest questions.
“They’re just announcing things that are either already the case or that they’re already required to do,” she said. “And we are supposed to take that as reform.”
Kehoe’s office released the working group’s report on Oct. 3. Both Foley and Helfrecht told The Independent that they believe the final report met the governor’s goal of “promoting consistent and equitable decision-making for parole decisions” and his directive to do so by revising agency rules to provide “clarity, transparency, and accountability for the parole process.”
The new rules must be published in the Missouri Register, which opens a period for public comment and requires legislative review before taking effect. The proposed rules are being reviewed by Kehoe’s office, Foley and Helfrecht said, and will be published when the governor approves them.
Much of the five-page report focuses on how some practices, listed in a departmental policy book, will become formal department rules, and how other rules will be revised or reorganized.
“Prior to doing this, the board could unilaterally alter those guidelines at any time they want,” Foley said. “Now, by moving them into rules, those become an open-forum, public policy debate of what should the minimum percentages be for eligibility or the maximums, or how should it apply to different offenses.”
 Parole eligibility

To determine exactly how much time any person sentenced to a term in a Missouri state prison will serve depends on a number of factors — the level of the offense, whether it is considered a violent crime or dangerous felony, the person’s criminal history and how long they were held before conviction.
Missouri has five levels of felony. Under department rules, non-violent offenders in those classes must serve 15% of their sentence, or just over 12 months of a maximum 7-year term for a Class D felony. 
By statute, the minimum for the same sentence, if the person is being incarcerated for a second time, is 40%, or almost three years. And if it is the fourth time being sent to prison, the minimum is 80%, or five and one-half years.
Foley called Missouri’s criminal sentencing laws “phenomenally complicated” and noted they are “frequently litigated.” 
Some issues aren’t related to how the rules apply but how credit for time served on a sentence is awarded.
Missouri math: How a 23-year sentence adds up to more than 40 years in prison

The department is currently in court over how a records officer calculated that a man with a 23-year sentence must be in custody for 41 years. Deandre Pointer of Kansas City was convicted of first degree murder, second degree murder and two counts of armed criminal action in 2005, receiving consecutive life sentences. 
His sentence was vacated and he was resentenced to 23 years in 2023, but he was given credit for time served only on one of the new terms because his previous sentences were ordered to be served consecutively. Instead of being eligible for release in 2024, he must wait until 2044.
Foley said he could not directly comment because of the litigation, but he defended the work of the records officers and said it complied with the law.
But even simple sentences can be handed down without certainty for any party. During an interview this summer with The Independent, Boone County Circuit Judge Brouck Jacobs, who represented the judiciary in the working group, said he was seeking ways to make sentencing clearer to defendants and crime victims.
“They think somebody’s got seven years for breaking into their home, a burglary,” Jacobs said, “and then I think they’re shocked and chagrined when the person’s out in a year-and-a-half.”
Foley said he thinks the changes will help, but that any significant revision of how sentencing and parole interplay is up to state lawmakers. Determining the parole eligibility date for is a “math problem” where all the variables aren’t known until the person being incarcerated is received by the department, Foley said.
“The goal would be, at the day of sentencing in the courtroom, does every stakeholder understand the implications of that sentence?” Foley said. “Because right now, they don’t.”
 Detailed recommendations

The report isn’t all just reference to revisions to match current practices and reorganization of sections in the Code of State Regulations.
An incarcerated person in a parole hearing will have the ability to bring two representatives of their choice to provide information about rehabilitation efforts or barriers to release.
“That might not sound like a huge deal, but it’s a tough decision for some of these folks to make, who they’re going to have there to represent them,” Helfrecht said. “They can bring up such things as a solid home plan, where they are going to live, their employer and family support. Now they can even have representation.”
Amy Malinowski, director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Missouri office (photo submitted).
Malinowski, however, doesn’t share Helfrecht enthusiasm about that change.
It is “the only sort of substantive change that I saw” related to Kehoe’s stated goals, she said.
“But that’s it,” Malinowski said. “You know, they worked all summer, and this is it.”
Some of the other detailed recommendations would:

Streamline the parole process by foregoing formal hearings for some low-level offenders, who often arrive eligible for parole because of time served in a county jail.
Remove the requirement that a prisoner paroled for medical reasons have a treatment plan in place before being released.
Require allegations of a parole violation such as a new crime to be proven before the Parole Board holds a revocation hearing, and for the board to “only consider revocation when a preponderance of evidence is found regarding new law violations or technical violations associated with community risk.”

The changes to the requirements for medical parole will align the policy with the statute, which does not require a treatment plan as a condition for release, Foley said. Medical parole can be considered for individuals who have a terminal disease, require long-term nursing care or have a health issue that would be made worse by continued incarceration.
While the availability of care will no longer be a factor in the decision, Foley said the situation of the person being considered for parole will be a concern.
The prison population is aging — almost 25% of offenders are older than 50 — and every prison has a nursing unit. Finding a nursing home willing to accept someone released from prison is difficult, Foley said.
“I do think we likely would be concerned about putting forth a medical parole packet to the board when that individual had no place to go,” Foley said. “We’re not interested in people dying homeless on the street.”
One change not reflected in the report is a revised form that will summarize the findings of the three-member parole hearing panel. 
On the current form, when parole is denied, often the only reason provided is that “release at this time would depreciate the seriousness of the present offense…”
The new form shows how the panel evaluated the offense, whether it was violent or sexual in nature and whether drugs were involved. Drug and alcohol history also spills into the person’s time in custody, and whether they have completed substance abuse treatment.
Four categories cover the person’s time in prison and on supervised release previously and with evaluations for conduct violations, program participation and whether the person had new offenses while incarcerated.
The final category is a catch-all for any reason not previously considered, including whether there is community opposition or the person has a stable post-release plan.
Working group member Courtney Everett, coordinator of the St. Louis University Prison Education Program, said in an interview this summer that the form needed revisions to provide more detail.
In an email about the final report, Everett said he was pleased at the openness of others in the 15-member working group, dominated by law enforcement and corrections officials, to consider his recommendations.
“A violent crime will always be violent, so denying a person parole because of the seriousness of their crime is punishing them for issues beyond their control and the opposite of what is best for public safety,” Everett said. “I did bring this up and the group agreed that this is an issue, however I don’t see this mentioned explicitly in the report.”
Helfrecht defended the current form but agreed more information would help document board decisions.
“Whenever we make a decision,” he said, “we make a decision for our offenders, but we also make it for the safety of our communities and our victims.” 
 Hurried process?

In the Jan. 13 executive order establishing the working group, Kehoe set Oct. 1 as the deadline for delivering a report. The panel held one public hearing on June 13 and completed the report on Sept. 18.
But not every member of the working group left the final meeting with the understanding that the report was final. In an email five days before Kehoe released it, Everett said he was expecting a final meeting to go over the report prior to it being delivered.
Secret meetings of parole study group may violate Missouri Sunshine Law

And after it was released, Everett said he had not seen the final version prior to its delivery and noted the cover letter was dated Sept. 19.
“We should have had an opportunity to see the final language before it was submitted to the governor to ensure we were all in agreement,” Everett said. “I don’t know if there would have been any revisions or further discussion, but I think one final round of eyes on the document would have been productive.”
Foley and Helfrecht said they tried to make it clear that the Sept. 18 meeting would be the last.
At the public hearing in June, 14 people signed up to give comments but only three actually spoke, including Malinowski. All other meetings were held in private. While the working group accepted written comments, it took no other public testimony.
“I would have loved for victims of crime to have the opportunity to come in and say, ‘here’s how the current system affected me,’” Lynch said.
Everett also said more public hearings would have helped the working group.
“I feel that everyone tried their best but we could have benefited from more interaction with the people most impacted by our decisions,” he said. “We could have benefited from more than one public hearing and having a research professional in the group would have been an asset.”
The working group did not have to hold any public hearings, Foley and Helfrecht said, because Kehoe directed the working group to include representation of a variety of perspectives.
But they said the lack of feedback at the public hearing, which was scheduled for up to three hours, was a surprise.
“I’ll be honest, we were stunned,” Foley said.
“I wish that meeting would have been longer,” Helfrecht said. “I wish we would have had more speakers.”
A more robust report that met the governor’s goals was possible, Malinowski said. The parole board doesn’t need legislative action to open its hearings to the public, give offenders their case files or change how decisions are stated.
“There is a lot they could have done if they had taken ownership of this opportunity,” she said. “I think they could have done more with the time they had.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Algoa-Correctional-Center-04022025-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-10-24 10:00:53.054680

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)TOPEKA — While Kansas remains one of the last states in the nation without legalized medical or recreational marijuana, THC-infused drinks have evaded scrutiny from officials.
The question of the legality of the drinks came up Thursday at a meeting of a joint legislative committee on security.
Robert Stuart, executive officer for the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, explained to lawmakers that while marijuana is illegal in Kansas, THC-infused beverages are considered hemp products and allowed under the 2018 federal Farm Bill, which legalized cannabis plants containing no more than 0.3% of a plant’s weight in tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Products created using hemp are commonly advertised as Delta 9 items, and they can have a weaker effect than marijuana because of their lower THC content.
Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican from Leavenworth, asked Stuart: “Should we be outlawing it?”
Yes, Stuart said, and he wagered the KBI’s position would be the same.
“If it’s intoxicating, it’s damaging,” he said.
THC drinks are restricted to adults over the age of 21, same as alcoholic beverages.
“You hear all sorts of social arguments and all sorts of different ways of thinking about it,” Stuart said, “but it would be much clearer for any of those distributors, any of those dealers, for any member of the public, to say, OK, this is what’s clearly illegal and clearly what’s not.”
Blurred lines make it difficult for retailers to comply with state laws, for consumers to know the products they purchase are safe and for law enforcement to conduct criminal investigations, Stuart said.
Kansas City, Missouri-based brewer Boulevard Brewing Company announced this month a THC-infused version of its signature Quirk seltzer, which will be called “Berry Jane.” It will be available in two dosages. One containing 5 mg THC and another containing 10 mg, differentiated by a darker can. They are expected to be sold in Kansas and Missouri next month.
The KBI celebrated a major crackdown on THC products earlier this month, raiding 10 storefronts in six cities across the state. KBI director Tony Mattivi said the products were harming Kansas children.
The Kansas House passed a bill legalizing marijuana in 2021, and a special committee crafted recommendations for the Legislature last year, but Republicans have blocked the legislation from progressing.

It’s here and it’s happening. The recent revelations about Republicans “joking” about an affinity for Nazism should wake us up to the reality of the moment. When President Donald Trump says immigrants have “bad genes” and are “poisoning the blood of our country,” he has raised the specter of eugenics that thrived in our country and of course in Germany during the 1930s.  There’s a direct line from this thinking to the Holocaust.
We need look no further than Minnesota for insight into this ugly history. During the early 20th century, Minnesota and many other states passed eugenics laws to support so-called racial purification. Laws in 31 states allowed the sterilization of mentally disabled and “feeble-minded” people, epileptics and more. Minnesota passed a sterilization law in 1925, and more than 2,000 people — mostly women — were sterilized. In California around 20,000 were sterilized from 1917 to 1952.
Through the 1930s, American scientists at the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Lab in New York promoted eugenics and maintained a Eugenics Record Office. David Starr Jordan, who wrote early major works on the fishes of North America and was president of Stanford University, was a white supremacist and supported forced sterilization programs aimed at poor Black, Indigenous and Hispanic women as well as the mentally disabled. 
We know that Charles Lindbergh, the Minnesotan famous for his solo flight across the Atlantic, was a eugenicist and talked of preserving the inheritance of European blood and guarding against its dilution by foreign races. He praised Hitler. Margaret Sanger, who was the first president of Planned Parenthood, was a eugenicist.
The Minnesota Eugenics Society was founded in 1923 by Charles F. Dight, who served as president until his death in 1938. He actively promoted reproduction of the “fit” and race betterment (the State Fair held “fit family” contests). 
During the 1930s, Dight communicated with Hitler, praising him for his plan to “stamp out mental inferiority among the German people” and “advance the eugenics movement.” If carried out effectively, Dight wrote, “it will make him the leader of the greatest national movement for human betterment the world has ever seen.” 
Our country has had a history of restricting immigrants, e.g. the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act that limited immigrants from eastern and southern Europe and Japan. 
Trump castigates immigrants as criminals and insane, even though immigrants have lower crime rates than that of American citizens. 
How could the President release 1,500 convicted insurrectionists yet push to deport immigrants? He’s likely a true believer in the nonsensical race science that was predominant a century ago.  
Episcopal Bishop Mariann Budde, who spent a quarter century in Minnesota, told Trump at the now famous prayer service early this year, “The people who pick our crops and clean our office buildings; who labor in poultry plants and meatpacking plants; who wash the dishes after we eat in restaurants and work the night shifts in hospitals — they may not be citizens or have the proper documentation. But the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals. They pay taxes and are good neighbors.”
Aren’t we all the immigrants or the descendants of immigrants? And don’t we all have defects? 
Let us not forget: We are called to protect the vulnerable, to treat everyone as equals, to “do unto others as we would have them do unto us.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/08-05-Lindbergh-in-Cottonwood-County-1-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-10-24 09:02:46.544809

“Together with Beloit College, we’re shaping a stronger health care workforce for the Midwest and beyond,” said DMU President and CEO Angela Franklin in the release. “This partnership accelerates the pathway to a rewarding career in health care for motivated students who are ready to pursue the education to get there.”
Doctorate programs of osteopathic medicine, podiatric medicine, physical therapy and occupational therapy will guarantee interviews for Beloit students, as well as master’s degrees in physician assistant studies, anatomy and biomedical sciences. The interdisciplinary PhD in biomedical sciences will also have guaranteed interviews, the release stated.
Of the eight programs with guaranteed interviews, the release stated both the doctor of podiatric medicine and doctor of occupational therapy will also reserve one seat each year for a Beloit student.
According to the release, the new partnership “illustrates both institutions’ commitment to improving access to advanced health care education while maintaining academic integrity and student-centered values.” DMU has similar partnerships with Simpson College in Indianola, Benedictine University in Illinois and Voorhees University in South Carolina.
“We are thrilled that this partnership makes pathways into health professions clear for our students,” said Beloit College President Eric Boynton in the release. “Des Moines University has a long history of educating students to treat the body as a whole, and their comprehensive, holistic approach to medicine is an excellent companion to the skills students develop at Beloit College.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-24 13:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Which CT social services could the government shutdown affect?,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/24/ct-social-services-government-shutdown/,Connecticut would feel the effects of a continued shutdown on federally funded programs around nutrition assistance and child care.,"November is a critical month in the federal government shutdown if it drags on for at least a couple of more weeks — and Connecticut would feel the effects across a few federally funded programs, namely around nutrition assistance and child care.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, would temporarily come to a halt starting Nov. 1 in Connecticut and other states. And two local Head Start centers face an imminent funding lapse in federal dollars next month, though at least one confirmed it plans to keep operating through November.
As the shutdown enters its fourth week, the federal workforce has largely felt the brunt of the government’s closure, with furloughed and essential employees starting to miss paychecks. But the pain of a shutdown will be felt more broadly if it stretches into the next month and imperils social services predominantly for lower-income households.
On top of that, open enrollment for health plans on the state’s insurance exchange, Access Health CT, begins on Nov. 1. Enrollees face possible premium hikes in 2026 if federal subsidies aren’t renewed before then. The expiration of those subsidies and their future are at the heart of the shutdown fight in Congress.
Of the federal programs that could face significant disruptions or cuts in the coming month, SNAP would take the biggest hit, unless the Trump administration can find a way to keep it going. Connecticut Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal joined other colleagues in a letter urging the USDA to use its contingency fund to pay out November benefits for SNAP.
But other benefits supported by federal dollars remain more in limbo or largely unaffected in the near term. The state said it has enough resources to keep the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program afloat for at least another month.
For Head Start, two programs in Connecticut won’t receive new federal grants expected on Nov. 1 if a shutdown persists. The state is looking for ways to temporarily support them, though exact plans haven’t been finalized.
The culmination of these funding cliffs on Nov. 1 could be a pressure point to jumpstart talks, but meaningful negotiations between the two parties have yet to come to fruition. The shutdown is currently the second longest in U.S. history.
More than three weeks into the shutdown, there has been little to no movement on reopening the government. Democrats are still pressing for extending the expiring health care subsidies in order to secure their votes, while Republicans say the issue should be dealt with separately and shouldn’t be attached to a funding bill.
The Senate has taken a dozen votes on the Republicans’ bill to fund the government through Nov. 21, but enough Democrats have opposed that bill to block it from advancing, including both of Connecticut’s U.S. senators. Meanwhile, the House has been out of session since late September since passing the short-term funding bill, referred to as a continuing resolution.
That standstill in Congress has officials and advocates in the state awaiting some of the toughest cuts so far. And while Connecticut will not feel the full force of shutdown disruptions next month, the state will inevitably face additional funding issues in a long-term scenario.
“As we stare down the barrel of this Nov. 1 date, to me, the fact that the House isn’t even in session tells me that here at the food bank, we have to be prepared for no SNAP on Nov. 1,” Jason Jakubowski, Connecticut Foodshare president and CEO, said.
Nutrition assistance
If SNAP pauses on Nov. 1, about 360,000 beneficiaries in Connecticut will not receive their monthly benefits for November and won’t be able to use their existing balances until a shutdown ends.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture sent states a recent memo warning “there will be insufficient funds to pay full November … benefits.” The federal guidance directs states to effectively shut down the Electronic Benefit Transfer or EBT cards. Benefits are loaded onto those cards, which are used by beneficiaries to help purchase groceries.
The lack of access to benefits, however, would be temporary. Recipients won’t lose any benefits currently stored on their EBT cards, according to guidance from the state Department of Social Services. But because of the uncertainty around the government reopening, DSS is recommending people spend the balances on their cards by Oct. 31. 
By November, the EBT cards are expected to shut off. Once the shutdown ends, recipients will regain access to the benefits that remain on their cards.
Connecticut distributes about $75 million per month in federal SNAP benefits, with many households receiving about $190. The federal government covers the costs of SNAP benefits, while it splits the administrative expenses evenly with the state, though that funding structure is subject to change in the future due to reforms in President Donald J. Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
Officials are looking into possible state interventions, but their options are limited. Connecticut was able to temporarily fund another federal nutrition program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. WIC serves about 52,000 people in the state, including women who are nursing or pregnant as well as young children. The expectation is that the state will get reimbursed by the federal government once a shutdown ends.
There are also talks among state officials and legislative leaders about beefing up emergency aid to food pantries and banks. If SNAP funding dries up next month, that will put increasing pressure on local food pantries to fill the need.
Connecticut Foodshare has been in daily talks with state officials about how the state might step in with nutrition assistance at risk. The group works with more than 600 food pantries across the state as well as 110 mobile sites.
With Nov. 1 approaching, Jakubowski said the focus is on the existing network of pantries and ensuring they have enough food to meet the increased demand. But if the shutdown goes beyond that, he said, they’ll need to seriously consider setting up emergency food distribution sites for the month of December — similar to what they did during the pandemic.
Advocates see cuts to food aid not only having a direct effect on families and other beneficiaries but also a larger economic impact on the stores and retailers that accept SNAP. Connecticut has about 2,500 SNAP retailers, with those dollars making up 5% to 15% of their business.
And they worry about how other shutdown-related cuts could have a ripple effect.
“Those don’t directly affect us, but there’s absolutely an indirect effect of those things,” Jakubowski said about cuts to heating aid and other federal programs. “There is definitely a residual effect. That’s less money they have to spend on groceries.”
Head Start centers
More Head Start centers — early childhood services that serve low-income children from birth to age 5 — could also feel the financial pinch of the shutdown heading into November. And that could cause disruptions in the coming weeks across the country.
These programs get federal grants on different timelines. Only half a dozen have been operating without federal funding this month. But an additional 134 programs will face a similar outcome in November in an ongoing shutdown, including two in Connecticut, according to the National Head Start Association.
In Connecticut, two centers won’t get access to federal resources when their grant cycle starts on Nov. 1 in the event of an ongoing shutdown: EdAdvance, a Regional Educational Service Center that serves western Connecticut, and Children’s Learning Centers of Fairfield County in Stamford. Between those centers, they have a combined 395 slots that serve children in Head Start and Early Head Start programs.
Connecticut’s Office of Early Childhood is working to fund these programs temporarily for one month, though the plans haven’t been finalized, according to Maggie Adair, the communications and legislative program manager for the OEC.
EdAdvance was supposed to get its five-year federal grant starting on Nov. 1. But to help with an expected funding lapse, it will get some of its allotted state funding for the year early, executive director Jonathan Costa said. That will help EdAdvance stay open through November, though he noted they will need to evaluate things if the government remains closed heading into December. 
As of this week, all Head Start centers across the country remained open amid the shutdown. But one program in Florida is poised to closed down on Monday, according to National Head Start Association deputy director Tommy Sheridan.
During the 2013 shutdown, Connecticut was one of half a dozen states that saw closures of Head Start centers, including one in Bridgeport.
Winter heating assistance
The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, also faces funding issues next month. But Connecticut will be in the clear, at least in the short term.
DSS administers LIHEAP grants to largely fund the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program, which provides subsidies to low-income households to help with their heating bills during the winter months.
The Connecticut Energy Assistance Program has more than $7 million in funds that were unspent from the past winter. The state anticipates that funding to last them midway or through the end of November, and it indicated they are looking into other options if the shutdown dips into December.
“The state of Connecticut has about $7 million in carryforward funds to assist eligible households with their home heating costs. We anticipate funding will last through mid-to-late November and are working on making sure families continue to receive the help they need to stay warm this winter and are evaluating options if the Federal Budget impasse continues past November,” DSS spokesperson Christine Stuart said in a statement.
Demand is expected to grow this winter, with the Lamont administration projecting more than 100,375 households needing heating assistance.
Other states are seeing a more immediate effect on their LIHEAP funding. Pennsylvania announced this week it’s delaying the opening of its energy assistance program by a month because of the budget impasse in Washington.
Open enrollment for Obamacare plans
Funding disruptions caused by the shutdown are happening at the same time that households are receiving notices about how much more they could pay for health plans next year if premium subsidies expire.
About 150,000 Connecticut residents purchase coverage through Access Health CT, and about 90% of those benefit from a federal subsidy.
Even without that tax credit, enrollees in Connecticut will still have access to some financial support, but residents with exchange plans could expect to pay $1,700 more on average every year for health insurance, according to Access Health CT. 
Connecticut could see some of the highest premium increases in the country if the enhanced premium subsidies go away, particularly for enrollees over the age of 60, according to a report from KFF.
Open enrollment for 2026 plans runs from Nov. 1 through Dec. 15 for those who want their plans to begin in January. For those who want to enroll in a plan that starts in February, residents have until Jan. 15.
As people weigh their options, officials in the state recommend holding off on immediately enrolling to see if Congress resolves the shutdown and the impasse over the Affordable Care Act subsidies. 
“If you could, wait a little bit longer,” Access Health CT CEO James Michel said Tuesday. “Instead of enrolling on Nov. 1, give it more time, because I know there’s conversations going on right now to try to get the subsidies resolved.”

San Francisco has avoided an aggressive immigration crackdown under President Donald Trump — for now. 
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, Bay Area officials and residents remain on alert after Trump called off his plans on Thursday for a “surge” of federal immigration enforcement in San Francisco. The move comes a day after the president sent about 100 federal agents to Coast Guard Island in nearby Alameda, prompting state and city leaders to denounce the potential deployment of federal troops in San Francisco. 
In a social media post, Trump cited discussions with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and calls with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff as reasons why he canceled the show-of-force. (After receiving public backlash, Benioff — who does not primarily live in San Francisco — walked back comments he made earlier this month supporting the deployment of the National Guard to the city).
Trump’s post ended with the phrase, “Stay tuned!”
On Thursday morning, protestors gathered at the entrance to the Alameda military base, where federal agents used a flash-bang grenade and pepper powder to disperse the crowd, according to KQED. At least two arrests were made.
Meanwhile, Lurie said that San Francisco “remains prepared for any scenario.” In Oakland — where Trump previously floated sending federal troops — its Mayor Barbara Lee said the city stands “ready to support our residents through every legal and appropriate means available.”
And Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the office is continuing to monitor the region “as the days progress.”

Crofts-Pelayo, in an emailed statement: “Trump has finally, for once, listened to reason — and heard what we have been saying from the beginning. The Bay Area is a shining example of what makes California so special, and any attempt to erode our progress would damage the work we’ve done.”

Speaking of Trump and Newsom:

Vetoing bills: Newsom spiked more than 100 pieces of legislation this session, citing Trump and “hostile” federal policies in several of his veto messages. Read more from CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow. 


Planned Parenthood funding: Newsom on Thursday said the state will invest more than $140 million to assist California’s remaining Planned Parenthood clinics. Earlier this year the Trump administration banned the clinics, which is the state’s largest abortion provider, from receiving federal Medicaid payments. About 80% of Medi-Cal patients use Planned Parenthood for reproductive health care, cancer screenings and primary care check ups. Read more from CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.

Marines’ misfire

California congressmembers are calling for an investigation as more details emerge about the Marine artillery mishap over Interstate 5 on Saturday, reports CalMatters’ Deborah Brennan.
In a planned demonstration involving firing 60 rounds of artillery at San Diego County’s Camp Pendleton, an apparent misfire ended up scattering shrapnel over the coastal freeway. The shrapnel struck a California Highway Patrol motorcycle and an empty patrol vehicle. The demonstration was in celebration of the U.S. Marine Corps’ 250th anniversary, which was attended by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.
Public safety officials and former members of the military said the demonstration’s location was unusual, and that live-fire training typically takes place on designated ranges within the base.
U.S. Rep. Mike Levin, a Democrat who represents the district that includes Camp Pendleton, sent a letter to Hegseth demanding answers to questions about the incident, including who decided to shoot live artillery over the freeway. Twenty-six other California congressmembers and the state’s two senators also signed the letter.

Levin, to CalMatters: “I’m led to believe the decision-making did not put public safety first.”

Clamping down on police data

Los Angeles County leaders are calling on their sheriff to limit license plate reader data sharing after CalMatters found that some law enforcement agencies were illegally sharing the data with federal immigration agencies, write Phoebe Huss of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network and Khari Johnson.
The county’s board of supervisors submitted the motion in September, requesting that the sheriff’s department not use license plate data it collects for non-criminal immigration enforcement. They also called for the department to conduct privacy training for deputies and delete plate sightings after 60 days, unless the plates are flagged on criminal lists.
The request cited a June CalMatters report, which found that a dozen Southern California police and sheriff’s departments shared such data with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection — despite a 2015 state law banning California law enforcement agencies from sharing license plate reader data with federal entities.
CalMatters did not find that the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department shared data with ICE or the Border Patrol, but some L.A.-area agencies did. The sheriff’s department says it “welcomes” the request and will review its policies.

While the need for rooftop solar is not going away, federal tax incentives are, which is why it's important for state and local governments to step up, Josh Tulkin writes. (Photo by Joe DelNero /National Renewable Energy Laboratory)This past summer, Maryland experienced record-breaking energy use and record-high electricity bills due to record-breaking heat. As we enter the fall and will soon face colder weather, it is critical that Maryland continues to seek ways to lower energy costs for Marylanders and connect more energy to our grid.
Installing rooftop solar and battery storage brings energy independence to residents looking to lower their energy bills and move away from reliance solely on the grid. Unfortunately, Congress has ended tax credits designed to encourage energy conservation and incentivize people to install solar and battery storage in their homes.
It is now incumbent on local and state governments to take all steps in their power to promote adoption of conservation and solar. While local governments can’t replace federal tax credits or control tariffs, they can still have a huge impact. They can cut red tape, offer their own incentives, speed up permitting and drive down the soft costs.
High upfront costs are among the top reasons Americans who want to put solar on their roofs and batteries in their garages haven’t done so yet. One of the ways we make things cheaper is by cutting down costs in the process. Thankfully, Maryland has already been working to make solar more affordable and passed the Brighter Tomorrow Act of 2024, which, among many cost-cutting provisions, requires local jurisdictions to adopt more effective permitting technology.

Enter SolarAPP+, which stands for Solar Automated Permit Processing (plus other clean energy technologies). In 2021, I was proud when Montgomery County started piloting the ‘SolarAPP+’ Platform to instantly approve solar permits for residents. Montgomery County has shared that residential rooftop solar projects that go through SolarAPP+ have been passing their inspections at a 30% higher rate than those submitted through the traditional route.
We cheered when lawmakers passed the Brighter Tomorrow Act of 2024, which added funding to support the requirement for Maryland jurisdictions to use solar permitting software to automate the process for residential rooftop solar and home energy storage installations. In 2025, we conducted outreach, hosted educational webinars with guests from the Maryland Energy Administration and SolarAPP+, and engaged with dozens of volunteer leaders across the state to inform them about this game-changing software.
And there’s been some good news in 2025: We were thrilled to hear that, in June, Prince George’s and Worcester counties were awarded the Maryland Energy Administration’s first SolarAPP Implementation Grant. In July, MEA relaunched a fiscal ’26 Maryland SolarAPP+ Implementation Grant Program, setting the stage for additional jurisdictions to onboard, train and support adding this automated tool to their tool belts.
We have heard that Kent County, Salisbury and Rockville launched their SolarAPP+ portals and that Prince George’s, Wicomico, and Worcester counties are all going through the onboarding process as I write this.
As we head into another high-energy-use season and with federal solar tax credits disappearing soon, it is essential that SolarAPP+ get launched in time for residents to take advantage of it. This crunch season is critically important, and far too many jurisdictions are lagging behind.
We have been supportive of adopting this technology as it aligns with our values of making clean energy accessible to more people. SolarAPP+ was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and building safety officials and is now run by an independent nonprofit foundation, with additional support from Maryland Energy Administration grants.
We call on jurisdictions to move swiftly to adopt SolarAPP+, apply for the implementation grant from MEA, and ultimately comply with the law. Making rooftop solar easier for Marylanders is one thing we can all agree on.
Will this solve all of the problems with solar? No – but it is something we can do now, even as federal opportunities dry up. Now is not the time for backsliding; it’s the time to add clean, affordable sunshine into the mix for as many rooftops as are ready for it.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/53515164850_6f123440fb_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 09:02:46.544809
,California,2025-10-24 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Gavin Newsom cited 3 main reasons in his vetoes this year. Trump was one,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/10/gavin-newsom-vetoes-2025/,"Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed 123 bills this year, citing fiscal restraint — and Donald Trump.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed 123 bills this year, citing fiscal restraint — and Donald Trump.


Sen. Anna Caballero is one of California’s most influential lawmakers, since she is in charge of a committee that decides in secret to kill hundreds of bills each year, often at the behest of the governor’s administration.
But even though Caballero is the powerful chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and regularly works with the governor’s team, Gov. Gavin Newsom still vetoed seven of her bills this year, the most of any lawmaker.
“I do tough bills,” Caballero, a Democrat who represents the Merced area, told CalMatters. “So sometimes I get lucky, and other times, it’s disappointing. And, you know, you learn to live with it.”
Her vetoed bills include one that aimed to reduce emissions at state ports, another that sought to add oversight for metal shredding facilities and one that sought to train police to investigate foreign governments that target immigrant communities.
In his veto messages, Newsom described those bills as unnecessary since state agencies were already doing similar work. That’s one of the more common themes in Newsom’s 123 vetoes from this legislative session that he finished signing earlier this month. He used the word “duplicative” 16 times, according to an analysis of CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database. 
The analysis highlights how Newsom uses his veto pen to assert authority over a Legislature his fellow Democrats control while rejecting bills he deems too costly, redundant or politically risky.  Newsom cited fiscal implications dozens of times in his veto messages, reflecting the challenges of a tough budget year. This year’s vetoes also gave him a chance to throw some shade at Newsom’s biggest enemy: President Donald Trump. 
Newsom mentioned Trump by name three times in his vetoes, and he cited Trump’s “hostile economic policies” in almost a quarter of his veto messages, 28 times. 
“With significant fiscal pressures and the federal government’s hostile economic policies, it is vital that we remain disciplined when considering bills with significant fiscal implications that are not included in the budget, such as this measure,” Newsom wrote, in vetoing Caballero’s bill that sought to exempt hydrogen fuel from sales taxes.
He used a nearly identical line to veto three other Caballero bills, including a measure to provide tax credits for medical equipment, a bill that would have provided grants for carbon dioxide removal and another that sought to incentivize biomass power plants. 
The vetoes represented just a small percentage of what Newsom’s did with the 917 bills that were sent to his desk this year. He vetoed just 13.4% of them, a slightly lower rate than previous years, according to Chris Micheli, an adjunct professor at McGeorge School of Law and a veteran lobbyist who keeps detailed statistics on the Legislature. 
It certainly wasn’t all vetoes for Caballero. Newsom also signed 10 of her bills into law. 
Zombie bills return for a second veto
There was another theme in Newsom’s vetoes: Spiking bills he’d previously vetoed.
He did that six times.
As CalMatters reported, even if a bill gets vetoed one year, lawmakers often bring the legislation back again — often with wording identical to the previous version. 
Previously vetoed measures are especially likely to be resurrected if well-funded lobbying groups that donate heavily to politicians are pushing for a new law. 
That was the case with two bills Newsom axed for the second time this year.
One was a union-backed bill by Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis of San Luis Obispo that sought to make it easier for farmworkers to win workers’ compensation claims against employers for heat-related illnesses. The other was a previously vetoed measure by Democratic Assemblymember Esmerlda Soria of Merced that sought to allow community colleges to offer bachelor’s degrees in nursing. Nurses unions, hospitals and community colleges supported the bill.
Newsom noted those bills were “nearly identical” to measures he previously killed, and he cited the same reasons. 
Newsom again spiked a bill that would require counties to create multidisciplinary behavioral health teams, a proposal to force insurers to pay for menopause treatment, a reparations bill and a measure to fund a study on women veterans’ mental health.
First-year lawmaker Democratic Assemblymember John Harabedian, representing the Pasadena area, had five vetoes this year, the second most in the Legislature. They were mostly related to health insurance and the fallout from last winter’s devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County.

Newsom vetoed his bill that would have required insurers to pay for up to 12 mental health visits for people living where there has been a recent wildfire. Another would have created a state-led disaster housing task force in Los Angeles County. The governor also vetoed a measure that sought to speed up patients getting the care their doctors recommended.
“Big, transformative policies often take multiple attempts, and I’m proud to keep pushing forward to serve my constituents,” Harabedian said in an emailed statement. 
Newsom signed four of Harabedian’s bills. 
None of Democratic Assemblymember Ash Kalra’s bills were vetoed this year  — for the first time in the San Jose lawmaker’s nine-year legislative career. He had 12 signed into law.
That included a bill aiming to prevent foreign labor contractors from exploiting their workers that was similar to a measure Newsom vetoed before. Kalra said he narrowed the bill to cover only farmworkers to address Newsom’s concerns. 
“You have to be persistent,” he said. “Sometimes it takes three, four or five times, or in the case of the foreign labor contractor bill, seven years.”

How other lawmakers avoid vetoes
Other lawmakers also got a lot of their bills past Newsom’s veto pen. 
Democratic Santa Ana Sen. Tom Umberg had Newsom sign 16 of his bills, the most behind San Francisco Sen. Scott Wiener, who had 21. As the Senate Budget Committee chair,  Wiener is the lead author of mandatory budget bills that skew his totals. 
Umberg’s bills include one prohibiting streaming providers such as Netflix from playing overly loud advertisements; another to prohibit Elon Musk and others from hosting lotteries to gin up partisan voter registration, one intended to stop puppy mills and an audit of the state’s troubled bar exam.
Umberg, a former federal prosecutor and attorney nearing the end of his term, said his success is due in part to him serving in the Legislature off and on since the 1990s. He’s served under four different governors, so he said he knows what they’re looking for.
“I hope that my years of experience provide some benefit and some expertise in legislating and how to work a bill through the process and how to get a bill signed,” he said.
Newsom vetoed one of Umberg’s bills this year, a measure that would have added new price-gouging protections and penalties in disaster zones. Newsom didn’t like that the bill also would have allowed the Legislature to override a governor’s authority on disaster declarations. 
Republicans are vastly outnumbered in the Legislature and not as many of their bills even reach the governor’s desk, so it stands out that Assemblymember Josh Hoover, a Republican representing the Folsom area, had the most bills signed among GOP lawmakers, with nine. Hoover is out of the country this week and wasn’t available for an interview, his spokesperson said. 
Republican Assemblymember Laurie Davies had seven of her bills signed, the third-most among Republicans.

Davies’ bills weren’t particularly controversial and didn’t involve partisan politics. They included a measure that requires schools to provide educational materials to prevent drownings. Another requires the state to tell those who file complaints about a drug and alcohol treatment center the outcome of their complaint. Another of her proposals prohibits selling equipment to modify electric bicycles so they no longer classify as an e-bike. 
Davies, who represents a competitive swing district in the Oceanside area, said she wants her bills to solve problems, not take partisan hits that almost certainly won’t get signed into law under a Democratic administration.
“We don’t run bills for social media clicks or cable news invites,” she said.Newsom did veto one of her bills this year, a measure that sought to make battery storage plants beef up their fire safety plans. Davies opposes a proposed battery storage facility in her district.
Newsom’s veto message used one of his favorite words: “Duplicative.”
“This bill is largely duplicative of existing requirements and mandates a new procedural requirement that risks delaying critical clean energy projects,” he wrote.

In November, the justices will wrestle with some disputes that are years or decades in the making. Others touch on current crises. And the Legislature’s action or inaction is often a factor.  
Here’s a preview of four cases that could have wide-ranging effects, set for oral arguments before the SJC next month.  

Charter school public records fight – November 3 
A years-long legal dispute between Attorney General Andrea Campbell and the high-performing but controversial Mystic Valley Regional Charter School is hitting the high court. The Malden-based charter received at least 10 public records requests between January and November 2022 from the Malden News Network, Commonwealth Transparency, and mayoral candidate Lissette Alvarado. 
They requested information including corporate statements, contracts, ledgers, lease records, conflict of interest disclosures filed by board members, payments made to employees or professional services, and confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. Mystic Valley rebuffed each request, claiming that “as a Commonwealth charter school, it does not fall under the category of entities handling public documents” and is not subject to the state public records law. 
After the Supervisor of Records issued multiple orders for the school to comply with the record requests, Campbell’s office filed suit in Suffolk Superior Court in July 2023. The Superior Court sided with the AG’s office, declaring the school to be a government entity subject to the public records law. Mystic Valley appealed, arguing that the suit fundamentally misunderstood the nature of charter schools.  
Mystic Valley has faced controversy before, including criticism over a dress code policy banning hair extensions that disproportionately affected Black students, which led to passage of state legislation declaring such practices discriminatory. 
In this case, the school argues that charters are more like business entities, granted “significant independence” without strong enough ties to the state to make them government entities subject to public records laws.  
“The Legislature intended for charter school (sic) to chart their own course, with the freedom to experiment and test out new ways of teaching children,” the school wrote in its brief to the high court. “With these goals in mind, it is logical to treat charter schools more like private, independent organizations than governmental entities. 
But the AG’s office says the school “can only exist and operate” if the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education allows it and continues to renew its charter, as it did in 2023, and clearly performs the “government function” of educating the Commonwealth’s young people as a public school. 
Whistleblower retaliation suit drags on – November 3 
Thomas Galvin’s wrongful termination lawsuit against Roxbury Community College is now before the SJC, more than a decade after the former security chief was fired. 
Galvin served as the college’s director of facilities and public safety from 2007 until his August 2012 termination. In a lawsuit filed in Middlesex Superior Court, he claimed he was fired as retaliation for exposing the college’s failure to report sexual assault allegations as required under the federal Clery Act. He is the brother of Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin.  
In 2010, Galvin received a letter from a student alleging she had been sexually violated by two former professors and had previously reported the incidents to college administrators. When Galvin pressed college officials about whether the complaints had been properly reported under the Clery Act, he alleges Vice President of Administration and Finance Alane Shanks told him there was nothing to report and accused him of trying to get her in trouble. 
Galvin reported what he believed to be the college’s Clery Act failures to state auditors and federal authorities in 2011. The college fired him the next year, citing security and performance concerns raised in an internal audit, including issues with Galvin’s Clery Act reporting.  
The Superior Court, considering Gavin’s claim that he was protected by the state’s whistleblower statute, rejected the college’s argument that Galvin had to prove he acted in good faith and agreed with Galvin that he engaged in protected activity. The high court will hear arguments on whether the lower court correctly found that Galvin was a whistleblower under state law. 
If lawmakers won’t raise attorney wages, can the courts? – November 5 
The bar advocate work stoppage will finally reach the full Supreme Judicial Court, which is being asked to consider whether it has the constitutional authority to raise court-appointed attorney pay rates. 
Most bar advocates, private attorneys who handle roughly 80 percent of indigent criminal defense cases in Massachusetts, stopped work in Suffolk and Middlesex county courts in June 2025, demanding higher hourly rates. Bar advocates in Massachusetts make $65 an hour, while advocates in other New England states make more than $100 an hour. The work stoppage overwhelmed the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the state’s major public defender organization. 
The Committee for Public Counsel Services is arguing that the Legislature, which rolled out a deal in late July that would raise the hourly wages $10 per year over the next two years, is shirking its responsibility to make sure that people without means still have access to counsel. Since July, more than 180 people in custody for more than a week without counsel and over 800 without representation for 45 days have been released or had charges dismissed because of the lag in finding attorneys to defend them.  
A lower court judge ordered that attorneys for five defendants be paid $100 an hour, and CPCS was able to find representation for those defendants at that rate. The question before the high court, now, is whether judges have the authority to raise rates to make sure that courts function correctly. Justice Dalila Wendlandt denied a request to raise bar advocate wages on July 3, and the matter now makes it up to the full court.
“Once again, indigent criminal defendants find themselves in an unacceptable and constitutionally intolerable position – without counsel” because of low compensation set by lawmakers, CPCS notes in its brief. The Suffolk County district attorney’s office argues that allowing judges to overrule that statutory wage, however, takes the “serious constitutional failure” and “turns it into a moral demand for judicial intervention, impermissibly blurring the line between enforcing constitutional rights and assuming the powers of the Legislature.” 
$1 billion tobacco verdict under review – November 5 
Philip Morris wants a new trial for a case that involves the largest ever jury award in the history of Massachusetts – in which a Middlesex County Superior Court jury handed down $8 million in compensatory damages and $1 billion in punitive damages – for the 2017 lung cancer death of Barbara Fontaine. 
After three-weeks of proceedings in late 2022, the jury found Philip Morris liable for Fontaine’s death at 60 years old, after 40 years of smoking Phillip Morris cigarettes. But the tobacco company argues among other things that the scale of punitive damages, which the judge reduced to just over $56 million, was constitutionally excessive and demonstrated that the jury was motivated by passion and prejudice. 
“The award is unprecedented from just about any perspective,” Philip Morris argues in its court filing. Focusing on this case, it added, “there was no justification for an award 125 times the $8 million compensatory award.” If an award is so exaggerated that it indicates a jury could be acting from a place of bias or prejudice, just reducing the amount is not enough to make the proceedings fair, the company asserts. 
Fontaine’s estate argues that the trial court judge concluded the award came after the highly educated jury listened attentively to weeks of testimony and asked thoughtful questions. It also argues that the verdict considered what it would take to deter such behavior given the company’s enormous wealth. Philip Morris’s “generational campaign to deceive and create fatally addicted addicts out of Americans worked,” the filing notes. “Preventing similar future conduct would save millions of lives.” 
Other massive punitive awards were reduced but did not lead to a new trial, like a $3 billion award in a 2005 California suit against Philip Morris, which was reduced to $50 million, the estate adds. 
Along with whether the company is entitled to a new trial, the court will consider whether trial judges generally should impose safeguards to avoid excessive damages, and whether the jury should have been told about federal law stating that cigarette labeling is considerate adequate to warn consumers about the risks of smoking.

But with more financial troubles looming, lawmakers say there’s more work to be done to protect reproductive health services.","In summary
An injection of public funding means the nonprofit organization can keep primary care clinics operating. But with more financial troubles looming, lawmakers say there’s more work to be done to protect reproductive health services. 


After months of financial strain, Planned Parenthood will get a $140 million lifeline to offset losses it sustained after Congress in July cut funding for the health system, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Thursday.
The money will help Planned Parenthood keep 109 California clinics open. In a statement, Newsom said the move reflects the state’s continued commitment to abortion and reproductive health care.
“Trump’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood put all our communities at risk as people seek basic health care from these community providers,” Newsom said.
Lawmakers will also take up the issue in January when the Legislature reconvenes.
The news comes a week after the nonprofit organization announced it would eliminate primary care at clinics in Orange and San Bernardino counties. Five other clinics also closed in July in the Bay Area, Santa Cruz and Central Valley, all in response to federal defunding.
Planned Parenthood needs roughly $27 million monthly to operate all of its local facilities, according to Jodi Hicks, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, the organization’s statewide advocacy group.
“We’re incredibly grateful that we’ve found a way to get some funding out to our Planned Parenthood health centers so they can remain operating and continue services,” Hicks said. 
California is the fourth state, following Washington, Colorado and New Mexico, to pledge public funds to keep Planned Parenthood afloat. Lawmakers in Oregon and New York are also considering similar moves.
Republicans have lambasted and targeted Planned Parenthood for decades over contraceptive and abortion services. A 1977 law banned federal funding for abortions, but this summer President Donald Trump took additional steps to cut down the nation’s largest abortion provider.
His sweeping tax and budget bill prohibited Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid dollars for any kinds of services, including mammograms, pap smears, birth control and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment.
According to Planned Parenthood, abortions account for less than 10% of its services, while other reproductive health services make up the bulk of medical care provided.
Federal funding losses have forced Planned Parenthood to close clinics across the country, where half of all patients rely on Medicaid. In California, where 80% of Planned Parenthood patients have Medicaid – known as Medi-Cal in the state – the losses are even greater.
“There was definitely an outsized impact on California,” Hicks said.
Primary care closures ripple across the state
Democratic lawmakers, Newsom and Planned Parenthood have spent most of the year searching for a funding solution that protects reproductive health access without cash from federal coffers. But, faced with a multibillion-dollar state deficit, solutions have been slow to appear and challenging to maintain.
“We’ll fight like hell to maintain access to care in the coming months and years,” said Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, a Davis Democrat who leads the Legislative Women’s Caucus,
Even with the state’s pledge to protect sexual and reproductive health care, Planned Parenthood clinics face growing uncertainty driven by federal grant freezes, lawsuits and even some proposed state cuts.
Last week, Planned Parenthood in Orange and San Bernardino counties announced facilities would close primary care services on Dec. 13. The group, which runs nine health centers, added primary care more than a decade ago to serve low-income patients unable to find appointments elsewhere. 
Dr. Janet Jacobson, medical director of the Orange and San Bernardino counties clinics, said the federal actions are “destroying our primary care program.” She said she worries patients with urgent mental health needs or chronic conditions won’t be able to quickly find another provider. Many communities in the region have too few doctors, according to state data.
Roughly 13,000 patients will lose access to care and Planned Parenthood will lay off 77 staff.
“It’s inhumane to take away people’s health care,” Jacobson said. “Folks that have Medi-Cal should be able to see the provider of their choice for primary care.”
Aguiar-Curry called the loss of primary care “unacceptable and dangerous.” 
Seeking stability as ‘financial cliff’ still looms
Farther north, Planned Parenthood Mar Monte — which runs 30 health centers along the California coast, Central Valley and Nevada — closed five health centers in July shortly after Trump blocked Planned Parenthood’s funding.
Mar Monte Chief of Staff Andrew Adams said the organization has been working to maintain its financial stability. The closures helped preserve services at the organization’s other clinics until the end of the year, but Adams warned that it could hit a “financial cliff” in January. 
“We are planning for an environment where there is no federal funding,” Adams said. “What that looks like is having to potentially charge patients some amount of money for services we provide.”
Other Planned Parenthood groups in the state are exploring ways to cut costs and boost revenue while keeping clinics open for patients.
Dr. Neda Ashtari, a former Planned Parenthood and Medi-Cal patient, emphasized the importance of ensuring more than 1 million patients continue to have access to cancer screenings and other reproductive health services. When Ashtari was a teenager, her mother died of breast cancer after missing routine scans that could have detected the cancer earlier, she said.
“It really crystallizes that this preventative care is the difference between life or death,” Ashtari said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Last summer, on his way to the Rich County rodeo, Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz stopped at a gas station in Evanston, Wyoming. Taking the out-of-state route allowed him to do two things — to buy a couple of lottery tickets, which are banned in Utah, and fill up his gas tank while saving 26 cents per gallon.
The gas price disparity across state lines had been on his mind before then, he said in a social media post in August, where he hinted at a legislative proposal to help find a relief. 
“A big reason is that Utah refineries produce up to 220,000 barrels a day, but about 75,000 of those are shipped out of state to meet demand elsewhere in the West—pushing our prices higher here at home,” Schultz wrote then.

A few months have passed since that post, and more details about the plan Schultz has worked on alongside Rep. Cal Roberts, R-Draper, and Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Highland, have emerged. It has to do with a longstanding tax practice for fuel exported out of state.
Currently, Utah has a $0.385 tax rate per gallon for motor fuel sold at gas pumps in the state, but has an exemption for fuel exported out of state.
A draft bill is still in the works, Roberts said, and may be introduced during the 2026 legislative session to, essentially, reassess the state’s gas tax structure.
“The idea would be, we’re going to remove that tax exemption, that special tax break that they get for (the) product that leaves the state, and we’re going to tax all fuel the same,” Roberts said. “And then by doing that, we’re going to be able to lower the gas tax for Utahns at the pump.”
How so? 
By also lowering that $0.385 tax rate that Utahns pay for fuel.
Removing the tax exemption would have an impact on Utah refineries’ ability to export their product out of state, Roberts said. “But you’re going to create enough revenue where you can drop the gas tax for Utahns in the state. And I think we’re looking at dropping the gas tax 25% to 50%.” 
That would translate to a price reduction of 10 to 20 cents per gallon, he added.
Since the bill language isn’t yet public, the Utah Petroleum Association didn’t have much to say about its position; however, Rikki Hrenko-Browning, president of the group, said in a prepared statement that “altering the state’s gas tax and other related taxes will have significant financial implications for the state of Utah. Until we have bill language that clearly lays out what the legislature wants to do, we won’t speculate on what the exact nature of those impacts will be.”
The association remains committed to conversations with lawmakers to share potential impacts on any proposals they may pursue, she added.
Regional pricing
According to the American Automobile Association, as of Thursday, the average gas price in Utah was $3.31 a gallon, over the $3.07 national average. 
In neighboring Wyoming, that’s normally cheaper with an average of $2.97 per gallon reported Thursday. Meanwhile, Colorado saw a $2.93 average. However, other surrounding states had higher gas prices on the same day. Idaho reported an average of $3.42 a gallon; Nevada had $3.80 and Arizona, $3.36. 
Roberts pointed to rural bordering counties, like San Juan in southeastern Utah, which had a $3.49 average per gallon on Thursday, while Montezuma in southwestern Colorado reported an average of $2.95.



Let us know what you think...


 


He argued that while Utah produces more gas than it consumes, prices aren’t competitive because of regional market influences. 
As other Western states like California move away from fossil fuels, leading refineries to shut down, Utah’s oil production grew 13% to 65.1 million barrels in 2024, the highest annual production on record, according to the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. 
“When supply goes down, or supply is not as much, what happens to price? Price goes up,” Roberts said. “And those higher prices in Nevada, California, Washington, Oregon, they’ve had a vacuum effect, where they’ve sucked barrels out of our state, because our refineries are chasing the higher margins of these other states, and it’s increasing our prices.”
Industry pushback 
An anonymous petition is circulating online opposing the proposal, arguing that “there’s no proof this would actually lower prices for Utah drivers—but it would create new costs and red tape for the energy producers who power our state.”
The refining industry, the petition says, is already dealing with global instability, market pressures and other regulatory burdens. “The last thing we need is more government interference in an industry that keeps Utah running,” petitioners wrote. 
Schultz responded to that request with an eye-rolling emoji, saying the legislative proposal would shift the tax burden off Utahns and onto oil refiners.
“These are some of the largest companies in Utah, and the world, and they’ve fought for decades to avoid paying their fair share, all while Utah families face some of the highest gas prices in the country,” Schultz wrote in a post.
Roberts is on the same page.
While he’s happy the refineries are doing well and help keep prices relatively low, he believes they get a lot of tax breaks that are paid by Utahns.
“We think it’s fair to Utahns to re-examine those tax breaks and those tax exemptions that these guys are enjoying,” Roberts said, “and then using some of that to lower the gas tax at the pump for Utahns.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia House Speaker Don Scott (D-Portsmouth) on Thursday called lawmakers back to Richmond for a special session Monday afternoon, setting off speculation that Democrats are preparing to act on redistricting plans just days before voters elect a new governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and all 100 members of the House of Delegates.
In a letter to legislators, Scott cited constitutional provisions and joint resolutions authorizing the General Assembly to reconvene the 2024 Special Session I “to consider matters properly before the ongoing session and any related business laid before the body.”
The House will meet at 4 p.m. Monday in the Capitol chamber, he wrote, adding that the clerk’s office will soon provide logistical details.
“My office has spoken with Senate leadership and has been assured that a similar communication … will be made by the Senate Clerk’s Office to Senate members,” Scott wrote.
He did not explain why the legislature is being recalled, and neither he nor Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell (D-Fairfax) responded to inquiries from The Mercury on Thursday.
Redistricting speculation
Several Democrats and legislative staffers told Virginia Scope that part of the session’s focus will be redistricting — a move that could reopen debate over how Virginia’s 11 congressional boundaries are drawn. Six of these are currently held by Democrats, and sources told the outlet that Democrats in Washington believe a new map could yield at least two additional Democratic-leaning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Maryland senator introduces bill to redraw congressional districts in response to Texas

Virginia voters in 2020 approved a constitutional amendment creating an independent redistricting commission of lawmakers and citizens, but the panel deadlocked in late 2021, leaving the Virginia Supreme Court to draw the current maps.
With Democrats now holding narrow control of both legislative chambers, some strategists have discussed using their majorities to revisit that framework.
Options under discussion include breaking up heavily Democratic districts to make them more competitive while reshaping Republican-leaning areas to favor Democratic candidates.
Timing is key — under Virginia’s amendment process, a constitutional change must be approved twice by the General Assembly with a House election in between before being placed on the ballot for voter approval or rejection.
According to Virginia Scope, Democratic leaders are considering an initial vote before the Nov. 4 election, followed by a second vote during the 2026 session, potentially allowing a referendum next spring and new maps no sooner than April — two months before congressional primaries.
Still, many Democratic lawmakers remain uneasy about the plan. Senate Democrats held a caucus meeting Wednesday night, and several members told the outlet they had been “kept out of the loop” about the special-session agenda.
National backdrop
Across the country, redistricting battles are intensifying as both parties look to lock in advantages ahead of the 2026 midterms.
Earlier on Thursday, the New York Times reported that Virginia’s Democratic leaders are considering “joining a growing number of states” seeking to counter what they call partisan gerrymandering efforts encouraged by the administration of President Donald Trump.
“We are coming back to address actions by the Trump administration,” Surovell told the Times, suggesting Democrats view their move as a corrective to Republican-led redistricting maneuvers in states such as Texas, Florida and North Carolina.
Those states have recently pushed new maps designed to cement GOP control after a series of federal court rulings loosened constraints on mid-decade remapping. The Supreme Court is currently weighing a major redistricting case from Louisiana, another sign of how important the issue is to legislators and voters nationwide.

In August, Sen. Louise Lucas (D-Portsmouth) hinted publicly that Virginia could soon act. Sharing a post by former President Barack Obama on X, formerly Twitter, that praised California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approach to mid-decade redistricting, Lucas wrote: “Every state in the nation should follow suit. Stay tuned for Virginia …”
Political fallout
Republicans swiftly accused Democrats of scheming to rewrite the rules ahead of a pivotal statewide election.
Republican Party of Virginia Chair Mark Peake, a state senator from Lynchburg, in a video on X characterized Scott’s move a sign of Democratic desperation.
“Desperate Democrats are pulling a pathetic, political stunt,” Peake said, accusing the majority of “doing anything they can to take attention away from their horrible candidates.”
He added that “the General Assembly hopes they can do something with this ruse about redistricting,” but urged voters not to “fall for it.”
The campaign of Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee for governor, blamed Democratic contender Abigail Spanberger for supporting the idea of dissolving the independent commission.
“In a stunning display of arrogance, Abigail Spanberger wants to overrule the will of Virginia voters in favor of a cynical power grab,” campaign spokesperson Peyton Vogel said in a statement Thursday.
“She came out in favor of abolishing Virginia’s Independent Redistricting Commission and wants to hand control back to the politicians in Richmond so they can guarantee their own reelection. … It’s never been about the voters or what’s best for Virginia. It’s always been about what’s best for Abigail Spanberger,” the statement said.
Civil rights groups vow challenge to North Carolina’s new congressional maps

In an interview with WJLA in late August, however, Spanberger said she opposed mid-decade redistricting and warned against “politicians trying to tilt the playing field in their favor,” aligning herself with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s call for fair-maps legislation.
And Democrats countered that they’re simply responding to an escalating nationwide power struggle over fair representation.
In a statement Thursday, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Courtney Rice said “House Republicans know they are poised to lose the majority because the public is souring on their failed agenda.”
She accused Republicans of “rigging the midterms by ramming through new, unpopular, gerrymandered maps across the country.” Rice added that Virginia’s move to reconvene and “preserve the right to consider a new map in 2026 is critical in the fight to ensure voters have fair representation,” praising state Democrats for “standing up against Republican attempts to weaken the power, and vote, of the people.”
What comes next
With the state legislature reconvening Monday afternoon, both chambers are expected to gavel in briefly before potentially taking up redistricting-related measures later in the week.
Procedural resolutions adopted earlier this year would allow lawmakers to address “matters properly before the ongoing special session,” giving Scott wide latitude to add topics to the agenda.
Any move to alter Virginia’s redistricting process would likely trigger intense legal scrutiny and political backlash — especially given the proximity to Election Day. But Democratic strategists across the country argue that Republican-led states have already rewritten maps to their advantage.

,California,2025-10-24 12:04:00+00:00,CalMatters,Should billionaires pay more? California unions want voters to decide,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/10/billionaire-tax-initiative/,Labor and health care groups are collecting signatures to put a measure that would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of about 200 billionaires in California.,"In summary
Labor and health care groups are collecting signatures to put a measure that would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of about 200 billionaires in California. 


For years, Gov. Gavin Newsom has staunchly opposed increasing taxes on wealthy Californians even when the issue repeatedly reared its head during recent tough budget years. But faced with deep federal cuts to social services programs, labor and health care groups are asking voters to circumvent the governor – to tax a very small number of people.
Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West and St. John’s Community Health in Los Angeles want voters statewide to approve a “billionaires tax” to help prop up the state’s health care and education systems. 
The proposed ballot initiative would levy a one-time, 5% tax on the approximately 200 billionaires in the state, generating roughly $100 billion in revenue, according to proponents. 
Going to the ballot is a common move for advocacy groups frustrated with Sacramento politics, which, while dominated by Democrats, can still be factious. Dave Regan, president of SEIU-UHW, said at a news conference the ballot initiative is the “only solution anyone can see.” 
“We are facing literally a collapse of our health care system here in California and elsewhere,” Regan said. “This will help us keep health care facilities open. It will stabilize premiums and coverage for all Californians, protect health care jobs, and also improve public education.”
The proposed initiative would tax the 2025 net worth of billionaires residing in California, allowing them to pay off the obligation over five years. The revenue would go into a special fund with 90% reserved for health care spending and 10% reserved for K-12 education spending.
It needs 874,641 signatures to be placed before voters on the 2026 ballot, a number that the groups are confident they can reach. Getting voters to ultimately approve the tax, however, could be a hard sell.
While California has taxed the income of millionaires, lawmakers have never successfully passed a wealth tax. Instead of targeting earnings, the state would levy such a tax on the net worth of an individual, everything from investments to property value and even other assets, like jewelry and paintings. 
The governor is a big reason why. Newsom has never supported a wealth tax, at times angrily rejecting conservative efforts to link him with one as “shameful.” He quashed the most recent legislative effort last year. 
Democratic lawmakers this year had considered raising revenue to help support the state’s social services programs, which receive billions in federal funds annually, but pivoted to focus on Newsom’s Proposition 50 redistricting fight.
Regan said there are no plans to cut a deal with state lawmakers and pull the initiative from the ballot.
President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax reform and budget bill — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — is projected to cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid over a decade. California is estimated to lose roughly $30 billion in federal Medicaid funds annually as a result. The state’s Medicaid agency estimates 3.4 million people will lose coverage as a result of federal eligibility changes.
The bulk of cuts won’t take effect until 2027. But states, including California, are already taking steps to shrink their health insurance programs for low-income and disabled individuals. 
California lawmakers facing a $12 billion deficit earlier this year made cuts to the state’s insurance program for immigrants without legal status, including a partial enrollment freeze that starts Jan. 1. They also reinstituted the Medi-Cal asset test, which limits how much enrollees can have in property value and savings.
Susan Shelley, vice president of communications with the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, said most Californians will probably assume that the tax will not affect them, but establishing a wealth tax in the state could create a troubling precedent. 
“We tax income at a very high level, but we don’t tax wealth and assets,” Shelley said. Nearly half of the state’s personal income tax revenue comes from just 1% of the state’s earners. Over time, she added, a wealth tax “could come all the way down to the middle class and they say you have too much equity in your house and we’re taking it.” 
Shelley also said the proposed initiative would incentivize billionaires to leave the state, creating a “huge hole in the state budget” that would hurt the economy in the long term. 
Proponents of the measure disagreed with that characterization of the proposal. They said that it would not levy taxes on the middle class nor would it affect businesses because it targets the net worth of ultrawealthy individuals. 
Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at UC Berkeley and supporter of the proposal, said the tax is structured to prevent billionaires from avoiding the bill simply by leaving the state.
It would tax their wealth established in 2025, and any billionaires who moved to the state in 2026 would not be subject to the levy.
“California billionaires are not going to be able to avoid the tax by moving their assets outside of California,” Saez said.

,California,2025-10-24 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s gerrymander and generational rift could shake up its Democratic hierarchy,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/california-gerrymander-democratic-hierarchy/,"If Prop 50 succeeds, Democrats' votes will be spread more thinly to five more congressional districts at the same time younger candidates challenge senior-age incumbents.","Democratic politicians throughout California — those already in office and those who want in — assume that voters will rearrange the state’s 52 congressional districts next month and create new career opportunities.
The assumption is well grounded. A recent CBS News poll found 62% of the state’s likely voters, driven by disdain for President Donald Trump, will enact Proposition 50, a plan to shift five more congressional seats to Democrats even though they already have 43.
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s gerrymander would offset pro-Republican redistricting schemes in Texas and other states that Trump seeks to retain, or perhaps expand, the GOP’s paper-thin majority in the House next year.
With Prop. 50 seemingly a slam-dunk, current Democratic congressional members and wannabes are trying to sort out who will run for what — no small feat. To create the new seats, the Democrats’ political cartographers have to spread the party’s 10.4 million voters more thinly, reducing its margins in districts it already holds.
California also is not immune to the Democrats’ generational conflict, in the wake of their loss to Trump last year after an aged and obviously impaired President Joe Biden dropped out.
Politico declares that “fully half of the state’s older House Democrats are set to face same-party challengers next year…”
The most interesting example is in San Francisco, where 85-year-old Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker who has held her congressional seat for nearly 40 years, has already drawn two primary opponents even though she hasn’t announced whether she’ll run again.
First in was 39-year-old Saikat Chakrabarti, a former campaign aide and staffer to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, typifying the young progressives who have chafed at their party’s geriatric leadership.
His candidacy forced the issue for state Sen. Scott Wiener, who at 55 is no spring chicken. He has been waiting patiently for years for Pelosi to retire.  Wiener declared his candidacy this week, telling the New York Times, “The world changes. I made a decision that it makes sense for me to get into the race now because I’m passionate about San Francisco having the best possible representation.”
Pelosi won’t announce her intentions until after Prop. 50 is decided. But if she does retire, she likely wants to choose her successor — which is how she got her congressional seat in 1987.
San Francisco politics have a long history of control by a few powerful factions, most prominently one created in the 1950s by Willie Brown, brothers Phillip and John Burton and George Moscone.
The Burtons both served in Congress. John Burton was a long-time legislative leader and Moscone, then the city’s mayor, was assassinated in 1978.
Brown, now 91 and the only one of them still alive, wields massive influence in the city, after being the longest-tenured Assembly speaker and winning two terms as mayor. He was instrumental in the careers of  Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris.
Pelosi, born into a powerful political family in Baltimore, continued the family business in 1963 after marrying Paul Pelosi, scion of an influential San Francisco family, and moving to his city.
She integrated into the Brown-Burton-Moscone organization. When Phillip Burton died in 1983, his widow, Sala, took over his congressional seat and then, before dying in 1987, designated Pelosi as her successor.
San Francisco media have speculated that if Pelosi steps down, she might favor Connie Chan, a city supervisor, as her successor, noting that Chan was the only local official to speak alongside Pelosi at a recent Prop. 50 rally. However, it’s also been rumored that daughter Christine Pelosi might want to succeed her mother.
That’s the way things have gone in San Francisco for decades. Will it continue or is evolution in the air?",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/080825-Texas-Democrats-Presser-FG-CM-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-24 08:16:31.953455

Nevada is 1 of 24 states that doesn’t dedicate funding in its state budget for after-school or summer programs, meaning organizations rely on precarious federal funding and finite philanthropic dollars. 
Children’s advocacy groups and after school networks, which see the benefits of after-school programs such as increasing literacy rates and reducing chronic absenteeism, have often discussed internally how state funding would make after-school programs available to more Nevada children.
“We could impact thousands of more students with appropriated money through the state Legislature,” said Jodi Manzella, the executive director of Southern Nevada based After-School All-Stars Las Vegas.
Nevada is routinely at or near the bottom of lists gauging education outcomes and achievement, while also seeing a surge in chronic absenteeism and other conditions which hinder student performance.
After-school programs in the state, as well as across the country, have shown to fill the gaps and increase literacy rates or math scores through tutoring and other educational programing, said Kendra Gipson with Nevada Afterschool Network Youth 
”Youth who attend after-school programs are more likely to graduate high school,” Gipson said. “Youth that attend after school programs don’t struggle with absenteeism, like their peers.”
Manzella said there have been schools that saw 30% chronic absenteeism before After-School All-Stars began offering programs that have seen rates cut in half. 
The principals at those schools say they “can directly tie some of that result to the students that are in All- Stars.”
”They come to school every day because they want to be there” for the program, Manzella said. “Testing scores will increase for the kids that are in All-Stars because they get 300 additional contact hours with educators throughout the year.”
These programs also become a “lifeline” for students who might not have access to other extracurricular activities or tutoring programs, and also decrease involvement in the justice system, said Annette Dawson Owens with the Children’s Advocacy Alliance of Nevada.
“The return on investment has shown that it’s much easier to invest in students on the front end than to do some of those costly expenses on the back end,” Dawson Owens said. 
Child care in the state is also among the most expensive, which can hinder working parents.  More, and free, after school programs “means that those parents can also go to work,” Gipson said. 
Afterschool Alliance released its “America After 3 p.m.” report this month that found 29.6 million families want afterschool programs but just 7 million children are enrolled.
Roughly 65,000 children in Nevada are in after-school programs, but nearly 229,000 would participate in programs if available, according to the report. 
In a survey of 415 households in Nevada asking what barriers prevented them from after school programs, nearly half said there wasn’t a program in their community, 60% said programs are too expensive, and 60% said they lacked a safe way to get to and from programs. 
Though After-School All-Stars, one of the many programs in the state, has expanded to 21 schools in Southern Nevada and serves about 2,000 students every day, it’s obviously far from enough, Manzella said.
“We know that there are many more students out there that need support,” Manzella said. “We have waiting lists for students that would like to participate with us, and our barrier is funding.”
The Schwarzenegger of it all
President Donald Trump announced over the summer his administration would withhold $6 billion in funding nationwide for after-school and summer programs, worrying many Nevada organizations that provide resources. Nevada was at risk of losing about $60 million.  
“If those dollars were zeroed out, like they said they were going to be, then programs would have closed,” said Gipson, adding an estimated 11,000 students across the state “would not have been able to attend a program because of those dollars.”
After bipartisan backlash against Trump withholding the money, the administration changed course and released the funding.
The federal funding for the next fiscal cycle isn’t expected to change, Gipson said.
“We are always trying to advocate for an increase because of the students that are still waiting to enroll” in these after-school programs,” she added. 
After-school programs, whether administered by nonprofits or through city-run programs, rely on federal funding and philanthropic dollars to survive in Nevada. The current funding sources not only mean thousands of children can’t access these programs, but funding streams for those programs that are accessible are unstable. 
Federal grant dollars are competitive and usually organizations are competing for the same pot of money, Gipson said. 
Like many other states, Nevada used funds provided by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 enacted during the Biden administration to expand and enhance existing programs. But those dollars only provided short-term assistance. 
“Many nonprofits, and not just ours, are feeling the effects of that covid funding going away.” Manzella said.
With tourism revenue down and the state experiencing economic uncertainty, “corporations here in Nevada, when their earnings are down and their revenue is down, they’re not able to give as much in turn,” she said
Afterschool Alliance found that “state-level funding for afterschool and summer learning programs has increased twenty fold since 2000, with 26 states now collectively providing more than $5 billion in funding for local programs.”
While there have been policy discussions within organizations that comprise an after school network, Gipson was unsure what larger policy discussions are happening with state lawmakers about providing a dedicated funding as is found in half the other states in the country. 
Manzella and Gipson pointed to states like California, which passed a ballot initiative in 2002 to fund after-school programs. The reason it was successful was because former Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger championed the efforts, they said. 
“We need a champion or two in this state that realizes the impact of after school, wants every child to have the opportunity to do that, and starts looking at legislation to get a state item in our budget,” Gipson said. 
Neither Gipson nor Manzella knew of any estimate of the cost reducing the number of students waiting. 
At the After-School All-Stars, for example, it cost around $140,000 “to run a school for the full year for approximately 120 kids,” Manzella said. 
But not all after school programs are equal or offer the same types of programming, so costs will vary.
“Even starting off small would give the opportunity to more students that are on waiting lists,” Manzella said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6SzRhrow-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-24 08:16:31.953455

Voters in the district, which covers part of Cullman County, will choose between GOP nominee Cindy Myrex and Democratic nominee Matt Glover. The seat became vacant after former Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April. Harbison was absent for much of the 2025 legislative session.
The district is solidly Republican. Harbison took over 85% of the vote in his re-election campaign in 2022. Multiple messages seeking comment from Myrex were left in the last week.
The candidates
Myrex, 58, campaigned on listening to constituents, improving mental health care in public schools and economic growth. Voters told Myrex they were concerned about a new state law that would allow the city of Cullman, a wet city, to annex land from Cullman County, a dry county, for a “community development project” to serve alcohol.

The law drew criticism from Democratic and Republican candidates in this election and the House District 11 election. Cullman County did not have representation in the House after Harbison resigned in April and Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.
Gudger, who co-sponsored the legislation, pre-filed a bill on Aug. 1 to repeal the law, which goes into effect on Oct. 1. Myrex supports the repeal bill, which cannot begin going through the lawmaking process until the Legislature returns in January. 
Glover, 41, said in an interview Friday that he is prioritizing eliminating state sales tax on groceries, a lottery to fund public education and expanding Medicaid. 
The Legislature this spring approved a cut in the state grocery tax from 3% to 2%. 
Glover said that expanding Medicaid has become a bigger priority for him since President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law in July. 
“Expanding Medicaid to try to offset the cuts that are coming from the federal bill to try to keep as many rural hospitals open as possible, and try to help with the independent doctors offices and pharmacies,” Glover said. 

Campaign finances

According to campaign finance records, Myrex raised over $157,000 and spent almost $153,000. Since Myrex was selected as the GOP nominee in August, she’s raised over $57,000. Over 62% of those funds have come from political action committees (PACs). During the primary, most of Myrex’s funds came from businesses and individuals.
According to campaign finance records, Glover has raised about $4,000 and spent about $3,500. Glover has gotten 180 donations, most of which are less than $20, from across the country.

How to vote

District 12 voters can choose between Myrex and Glover on Oct. 28. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Polling locations can be found here. The winner will represent the district in the Alabama House of Representatives.

Sears/Maryland Matters)The statue honoring Baron Johann Dekalb is looking a little different lately.
The 139-year old bronze statue on the south side of the State House grounds is missing the blade of Dekalb’s sword. Instead of looking like he’s leading troops into battle, the Revolutionary War hero, clasping just the sword handle, looks a bit like an old man shaking his fist at the sky.
Fear not.
The removal is part of regular conservation efforts rather than theft or vandalism of the monument.
“The statue was conserved in June of this year, and during that process, it was determined that the replacement sword blade on the statue needed to be removed due to condition issues,” Chris Kintzel, director of the Maryland Commission on Artistic Property, said in an email.

“The statute receives conservation funding from the Maryland Military Monument Commission, and we work in conjunction with the Maryland Historical Trust/Maryland Department of Planning to arrange for its treatment, which is typically every two-three years,” Kintzel’s email said. “We are currently working with our partners to coordinate the installation of one of the replacement blades.”
Dekalb – or De Kalb as it is spelled on the monument and various reputable historical records — was a French general who fought with the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.
He served with Gen. George Washington at Valley Forge and was second in command under Horatio Gates in the Carolina campaign. Dekalb led troops from Maryland and Delaware during the battle of Camden in South Carolina. He was wounded multiple times during that battle and died days later as a result.
Ephraim Keyser, a Marylander considered to be a prominent sculptor in his time, was hired to create the monument. The Dekalb monument is considered a “significant example” of Keyser’s work, according to Maryland Historical Trust records.
The monument, dedicated in August 1886, cost 10,000 (more than $300,000 in 2025). Congress paid for the granite and bronze memorial, according to the Maryland Historical Trust.
The sword blade itself is removable. The one that was removed this summer during conservation work was not the original, Kintzel said.
The original blade was vandalized twice in 1990, according to the Maryland Historical Trust. Kintzel added that the blade was stolen that year.
That same year, five replacement blades made of fiberglass were made, according to Kintzel.
