The Mississippi State Board of Education voted Thursday to remove the requirement starting this fall. 
Department officials reiterated at the meeting that high schoolers would still have to take and pass history classes to graduate. 
Paula Vanderford, the education department’s chief accountability officer, said the agency has informally discussed releasing test resources to local districts if they want to create their own assessments. 
She said at a previous board meeting that getting rid of the test would save the state money.
The state board voted to open public comments about the decision in April after the Commission on School Accreditation voted to propose eliminating the test. Ultimately, it received 20 comments in support of the test’s removal, many of them from parents who cited their children’s test anxiety, and 16 against it, arguing that getting rid of the test would diminish the importance of the country’s history. 
U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker recently co-authored an editorial advocating against removing the U.S. history state test with board member Mary Werner, who voted against the decision at the meeting. 
“Our state has been making remarkable strides in education, and this progress is equipping the very Mississippians who will lead our state into the 21st century,” the editorial reads. “As they take on our future, we believe they should be as knowledgeable as possible about our past.”
Passing the state algebra I, biology and English language arts tests will remain a graduation requirement. The U.S. history assessment was the sole test not required by state or federal law. 
“Though the U.S. history statewide assessment will be eliminated starting next school year, it’s important to emphasize that students will still learn U.S. history and will be required to successfully complete the course to graduate,” said Dr. Lance Evans, state superintendent of education, in a press release. “Having fewer state tests required to graduate should be less taxing on educators, students and families alike.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07024100/Teacher-Shortage8.jpg,,,2025-06-19 13:16:19.657703

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)Bishop Craig Coates doesn’t want to name names.
But, the organizer of Annapolis’ annual Juneteenth celebration said, eight of the event’s main sponsors have dropped their support for the two-day event this year. In total, Coates said the festival and parade lost about $150,000 in sponsorships and federal grant money.
This is the first time the celebration has ever faced a decrease in funding from the previous year, he said. To cover the losses, Coates has had to rely on community support and individual donations to fund the $185,000 project.
“We were so dependent upon our relationships we built,” Coates said. “It was just so shocking and disheartening when you’re getting these declines in the email.”
Though most didn’t say it outright, Coates said he could “read between the lines” that the sponsors’ decisions to cancel their support stemmed from the cuts to and dismantling of DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — programs.
But Coates worked to keep the funding cuts from dampening the celebration. It expanded from one day to two, and he expects about 3,000 people will attend the parade in downtown Annapolis on Saturday and more than 12,000 will come to the festival at the Anne Arundel County Fairgrounds.
“We’ve had hardships before, and yet in the midst of it, we celebrated,” he said. “We won’t put the spotlight on what’s been cut, but what we’re able to do despite those challenges.”
Annapolis Juneteenth’s financial struggles are not unique. Many Juneteenth celebrations across the country have been forced to scale back as they face decreased corporate sponsorships and lowered government support.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Still, not all events have fared as Annapolis has. Organizers of other Juneteenth celebrations across the state, from the National Harbor to the Eastern Shore, said their events have remained steady — or even gained more support than last year.
Lauren Fells, the marketing content manager at National Harbor and the organizer of its Juneteenth celebration, said the event has gained sponsors this year.
After starting with just one sponsor for the first event in 2022, Fells said this year’s celebration gained three more, including Ben & Jerry’s and the MGM National Harbor. She expects between 500 and 1,000 people will attend the event Thursday.
“Every year seems to be where more people are interested in really wanting to make sure that they are a part of the community, and they reach out through these types of cultural events,” Fells said.
Juneteenth, the nation’s newest federal holiday, is celebrated on June 19 each year and honors the ending of slavery in the U.S. The date commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger led troops to Galveston, Texas, where they delivered the news that the Civil War had ended and the enslaved were free.
After more than 150 years without nationwide recognition, former U.S. President Joe Biden declared Juneteenth a federal holiday in 2021.
Makya Purnell, the president and co-founder of Eastern Shore Juneteenth, said the celebration has grown significantly since the organization’s first event in 2018. After starting in a cultural center’s backyard, the organization hosts its parade and festival in downtown Salisbury.
While the celebration on Saturday has three fewer sponsors this year, Purnell said she didn’t know whether there was a political reason for their lack of support or not. Overall, she said the event has remained steady.
Purnell said larger events which rely on corporate sponsors may have been more impacted than celebrations like Eastern Shore Juneteenth, as its sponsors are primarily local.
Speaker’s bill would make social equity part of state government, literally

“When you build those local relationships, I don’t think that there’s going to be much impact,” she said.
But some celebrations scaled back for different reasons.
The NAACP’s Allegany County branch, which usually hosts an annual festival and parade, opted for a smaller community BBQ after focusing much of its efforts this year on turning a historically Black playground in Cumberland into a community garden.
Tifani Fisher, president of the chapter, said the group will host a new festival this September which will highlight the experience of being Black in Appalachian Maryland. The chapter’s Juneteenth festival will return next year, however.
But Fisher said she has seen the second Trump administration and cutbacks to DEI programs created a sense of wariness among donors and corporate sponsors.
“We haven’t experienced that here locally, and part of that is that we’re just a tight-knit community,” Fisher said. “Those who have supported our Juneteenth festival and the branch’s work are still those who support that.”
LaTisha Gasaway-Paul, president of the Scotland Juneteenth Heritage Festival, said the weeklong celebration in Montgomery County has continuously grown since 2021. The festival has added three new events this year, and has also grown in sponsors, increasing to 17 this year from about a dozen last year, she said.
The festival, which she said drew more than 10,000 people across all its events last year, is located in Scotland, a historically Black community in the Potomac area of Montgomery County. The community started off as 36 acres purchased in 1880 by Gasaway-Paul’s great-great grandfather, William Dove.
After a surge in development in Potomac in the 1960s, she said local residents tried to force the Scotland community off their land, leading to the creation of a campaign to protect the community. She said she feels the weight of preserving her community and its legacy.
Gasaway-Paul said that for her, Juneteenth is more than just a date on a calendar.
“It’s the date that we endure the spirit of the ancestors, the resilience of our people and the promise of a future fate shaped by justice, truth and unity,” Gasaway-Paul said. “It’s the sacred remembrance of freedom.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1499842189-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-19 13:16:19.657703

(Photo: Angela Dennis)As cities across Tennessee prepare for Juneteenth celebrations with banners unfurling, vendors setting up, and leaders finalizing programs honoring Black liberation, a deeper question lingers: What does it mean to celebrate freedom in a state restricting how that freedom’s history is taught?
In Tennessee, state lawmakers have gutted DEI programs, banned books by Black authors, and restricted how teachers can talk about race and history in the classroom.
This year’s celebrations have also come with cutbacks. Across the country, Juneteenth events have been scaled back due to shrinking DEI funding, canceled federal grants and  retreat from corporate support for racial justice initiatives.
For many Black educators, organizers, and students, the policies feel like a modern day echo of the delayed freedom Juneteenth was created to mark. It represents a continued struggle for true freedom and liberation.
 

“The attacks on our history, on information, professors, universities and on teachers, are horrifying,” said Tennessee State Rep. Justin Pearson. “One of the first tools of oppression is to deny the education of people. In this moment in Tennessee and across the country, we are seeing policies and practices that are very harmful to our society’s memory about how we have gotten to where we are.”
On June 19, 1865, enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been free for more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. That delay in freedom highlights, for many, the same struggle seen today as laws and policies seek to suppress the teaching of Black history and limit the freedom of education.
What began as a regional celebration has grown into a national symbol of Black freedom, with Juneteenth becoming a federal holiday in 2021, signed into law by President Joe Biden. Gov. Bill Lee signed a law recognizing Juneteenth as a state holiday in 2023.
“Recognizing Juneteenth as a state holiday, while passing laws that harm Black communities, reveals deep hypocrisy,” said Pearson. “We’re still trapped by systems, academically, environmentally, politically, and civically, despite being technically free.”
For other community leaders, the recognition of Juneteenth as a federal holiday is significant but raises important questions about the intent and timing of such a move.
Chris Woodhull, a longtime civic leader in East Tennessee, reflected on how he and others were teaching the significance of Juneteenth decades ago, long before it gained national visibility.
“Back in the ’90s, I was teaching about Juneteenth with young people through our organization called Tribe One,” Woodhull said. “We were talking about emancipation and the legacy of slavery before it was popular.”
  “Recognizing Juneteenth as a state holiday, while passing laws that harm Black communities, reveals deep hypocrisy,” said Rep. Justin Pearson, a Memphis Democrat. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
When Juneteenth was made a federal holiday in 2021, Woodhull couldn’t help but notice the timing after the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer — and subsequent uprisings —and growing momentum behind the movement to defund the police.
“Juneteenth became a federal holiday not in a vacuum but in the wake of George Floyd’s death, when people were in the streets demanding justice, systemic change, and real transformation,” he said.
While he appreciates the symbolism of the recognition, Woodhull said it felt, in part, like a concession, a gesture meant to appease, rather than challenge systems of power. Still, Woodhull believes Juneteenth holds real significance, especially when it’s rooted in truth and history.
“There are a lot of well-meaning people who want to celebrate Juneteenth but don’t really understand what it means,” he said. “We can’t afford for it to become just another day off. The challenge is to make sure we’re not just marking the day but honoring the story, and the struggle behind it.”
In recent years, Tennessee lawmakers have passed sweeping legislation targeting the teaching of race, diversity and Black history. In 2021, the state passed a law banning divisive concepts in public education, followed by restrictions in 2022 on mandatory DEI training in higher education. These measures were followed by further legislation in 2025 aimed at dismantling DEI programs across the state.
Book bans and curriculum restrictions have also spread across Tennessee. In January 2022, McMinn County removed the Pulitzer-winning graphic novel Maus from its eighth-grade curriculum.
That same year, Hamilton County established a review board to evaluate books for “offensiveness,” leading to the removal of titles with Black and LGBTQ+ voices. In Knoxville, 113 books, including Push by Black author Sapphire, were pulled from schools. Wilson County removed nearly 400 books, including works by Toni Morrison, while Nashville’s public libraries responded by promoting banned books during Banned Books Week. In Chattanooga, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas was also removed.
Despite political efforts to restrict classroom content, educators across Tennessee are finding ways to teach Juneteenth and center Black freedom.
“Juneteenth has always been a topic I discussed in my classes,” said Dr. Learotha Williams, associate professor of African American and Public History at Tennessee State University and director of the North Nashville Heritage Project. “It’s one of those celebrations that has persisted.”
Williams believes Black history must extend beyond traditional classrooms. His courses split time between lectures and community exploration, including visits to historic sites. At Hadley Park Community Center in Nashville, he also led a community course on Black Nashville, taking community members to former enslaved markets and lynching sites. He draws that inspiration from Carter G. Woodson — the author and historian known as the “Father of Black History” — who urged scholars to consider whether their work uplifts or alienates the communities they study.

“That was one of the most rewarding teaching experiences I’ve ever had,” he said. “It involved students and many elders in the community engaging directly with their city’s history.”
In Knoxville, Melody Hawkins, a nationally recognized and award-winning educator, sees Juneteenth as an opportunity for reflection and liberation in classrooms, despite growing restrictions on educators like herself
“Whenever people hear about all the banned books, there’s this assumption that it means we can’t still do the work,” she said. “But you can still be affirming. We just call it being good teachers.”
She believes the focus should be less about restricted terminology and more about how educators show up for their students.
“Juneteenth teaches us about our history and also helps us build classrooms where Black students feel safe, valued, and free to thrive,” she said.
Her upcoming book, Black Girl in the Middle, explores how race and gender bias shape education for Black girls, particularly in middle school. While educators didn’t create the systems that marginalize students, Hawkins says, “we’re still responsible for how we respond to them.”
In East Tennessee, Black in Appalachia, an educational organization, preserves and amplifies Black history and community stories in the region, especially in rural areas where much of the history is whitewashed. Director William Isom sees the current climate as part of a larger historical pattern of erasure.
“From my perspective, none of this is new. This repression is just a continuation of our history,” he said.
Isom points to Reconstruction as a parallel.












Juneteenth strengthens the whole idea of the American narrative and any effort to erase the difference in perspectives around this significant day.


– Adam Dickson, Langston Centre




“If local archives and historical societies looked closely at how their communities were shaped by Reconstruction, and its dismantling, they’d see the throughline.”
His advice is to focus on community record-keeping.
“Everyday people creating their own records, sharing their family stories, can be more powerful than anything an organization can do.”
Adam Dickson, Cultural Director of the Langston Centre in Johnson City, runs a monthly public series called Community History 365. He believes the burden of preserving and teaching Black history now rests heavily on local communities.
“Juneteenth strengthens the whole idea of the American narrative and any effort to erase the difference in perspectives around this significant day,”  Dickson said.“For so long, the Black perspective around Juneteenth had been ignored. That’s why it’s such a pivotal moment and never really considered as it should have been so it was a pivotal moment.”
For Pearson, embracing Juneteenth is also about Black joy. He said it’s as essential as any political or educational fight.
“There’s a song that says, ‘This joy that I have, the world did not give it to me, and the world can’t take it away,’” he said. “We are still here, despite everything that has been done to diminish our humanity. That’s good news. And we have a responsibility to carry the spirit of those who came before us, both in our struggles and in our celebrations. Because they persevered, we can persevere. Because they sacrificed, we can serve. Because they gave, we can do more.”

I’ve worn a mask the entirety of my college career, far outlasting my peers and others. Being one of only a few people still masking has been a major part of my routine almost every time I leave my house. 
I just like wearing it, even if I’m the only one in the room doing so.
Given how divisive masking was for a time and how so many people were quick to ditch them the second they could, it surprises me that I never got many comments about why I was still masking. It seems like it just became part of the culture, though the assumption now is that you only mask when sick. 


But I don’t really care what people might think of me if they see me in a mask. It’s a free (somewhat) country and masking is still a viable way to protect against viruses.
I’ve greatly enjoyed how masking has prevented me from getting colds these past few years. Back in middle school and high school, it used to be typical for me to get four or five colds a year when cold and flu season rolled around. No matter how hard I tried, it was inevitable I’d get sick and I hated it. But masking proved very effective indeed. 
My pride in not having any more colds was shattered in early 2023 when I caught one from a friend’s brother as we were playing Uno. I became stricter with myself when it came to masking as I recovered. At least when I masked while sick, I could prevent myself from passing it on to others.

Masking has also given me a sense of privacy. I’m usually a rather shy and dislike being looked at. Ever since I was young, I preferred to not be visible to others. Face masks provided me an opportunity to have a sense of the anonymity I craved. Even after most people stopped wearing masks and I surely was sticking out because I was still masking, I still had my privacy. 
Seeing me in-person, you don’t know how I fully look and I can act with greater agency in letting you get closer or not.
It’s been fun to show off my collection of face masks over the course of my college career. I got most of them between 2020 and 2022 and have just cycled through them over the years. During the height of masking, it was fun to see people come up with designs for their masks. If we were going to be required to wear them, we would do so with style. That was the popular attitude I subscribed to at the time. And honoring my collection by showing them all off was how I could express myself at college. Not only was I the perpetual mask wearer, but I was wearer of interesting masks. 
Masking has also benefitted me in terms of avoiding COVID. The only times I’ve gotten COVID was when I didn’t mask properly. The summer of 2022, my family went to Disney World for vacation and were wearing masks. In Animal Kingdom, I was wearing my mask kind of loosely and started to feel stuffy. I tried not to think of the implications and adjusted my mask. The next morning, I woke up feeling certain I was sick and did test positive for COVID. It was a week before classes for my sophomore year started.
In fall 2024, in the first week of classes of my senior year, I had a slight feeling of being sick. When I went home and tested myself, the COVID test came back positive. Déjà vu. My mom said she had it, and that she’d likely caught it while we were at the airport as we returned home from our vacation. Each time a family member or I got COVID strengthened my resolve to continue wearing the mask.
I’m not as worried about COVID as I used to be. I am lucky to be healthy enough to get through with little trouble. But it still is worth it to be careful and considerate of others who have compromised immune systems. It remains important to slow the spread of this disease that is still very present and affecting people to this day, even if it is on a much smaller scale than in previous years.
It’s not particularly enjoyable to still wear a mask. But masking still remains a recommended practice to prevent the spread of COVID. Even after the end of the public health emergency that the COVID-19 pandemic caused, we still live in its shadow every day. I mask regularly when I go out by myself, but I’ve slowly stopped when I’m out with friends or family. 
Maybe I’ll remove to mask for good one of these days but for now I keep at it because I like it.

Picnics. Family outings. Special jazz concerts sponsored by Black sororities and social clubs.
In those days, Juneteenth was an intra-communal gathering, shared between us like secret knowledge, because we knew the story behind the tradition. In June 1865, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation, and months following the Confederate surrender in the Civil War, Union General Gordon Granger finally reached a group of slaves in Galveston, Texas. These enslaved people did not know that the South had lost the Civil War. General Granger informed them they were free. The enlightened former slaves threw a joyous celebration, which became alternately known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day or (today) Juneteenth.
It was originally celebrated every June 19 in Texas. Its popularity spread throughout Black communities in the 1930s when it represented the aspirations of Black Americans who knew they were liberated from slavery, yet lacked full equality. The Fourth of July represented independence, in the sense of breaking from England, while Juneteenth symbolized freedom in both a legalistic and spiritual sense — freedom from slavery before the next step toward full humanity.
In 2023, I was the main speaker at the annual Juneteenth event sponsored by the City of Santa Fe, NM, at which Mayor Alan Webber officially proclaimed Juneteenth Day locally. I reiterated the classic script, describing Juneteenth’s origin, but I also used to the occasion to discuss how New Mexico still had a way to go achieving freedom from hunger, child poverty and the malaise of substance abuse. This is the narrative that Juneteenth bequeaths to the country, since becoming a national event: Celebrate social and economic justice, and believe someday it is coming!
There is no doubt in my mind that this country needs a federal holiday like this one, encouraging the populace to address perceived forms of oppression, with belief that they can survive the travails and, in the end, achieve redemption and renewal. Freedom is both specific, to a particular set of circumstances, and universal, which is why Juneteenth eventually spoke to the hearts and minds of all Americans.
This year, however, the holiday arrives at a time when President Trump is waging an unprecedented war on civil rights, first amendment rights, free speech rights, academic freedom, or the freedom to protest. The administration uses executive orders to force government grantees to desist engaging in speech the administration dislikes, including anything that honors diversity, equity or inclusion; seriously addresses climate change; or highlights the LGBTQ community.
It arrives at a time when Trump’s ICE agents engage in massive raids that terrorize Latino communities, indiscriminately ordering civilians inside unmarked vans and “disappearing” immigrants who have positively contributed to American society. Following protests that erupted against ICE raids in Los Angeles, California Gov. Gavin Newsom accurately critiqued Trump’s immigration policy, asserting that Trump’s methods do more harm than good because, “Instead of focusing on undocumented immigrants with serious criminal records and people with final deportation orders — a strategy both parties have long supported — this administration is pushing mass deportations. Indiscriminately targeting hardworking immigrant families, regardless of their roots or risk. What’s happening right now is very different than anything we’ve seen before.”
With increasing authoritarianism, without consulting California government officials, Trump deployed National Guardsmen and marines to Los Angeles using tear gas and rubber bullets. This move against the populace (which Gov. Newsom called “a reckless deployment of American troops to a major American city”) is among the many ways that the administration discourages citizens from engaging in legal protest or enjoying free speech.
This year, we will celebrate freedom from chattel slavery. We will celebrate a victory for humanity. But the celebration is shadowed by an awareness that bondage can take other forms. It is fear of being arrested, economically disenfranchised or “disappeared.” Fear that the country is inching towards totalitarianism is against the spirit of Juneteenth.

Jeff Hood is “determined to let people know you’re killing my friend.”
Those are the people he’s grown close to before witnessing their executions — a dozen so far and a number that continues to grow as Mississippi prepares to put 79-year-old Richard Jordan to death and the death penalty continues being handed down in over half of all states, particularly the South.
Hood is a spiritual adviser who accompanies death row inmates to their executions, praying for them and sharing last words with them as a culmination of a months-, sometimes years-long relationship. 
By doing that, Hood said he can bring members of the public as close to the execution chamber as they can get and see the impact of the death penalty.  
To date, he has witnessed 11 executions: four in Oklahoma, three in Alabama, two in Texas,  one in Missouri and one in Florida. 
It’s something he may be called to do one day in Mississippi. Hood is not Jordan’s spiritual adviser, but he has communicated with a member of Jordan’s family and he plans to travel to Parchman to pray outside on June 25 if Jordan’s scheduled execution goes through, just as he did in 2022 for the execution of Thomas Loden, a Marine Corps recruiter who kidnapped, sexually assaulted and killed a 16-year-old waitress.

He and advocates have spoken out against Jordan’s scheduled execution, questioning whether it makes sense to see someone who is almost 80 as a safety risk and the fact it’s been 48 years since he was first convicted of capital murder in the kidnapping and death of Edwina Marter in Harrison County. 
He participated in a video released by the Mississippi Office of Capital Post-Conviction Council in which Jordan shares his story and asks the state to commute his sentence to life without the possibility of parole. In the video, Jordan says he was a model citizen until he returned after three tours in the Vietnam War. His defense has argued that he suffered post-traumati striss disorder from the war, a view bolstered on the video by Jordan’s younger siblings — brother Houston Jordan and sister Nordeen Jones — who said he was kind and a role model to them. Former schoolmates, ministers and a retired corrections officer also appear on the video, talking about Jordan’s willingness to help others.
‘Whatever you did to the least of these’
Hood grew up in Georgia in a Southern Baptist family and studied theology. As he studied in Atlanta, he was part of organizing against the 2011 execution of Troy Davis, who maintained his innocence to the end in the murder of a Savannah police officer. 
Connecting with death row inmates and being present at their deaths is something he said he was called by God to do, saying the work aligns with Matthew 25:40: “(W)hatever you did for the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” 
Hood can’t think of a group that embodies “the least of these” more than those sentenced to death. He said he shows them the love of God and encourages them to have the courage to live, even if they have weeks or months left and people want them to be executed. 
“It’s my job to make them hungry to live,” Hood said. “I think that is the greatest resistance possible.”
Innocence isn’t a requirement to work with someone, and he said he will love someone “irrespective of what they’ve done.” But Hood said that doesn’t mean there haven’t been difficult interactions or that he doesn’t think about victims’ families and the severity of death row inmates’ crimes. 
Hood sees how nearly 50 years of waiting for an execution has been torture for any victim’s family, especially the Marters. 
Eric Marter, the elder son of Edwina and Charles Marter, was 11 years old and his younger brother was 4 when their mother died. 
He said it’s been so long and he would have preferred Jordan to have been executed years ago. Over the years of his appeals, Marter said he hasn’t made his ongoing legal case and whether an execution happens a priority. 
“At this point in my life, maybe 30 years ago I may have had more interest in wanting him to be executed,”said Marter, who is 59 and lives in Louisiana. 
“But at this particular point, I don’t really want to waste my time thinking about him.” 
A ‘moral sacrifice’ to be in that chamber’

Spiritual advisers like Hood have been allowed to be in the room and stand alongside the condemned since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with a Texas death row inmate who sued for the right to have his pastor beside him.  
June 10 was the executions of Anthony Wainwright in Florida and Gregory Hunt in Alabama. As both of their spiritual advisors, Hood said the states put him in a position to have to choose whose to attend and break a promise. He was with Wainwright at his execution. 
The week before that, he was on the road and traveled from his home in Arkansas to Alabama and Florida to be with the men and organize against the death penalty with local advocates. From a virtual event streamed from his car June 6, Hood raised issues about violations of Hunt’s and Wainwright’s spiritual liberty and constitutional rights. 
Like Mississippi, most death penalty states use lethal injection, but others are starting to use lethal gas and firing range. Since 2022, Mississippi allows those methods along with the electric chair, but lethal injection is the state’s preference.
Jordan continues to challenge the constitutionality of the drugs Mississippi uses for lethal injection through a federal lawsuit. 
Last year, Hood witnessed the “horror show” execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith in Alabama by nitrogen gas. The pastor remembers seeing Smith start to heave back and forth violently as soon as the gas hit his face, his veins looking like ants under his skin. Smith thrashed against the restraints, and Hood remembers crying – something not typical for him. 
Even if an execution has not been scheduled, Hood stays in contact with two dozen people on death rows around the country. Some call him several times a week and on specific days. 
His contact includes seven in Mississippi, including Willie Manning – for whom the state is seeking an execution date – and others who are still pursuing legal challenges such as Willie Godbolt and Lisa Jo Chamberlin. 
Chamberlin, convicted of two counts of capital murder in 2006, is the only woman on death row in the state, and Hood said he reached out to her knowing a bit about her story and that she needed help. What he found was someone who “desperately needed a friend” and whose mental health suffers because she is isolated.

Unlike death row in Parchman where most of the men are together, Chamberlin is kept on her own in a maximum security unit in the women’s prison at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility. Hood said that often means Chamberlin spends hours in her cell or time in the dayroom on her own. 
Ahead of Jordan’s execution, Hood has called out elected officials like Gov. Tate Reeves, Attorney General Lynn Fitch and justices of the Mississippi Supreme Court for allowing executions to happen but not having to attend or witness them. 
“There’s a moral sacrifice it takes to be in that chamber,” Hood said. 
When he stands beside the condemned, Hood prays and tells them how sorry he is that he wasn’t able to stop the execution. And each time he leaves, he said it’s as if he leaves a piece of his soul behind. 
The next execution might be scheduled in a matter of days, weeks or months, so he doesn’t have much time to recover. Continuing to intervene in executions and speak out against the death penalty also makes him the target of threats and potentially puts his family at risk. Hood is married and the father of five children.
But Hood takes on the risks to his wellbeing and health and sees it as a privilege to work with people on death row and do something he cares about. 
“The spiritual adviser can either be silent about what is happening,” he said. “… (Or) they can speak up and resist the evil that is happening.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/28173619/Death-penalty-protest-3.jpg,,,2025-06-19 12:18:59.420722

WILMINGTON— Delaware Shakespeare is reimagining a comedy favorite with Twelfth Night, O Lo Que Quieras, a bilingual musical adaptation set to run July 17 through August 3 at Rockwood Park as part of the 2025 Summer Festival. 
The production blends English, Spanish, and “Fake-speare,” combining Shakespeare’s classic language with vibrant original music and Latin American influences.
The story follows Venezuelan twins Violeta and Sebastian, who are separated after a shipwreck on the island of Illyria. As Illyria undergoes a political shift, the twins and local residents grapple with protest, power, and identity in a narrative that Ghant says “felt so necessary and important right now.”
Mariah Ghant, Delaware Shakespeare’s Producing Artistic Director, said the musical has been years in the making. Originally developed for the organization’s Community Tour in 2022, the show was born out of a creative challenge extended by former artistic director David Stradley to co-creator Liz Filios. That idea evolved into a full musical with contributions from Tanaquil Márquez, Robi Hager, and Ximena Violante.
“Liz quickly started to feel like the story really spoke to a Latinx, Spanish-speaking group of folks,” Ghant said. “She brought in Tana Márquez, a Latinx playwright and director, and together they built this beautiful, bilingual adaptation.”
Performing a musical outdoors for the first time at Rockwood Park presents new challenges, Ghant noted, especially in terms of sound projection and musical clarity.
“It’s a lot more breath work, a lot more preparation to make sure that the music is being heard clearly,” she said. “Singing and performing outdoors is incredibly different than just doing Shakespeare outdoors.”

The festival typically draws 1,500 to 3,000 attendees across its three-week run, and Rockwood Park’s expansive, sloped grounds offer plenty of space for lawn chairs and large audiences.
This year’s schedule includes special events like Pay What You Will Wednesdays, Family Night Sundays (offering free admission for children under 12 with a paid adult), LGBTQIA+ and BILAM+ Night on July 23, and a Relaxed Performance—a welcoming, “shush-free” show—on July 27.
Ghant hopes the production will connect with audiences of all backgrounds, even those unfamiliar with Shakespeare or Spanish.
“A lot of people think Shakespeare isn’t for them. But as long as you’re willing to be open and see the story, you’ll probably find pieces of yourself in it,” she said. “You don’t have to understand every word. It’s about sitting with the story—and the actors, the music, they really let you in.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-DelShakes-TwelfthNight-IGFeed-1080x1440-rev01-1-2-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-06-19 12:18:59.420722

(Provided, SC State Ports Authority, Walter Lagarenne)MOUNT PLEASANT — It’s a simple economic reality: The number of cargo containers moving through the Port of Charleston closely mirrors growth — or declines — in consumer spending.
Not so simple is U.S. trade policy and President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff pronouncements.
That has the S.C. State Ports Authority looking at a wide-ranging forecast for cargo volumes in the coming fiscal year, which starts July 1.
“If we have a good sense of where durable goods spending will be in the coming months, we can estimate what pier container volumes look like,” said Joey Von Nessen, a research economist with the Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina.
  Joey Von Nessen is a research economist at the University of South Carolina (Provided, University of South Carolina)
Von Nessen, who presented his forecast Tuesday for the authority’s board of directors, said positive trends in spending will go head-to-head with erratic tariff policies over the coming 12 months.
Depending on which factor prevails, Von Nessen sees the number of pier containers moving through Charleston’s terminals ranging from a little more than 1.3 million on the low side and a maximum of 1.5 million in fiscal 2026.
For budgeting purposes, the authority’s board voted to split Von Nessen’s forecast in the middle, with the expectation of about 1.4 million pier containers — that is cargo boxes of all sizes — for the coming fiscal year.
That’s unchanged from the 1.4 million containers the port will see by the time the current fiscal year comes to a close at month’s end.
“With so much uncertainty in our industry and the broader market, we are anticipating mostly flat growth for FY26,” the authority said in a statement.
The past few months have seen stable or growing cargo volumes, and the authority expects a stronger summer as some shippers rush to get goods to market while tariffs are paused.
“The outlook is uncertain after that,” the authority said. “We plan to reevaluate our outlook in January and may reforecast then, depending on the broader market.”
Barbara Melvin, the ports authority’s president and CEO, said regardless of short-term economic situations “the port is a long-cycle business.”
“We are investing today to have the capacity to support our customers for decades to come,” she said.
Von Nessen said a surge in consumer spending during the pandemic years created an artificial bubble — boosted by stimulus dollars — that has largely deflated.
That means people are now in the mood to start buying again. They just might not have the means.
“It turns out we haven’t seen that much growth this year because of the impact of tariffs and changes in trade policy,” he said. “That’s had an impact on prices.”
The cumulative growth in U.S. prices has topped 25% since May 2025 while wages have increased at just a 20% clip during that time.
Tariffs will raise prices even more, “which can make it harder for consumers to continue to spend at current levels,” Von Nessen said.
“The primary headwind is the potential rebounding of inflation due to tariff activity,” he added. “That’s the No. 1 metric to watch.”
The National Retail Federation is forecasting higher inflation that will impact spending.
“Consumers are seeing their way through the uncertainty with trade policies, but expect the inflation associated with tariffs to be felt later this year,” Jack Kleinhenz, the federation’s chief economist, said in a statement. “Consumers remain very price sensitive, and those costs are likely to weigh heavily on consumer budgets.”
Charleston’s port, while impacted by national trends, will be somewhat buffered by population and economic growth in the Southeast, which is outpacing every other U.S. region.
It’s a key reason credit ratings firm S&P Global affirmed the authority’s A-plus rating while downgrading the U.S. port industry as a whole.
“Despite the back and forth and uncertainty that we’ve seen emerge in 2025, as we look ahead this does nothing to change our long-run bullishness on South Carolina and the Southeast,” Von Nessen said. “We have strong economic competitiveness in this region primarily because of the population growth that we’re seeing.”
The ports authority’s board also approved a $294 million capital plan for fiscal 2026 that will support completion of the Navy Base Intermodal Facility where cargo containers will be transferred between trucks and trains.
The budget also includes money for the second phase of the adjacent Leatherman Terminal in North Charleston and upgrades to Columbus Street Terminal in Charleston to alleviate flooding concerns.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cargo-ships-at-wando-1024x366.jpg,,,2025-06-19 12:18:59.420722

(Photo by David Wren/SC Daily Gazette)MOUNT PLEASANT — The $550 million in taxpayer funding that South Carolina lawmakers set aside for two projects at the Port of Charleston will now be used for just one — a rail-based cargo hub adjacent to the Leatherman Terminal in North Charleston.
The Navy Base Intermodal Facility, where cargo containers will be transferred between trucks and trains, is over budget and behind schedule.
The State Ports Authority said this week the project’s budget now totals $545 million — up from an original $349 million price tag three years ago.
Legislators want to know more about SC Ports projects delays, cost overruns

The cost overrun means a second project that was supposed to be funded by the taxpayer dollars — a $150 million barge facility to move containers between port terminals by river instead of trucks — is on indefinite hold.
The remaining $51 million from the 2022 general fund appropriation went to pay off a loan used for early planning documents related to the cargo hub.
The Joint Bond Review Committee’s fiscal accountability subcommittee will meet with ports authority leaders in July to hear an update on the projects. That meeting of the legislative oversight panel has not yet been scheduled.
It’s not clear what legislators will say about the barge project’s suspension.
Those interviewed by the SC Daily Gazette said they are still trying to get up to speed on the ventures ahead of next month’s meeting.
However, the $550 million was given to the authority without a mandate that both projects are completed.
The ports authority said any further increases that could push the cargo hub’s price tag beyond $550 million will be paid for from the maritime agency’s own funds.
Part of the construction delay has been due to disagreements between CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern railroads over how their trains will access the container transfer site, which has been in the works for more than a decade.
Barbara Melvin, the authority’s president and CEO, has also blamed tariffs, trade uncertainties, a changing business climate and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that forces the ports authority to use union labor at new terminals — citing training issues — for the delay.
At this point, the 118-acre Navy Base Intermodal Facility is roughly 80% complete, with miles of new tracks and three of six electric, rail-mounted gantry cranes installed.
Concrete paving has finished, and new buildings and canopies have been completed.
Also, the Cosgrove Avenue Extension — an overpass and pedestrian bridge connecting North Charleston to the city’s Waterfront Park — will open in July. The project also includes other work to minimize the impact of rail traffic on local roads.
The ports authority has long lobbied for a rail-based cargo hub near its waterfront terminals, saying the lack of on-dock or near-dock rail puts the Port of Charleston at a disadvantage to other ports.
Charleston is the only major East Coast port without such rail access.
About 300,000 containers, or roughly one-fourth of the port’s annual total, are moved by rail each year, with trucks handling the rest.
The Navy Base Intermodal Facility will have the capacity to nearly triple that number while potentially eliminating thousands of tractor-trailer trips along local roads and state highways.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/nbif-3-1024x521.jpg,,,2025-06-19 12:18:59.420722

As summer temperatures rise and more Delawareans head outdoors, state health and environmental officials are warning of increased risks from ticks and tick-borne illnesses.
The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) and the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) are urging residents to take precautions to avoid tick bites, which can transmit serious diseases including Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and the increasingly reported Alpha-gal Syndrome (AGS).
According to DPH’s 2024 Vector-Borne Disease Surveillance Report, there were 344 reported cases of Lyme disease in Delaware last year.
The disease, which is transmitted by blacklegged ticks (also known as deer ticks), can cause symptoms ranging from fatigue and fever to joint pain and neurological complications if left untreated.
A telltale bullseye-shaped rash may appear at the site of the bite in some cases.
READ: Sussex County Council approves lower tax rate, $285.1M budget for fiscal year ’26
State health officials also noted a rise in AGS cases, a tick-related condition that can cause an allergic reaction to red meat.
The illness, linked primarily to the lone star tick, became a reportable condition in Delaware in December 2024 after more than 100 cases were documented in the latter half of the year.
“Defending yourself from ticks is not just about comfort, it’s about health,” said DPH Director Steven Blessing. “By following these simple, effective steps, you can protect yourself and your loved ones from tick bites and tick-borne illnesses, ensuring a safe and enjoyable summer.”
DNREC Tick Biologist Dr. Ashley Kennedy emphasized the growing diversity of tick species in the state.
Delaware is now home to at least 15 different tick species, possibly as many as 19, she pointed out.
The most common tick in Delaware is the lone star tick, which does not carry Lyme disease but can transmit ehrlichiosis and is strongly associated with AGS.
The American dog tick, another prevalent species, can spread spotted fever rickettsiosis.
Defending against ticks
Officials recommend preventive measures:

Dress smart: Wear long sleeves and pants, and tuck pants into socks when walking in wooded or grassy areas. Light-colored clothing helps spot ticks more easily.
Avoid tick habitats: Stick to the center of trails and steer clear of tall grass, leaf litter, and dense brush.
Use repellents: Apply EPA-approved insect repellents containing at least 20% DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus.
Conduct tick checks: After spending time outdoors, check yourself, children, and pets thoroughly. Pay close attention to warm, hidden areas like armpits and behind the knees.
Practice yard care: Keep grass trimmed, clear leaf litter, and use gravel or wood chips to separate play areas from wooded zones.

If a tick is found, experts advise removing it promptly with fine-tipped tweezers and cleaning the bite area. Anyone who develops a rash, fever, or flu-like symptoms within 30 days of a tick bite should consult a healthcare provider.
Delawareans are also encouraged to report tick encounters to DNREC and consider saving the tick for identification, which can aid in diagnosis if symptoms develop.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-19-at-11.19.56-AM.png,,,2025-06-19 12:18:59.420722

After the Egyptian and Indian, the Greek and Roman, the Teuton and Mongolian, the Negro is a sort of seventh son, born with a veil, and gifted with second-sight in this American world,—a world which yields him no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through the revelation of the other world. It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his twoness,—an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.
The history of the American Negro is the history of this strife,—this longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer self. In this merging he wishes neither of the older selves to be lost. He would not Africanize America, for America has too much to teach the world and Africa. He would not bleach his Negro soul in a flood of white Americanism, for he knows that Negro blood has a message for the world. He simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American, without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows, without having the doors of Opportunity closed roughly in his face.

(Kevin Hardy/Stateline)TOPEKA — Kansas farm income in 2025 is expected to be among the strongest in the last 20 years, bolstered by $2 billion in government payments for depressed crop prices and weather conditions, an agricultural economics expert said Tuesday.
“If you look at the inflation-adjusted farm income for 2025, it’s by far the largest we’ve seen in several years,” said Jennifer Ifft, professor and extension specialist in agricultural policy at Kansas State University. “What drove that sharp increase that we see from 2024 to 2025? The answer is government payments.”
Ifft spoke at a webinar about the outlook for farm income in Kansas and nationally, based on a report from the Rural and Farm Finance Policy Analysis Center at the University of Missouri and Kansas State University’s Department of Agricultural Economics.
Crop and livestock farmers face opposite market conditions, as livestock farmers are thriving amid strong demand while crop farmers face lower prices and high input costs, Ifft said.
“We’ve seen an increase of over $5 billion in livestock receipts since 2020,” she said. “On the crop side, you have seen a decline in crop receipts since 2020. These numbers are very much moving in opposite directions, even though crops have leveled off a little bit.”
Crop receipts fell about $1.6 billion from 2020 to 2025, according to a chart Ifft shared. Data in 2025 is projected.
“Somebody recently reminded me that there’s never been a year when all farms are doing well, and I think that’s especially true this year, and it’s especially important to look under the hood to understand what’s happening with these numbers,” Ifft said.
Although crop farm expenses have decreased, they are still high compared to previous years, she said.
“In 2015, fertilizer expenses have come down, but they’re still 28% higher than the long-run average,” Ifft said. “Pesticides … have come down in 2025, and they’re still 30% higher than that long-run average.”
The long-run average was determined from fertilizer and pesticide expenses from 2006 to 2024.
Ifft highlighted government payments made in recent years, including during the first Trump administration after trade tariffs affected sales; in 2020-2021 related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and those approved at the end of 2024 that will be paid this year related to economic losses for some crop farms and disaster payments.
Gregg Ibendahl, K-State associate professor of agricultural economics, shared data that narrowed Kansas numbers down to a farm level, using information collected from farmers who are part of the Kansas Farm Management Association.
He noted that in 2024, without government payments, about half of Kansas farms in his data would have lost money.
Ibendahl said the current global situation affects farm income projections.
“Some other issues to maybe think about or worry about, is what’s going to happen with the oil supply,” he said, adding that there are wars involving two of the biggest areas in the world where oil is produced, Russia and Ukraine, and now the Middle East conflict between Israel and Iran.
“Surprisingly, though, with the fact that we have two major conflicts going on in two of the major oil-producing areas of the world, oil is still in the $70 range,” Ibendahl said. “I don’t know if the traders are being a little optimistic. They kind of got burned a little bit when the Ukraine war first started, because they had jacked up oil prices into about the $130 range. Turns out that it really didn’t affect Russia’s ability to produce oil.”
If oil prices would escalate quickly, it would affect diesel and fertilizer prices, he said.
 National outlook

Kansas parallels what is happening across the country.
“The bottom line at the national level is that we are seeing short- and medium-term pain for field crops because of lower prices, sticky costs,” said Alejandro Plastina, director of the Rural and Farm Finance Policy Analysis Center. “In the cattle sector, I would say the picture is better. There are limited supplies, mostly on beef and cattle production, high prices and lower feed costs than in the past, still high, but lower than the past.”
Plastina said government payments, specifically ad hoc payments made based on need to address situations such as weather events, were important in 2023 and 2024.
“At the aggregate level, we are projecting higher net farm income in 2025,” he said. “But there’s a lot of uncertainty regarding the impact of tariffs and trades, whether we will have a farm bill this year, reconciliation and what it will look like, and then what’s next? That’s a big question for us.”
Like Ifft, Plastina said government support from 2023 and 2024 being paid out this year will increase net farm income.
“In the absence of another round of big ad hoc, direct government payments in 2026, which there’s no sign or signal at this point that they might occur —  without those payments, net farm income would decline by 20% in 2026 to be barely above what we have as an estimate for 2024,” he said.
Of the $41 billion in net farm increase predicted in 2025, $33 billion of it is in government payments, Plastina said.
“Net farm income is up for one time in 2025 for those who will receive the payments, but managing that cash flow generated in 2025 to cushion the drop in margins going forward, I think will be critical for the ag sector,” he said.

States will not be allowed to enforce any law for a 10-year period, “limiting, restricting, or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate commerce.” The bill text also says states could not enforce artificial intelligence laws during the moratorium.
Montana is a leader in artificial intelligence legislation according to one legislator who driving much of the state’s legislation. Both Republicans and Democrats expressed concern this week the provisions in the Big Beautiful Bill Act could undo progress when it comes to protecting privacy and as a potential state rights issue.
Artificial intelligence is not an issue following traditional party lines, and some U.S. Senators are trying to send that message. On Wednesday, Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, and Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti held a joint Zoom press conference on the issue.
Blackburn spoke, Cantwell answered a variety of questions, and the attorneys general talked about some of the laws they’ve had on the books and the impact a ban could have. 
“Hopefully, as a result of those laws there, there are guardrails baked in that prevent the worst abuses that we fear,” Skrmetti said in response to a Daily Montanan question. “But this is a technology still in its infancy, and the earlier the law can shape the contours of what products provide, the safer people will be. And if we lose the ability for the states to regulate that, you know, Congress, even moving as fast as it can, will not be able to keep up with all of the risks.”
Montana artificial intelligence legislation was held up as an example of some of the laws that could become unenforceable during the press conference. None of Montana’s federal delegation returned a request for comment on this story.
The Treasure State has a slate of artificial intelligence laws on the books, many crafted or pushed by state Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, a Billings Republican, who has been a leader on the issue. Zolnikov, along with Rep. Jill Cohenour, a Helena Democrat, and Rep. Braxton Mitchell, a Flathead Republican, all saw artificial intelligence bills signed by Gov. Greg Gianforte. 
The Republican governor famously sold RightNow Technologies to Oracle for $1.5 billion in 2011, an acquisition that likely helped kickstart Bozeman’s push toward becoming a technology hub.
“Regulation tends to follow, not lead,” Gianforte said during a press conference on April 24 when asked about tech legislation during the session. “So I think we have to be careful as we look at regulations, that we don’t impede the adoption of new innovations. If there’s a problem, let’s fix it.”
Under the 10-year moratorium, Montana might not be able to fix things.
During the April press conference, the governor also pointed to a bill studying social media impacts on mental health, using it as an example of a technological consequence “we could never have anticipated.” He advocated caution but said he wants the government to stay out of the way of advancements. 
Gianforte signed numerous laws passed in 2025 relating to artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, blockchain and data centers. This included limiting the state government usage of AI and the technology’s use in elections, as well as people’s rights to privacy and to compute.
In Montana, the issue and the reasons people have for their opinion on AI is varied. 
Data centers, which help run the digital modern world, need huge amounts of power and became a topic of discussion at the legislature. Montana’s utility monopoly is in the middle of a public rate case, and some are worried adding more tech infrastructure could make power even more expensive.
For others, it’s trying to protect the average Montanan. That’s where Rep. Coenhour’s approach on the issue comes from including a bill to protect people’s personal data, called name, image, and likeness. On that bill, HB 514, she also worked with the governor’s office, specifically Lt. Gov. Kristen Juras, on amendments to help get it to pass. Juras did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Cohenour, along with Sen. Laura Smith, another Helena Democrat, pushed for bills against fabricated explicit images, such as fake sexual images of teens being used more frequently as a bullying tactic.
“I’m scared. And I think Montanans should be scared about their data and the way they’re affected by AI working in these different systems,” Cohenour said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “It’s scary.”
Zolnikov’s said that Montana was putting artificial intelligence laws on the books because Congress has done little to regulate the issue. He’s expressed multiple times he feels Montana is far ahead of other states and the federal government on artificial intelligence and other new technologies.
He also expressed a little frustration that some states have fully banned certain artificial intelligence technologies, calling it “an overreaction.” Zolnikov, who believes in open sourcing of code and software over big tech companies controlling the entire industry, wants innovation, but wants sideboards as well.
“It’s kind of a Catch-22. They don’t want states to do it,” Zolnikov said. “They refuse to do it. Now they’re looking at a ban. What do you do?”
He’s well aware of the dangers it can bring, but said that America cannot get behind its “adversaries” in innovation by stifling artificial intelligence.
“There’s a whole other side to this coin,” Zolnikov said, “It’s way above my pay grade, I’ll put it that way.”
Mitchell, who often expresses his support for President Donald Trump, said that while he supports “99%” of the Big Beautiful Bill Act, the 10-year moratorium is not something he can support. He said it undermines the intent of HB 178, which limits government usage of AI.
“We shouldn’t be blocking states from protecting citizens against surveillance abuse, censorship, and tech-driven manipulation,” Mitchell wrote in an email on Wednesday. “I’ll keep standing for individual liberty and limited government, with or without a moratorium. Hopefully it’s stripped out in the Senate or when it goes back over to the House.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/capitolpeople-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-19 12:18:59.420722

(Carnegie Mellon University)COLUMBIA, S.C. – Edda Fields-Black was working on a book about rice plantations when she came across the story of a raid in Beaufort that freed more than 700 slaves from Lowcountry plantations.
The Carnegie Mellon University professor decided to pursue the story and, nearly a decade later, published “COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid, and Black Freedom During the Civil War,” which recently won the Pulitzer Prize for history.
Fields-Black first learned about the June 1863 raid reading an account by Minus Hamilton, who was an 88-year-old slave when the daring mission led by Tubman freed him. He told of how three steamships traveled up the river in the dead of night before sounding their whistles, sending slaves working on the neighboring plantations running to the river and to freedom.
Hamilton also talked about his awe at seeing fellow Black men in uniform for the first time, and that image struck Fields-Black.
“I was like, ‘Wow,’ and I tucked it away for a long time,” said Fields-Black, of Pittsburgh.

She tried to read more about the raid Hamilton recounted. But she found little beyond mentions here and there in biographies of Tubman, who’s best known as a conductor on the Underground Railroad.
So, she set out to write the history herself, telling it from the perspective of the raid’s participants and detailing the importance of the rice plantations in pulling it off, she said.
“I wanted to pull out all of those elements, and I thought that I could tell that story,” Fields-Black said.
“COMBEE,” the Gullah pronunciation of the Combahee River, won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize alongside “Native Nations: A Millennium in North American” by Kathleen DuVal in a category that rewards “a distinguished and appropriately documented book on the history of the United States,” according to the Pulitzer website.
The 776-page book told “a richly-textured and revelatory account” of the raid, “weaving military strategy and family history with the transition from bondage to freedom,” the prize’s jury wrote.
Harriet Tubman
Tubman, who became known as the Moses of Her People after escaping slavery herself in 1849, spoke about the Combahee River Raid during her life.
Her role in the raid made her the first woman ever to lead a major military operation in the U.S. and the only Black woman to lead troops during the Civil War. A statue of her unveiled in May 2024 at Beaufort’s Tabernacle Baptist Church commemorates her part in the raid and her years spent in Beaufort.
But historians, lacking official records, rarely delved into the details, Fields-Black said.
When she started telling friends and colleagues about her plans, they similarly insisted there was no way to tell the story from the perspective of enslaved people because no records of the raid existed. But they did exist — just not the kind most researchers rely on, she said.
 

“There’s a broader question about believing women, believing marginal people and taking our words and our descriptions of our own experiences at face value,” Fields-Black said. “And that hadn’t been done.”
The rice plantations, with their snakes and alligators, made Tubman’s work even more impressive. Other historians had written about the raid as if the environment were the same as in the more northern states where Tubman had worked, but as a researcher of rice fields, Fields-Black knew the specific challenges they presented.
“She could’ve been on the moon, and she would’ve figured out how to survive,” she said.
Finding the story
As she started to research in earnest, Fields-Black knew she couldn’t rely solely on the official military records of the raid, which were written by the Confederate troops controlling Beaufort at the time. Slave narratives from the 1930s mentioned the raid only in passing, and official records in Beaufort and Colleton counties were burned as cities went up in flames during the Civil War, she said.
Fields-Black turned instead to a lesser-used historical resource: pension files. Following the war, soldiers relayed information about themselves and their experiences in an attempt to receive payment from the government.
Among those submitting applications were members of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, a regiment consisting largely of freed men from the sea islands who drove boats up the Combahee River for enslaved people to board and escape.
Through scouring hundreds of pension files, Fields-Black came across a familiar name.
She had known about a Hector Fields from whom her family descended, but she had thought he lived in nearby Colleton County, not Beaufort. The pension files, however, told the story of Fields as a Civil War veteran who fought in the volunteer infantry, helped free slaves and eventually settled down in Colleton County, she said.
Fields-Black grew up in Florida, but she still has family in that area. Her own father was born in Green Pond, a small town in the same county, and the family’s roots in South Carolina are strong, she said.
The story “has become a source of immense pride in our family,” Fields-Black said.
Even after they were freed, many of the people in the raid returned to Confederate territory, risking their lives and freedom, to help others, she said. The raid itself happened after the Emancipation Proclamation, which had proclaimed all slaves in Southern states to be free.
But in Confederate-controlled areas, that wasn’t put into effect. The nation’s last slaves weren’t freed until two years later, on June 19, 1865, known as Juneteenth.
“It’s the actions of these folks that some would say, and I would agree with them, are even more important than, say, the Emancipation Proclamation in the demise of slavery and ending the institution of slavery,” Fields-Black said.

On his right is State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The owners of 82 smoke and vape shops and other THC-friendly retailers in Lincoln are receiving cease and desist letters this week from Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers about selling THC-containing products. 
Hilgers, the state’s top prosecutor, ramped back up his push to get stores to stop selling delta-8, delta-9 and other products containing tetrahydrocannabinol that he argues offer people an unregulated, unsafe, illegal way to get high.
Store owners in several cities that Hilgers has targeted have argued state law is unclear about the legality of selling the products. Some have argued that federal law might have a loophole allowing it.
Hilgers had said he would pause his efforts to warn and then sue retailers still offering the targeted THC products if the Legislature in the 2025 session passed a bill to clearly make them illegal in the state, which stalled. The bill is likely to return in 2026.
His office, which also files civil cases to enforce state law, has sent the letters to 204 stores statewide alleging unfair business practices, deception and violations of safety requirements for food. That tally includes 104 stores in Omaha, four in Kearney and three in Nebraska City.
This year, the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office worked with AG’s Office investigators to purchase products from stores in the Lincoln area. The AG’s Office said the products were incorrectly labeled as hemp.
The letters threaten multiple aspects of the businesses, including their tobacco licenses and their bottom lines. They offer not to sue if the stores voluntarily pull the products off shelves.
“Our office’s testing showed that nearly every one of these products were mislabeled,” Hilgers said. “It operates without regard to the health or safety of Nebraskans.”

(Stock photo from Getty Images)Cincinnati-based Bon Secours Mercy Health describes itself as a “ministry” that seeks to serve “the poor, dying and underserved.”
However, it’s one of two Ohio “nonprofit” hospital systems to face scrutiny from Congress over the huge amounts it’s raking in from a federal program meant to subsidize care for the poor.
It’s using some of that money to pay lavish salaries and buy stadium-naming rights.
Meanwhile, it is reportedly boosting the bottom line by serving wealthy communities and neglecting poorer ones — an outcome that, if true, would directly counter the program’s intent.
In April, the U.S. Senate Health, Labor and Pensions Committee released the results of a years-long investigation it made into a federal program that has exploded over the past 15 years. Among the committee’s concerns was that there appeared to be few — if any — controls on the way hospitals, clinics, and contract pharmacies spend the billions they receive from the program.
And it singled out two Ohio-based hospital chains for special focus — Cleveland Clinic and Bon Secours Mercy Health.
“These hospitals were selected for this investigation as a result of media reports alleging abuse of the 340B Program, such as hospitals cutting services to underserved populations and expanding into affluent areas to increase reimbursement rates and subsequent revenue under the 340B Program,” the committee report said.
The committee’s findings about Cleveland Clinic, which received nearly $1 billion from the program over a 38-month period, are detailed here.
The report focused on Bon Secours Mercy Health because of media reports that it had gained 340B status from a hospital it owns in a poor, Black neighborhood in Richmond, Va. It steadily depleted resources at that hospital, while adding them at facilities in more affluent neighborhoods nearby, the reporting said.
Bon Secours Mercy Health didn’t respond to requests for comment. But observers said such conduct is likely happening elsewhere in the 50-hospital chain.
 Explosive growth

Intended to subsidize care for the needy, the 340B program has grown from $5 billion a year in 2010 to nearly $67 billion in 2023, and analysts say that growth is only accelerating.
An obscure drug discount program stifles use of federal lifeline by rural hospitals

The program works by requiring drugmakers to give deep discounts off of list prices for drugs to qualifying hospitals, clinics, and the pharmacies with which they contract.
Those entities are then allowed to charge insurers and uninsured customers the full list price and pocket the difference.
The idea behind 340B was to help providers with a large share of uninsured and Medicaid patients make ends meet while they shoulder the cost of uncompensated and under-compensated care.
Cleveland Clinic claimed last month that the program has no impact on taxpayers. But Antonio Ciaccia, a Columbus-based drug-pricing analyst, said the program creates billions in higher costs for insurers and ultimately consumers.
After Congress created the Medicaid Prescription Drug Rebate Program in 1990, it created 340B in 1992, requiring drugmakers to give discounts to qualifying hospitals and clinics that were equal to the Medicaid rebates.
The program grew relatively slowly until passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, when rules changes allowed a lot more entities to qualify. It’s since grown by leaps and bounds and is now the second-largest federal prescription-drug program, behind only Medicare Part D.
Growing numbers of hospital systems have joined the 340B program through seemingly giant loopholes.
Cleveland Clinic, for example, doesn’t admit enough Medicaid and uninsured patients to qualify under the original 340B rules. But under a quirk in the new rules, it was allowed in as a “rural-referral center” even though it’s headquartered in the middle of a big city.
Rural referral centers have lower barriers to qualify and are the fastest-growing type of 340B hospitals. Possibly indicating abuse, by 2022, 82% of so-called “rural referral centers” were located in urban areas, as were 77% of their patients, according to the Berkeley Research Group, a consulting firm.
 Intended outcome?

Facilities owned by another Ohio-based group — Bon Secours Mercy Health — qualified another way.
Its Richmond Community Hospital in Virginia is located in a low-income Black neighborhood in the city’s East End, where it qualifies as a federal “disproportionate share” hospital and thus for the 340B program.
However, the New York Times reported in 2022 Bon Secours Mercy Health hollowed out Richmond Community, closing its intensive care unit, its maternity ward, and other vital departments.
At the same time, it created legal connections between the hospital and other clinics it owned in wealthier parts of town so that they could get 340B drug discounts. In those facilities it could reap a greater percentage of the 340B benefit because more patients are privately insured. That’s because transactions involving Medicaid patients aren’t eligible for the discount.
The paper reported on the perverse outcome of Bon Secours Mercy Health’s practices: It stripped its hospital in a poor neighborhood of resources while it used money meant for it to build and renovate lavish facilities where few poor people went.
“Bon Secours was basically laundering money through this poor hospital to its wealthy outposts,” Dr. Lucas English, who worked at Richmond Community until 2018, told the Times. “It was all about profits.”
For participating hospitals, the profits can be huge.
Bon Secours Mercy Health collected $276 million in 340B benefits over a five-year period that ended in 2023, the Senate committee reported. That was just for the facilities that participate in 340B under Richmond Community’s designation — not those connected to any of the chain’s dozens of other hospitals that might separately be part of the 340B program.
 Questionable spending

Some critics who want to see reform say there must be greater controls over how money collected under the program is spent. As it is, there don’t appear to be any.
Bon Secours Mercy Health and Cleveland Clinic told Senate investigators that they simply put the money into their general revenue and don’t specifically account for it after that.
As tens of billions more flow each year into hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies that participate in 340B, some are accused of spending on things that have nothing to do with health care — much less health care for the poor.
For example, how much New York University’s Langone Hospitals receive from the 340B program is not publicly available, but the number surely isn’t small. The system raised eyebrows when it spent an estimated $8 million advertising itself during the Super Bowl.
Bon Secours paid $4.5 million in 2013 for the 10-year naming rights of a sports and concert arena in downtown Greenville, South Carolina, claiming it would produce better health outcomes for the community. A five-year extension to keep the name Bon Secours Wellness Arena was signed in 2023.
“We’ve truly used this collaboration to expand our reach beyond hospital walls and live out our mission of building healthier communities, which is why we are very excited to extend this partnership and continue working together to make a difference in our community for many years to come,” Mark Caldwell, an executive with the 340B hospital, said in a written statement.
How the community would be made healthier by the arena’s food and beverage offerings isn’t obvious.
“The arena proudly offers Carolina Smoke BBQ, Well Pressed and Swamp Dog food stands, Reedy River Roost (our in house fried chicken shop!), GVL Pizza, Moe’s Southwest Grill, Pepsi products, and a nice selection of craft beer, domestic beer, and wine,” says the arena’s website, which has a picture of a bartender pouring gin into a cup.
Mercy Health also held the naming rights to the Lake Erie Crushers baseball stadium in Avon, Ohio, until last year. Mercy Health Lorain Hospital, 12 miles away, is a 340B facility.
 Community benefit

Nonprofit hospitals receiving huge amounts from 340B aren’t just facing questions about whether they’re using those funds in the best interest of the poor and uninsured.
Nonprofit hospitals generally have been coming under fire as analyses have shown that most are not providing community services that are commensurate with the huge tax breaks they enjoy.
Theoretically, institutions are given tax exemptions in exchange for providing community benefits, but in Ohio most nonprofit hospitals receive more than they give, according to a recent analysis.
An obscure drug discount program stifles use of federal lifeline by rural hospitals

The nonpartisan Lown Institute this year reported that Ohio’s nonprofit hospitals get $2.2 billion annually in tax breaks. Yet nearly three quarters (74%) of them provide less than that in community service, the report said.
That creates a $1.3 billion annual “fair share” deficit — the second-highest of the 20 states studied, the report said. Cleveland Clinic was the biggest offender in the state, with a $207 million annual deficit. That also qualified as the fifth-highest among any hospital in the 20 states, the report said.
Some of these “nonprofit” hospitals are also paying their top brass huge salaries. In the case of Bon Secours Mercy Health, CEO John Starcher Jr. made $8.8 million in reportable compensation in 2023 and an estimated $3.5 million more in “other compensation from the organization and related organizations,” the nonprofit’s IRS Form 990 says. The resulting $12.3 million is 176 times the median household income in Ohio.
The Economic Research Institute in 2022 put Starcher among the 10 highest-paid nonprofit CEOs in the country. The average nonprofit CEO made much less — just $152,199, the report said.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)On June 3 in Pierre, a gaggle of Mitchell city leaders delivered an unambiguous message to the state’s prison construction work group.
The city council, mayor, county commission, sheriff and various economic development officials were all in agreement: a patch of land south of Mitchell could easily host a new prison for 1,500 or more inmates, and their community would reap the benefits.
That wall of official support has since cracked under the weight of fierce public opposition.
A sea of people in red T-shirts – red for “stop,” like a stoplight – have greeted city council members and county commissioners during the public comment portions of recent meetings in Mitchell.

The Davison County sheriff withdrew his support within days. Mitchell’s mayor pulled back shortly thereafter. Both men said their backing was provisional and subject to change by the will of the community.
About 50 of the people on hand for an informational session Tuesday night at Mitchell Technical College wore red T-shirts.
To hear Dwight and Barbara Stadler of Mitchell tell it, support for a prison in their town had never extended beyond leadership offices. Neither of them wore red T-shirts on Tuesday, but both are firmly in the anti-prison camp.
“They didn’t tell us about it until after the fact,” Barbara Stadler said of Mitchell’s initial pitch to the Project Prison Reset task force.
The opposition in Mitchell mirrors what state officials already faced in rural Lincoln County – and are beginning to face in Worthing – as they try to find space for a men’s prison. The facility would ease overcrowding in the correctional system and replace the oldest parts of the Sioux Falls penitentiary, a facility that dates to the late 1800s.  


 Locations of the potential prison locations that remain in play, plus the location of the original rural Lincoln County site that’s been ruled out.
Other sites see pushback
The selection of land for a new men’s prison south of Harrisburg in late 2023 spurred the creation of a nonprofit organization whose activism contributed first to that $825 million project’s legislative defeat in February, then to the removal earlier this month of the land set aside for it from the list of possible sites for any future prison.
Neighbors Opposed to Prison Expansion (NOPE) also sued the state in hopes of forcing it to abide by local zoning rules. A Lincoln County judge rejected that argument; the state Supreme Court is considering an appeal, though its ruling would now matter for future state-local disputes, not the dispute over that specific prison site.
No one in Mitchell has sued – the state hasn’t decided to do more than study the land as an option – but community members have launched a Facebook group called “NO Davison County,” whose page is populated with skeptical dialogue about the prison idea.
The group had 1,200 members as of Wednesday afternoon.
Prison group narrows options
That Mitchell became a focal point at all is an outgrowth of a choice made at the June 3 meeting in Pierre.
The Project Prison Reset group, convened by Gov. Larry Rhoden to find solutions for overcrowding after the initial prison plan’s legislative loss, left four locations on the table at the end of its meeting that day, culled from a list of more than a dozen: Mitchell, a separate Lincoln County site in Worthing, Springfield and Sioux Falls. 
Open process and publicity draw wide range of offers for state prison site

The latter two options would involve building on land the state Department of Corrections already owns, even though no tract of that land would be large enough for a prison the size of the one shot down by lawmakers in February. The request for proposals sent in April sought potential sites with more than 100 acres.
In Springfield, the state would need to build within the footprint of Mike Durfee State Prison, which is less than 70 acres altogether. In Sioux Falls, it could mean building another floor onto the penitentiary complex’s Jameson Annex, on land adjacent to the penitentiary (less than 30 acres), or on land west of town currently used to house juvenile offenders (68 acres).
In addition to its vote to narrow down possible prison sites, the group opted to cap the price of any new prison at $600 million – far less than the $2 billion a consulting group called Arrington Watkins had suggested the state would need to spend on new facilities to address overcrowding over the next decade.
Members of the NOPE group were celebratory on social media over the removal of the initial Lincoln County site from consideration. Since then, the group has shifted the focus of its activism to Worthing, where task force members are considering a site off Interstate 29 that’s not far from the original Lincoln County site.
The NOPE group discussed the Worthing site at a meeting in Canton on Tuesday. Today, the group will lead an informational session at Worthing Elementary School.
Seven days ago, Worthing Mayor Crystal Jacobson came out against a prison near her city.
Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken said in 2023 that he’d prefer a new prison be built outside the city. 
He was more measured at the first Project Prison Reset meeting in early April. At that point, TenHaken testified that he wasn’t going to advocate “for a specific location,” but predicted that the task force would face the kind of pushback that’s since appeared from the neighbors to any site large enough to hold a new prison.
“No matter where you decide, you’re going to have a fight on your hands,” TenHaken said.
Less fight – but little space – in Springfield
The second project prison reset meeting was in Springfield, and included testimony from residents who told the task force that the prison was a positive force for the town.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen and Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko both took time at the end of the meeting to assure residents that the state’s commitment to the Mike Durfee facility is solid.
South Dakota corrections work group formally backs need for new prison

The mayor of Springfield, Scott Kostal, was on hand for Tuesday’s meeting in Mitchell and told residents not to fear a prison. The medium security facility in his town, once a university, has been a good neighbor, Kostal said, hasn’t forced the city to pay more for public safety or infrastructure, and hasn’t affected property values.
Kostal said he’s been surprised at how much his town’s property is worth.
“If there’s a problem with property values going down because of the prison, will somebody please call the Bon Homme County Assessor’s Office and let them know?” Kostal said Tuesday.
Springfield can’t address the state’s full slate of needs though, Kostal told South Dakota Searchlight in a Wednesday interview. There isn’t enough space on the Durfee campus to build a 1,500 or 1,700-bed facility, which is what the most recent consultant’s report suggests is needed to address overcrowding.
There is some green space inside the fence and a parking lot that could hold a few hundred more inmates, according to a previous consultant’s report, but Kostal says anything more substantial would put vocational and educational programming at risk.
“The only way you could remotely do that would be to remove those buildings or eliminate those programs,” Kostal said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PXL_20250617_223817084-scaled-e1750343012549-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-19 11:01:16.812836

“That’s had nothing to do with anything I’ve said,” Braun told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “I’m concentrating on being governor, and have no interest in that.”
Politico’s Adam Wren first reported that the Indiana GOP governor was privately discussing the idea of mounting a presidential run in 2028, citing three unnamed sources.
“Don’t know who came up with that,” Braun said.

Prior to his inauguration in January, Braun was one of Indiana’s two senators in Washington D.C. But the one-term congressman seemed to have little interest in returning to the nation’s capital.
The Capital Chronicle asked Braun about the idea after he spoke to Future Farmers of America students at a state convention in West Lafayette.
“I get asked that often by people that are good supporters, especially from the time I spent out in the Senate. But when I came back here and gave up another term there, this was about a job that looks like you’re going to get a lot more done with the time that you’re spending at it.”
The 71-year-old is Indiana’s oldest governor and a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, who is term limited. He spent much of his time in the U.S. Senate criticizing the nation’s deficit. The wealthy businessman has spent his first months in office as governor trimming the state budget, trying to reform property taxes and focusing on health care regulations and laws.

Dream Point can house as many as 40 people. (Photo: Bertie County Schools)Even as teachers’ salaries have risen in some states, the changing housing market has left many of them “priced out” of communities where they work, according to a recent paper by the National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ) titled “Priced Out: The Growing Challenge of Teacher pay and Housing Costs.”
  Katherine Bowser (Photo: National Council on Teacher Quality)
Author Katherine Bowser, a research analyst NCTQ, contends it’s more important than ever for teachers to be able to afford to live where they work. She cites recent research showing that teachers with long commutes are more likely to leave districts, be absent from work and receive lower observation scores than those who live closer.
“To retain a high-quality teaching staff, it is in districts’ best interest to pay teachers enough to afford housing reasonably close to where they teach,” Bowser wrote. “Yet given skyrocketing housing costs, district leaders are left wondering where the money will come from.”
Finding affordable housing has been particularly difficult for beginning teachers who earn lower salaries than veteran counterparts, Bowser said. The percentage growth of home prices and percentage growth of one-bedroom rental costs have “consistently and dramatically outpaced beginning teacher salary growth and general inflation,” she said.
Between 2019-2025, home prices increased by 47% while rental costs jumped 51%. Beginning teacher pay only increased by 24%, Bowser reported, while inflation increased 26%.
“This means that although salaries have almost kept pace with inflation, there is a widening gap between income and housing affordability,” she said.
Teachers who began their careers in 2019 have less purchasing power today than when they started, Bowser said. From 2019 to 2024 home purchase prices and rental costs increased by an average of 44% and 42% respectively while pay for teachers who started in 2019 saw an average 34% to 35% salary increase, which outpaced the 23% growth in inflation, she said.
“Despite this growth, it still failed to keep pace with the housing market,” Bowser said. “Consequently, teachers who started in 2019 in our sample districts lost purchasing power for buying or renting a home compared to when they began teaching.”
Bowser’s study examined 72 large, urban districts. It found that new teachers can’t afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment in about half of the districts in the sample, even if they held a master’s degree. Rent is considered unaffordable if a person spends more than 30% of their income on housing.
In 2019, there were 18 districts in the sample where new teachers with bachelor’s degrees couldn’t afford the rent and 11 for those with master’s degrees. That number jumped to 39 in 2025 for teachers with bachelor’s degrees and 34 for those master’s degrees. Districts in Mecklenburg and Wake counties are among those Bowser found unaffordable for beginning teachers.
“This year, rent for a one-bedroom unit costs over 40% of beginning, bachelor-degree-holding teacher salaries in 10 districts, with four surpassing 45%,” she said. For beginning, master-degree-holding teachers, San Diego Unified School District (CA) remains the most unaffordable district (45%) and there are four more in which rent constitutes over 40% of salaries.”
The most affordable district for beginning teachers is Wichita, Kansas Public Schools were teachers pay only 18% of salary to rent a one-bedroom apartment.
In 2019, there were nine unaffordable districts for teachers with a bachelor’s degree and five years of experience compared with 29 in 2025, Bowser found. For teachers with 10 years of experience and a bachelor’s degree, there were two districts in the sample deemed unaffordable and 18 in 2025. There were no unaffordable districts for teachers with master’s degrees in 2019.
Bowser also found that homeownership, like it is for many Americans in other professions, is becoming increasingly unrealistic for teachers.
“A back-of-the-envelope calculation reveals that teachers with a master’s degree would need an average of 13 years to save for a 20% down payment in their region, while those with bachelor’s degrees would require an average of 14 years,” Bowser said, using 2025 data as a snapshot in time to estimate the number of years required to save a 20% down payment based on 10% annual savings that accumulate over time.
In 2019, homeowners’ monthly housing payments in 46 districts were unaffordable for beginning teachers with a bachelor’s degree and 41 for those with a master’s. By 2025, 54 districts were unaffordable regardless of degree attainment.
Meanwhile, in 2019, homeowners’ monthly housing payments were unaffordable in 36 sample districts for teachers with a bachelor’s degree and five years of experience and 52 districts in 2025. For teachers with a bachelor’s degree and 10 years of experience, homeowners’ monthly housing payments were unaffordable in 29 districts in 2019 and 47 districts in 2025. Homeowners’ monthly housing payments were unaffordable in 22 districts for teachers with master’s degrees in 2019 and 44 by 2025.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dream-Point-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-19 11:01:16.812836

Some prisoners commenced a hunger strike in protest.,"In summary
Incarcerated people in more than 20 California prisons have limited communication because of expansive restrictions that took effect this month. Some prisoners commenced a hunger strike in protest.


Nearly two dozen state prisons last week imposed sweeping restrictions on their incarcerated population — including shutting off all outside communication. Now, hundreds of prisoners are reported to be on a hunger strike to protest the system’s largest restrictions since the pandemic. 
The corrections department “significantly limited” the daily activities and movement of roughly 34,000 incarcerated people on June 12 in response to a recent uptick in violence, overdoses and contraband, according to its website. 
Under the restrictions, incarcerated people are forced to remain primarily in their cell or dormitory. All in-person visitation, programming, phone access and tablet communications has been suspended. Medical care and other essential services will continue, the department said. 
The department did not say when the restrictions will end.
Legal experts and advocates called the department’s move drastic and said the approach is solitary confinement in all but name. 
“It’s a very lonely space to be in,” said Warren Hands, supervising parole success advocate at UnCommon Law, a nonprofit. “Addiction is real. Mental health issues are real. And they are exacerbated by these lockdowns.”
Corrections Secretary Jeff Macomber said in a written statement that the department has an obligation to ensure public safety for staff, incarcerated individuals and the communities.
“We recognize the concerns of the incarcerated and their families and how this impacts participation in rehabilitation programs and visiting,” he said. 
The department published a press release late Tuesday that listed a number of armed assaults on staff members, armed battery on incarcerated people, and several riots in the weeks leading up to the restrictions, but did not attribute those incidents to specific prisons. 
Families of incarcerated people say the restrictions are cruel and collective punishment. Angel Torrez said it feels unbearable to have no contact with his father, who is incarcerated at Folsom State Prison.
“I wonder if he’s safe and sound,” said Torrez. The department “is playing propaganda warfare. They are professionals of abstract, obtuse, and vague statements that are generated to keep families in the dark.”
At prisons across the country, lockdowns have become increasingly common due to staffing shortages. In California, the corrections department has imposed broad restrictions on incarcerated people twice in the span of three months. 
Prisons report ‘surge in violence’
The last restrictions on March 8 were placed on nearly a dozen prisons due to a “surge in violence against staff and incarcerated people.” They ended on April 11. During that time, at least three incarcerated people were killed and one officer reportedly was attacked.
In recent years, the department has come under fire for its approach to managing violent incidents and contraband. It was criticized by a Sacramento County Superior Court Judge in 2022 for creating violence when it merged incarcerated people from the general population with those who were previously protected, such as informants, bypassing established procedures in the process. 
The following year, an oversight agency found that drugs continued to get inside California prisons during the pandemic when public health protocols prohibited visits. 
“It’s an open secret that staff are the primary vector of contraband into the prison,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor at UCLA. 
She said a lockdown may be a useful tool if it’s done in a limited way, but the department’s blanket policy appears to be hard to defend.
“This is a blunt instrument when they should be using a scalpel,” she said. “The question is the relationship between the ill that they are trying to wrestle with and the strategy that they are adopting to try to address it. I remain unconvinced that a lockdown of this scale is necessary to address this problem.”
Hunger strike in Salinas
One day after the corrections department implemented the restrictions, incarcerated people at Salinas Valley State Prison formally declared a hunger strike. 
“This action arises in response to persistent and unlawful practices by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, including the use of indiscriminate lockdowns, deprivation of rehabilitative and constitutional rights, and collective punishment of the incarcerated population,” they wrote in a letter provided to CalMatters. “This protest is not rooted in defiance but in our firm demand that (the corrections department) adhere to its obligations under the U.S. Constitution, California Penal Code, and Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations.”
Corrections spokesperson Terri Hardy said the department has procedures to monitor and evaluate hunger strikes. 
Brooke Terpstra, a member of the anti-prison group Oakland Abolition & Solidarity, estimated that upwards of 500 people are participating in the strike. He suspects incarcerated people at other prisons with restrictions will join. 
“All hunger strikes are notable, but this is a major occurrence,” he said. “(The department’s) unified collective punishment has produced a unified collective response. It’s inspiring.”

This story first appeared on Tennessee Lookout.
The U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

The Tennessee House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”

This story was originally reported by Errin Haines of The 19th.  Meet Errin and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Thursday marks the first national observance under President Donald Trump of Juneteenth, the day commemorating the end of slavery in the United States that became a federal holiday in 2021.
This year, it comes as Trump’s presidency has been marked by attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion and attempts to erase and minimize Black history as part of the American story. What does it mean to claim resistance and resilience in an age of exclusion?
For perspective on how to consider Juneteenth this year, I spoke to Dr. Kaye Wise Whitehead, president of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, the organization that founded Black History Month. Whitehead shared her insights on the politics of history, memory and race and why traditions matter even more in the current political climate.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Errin Haines: How do you understand the meaning of Juneteenth — not just as a holiday, but as a marker of America’s unfinished work?
Kaye Wise Whitehead: The country has significantly changed between January 19, 2025, and today. Every single thing that we have fought for — that, I would argue, we began to take a little bit for granted — has either been canceled, erased or is under fire. Juneteenth is no different.
We don’t wait to be celebrated; we celebrate ourselves. We celebrate our history, and we celebrate our contributions to this country. Our lives and our histories are etched into the stones of the buildings. So we don’t have to have a proclamation from anyone else but ourselves.
What does it mean to celebrate emancipation in a political era marked by rollbacks of civil rights and diversity policies?
This is why it’s even more important that we take a moment to stop and understand the significance of Juneteeth. Juneteenth, as a holiday, has been celebrated within the Black communities of Texas and Louisiana since right after American slavery ended. They did not wait for it to be a holiday.
That is really the message of the American historical narrative. It is the people that lead the government. It’s not government leading the people. It is “We the People.” And Juneteenth is a great example of that.
If we don’t center the teaching and the understanding of Black history, if we don’t amplify it, if we don’t force it onto America’s agenda, then it can be erased. People don’t understand that if you erase the contributions of Black people to America, you are essentially erasing the American historical narrative, because Black history is American history. It is tied to the fabric that makes up the blanket of this country.
Juneteenth is a celebration. It is a time of firing up the grill, it is a time to line dance, of getting out the fans, and celebrating the beauty and the wonder and the joy that is essentially in the heart of Black culture. Our culture is not rooted in just tears and tragedy and trauma and slavery and oppression and lynching. Our culture is rooted in joy and laughter and tenacity and the ability to overcome and find places of happiness despite what the situation is around us.
What parallels do you see between the delayed freedom of Juneteenth and the current efforts to delay or deny racial progress — whether in education, policy or civic life?
We are not powerless in the face of those who seek to erase us. In fact, this is the best time for us to reclaim our power — our history is a part of this story. We can turn all of our spaces into freedom schools: a church basement, if you’re standing in the middle of a coffee shop, if you’re sitting with young children. You put it on your bags, you put it on your T-shirt, you put it on your social media. They can’t stop us from telling our story. Even though they are banning books, they don’t stop me from buying books and giving them to people. We have to take back our power in this moment, because otherwise, that is how authoritarianism wins. It makes you believe you’re powerless.
You’ve spoken and written powerfully about memory as resistance. How does celebrating Juneteenth become a form of resistance in a time of historical erasure?
I argue that you only have four choices right now. You fight, which to me means practicing small, daily acts of resistance. You have flight: If you have an exit plan, you activate it — and most folks do not. You freeze, and you pretend that everything is normal and that you pretend you can’t do anything. Or you fawn: You bend your knee and you kiss the ring and say, “I support this administration.”
I’m telling people, choose to fight and practice small, daily acts of resistance. Unfortunately, in this environment, celebrating Juneteenth is an act of resistance.
I believe that this moment is about both reclaiming the historical memory, but it’s also about a moment of looking forward, because if we stand right now and say that we’re not going to be erased, we are holding fast to our memory, we’re holding fast to our history, we’re holding fast to our contributions, then we’re laying the groundwork, setting up the framework for what’s going to come next.
What role have Black women played — historically and now — in defending and advancing the truth of our history against efforts to distort or erase it?
Black women have always been, as Zora Neale Hurston has said, “the mules of the world.” I talk about this as Black women being the ones that are willing to push and carry this country forward, because that is what we have done, whether it was during the time of American slavery trying to hold our family together, whether it was using quilts to stitch a road to freedom, whether it was braiding in routes to freedom in the hair of our children. Or as 19th-century women lifting as they climb, setting up club groups, raising money for the family, or coming today with the political activism that Black women have continued to be involved in and have continued to stand firm on trying to save this country, politically, culturally, socially and economically, for hundreds of years.
We’re at a moment now where a number of Black women are saying, “This is a moment that we sit out. We are tired. We’re exhausted. We’ve been teaching and reteaching the same lessons.” I’m making the argument that as much as I want to sit down, I cannot, as much as I want to stop I cannot. I can take rest breaks, but I do have to keep pushing the work, I do have to keep getting involved politically. I do have to keep talking about the reclamation of memory and history. I do have to keep standing up and resisting, even in very small ways. We are planting seeds for trees that will never give us shade. I am very clear that the work I’m doing right now is not work that I’m going to actually benefit from.
So then, what does rest, joy and celebration look like for Black women in this political climate? How do Black women hold space for both resistance and restoration?
That’s where Juneteenth comes in! Juneteenth is a great example of resistance and restoration. I’m telling Black women like I tell myself: No one’s asking you to fight 24/7, we’re not looking for that. Even Harriet Tubman rested. So where are the moments when you can actively get involved without draining your social battery? Maybe it’s an economic choice that you made. I can choose to vote with my feet, to vote with my dollars, write an op-ed. I can’t go out and march, but I can call into the radio station, I can give $5 to the institutions and the organizations that are holding up the work. That’s what restoration and resistance look like. You choose the moments when you can engage and then you practice radical self-care when you can’t — and be honest with yourself about what those moments look like.
For people who feel disheartened by the moment we’re in, what do you say about the power of showing up?
I’m gonna say this, and I know that it goes to the opposite of what a number of folks are saying right now, but our ancestors didn’t stop.
We can’t be the generation that stops. I know I’m tired, but I can’t be the one where the baton stops. As much as we want to stop in this moment, we have so much to lose. We cannot offer our children and their children a world that’s so destructive and just falling apart because we got tired and we stopped.
If Juneteenth is a mirror, what should we be reflecting on this year?
I would not say Juneteenth is a mirror; I would say Juneteenth is a prism into what we used to be, into who we are now, and into who we can be.
I think Juneteenth this year should be a space of radical imagination. It is clear that whatever this form of “democracy” has been, it does not exist anymore. I don’t want to go back to that. That was not a space of freedom, equality and diversity. That was not a space where we could rest.
So since that system is collapsing all around us, let’s use Juneteenth as a moment of radical imagination. What should come next? What exactly are we working for? Because at times I ask myself, “What am I fighting to save?” We need to have a plan for how we go forward, not their plan, but our plan.
That’s how we should celebrate and uplift Juneteenth: Throw up the grill, party, get the fans going — and then while people are sitting around the table and they’re passing the beans and the corn, say, “What should come next?” Let’s get some plans on paper. Let’s start getting people into the room to have these conversations. Standing still is not what we want to do at this moment.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_0658-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-06-19 10:01:24.990212

(Courtesy of Carnegie Mellon University)Edda Fields-Black was working on a book about rice plantations when she came across the story of a raid in Beaufort, South Carolina, that freed more than 700 slaves from Lowcountry plantations.
The Carnegie Mellon University professor decided to pursue the story and, nearly a decade later, published “COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid, and Black Freedom During the Civil War,” which recently won the Pulitzer Prize for history.
Fields-Black first learned about the June 1863 raid reading an account by Minus Hamilton, who was an 88-year-old slave when the daring mission led by Tubman freed him. He told of how three steamships traveled up the river in the dead of night before sounding their whistles, sending slaves working on the neighboring plantations running to the river and to freedom.
Hamilton also talked about his awe at seeing fellow Black men in uniform for the first time, and that image struck Fields-Black.
“I was like, ‘Wow,’ and I tucked it away for a long time,” said Fields-Black, of Pittsburgh.
She tried to read more about the raid Hamilton recounted. But she found little beyond mentions here and there in biographies of Tubman, who’s best known as a conductor on the Underground Railroad.
So, she set out to write the history herself, telling it from the perspective of the raid’s participants and detailing the importance of the rice plantations in pulling it off, she said.
“I wanted to pull out all of those elements, and I thought that I could tell that story,” Fields-Black said.
“COMBEE,” the Gullah pronunciation of the Combahee River, won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize alongside “Native Nations: A Millennium in North American” by Kathleen DuVal in a category that rewards “a distinguished and appropriately documented book on the history of the United States,” according to the Pulitzer website.
The 776-page book told “a richly-textured and revelatory account” of the raid, “weaving military strategy and family history with the transition from bondage to freedom,” the prize’s jury wrote.
Harriet Tubman
Tubman, who became known as the Moses of Her People after escaping slavery herself in 1849, spoke about the Combahee River Raid during her life.
Her role in the raid made her the first woman ever to lead a major military operation in the U.S. and the only Black woman to lead troops during the Civil War. A statue of her unveiled in May 2024 at Beaufort’s Tabernacle Baptist Church commemorates her part in the raid and her years spent in Beaufort.
But historians, lacking official records, rarely delved into the details, Fields-Black said.
When she started telling friends and colleagues about her plans, they similarly insisted there was no way to tell the story from the perspective of enslaved people because no records of the raid existed. But they did exist — just not the kind most researchers rely on, she said.
“There’s a broader question about believing women, believing marginal people and taking our words and our descriptions of our own experiences at face value,” Fields-Black said. “And that hadn’t been done.”
The rice plantations, with their snakes and alligators, made Tubman’s work even more impressive. Other historians had written about the raid as if the environment were the same as in the more northern states where Tubman had worked, but as a researcher of rice fields, Fields-Black knew the specific challenges they presented.
“She could’ve been on the moon, and she would’ve figured out how to survive,” she said.
Finding the story
As she started to research in earnest, Fields-Black knew she couldn’t rely solely on the official military records of the raid, which were written by the Confederate troops controlling Beaufort at the time. Slave narratives from the 1930s mentioned the raid only in passing, and official records in Beaufort and Colleton counties were burned as cities went up in flames during the Civil War, she said.
Fields-Black turned instead to a lesser-used historical resource: pension files. Following the war, soldiers relayed information about themselves and their experiences in an attempt to receive payment from the government.
Among those submitting applications were members of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, a regiment consisting largely of freed men from the sea islands who drove boats up the Combahee River for enslaved people to board and escape.
Through scouring hundreds of pension files, Fields-Black came across a familiar name.
She had known about a Hector Fields from whom her family descended, but she had thought he lived in nearby Colleton County, not Beaufort. The pension files, however, told the story of Fields as a Civil War veteran who fought in the volunteer infantry, helped free slaves and eventually settled down in Colleton County, she said.
Fields-Black grew up in Florida, but she still has family in that area. Her own father was born in Green Pond, a small town in the same county, and the family’s roots in South Carolina are strong, she said.
The story “has become a source of immense pride in our family,” Fields-Black said.
Even after they were freed, many of the people in the raid returned to Confederate territory, risking their lives and freedom, to help others, she said. The raid itself happened after the Emancipation Proclamation, which had proclaimed all slaves in Southern states to be free.
But in Confederate-controlled areas, that wasn’t put into effect. The nation’s last slaves weren’t freed until two years later, on June 19, 1865, known as Juneteenth.
“It’s the actions of these folks that some would say, and I would agree with them, are even more important than, say, the Emancipation Proclamation in the demise of slavery and ending the institution of slavery,” Fields-Black said.

The United States’ newest federal holiday, celebrated annually on June 19, has quickly become its most puzzling one. Four years after President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Americans have wrestled with what to make of the holiday.
What is Juneteenth? What is the proper way to celebrate it? Should holiday observers attend barbecues and cookouts? Should Juneteenth’s observance be a day of learning? Is there a way to acknowledge the holiday without misappropriating it?
This confusion likely emerged because many Americans did not even learn about Juneteenth until around when it became a federal holiday in 2021. Moreover, the Trump administration and state legislatures across the country have further complicated matters with their increased efforts to ban the type of education that led to the national recognition of the holiday in the first place.
‘All slaves are free’
Juneteenth – short for June Nineteenth – recognizes the day in 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with roughly 2,000 federal troops from the 13th Army Corps. Upon arriving, Granger issued General Order No. 3. The order read:
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”
  The official handwritten record of General Order No. 3, preserved at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. National Archives.
Granger’s order effectively freed 250,000 enslaved people in the region.
Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the enslaved in all the states that had seceded from the U.S., nearly 2½ years earlier, Texas, a Confederate state, rebelled against it.
At the time, Texas had a minimal number of Union soldiers to enforce the proclamation’s emancipation of enslaved people residing within Confederate territory. Consequently, many of those enslaved in Texas remained ignorant of the proclamation’s potential impact on their lives, or of the fact the Civil War had functionally ended two months earlier.
In an interview published in 1941, for example, Laura Smalley of Hempstead, Texas, remembered how her enslaver fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He returned without informing those whom he enslaved of their freedom. In her interview, she recounted,
“Old master didn’t tell, you know, they was free … I think now they say they worked them, six months after that.”
‘Second Independence Day’
June 19, 1865, a Monday, changed that.
The news of emancipation culminated a generations-long struggle for Black people to obtain a modicum of freedom in the U.S.
For this reason, some refer to Juneteenth as the nation’s second Independence Day. The end of bondage was ostensibly codified in the 13th Amendment ratified later that year.
Spontaneous Juneteenth celebrations emerged almost immediately. Celebrants referred to the day as “Emancipation Day,” “Freedom Day,” “Juneteenth” and “Jubilee Day.” The latter title alluded to the biblical period following seven sabbatical cycles that resulted in canceling debts and freeing the enslaved.
Flake’s Bulletin, a weekly, Galveston-based publication, reported on an Emancipation Celebration occurring on Jan. 2, 1866, that included upward of 800 people. A similar gathering occurred in Galveston on June 19, 1866, in what is now the church known as Reedy Chapel AME. Annual celebrations continued, beginning in southeastern Texas, with events such as historical reenactments, parades, picnics, music and speeches.

Legacies of slavery
While the holiday marked a joyous occasion for some, Juneteenth met early and persistent opposition, particularly in the time following Reconstruction.
For years, local reporting spoke of Juneteenth, as the Galveston Historical Foundation put it, in a “flagrantly racist nature.” Additionally, the racist stereotyping – “idleness” – in the final sentence of Granger’s order simultaneously illustrated its complicated nature while also “[foreshadowing] that the fight for freedom would continue,” National Archives staffer Michael Davis wrote in 2020.
Historian Keisha Blain explains, “The enslavement of Black people in the U.S. may have ended but the legacies of slavery still shape every aspect of Black life.”
Advocates such as Opal Lee, commonly referred to as the “grandmother of Juneteenth,” pressed for Juneteenth celebration to continue and, ultimately, for it to be made a national holiday.
Lee began her advocacy in earnest during the mid-1970s in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. The oldest member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, Lee spearheaded several campaigns to draw attention to Juneteenth. These campaigns included initiatives such as an online petition promoting the holiday’s observance launched in 2019 that amassed 1.6 million signatures.
In speaking on the significance of Juneteenth, Lee said, “Freedom is for everyone. I think freedom should be celebrated from the 19th of June to the Fourth of July; however, none of us are free until we are all free. We are not free yet, and Juneteenth is a symbol of that.”
National recognition
Because of this advocacy, Juneteenth has grown from relatively obscure regional celebrations to, starting in 2021, a federal holiday.
The establishment of the holiday was the capstone of initiatives during the racial reckoning. Historians refer to the racial reckoning as the time period beginning in the summer of 2020 until the spring of the following year that witnessed heightened attention to America’s nagging history of racism.
This reckoning included the historic protests prompted by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.
During this time, numerous institutions, ranging from colleges and universities to major companies, made commitments to racial equity. The recognition of Juneteenth represented a symbolic means to honor those commitments.
In remarks marking his signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Biden said, “Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come.”

Backtracking on gains
But within a year, some had already begun to argue the nation had, as community organizer Braxton Brewington wrote, “betrayed the spirit of Jubilee Day.”
Many of the racial equity commitments made during the racial reckoning quickly vanished within a year or two. Economist William Michael Cunningham revealed American companies pledged $50 billion to racial equity efforts in 2020, yet had only spent $250 million by 2021.
By the spring of 2025, companies such as Walmart and McDonald’s announced they will discontinue their diversity, equity and inclusion work. Moreover, Walmart will stop using the term altogether. Amazon, Meta and dozens of other large corporations made similar announcements.
And members of the Trump administration have mounted continual attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and used the term as a politically expedient slur to deride Black people. This is also exacerbated by the Trump administration’s challenges to birthright citizenship, a key right that gave citizenship to the formerly enslaved and later guaranteed important rights to the entire populace.
This major shift has fueled arguments that the U.S. has regressed from efforts toward racial equity and thus undermined the meaning of Juneteenth. And such backtracking arguably makes some Juneteenth celebrations performative exercises rather than celebrations of true racial equity.
As one critic asked, has the holiday devolved “into an exploitative and profit-driven enterprise for companies that disregard the true significance of this day to the Black community?”
All of this has led to increasing confusion over how to commemorate Juneteenth, if at all. Juneteenth is not the first federal holiday with a complicated history. Nevertheless, with other complex holidays, Americans had years to process their misgivings. In short, the nation is still deciding what it means to be free.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Dole Institute livestream)TOPEKA — The co-author of a national assessment of challenges faced by local election administrators focused on the failure of some Kansas counties to match rising costs of voting technology and election staff with budgets heavily reliant on property tax revenue.
The joint report from the Robert Dole Institute of Politics in Lawrence and the Edward Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate in Boston provided election policymakers and administrators with data and research useful in arguing for more sustainable funding of local elections.
Zach Mohr, associate professor of public affairs and administration at University of Kansas and a co-author of the report, said 92% of funding for local elections in Kansas’ smallest population counties was derived from property taxes. He said the property tax was a steady source of money, but it didn’t keep pace with escalating costs.
“It might not be growing as much as we’d like, so that’s a bit of a problem,” Mohr said. “There’s probably a need for more diversification so that it can grow with the growing need. We may need more transfers from the higher levels of government.”
He said only 37% of Kansas counties studied had sufficient revenue to cover election expenditures in 2024.
It was a relief Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab forwarded $1.9 million in federal Help America Vote Act grants to 84 counties in 2024, Mohr said. The money was invested in advancing the physical security of elections and to address cybersecurity risks.
The Kennedy and Dole institutes’ report released Wednesday recommended creation of more stable funding streams drawn from local, state or federal sources. It argued local governments needed adequate staffing of offices and modern equipment to improve administrative efficiency and to maintain or earn public trust in elections. The report was produced with support from the Election Trust Initiative, a nonpartisan subsidiary of the Pew Charitable Trusts.
“Now, more than ever, the story of the election professionals who conduct our elections, often on a shoestring budget, needs our attention,” said Tammy Patrick, an advisor on the election administration project. “Administrators in cities and in rural areas; in red states, blue states and swing states; those who were elected, appointed or hired as a public servant; Republicans, Democrats and unaffiliated officials — all are better able to serve their voters and communities when they are sufficiently supported with the tools and resources the American voters deserve.”
The report said local government financed 85% of costs associated with administering elections, despite surveys showing the public believed federal and state governments were mostly responsible. The report said the budget for local elections represented 0.5% of the annual budget of local units of government.
“Half a percent is not much money at all to something that is the foundation and undergirds American democracy,” said Mitchell Brown, a professor of political science at Auburn University and contributor to the report.
The report said election offices, particularly in rural areas, too often faced personnel shortages and limped along on outdated technology. The debate about allocation of resources between urban and rural counties was complicated by the fact that 8% of U.S. election offices served three-fourths of the electorate.
Colorado’s cost-based reimbursement system for county-conducted elections could serve as a model for other states, the report said. In 2024, Colorado shifted to a model with state reimbursement of 45% of actual costs. The law allowed reimbursements to grow automatically over time in line with growth in election costs.
It replaced a system that allocated 80 cents or 90 cents per active voter to counties, said Hilary Rudy, Colorado’s deputy elections director.
“A per-voter formula fails to account for things like drastic changes in supply costs … or upgrading security requirements or new voting equipment,” Rudy said.
Ben Hovland, a member of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, said there was a need for the federal government to increase financial support for local election administration.
Large annual shifts in federal funding, often driven by emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, made it difficult for city, county and state governments to plan election budgets. The Help America Vote Act delivered $425 million in 2020 to the states, but the total dropped to $75 million in 2022 and $15 million in 2025.
“That trajectory is obviously headed downward,” Hoyland said. “We hear about a desire for that funding to be consistent and predictable.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Election-costs-Dole-report.png,,,2025-06-19 10:01:24.990212

Truth, a former slave and one of history’s most noted abolitionists who spent her last years as a resident of Michigan, is still remembered by her famous “Ain’t I a Woman” speech in 1851. But as historians believe her words may have been recorded inaccurately, Michigan Advance took a look at what she said during her later speeches at the Michigan Capitol in opposition to the death penalty. 


The life and legacy of one of history’s most famous abolitionists, Sojourner Truth, a former slave who spent her life evangelizing and rallying for a collection of causes is often condensed to four words “Ain’t I a Woman?”
But that rendering of her speech, where Truth’s words are written with a Southern dialect is not an accurate portrayal of what Truth, who grew up in Dutch-speaking Ulster County, New York, would have sounded like, historian and author of “Sojourner Truth: A Life, a Symbol,” Nell Irvin Painter told The Advance.

Painter and many other historians assert that the speech, as it’s recited in popular culture today, was incorrectly recorded by white journalist and abolitionist, Frances Dana Gage, which was published twelve years after Truth spoke at the Woman’s Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio in May of 1851.
And by the time Gage’s version of the “Ain’t I a Woman” speech became well known in the 20th century during second-wave feminism in the 1960s, Painter said American activists and culture demanded “authenticity” from Black people which erroneously dictated that Truth be a Southerner. 
“It’s such a crime that this person who was so thoughtful and so eloquent and so powerful a speaker should be reduced to a slogan,” Painter said. “I would like to abolish the sound bite, then I would like people to go beyond this sound bite.”
Truth was a gifted preacher and a stalwart defender of human rights, whether that meant women’s rights, temperance or abolitionism, she had a voice and she used it, Painter said.
And she utilized emerging technology to further her causes, selling photographs of herself when the technology was fairly new that had the inscription “I Sell the Shadow to Support the Substance“.
“It’s a picture of power. It’s not a fashionable picture, but it’s very composed and she decided how she wanted to be seen in those photographs. That’s the closest I could get to her self presentation,” Painter said.
Though she never learned to read or write, Truth dictated her life story to a friend who wrote her autobiography, for which she used the proceeds to travel around the country captivating audiences with her powerful speeches, Painter said.

Truth speaks at the Michigan Capitol
In the later years of Truth’s life, she put down roots in Michigan in the Battle Creek area, but that’s not necessarily common knowledge throughout the state, Michigan Capitol Historian Valerie Marvin told Michigan Advance.
“Truth is understood to be a national figure, and we often don’t think about where national figures live, because we just imagine them forever traveling across the country,” Marvin said. 
But Truth was a prominent political figure in Michigan who had become a legend by the time she started being asked to speak at the Michigan State Capitol on various topics, Marvin said.
There aren’t any known photographs from Truth’s June 2, 1881 speech from the state House rostrum in the Michigan Capitol condemning efforts to reinstate the death penalty, but by that time Truth had acquired such notoriety and intrigue that likely the chamber was filled with elected officials, capitol staff and members of the public to hear the famous speaker, then in her 80s, just two years before the end of her life.
It would be another decade before Michigan would have its first Black state lawmaker serving in the room Truth spoke in, but Marvin illustrates that there would have been plenty of Black individuals working in the chamber and around the Capitol, along with Black residents in the area that would have eagerly come to hear Truth speak.
An article published by the Lansing Republican five days after Truth’s speech offers its telling of her words where she opens by thanking God that despite all she may have been deprived of in life, she is still alive to call on her fellow Michiganders to maintain the abolishment of the death penalty, which Michigan had been the first state to abolish in 1846.
death penalty speech
“When I had thought for so many years that I lived in the most blessed state of the union, and then to think of its being made the awful scene of hanging people by the neck until they are dead. Where is the man or woman who can sanction such a thing as that?,” the article quotes Truth saying. “We are the makers of murderers if we do it.”
The portion of this speech that jumps out to Marvin as a hallmark of Truth’s willingness to speak her mind is early in Truth’s speech she says the idea that lawmakers were considering a bill to reinstate the death penalty jarred her so much that it “shocked” her “worse than slavery”.
“I think in Michigan, we think of the death penalty as something that’s kind of been dealt with because we’ve been talking about it for so long, going back to the 1840s, but I’m sure for many people who saw slavery as the penultimate issue of their day… there would have been eyes that would have gone wide,” Marvin said.
And though like her famous 1851 speech in Ohio, where history is largely at the mercy of the news articles written at the time, Marvin said she would like to think that the articles she’s reviewed, written in standard English, may be closer to reality, but ultimately no one knows.
“I think regardless of if she had a Dutch accent, regardless of the grammar she used, regardless of individual words she chose from one talk to another, she lived her convictions, and she dedicated her life to sharing those convictions with others,” Marvin said.
What Truth was able to do and say was unheard of, she was a power that demanded to be heard in a government for which she was not given a voice, Marvin said. And though it’s incredibly frustrating that Truth and many other great speakers who have given speeches in the state Capitol may not have their words 100% accurately recorded, Truth should not be relegated to one speech.
“Every person speaks within the context of their life, and your speech is just an audible declaration of something that you feel is worth saying. But how can you really tell who a person is? It’s not just by what comes out of their mouth, but how they live, and when you think about the decades that she invested in trying to educate people, in trying to preach to people, in trying to bring people around to what she saw as positive reforms, her life exemplified that movement,” Marvin said.
Truth’s is just one story of formerly enslaved individuals who utilized their story to call on the powers that be to change what was, but her presence in history is one of such elegance that it demands to be told in the full color for which Truth lived it, Painter said.
And the world is ready to look past the “sound bite” of the “Ain’t I a Woman” speech and delve deeper into who Truth and other Black voices of the 19th century were, Painter said. Recent pushback on diversity, equity and inclusion education and policies may make the curious of mind all the more curious about her story.
“Even when we think of how terrible our country can be, how terrible our times can be. We can take heart knowing that there were ordinary people who you look at them and you think, ‘oh, this person has no power’, yet those people empowered themselves,” Painter said. “ So you can see places in what looks like a totally impossible balance of power and you can see how people can get through. I find that very encouraging, that people can’t be dismissed…to go beyond what their situation condemns them to.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Members of the U.S. Senate last week proposed a major sale of federal land as part of the “Big, Beautiful Bill” proposed by Republicans to fund the U.S. government.
If adopted, the proposed sale could be significant for Alaska, where the federal government owns and manages 61% of all land in the state.
Under language proposed by the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service would be required to sell between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres of public land across 11 Western states, including Alaska.
National parks and monuments would be off limits to sale, but wide swaths of Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land would still be available.
The proposed language states that the sold land “shall be used solely for the development of housing or to address associated community needs,” and that the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture can determine whether the sold land is being used for an appropriate purpose.
The land-sale provision is being boosted by lawmakers who say it could alleviate high housing prices in Western states. Since 1998, for example, the BLM in Nevada has operated a successful land-sale program that has created thousands of homes in and around the Las Vegas area.
Staff for Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the new land-sale language would allow a similar effort nationwide.
But environmental groups, including the Wilderness Society, are opposing the sale provisions. 
For the moment, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee proposal is only a draft, but it’s one of a number of ideas with potentially major impacts in Alaska.
While the Senate’s proposed cuts to Medicaid and food stamps have been widely discussed, the energy and lands components of the bill may be just as significant.
“If we get everything that we’re trying to get in it … I think this will probably be one of the most important pieces of legislation for Alaska in our state’s history,” said U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, in a prerecorded Wednesday address to the Resource Development Council in Anchorage. 
It would affect policies related to oil development in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, as well as other resource development, he said.
“ANWR, NPR-A, timber, Cook Inlet, you name it, it’s in there,” he said.
Murkowski, also speaking in a recorded message, said that within Congress, she, Sullivan and Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, are all working on the budget reconciliation process.
“We’re going to refill TAPS,” she said, referring to the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, “we’re going to produce more of our minerals. We’re fighting for a sustainable timber industry, and we’re going to keep harvesting the best seafood and welcoming millions of visitors every year as we come together to secure our resource future.”
Oil and gas drilling
If the Energy and Natural Resources Committee’s text is adopted, the federal government would be required to hold four oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, east of Prudhoe Bay, between 2025 and 2035. 
The language of that section mirrors a section proposed by Murkowski in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which resulted in two lease sales that drew minimal interest from bidders.
The federal government would also be required to hold six lease sales in Cook Inlet by 2035. Again, bidders have shown little interest in prior sales.
More significantly, the federal government would be required to hold six lease sales in the NPR-A, to the west of Prudhoe Bay, by 2035. Development restrictions imposed by the administration of former President Biden would be lifted.
Oil companies have been interested in NPR-A development, with ConocoPhillips’ Willow Project being the largest recent effort in the area.
Importantly for the state, the committee is proposing that Alaska receive 90% of all rentals and royalties from oil and gas leasing on North Slope federal land starting in fiscal year 2035, an increase from the current share of 50% of royalties. The same 90% share would apply for Cook Inlet leases.
The state would continue to receive 50% of royalties, rental fees and other bonuses before 2035. Currently, most of those royalties go to communities on the North Slope.
If the royalty change is adopted, it would have significant positive effects for state finances. Currently, Alaska subsidizes development in NPRA via tax credits, but the lack of royalty revenue means that the state’s subsidy will take many years to be paid off. 
The Alaska Legislature voted by a combined 57-2 margin to support a resolution asking for the 90-10 split to be adopted by Congress.
The committee’s proposal also would lower the federal royalty rate — which was raised by the Biden administration — diminishing the amount of money the state would receive under successful leases.
Ambler Road
Section 201 of the committee’s proposal would approve a right-of-way permit for the proposed Ambler Road, which would connect the Dalton Highway to a mining district in Northwest Alaska.
The Biden administration opposed the project, but the congressional language would take matters back to where they stood in 2020, said Murkowski staff members.
The Ambler Road remains in litigation, with lawsuits by environmental groups opposing it, and lawsuits by the state and Alaska’s state-owned investment bank supporting it.
Logging
One section of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee concept would significantly increase the amount of logging required on federal land. The U.S. Forest Service would be required to significantly increase the amount of timber sold to loggers, and the Forest Service would be required to sign at least 40 long-term timber sales contracts involving national forests.
Those kinds of long-term sales contracts contributed to the establishment of Southeast Alaska’s pulp mills, which relied on harvests from the Tongass National Forest. 
Most timber harvests from the Tongass currently are exported internationally without processing in the United States.
The Bureau of Land Management would also be required to enter into long-term timber harvest contracts with buyers.
Land sales
Section 301 of the committee plan requires the Bureau of Land Management to sell between 0.5-0.75% of eligible land and for the Forest Service to sell 0.5-0.75% of its eligible land.
The land eligible for sale doesn’t include national parks, preserves, landmarks, or land that’s already subject to a “valid existing right.”
For example, land already earmarked for transfer to an Alaska Native corporation, the state of Alaska, or the University of Alaska isn’t available for sale. Land that’s being leased for timber sales, mining or oil and gas drilling also isn’t available for sale.
In Alaska, the language requires that local Alaska Native tribes be consulted before a land sale, and it states that the sold land “shall be used solely for the development of housing or to address associated community needs.”
In a written statement, Sullivan said he sees the energy and natural resources committee’s land-sales provision as important for Alaskans.
“Alaskans are keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities, like exacerbating the severe shortage in affordable housing,” he said in the statement. “I worked to ensure Alaska’s federal lands are eligible under the ENR amendment, which will give us the opportunity to free up some Forest Service and BLM lands for additional housing, including lands around Southeast and Southcentral Alaska communities that are seeing a surge in demand due to the historic build-up of our military and Coast Guard assets.”
Sullivan said the language, and Trump’s presidency, offer a “historic opportunity” for the state, and if the bill’s language becomes law, he would work with the state to make the most of that opportunity.
In Southeast Alaska, many communities have high home prices and are surrounded by Forest Service lands. 
Municipal officials in Ketchikan have asked for the release of some federal land, particularly on nearby Gravina Island, for homebuilding. 
In Juneau, city officials are looking for available land, but city manager Katie Koester expressed skepticism that Forest Service land is buildable. 
“That land is mostly mountains and ice fields … and if it were flat and easy to develop, it’s also far away from utilities,” she said.
“I just don’t see a lot of easily developable land that is owned by the federal government,” Koester said.
Maps published by the Bureau of Land Management show some available Forest Service land along the road leading to Juneau’s ski area, Eaglecrest, and some in a swampy area near one of its shopping malls.
She added that there may be individual parcels, here and there, that may make sense for development, “but our community, our Assembly, has been very vocal about public land staying in public ownership.”
In Anchorage, Mayor Suzanne LaFrance has launched a major homebuilding campaign, but the mayor’s office there said they’re not certain whether a federal land sale would help.
Under the language proposed by the Senate committee, and using maps published by the BLM, the Campbell Tract appears to be the largest piece of salable land in urban Anchorage. Some parts of Eagle River south of the spur road and north of the river also appear to qualify for sale.
“The BLM’s Campbell Tract is a recreational gem for Anchorage, providing residents and visitors with year-round access to undeveloped space and an extensive trail system,” the mayor’s office said in a written statement.
“We are open to using other federal lands suitable for housing development in areas not already used for recreation or other valuable purposes — for example, any unused, federally-owned parcels within the developed part of the Municipality.”
Where things stand
Ordinarily, a bill would need 60 votes in the Senate to bypass its filibuster rule. But Republicans are advancing the “Big, Beautiful Bill” under a complicated process called reconciliation. 
If successful, the process means that a bill can pass with 51 votes, or 50 if it’s supported by the vice president’s tiebreaking vote. 
Reconciliation starts when the Senate and House adopt a resolution that says how much they want to spend on the federal budget or change taxes.
Then, the Senate directs its various committees to come up with ways to make spending fit within that resolution, reconciling what the federal government is doing with what Congress planned.
Each Senate committee drafts a proposal for the federal departments that it oversees. 
That’s where the Senate process stands right now.
Next, each committee’s work is examined to see whether it follows the Byrd Rule, which sets six tests to see whether an item can be done in reconciliation. 
If a particular item fails one of those tests, it gets stripped out. Colloquially, in the Senate, this is known as going through the “Byrd bath.”
When that’s done, what follows is a “vote-a-rama,” where the Senate votes on each committee’s language and senators have a chance to offer amendments.
Because of limits on the time allowed for debate, the votes often proceed quickly.
Once the Senate is done with its work, its version of the budget must be combined and compromised with a different version that has gone through a similar process in the House.
Once the House and Senate have agreed on the same version of the budget, it goes to the president for his signature.

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is taking Juneteenth off and will return to your inboxes on Monday.
From CalMatters technology reporter Khari Johnson:
When Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed California’s most high-profile artificial intelligence regulation last fall, he simultaneously asked the state’s deep bench of AI researchers to recommend guardrails that balance safety and innovation. The result of that work, The California Report on Frontier AI Policy report, was released earlier this week.
The report stresses transparency-focused regulations such as whistleblower protections and audits by independent third-parties — mirroring a draft of the report released in March. It also highlights how AI has changed in the past three months, including improvements in its ability to act independently and to help people make dangerous weapons or carry out cyber attacks. 
In one example, a language model from the AI company Anthropic threatened to blackmail engineers and tell their partners they cheated on them, according to an evaluation by the company. Another assessment found that highly advanced AI models, known as “frontier models,” can tell when they’re being evaluated. 
These reports do not indicate an immediate risk, but underscore the speed of progress of the technology, and that such risks must be taken seriously, said Scott Singer, one of the report’s lead writers, in an interview with CalMatters.
The California Legislature is considering numerous bills to regulate AI, including measures that require online platforms to label AI-generated content and mandate protocols for how chatbots deal with people who talk about self harm. Another prevents developers from blaming AI for harm in court. State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, said in a statement that his office is considering which report recommendations to incorporate into a bill that protects AI whistleblowers.
The report does not address a decade-long pause on state AI regulation beyond encouraging coordination with other governments to avoid the compliance burden for businesses that Republicans in Congress used to justify the proposed moratorium.

No curfew, more troops

Despite protests winding down in Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass ending the downtown curfew and the local police department reporting no arrests related to the demonstrations since Saturday, President Donald Trump’s administration said Tuesday it is deploying 2,000 more California National Guard troops into the city.
The mobilization follows the administration’s June 9 order, bringing the total number of National Guard troops in L.A. to 4,100. A federal appeals court case to determine whether the troops can stay in L.A. under Trump’s command is still ongoing. 
Meanwhile, California’s food and restaurant industries — which employ about 1.42 million people as of April — have been rattled by the immigration raids, write CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay and Lauren Hepler. 
Some restaurants have closed temporarily, street vendors have gone into hiding and food festivals and farmers markets have been canceled. Adriana Gomez Salazar, who is able to work legally in the U.S. and is the owner of an Altadena-based food truck, said she had to shut down her business for now to protect herself and her workers.

Salazar: “I have no idea how long I’m going to be shut down for. Trump can say a lot of things (about pausing ICE raids) but he has also said he wants to do the biggest mass deportations in history.”

Senator may sue Sacramento police department

A month ago, state Sen. Sabrina Cervantes was involved in a car accident near the state Capitol, after which Sacramento police officers accused her of driving under the influence. The Riverside Democrat immediately denied this, and was exonerated after a blood test proved she had no drugs or alcohol in her system.
Cervantes is now considering suing Sacramento police, arguing that her arrest was “politically motivated.” The police department, however, says officers “remained professional throughout.”
Between these two conflicting narratives, it’s difficult for the public to determine which is the most accurate.
As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow and Jeanne Kuang explain, authorities are refusing to release records about the incident. CalMatters has requested body camera footage, police reports and search warrants, but has so far been denied the records from the police department and the county’s district attorney’s office.
David Snyder, the executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, said it is concerning that officials are refusing to release information related to a criminal investigation of an elected public official, and that “the public is entitled to see what the police know and what they believed at the time.”
Meanwhile Cervantes is “100% behind any and all records being released,” according to her attorney.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Though Newsom and legislators agree about how much to fund schools, they are neglecting to address the state’s chronically subpar academic achievement.
Many Californians are quick to criticize the state as a “hellscape,” while remaining seemingly unaware of what true “bad” governance entails, writes DeAndre Evans, an Arkansas native currently residing in San Diego.

Some food trucks, farmers markets and small restaurants are temporarily closed, while others are shielding workers and raising funds to help.



Brandon Mejia usually spends his weekends conducting a symphony of vendors serving pupusas, huaraches and an array of tacos at his two weekly 909Tacolandia pop-up events.
Half food festival, half swap meet, the events draw 100-plus vendors a week in Pomona and San Bernardino. They offer a way to “legalize” street food — vendors get a reliable location, cities collect taxes and enforce health codes — while patrons enjoy delicacies from all over Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Spanglish music plays, people dance and kids flock to facepainting and pony rides.
But in the past week, that’s all come to a screeching halt. As the Trump administration ramps up immigration raids in California, some restaurants, worried about their workers or finding that customers are staying home more, are closing temporarily. Many street vendors are going into hiding, and some food festivals and farmers markets have been canceled.
Mejia called off all Tacolandia events last week. His mind raced about whether agents would come for his vendors as videos surfaced on social media of taqueros, farm workers and fruit vendors vanishing in immigration raids around LA and neighboring Ventura County. 
“A lot of these vendors, their goal is to have restaurants. They want to follow the rules,” said Mejia, who was born and raised in San Bernardino in a family from Mexico City. But after conferring with vendors, they decided the risk was too high: “Some people have told me that their relatives have got taken, so I don’t want to be responsible for that.”
After a week of mass protests and more raids at farms, grocery stores and at least one swap meet, Mejia and many others remain on edge. Mejia said some small food businesses are getting desperate, trying to decide whether to risk reopening or stay closed while their own families grow hungry.
The disruptions come at a difficult time for California’s restaurant industry, which is already grappling with soaring costs for ingredients, labor, rent and regulatory requirements. In Los Angeles alone, more than 100 well-known restaurants closed last year, the Los Angeles TImes found — all before the immigration raids that industry leaders warn could further hamstring the industry.
In California, the food and restaurant industry employed about 1.42 million people as of April — a sizable workforce that is being affected regardless of the immigration status of its workers. That includes nearly 600,000 people who work for full-service restaurants.
Jot Condie, president of the California Restaurant Association, called immigrants “the lifeblood of our industry.”
Confusion over Trump orders 
President Donald Trump and his administration have sowed confusion: Late last week, the president posted the following on social media: “​​Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.” That led to reports that his administration would pause most raids on restaurants, farms and hotels. 
This week, those exceptions were reversed.  
“The President has been incredibly clear,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, in an emailed statement to CalMatters. “There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE’s efforts.” McLaughlin said “worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts.”
When CalMatters asked whether worksite raids would target only those with criminal records, the agency did not respond.
“I’m following it step-by-step,” Mejia said of the administration’s announcements. “I fall under those categories — hospitality and restaurants. But the thing that scares me is he said he’s going to go to the biggest cities — LA, Chicago, New York. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”
Brandon Mejia (center), shown at his 909Tacolandia pop-up, started the event after he said a 2023 hit-and-run car crash left him with severe nerve damage and unable to keep working as a chef. He shut down the events last weekend because his vendors fear LA-area immigration raids, and now he and the vendors are debating when to reopen. Photo courtesy of Brandon Mejia.
A food-truck owner in the Pasadena area who has had to shut down said she has a hard time trusting what the president says. 
“We feel like (Trump is) not being honest,” said Adriana Gomez Salazar, who was 4 years old when she came to the U.S. from Mexico and has been able to work legally for years without fear of deportation as a DACA recipient. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, established under President Barack Obama, is facing legal challenges.
Salazar had to shut down her Altadena-based food truck, LA Cajun Seafood Boil, after the January fires. When she reopened, she said customers were scarce because the area needs to rebuild. She was not eligible for a Small Business Administration low-interest disaster loan because she’s a DACA recipient, something she said is frustrating because she is a taxpayer just trying to make a living. 
Now, Salazar has had to shut down again to try to protect herself and her workers — and because many customers are staying home out of fear of the ICE raids. She is trying to bring in income from catering jobs and has started a GoFundMe to try to raise money not just for her but for an employee who is out of work now. 
“I have no idea how long I’m gonna be shut down for,” she said. “Trump can say a lot of things (about pausing ICE raids) but he has also said he wants to do the biggest mass deportations in history.”
In the LA neighborhood of Wilmington, a farmers market also has closed down. “Due to increased ICE activity in Wilmington, many of our farmers are scared and have chosen not to attend… We do hope to one day reopen… but for now, we must step away,” according to a Monday post on the Wilmington Farmers Market’s Instagram page.
“I have no idea how long I’m gonna be shut down for. Trump can say a lot of things (about pausing ICE raids) but he has also said he wants to do the biggest mass deportations in history.”ADRIANA GOMEZ SALAZAR, OWNER OF LA CAJUN SEAFOOD BOIL
Similar stories and concerns have emerged up and down the state. San Diego restaurant Buona Forchetta was the site of a “traumatic raid,” the restaurant’s owners recently confirmed in a statement. They had to close for a couple of days.
In the Bay Area, restaurant owners and industry groups are anxious and bracing for possible impact on their workers and businesses. 
Owners educate workers about their rights
An owner of a Mexican restaurant in the historically Latino Mission District in San Francisco, who requested anonymity over fears his restaurant and workers could be targeted by ICE, said he has gone over possible scenarios with his employees in case federal agents enter the restaurant. 
He has a sign that clearly says “employees only” beyond a certain point. Beyond the sign, it’s not a public space so his employees are supposed to be safe there, he said. 
His employees also know the agents need to show a warrant, and that they should check the name on the warrant. They also know to try to stop the agents verbally as well as to use hand gestures, so his security system’s cameras can pick it all up for possible evidence later.
His employees all had the necessary paperwork when they were hired, but he can’t be sure of their immigration status.
“I don’t want to assume anyone’s undocumented,” he said. “I have no reason to question them.” 
He said all he can tell them is to be careful out there, especially now. “I told them I’m careful because I look very Mexican,” he said. “So know your rights when you’re out on the street.”
According to an estimate by the Migration Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank, more than 250,000 undocumented immigrants in California worked in the accommodation and food services, arts, entertainment and recreation industries in 2019.
Condie said the California Restaurant Association is working with the National Restaurant Association to push for federal immigration reform, which includes providing pathways to legalization for those who are undocumented and creating a temporary worker visa program.  
The Golden Gate Restaurant Association, which has about 800 industry members mostly in San Francisco, is focusing on disseminating information to try to quell some of the anxiety.
“This fear is really causing stress on families, workers, and also on customers,” said Laurie Thomas, the association’s executive director.
“The hospitality industry, the backbone of it, is mainly made by immigrants. My dad was an immigrant until he got his citizenship. It hits close to home.”ULISES PINEDA-ALFARO, CHEF-OWNER OF EL BARRIO CANTINA
Besides the possible personal and financial toll on workers and owners as a direct result of the raids, she said protests against the raids could mean double trouble for restaurants, which have very tight margins: They have to prepare for the possibilities of a lull in business, violence and vandalism, too. 
Thomas is tracking the changing directives coming from the Trump administration. “Until there is clarity regarding ongoing actions, there will continue to be a high degree of stress in our community,” she said. 
Some California restaurant owners are remaining defiant — and open. In Long Beach, El Barrio Cantina chef and owner Ulises Pineda-Alfaro decided that his restaurant would offer the community a place to gather and take a break from doom-scrolling. 
After a few calls to popular Mexican-owned liquor brands, he also came up with a way to give back to those on the frontline. For $13 last weekend, customers could get the restaurant’s taquitos de papa and either a margarita or a whiskey sour, with 100% of proceeds going to local immigrant rights group Órale.
“The hospitality industry, the backbone of it, is mainly made by immigrants,” Pineda- Alfaro said. “My dad was an immigrant until he got his citizenship. It hits close to home.”
By last Friday, an Instagram post announcing the deal had more than 50,000 views, and Pineda-Alfaro said about a dozen people were waiting outside when the restaurant opened for lunch that day — a welcome sight as other pockets of the city sat empty. 
“I have seen some vendors and some other restaurants closing early or not opening at all,” he said. “We’re embedded in the community, hence our name. We’re going to remain open.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/043025-Street-Vendor-LA-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-19 09:02:14.937267

DeAndre Evans is an Arkansas native currently residing in San Diego. He moved to California to further his software engineering career.


As I navigate my new life in California, there is a question that echoes in my mind. There’s a subtle, almost reflexive sympathy that surfaces from California natives when I mention my home state of Arkansas. It’s a quiet acknowledgment, as if I’ve survived some hardship and finally reached a haven.
I can’t entirely knock this sentiment since California’s reputation as a beacon of progress and opportunity is largely earned. It is, by many metrics, one of the nation’s leading states. Yet as a newcomer who has experienced a starkly different civic landscape, I’ve perceived a troubling undercurrent: A willingness among some Californians to dismantle the very structures that make this state exceptional.
The litany of criticisms is familiar — negativity that seems to originate far beyond California’s borders but somehow latches within. Issues like homelessness, gas prices, public transit, the cost of living and the efficacy of state government are relentlessly portrayed as unique, catastrophic failings. The narrative suggests California is a “hellscape” where businesses cannot thrive and citizens suffer under uniquely oppressive conditions. 
However, a crucial piece of perspective is often missing: These problems, while significant, are not exclusive to California. The sheer size of the state amplifies their perceived magnitude here and, in my view, by a persistent smear campaign. One that many Californians seem to be internalizing.
Take homelessness, a deeply complex and visible crisis. Yes, it is a significant problem in California’s urban centers. But California is also one of the few states actively, if imperfectly, attempting to address it with substantial resources and a multi-pronged approach that includes housing initiatives and support services. 
In Arkansas, the response is often a shrug of administrative shoulders, a “good luck” or, more disconcertingly, the criminalization of poverty. There, the problem is less visible not because it’s smaller proportionally, but because it’s often swept under the rug or into the correctional system.
The perennial complaint about high gas prices often ignores the deliberate policy choices behind them. California’s specialized fuel blend, while costlier, is a critical component of its efforts to combat air pollution in densely populated basins. 
This commitment to environmental quality is further underscored by the state’s unparalleled electric vehicle infrastructure, support programs and adoption rates. It offers a stark contrast to states where fossil fuel interests often dictate policy with little regard for long-term ecological consequences.
Public transit, another frequent target of criticism, is a marvel from my perspective. While the high-speed rail project has faced undeniable setbacks, exacerbated by global events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the vision persists. More importantly, California possesses a functioning, diverse transit ecosystem encompassing subways, light rail, extensive bus networks and dedicated bike paths. 
In Arkansas, comprehensive public transit is largely a foreign concept, often limited to university towns sharing minimal services with the wider populace. The idea of a state-level strategic transit plan is almost unimaginable.
The high cost of living is an undeniable reality. However, this is intrinsically linked to California’s economic dynamism, desirability and the high demand for its quality of life, amenities and progressive social environment. While the housing crisis requires urgent and innovative solutions, the “low cost of living” in states like Arkansas often comes with significant trade-offs: lower wages, fewer economic opportunities, a dearth of specialized services and a less robust social safety net. 
It’s a classic case of getting what you pay for, or perhaps, what you collectively invest in.
Frankly, it was the perception of state government that compelled me to write this. Many Californians appear remarkably quick to criticize Gov. Gavin Newsom and the broader state apparatus, seemingly unaware of what genuinely “bad” governance entails. 
There’s a pervasive readiness to vote against the very policies and leadership that have cultivated the state’s defining advantages: its robust safety nets, comprehensive social programs and commitment to environmental preservation and public access. The legalization of cannabis, the staunch defense of reproductive rights, the preservation of public coastlines — these are not accidental outcomes. They are the direct result of a progressive, albeit imperfect, state government that actively legislates to protect and enhance the lives of its citizens. 
My governor was Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Yes, that one. Arkansas voted for her instead of a nuclear engineering and urban planning doctorate — who was also religious. 
After living under a state government often characterized by inaction, regression or outright hostility to such progressive values, California’s governance is a relative model of responsiveness and foresight.
Do not let externally crafted propaganda and internal frustrations, however valid some may be, blind you to the substantial, hard-won progress California represents. The problems are real, but the foundational structures and the political will to address them are more robust here than in many other parts of the country. Cherish that. Engage critically, demand improvement, but do not be so easily convinced to tear down a framework that, for all its flaws, still stands as a comparative bastion of progress in a nation facing profound challenges.

(Photo courtesy of Carnegie Mellon University)Edda Fields-Black was working on a book about rice plantations when she came across the story of a raid in Beaufort, South Carolina, that freed more than 700 slaves from Lowcountry plantations.
The Carnegie Mellon University professor decided to pursue the story and, nearly a decade later, published “COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid, and Black Freedom During the Civil War,” which recently won the Pulitzer Prize for history.
Fields-Black first learned about the June 1863 raid reading an account by Minus Hamilton, who was an 88-year-old slave when the daring mission led by Tubman freed him. He told of how three steamships traveled up the river in the dead of night before sounding their whistles, sending slaves working on the neighboring plantations running to the river and to freedom.
Hamilton also talked about his awe at seeing fellow Black men in uniform for the first time, and that image struck Fields-Black.
“I was like, ‘Wow,’ and I tucked it away for a long time,” said Fields-Black, of Pittsburgh.
Fields-Black tried to read more about the raid Hamilton recounted. But she found little beyond mentions here and there in biographies of Tubman, who’s best known as a conductor on the Underground Railroad. So, she set out to write the history herself, telling it from the perspective of the raid’s participants and detailing the importance of the rice plantations in pulling it off, she said.
“I wanted to pull out all of those elements, and I thought that I could tell that story,” Fields-Black said.
“COMBEE,” the Gullah pronunciation of the Combahee River, won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize alongside “Native Nations: A Millennium in North American” by Kathleen DuVal in a category that rewards “a distinguished and appropriately documented book on the history of the United States,” according to the Pulitzer website.
The 776-page book told “a richly-textured and revelatory account” of the raid, “weaving military strategy and family history with the transition from bondage to freedom,” the prize’s jury wrote.
Harriet Tubman
Tubman, who became known as the Moses of Her People after escaping slavery herself in 1849, spoke about the Combahee River Raid during her life.
Her role in the raid made her the first woman ever to lead a major military operation in the U.S. and the only Black woman to lead troops during the Civil War. A statue of her unveiled in May 2024 at Beaufort’s Tabernacle Baptist Church commemorates her part in the raid and her years spent in Beaufort.
But historians, lacking official records, rarely delved into the details, Fields-Black said.
When she started telling friends and colleagues about her plans, they similarly insisted there was no way to tell the story from the perspective of enslaved people because no records of the raid existed. But they did exist — just not the kind most researchers rely on, she said.

“There’s a broader question about believing women, believing marginal people and taking our words and our descriptions of our own experiences at face value,” Fields-Black said. “And that hadn’t been done.”
The rice plantations, with their snakes and alligators, made Tubman’s work even more impressive. Other historians had written about the raid as if the environment were the same as in the more northern states where Tubman had worked, but as a researcher of rice fields, Fields-Black knew the specific challenges they presented.
“She could’ve been on the moon, and she would’ve figured out how to survive,” she said.
Finding the story
As she started to research in earnest, Fields-Black knew she couldn’t rely solely on the official military records of the raid, which were written by the Confederate troops controlling Beaufort at the time. Slave narratives from the 1930s mentioned the raid only in passing, and official records in Beaufort and Colleton counties were burned as cities went up in flames during the Civil War, she said.
Fields-Black turned instead to a lesser-used historical resource: pension files. Following the war, soldiers relayed information about themselves and their experiences in an attempt to receive payment from the government.
Among those submitting applications were members of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, a regiment consisting largely of freed men from the sea islands that drove boats up the Combahee River for enslaved people to board and escape.
Through scouring hundreds of pension files, Fields-Black came across a familiar name.
She had known about a Hector Fields from whom her family descended, but she had thought he lived in nearby Colleton County, not Beaufort. The pension files, however, told the story of Fields as a Civil War veteran who fought in the volunteer infantry, helped free slaves and eventually settled down in Colleton County, she said.
Fields-Black grew up in Florida, but she still has family in that area. Her own father was born in Green Pond, a small town in the same county, and the family’s roots in South Carolina are strong, she said.
The story “has become a source of immense pride in our family,” Fields-Black said.
Even after they were freed, many of the people in the raid returned to Confederate territory, risking their lives and freedom, to help others, she said. The raid itself happened after the Emancipation Proclamation, which had proclaimed all slaves in Southern states to be free.
But in Confederate-controlled areas, that wasn’t put into effect. The nation’s last slaves weren’t freed until two years later, on June 19, 1865, known as Juneteenth.
“It’s the actions of these folks that some would say, and I would agree with them, are even more important than, say, the Emancipation Proclamation in the demise of slavery and ending the institution of slavery,” Fields-Black said.

I think that ’twixt the negroes of the South and the women at the North, all talking about rights, the white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what’s all this here talking about?
That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain’t I a woman?
Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain’t I a woman?
I could work as much and eat as much as a man — when I could get it — and bear the lash as well! And ain’t I a woman?
I have borne thirteen children, and seen most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother’s grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain’t I a woman?
Then they talk about this thing in the head; what’s this they call it? (Member of audience whispers, “intellect.”) That’s it, honey. What’s that got to do with women’s rights or negroes’ rights? If my cup won’t hold but a pint, and yours holds a quart, wouldn’t you be mean not to let me have my little half measure full?
Then that little man in black there, he says women can’t have as much rights as men, ’cause Christ wasn’t a woman! Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him.
If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back, and get it right side up again!
And now they is asking to do it, the men better let them.
Obliged to you for hearing me, and now old Sojourner ain’t got nothing more to say.

Although the Emancipation Proclamation had been issued two years earlier, it wasn’t until this date — two months after the Civil War ended — that all those enslaved in Texas learned they were free. 
Union Gen. Gordon Granger delivered the news to those enslaved in Galveston that the Civil War had ended: 
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.” 
His announcement put the Emancipation Proclamation into effect. The news set off celebrations and continued to be remembered in the years that followed. The day became known as “Juneteenth,” which became a legal state holiday in Texas in 1980. In 2021, Juneteenth, also known as “Freedom Day,” became a national holiday.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06104045/June19-update-Juneteenth22_Banner_final.jpg,,,2025-06-19 09:02:14.937267
,California,2025-06-19 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"California politicians agree on school money, but poor test scores need attention",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/california-school-spending-test-scores/,The Legislature's and governor's budget proposals agree to spend $80 billion on schools. There've been few discussions about how to boost students' persistently low test scores.,"Historically, the annual process of writing a state budget has often stumbled over how much money California should spend on its public school system and its nearly 6 million students.
However, as Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders negotiate a final budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year, dealing with a multi-billion-dollar deficit, they have only small disagreements on school finance.
Both Newsom’s latest budget and the Legislature’s alternative draft would peg state spending on schools at $80.5 billion, including transitional kindergarten, a new education subcategory.
That’s $4.5 billion less than the current budget allocates, but with anticipated increases in education’s share of local property taxes, total spending would remain roughly even.
With schools off the table, politically, Newsom and legislators are wrangling over more contentious issues, particularly the reductions in medical and social services for poor, elderly and disabled Californians that Newsom seeks to close the budget gap.
The comity on school spending, however, shuns a debate that California’s politicians should be having — what to do about the system’s chronically subpar academic achievement.
This week the Public Policy Institute of California issued a timely reminder that there’s been little progress — and some regression — in such basic skills as reading and mathematics, with wide gaps among students tied to family income, ethnicity and other socioeconomic factors.
In an analysis of state academic tests that were administered last year, PPIC researchers reported that fewer than half of all students “met or exceeded state standards in English Language Arts, while about a third (36%) did so in math.”
The analysis also found that “proficiency rates were highest among Asian students: just above 70% in English and nearly two-thirds in math. White students’ rates were lower, with 60% meeting the standard in English and 50% in math. Proficiency rates were lower on average for Black and Latino students — 24% and 37% in English, respectively, and 18% and 30% in math.”
Also girls fared much better than boys in English. And proficiency in basic skills among low-income students is scarcely half that of those from moderate- or high-income families.
To cap it off, PPIC notes that California students’ rates of proficiency in federal tests continue to lag behind those of other states.
None of these findings is unexpected. California students have been lagging behind the state’s expectations and national norms for many years, even as spending on the school system has continued to climb to well over $20,000 a year per pupil from state aid, local property taxes and federal subventions.
One would think that California’s stubbornly mediocre — at best — education outcomes would sit atop the political agenda, given their negative effects on students and the state as a whole.
However, the Capitol’s discussions of education usually start and end with how much money schools should receive, when it’s obvious that school finances, while important, are just one factor in outcomes.
There are some signs of progress on those other factors, such as a recent agreement to encourage local school systems to use phonics in teaching elementary students how to read, the most important of all academic skills.
While the state is stopping short of mandating phonics, as many education experts advise, it’s a step forward that more or less declares a winner in the very long debate over methodology that’s been dubbed “reading wars.”
However, there’s also been some regression. As PPIC notes in its study, the state Board of Education, which tends to reflect the education establishment’s priorities, has adopted new definitions of academic test proficiency that could obscure embarrassingly low results. For instance, if a student scores below grade level,  their performance will be labeled “Developing” or “Minimum.”  
“Understanding student scores could be growing more difficult,” PPIC says. That’s not a good thing.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061825_St-Hope-Charter-School_MG_CM_31.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-19 08:01:53.722703

Seven candidates have filed for New Mexico's next top executive, and a few are already campaigning. (Austin Fisher / Source NM)Three Democrats, three Republicans and a “declined to state” candidate have filed the paperwork seeking to be New Mexico’s next top executive in 2026 but, with more than a year to go, the lineup remains in flux.
Current Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is barred by state law from running again, as she finishes up her second consecutive term.
The primary election will be held June 2, 2026, and the general election is in November, but the campaigns are already a multimillion-dollar undertaking. Deb Haaland, the former U.S. Secretary of the Interior and New Mexico congresswomen — who formally announced in February — in May reported raising $3.7 million from 51,000 donations.
Sam Bregman, the 2nd Judicial district attorney, who announced in April, surpassed $1 million in donations, according to campaign officials in May. He previously told Source he felt confident he could manage his day job while running for office: “I’m sure of it because of the team I have in place; I’m sure of it because I have a leash on every day called the iPhone, which is a computer itself,” he said. “I’m the district attorney 24-7, 365 and I always will be, as long as I have this job — and I know I can do the job and run for governor.”
While candidates will likely be on the trail this summer, it will be months before the public will see fundraising and spending reports. New Mexico campaign finance filings are collected in April and October outside of election years.

Since her February announcement, Haaland has garnered endorsements from all members of the New Mexico delegation, save fellow Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich — who took himself out of the race in January —  in addition to local and state representatives. The campaign recently announced 10,000 volunteer sign-ups, according to Felicia Salazar, a spokesperson for the Haaland campaign.
“New Mexicans are excited about Deb’s vision for the future and are lining up to help get her elected,” Salazar said in a statement.

Bregman has secured endorsements from the Albuquerque Police Officers Association, LiUNA Local 16, the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, Iron Workers Local 495, and the Teamsters Local 492, according to his campaign.
“I’m humbled and energized by the overwhelming support,” Bregman said in a May 16 press release.

Ken Miyagashima, the former governor of Las Cruces, told Source NM in a text he’s been fundraising since announcing his campaign on May 28, but said further details would be released at a later time.
After much speculation, Lt. Governor Howie Morales announced recently he will not embark on a gubernatorial campaign, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family.
“My family is extremely important to me, and I didn’t want to sacrifice that time for the rigor and the travel and the pressures that come from a governor campaign,” Morales told Source NM.
Morales was demure about a future endorsement, noting he called all three Democratic candidates to let them know his decision not to run.
“I did share it is too early to even consider weighing in on an endorsement,” Morales said.
The GOP

Rio Rancho Mayor Greggory Hull thus far remains the only Republican candidate to fully confirm his campaign for governor, but he postponed his formal announcement after his campaign issued a news release, stating it is still in a “strategic growth phase.”
Hull, who has been Rio Rancho’s mayor since 2014, has reported raising a little more $206,000 according to campaign finance documents.
Hull did not respond to Source NM texts, emails, calls or social media messages for comment.
Brian Cillessen, a 53- year-old Farmington resident, veteran and hunting show host, filed the paperwork, but told Source NM he still has not declared his candidacy.
“There is plenty of time to decide, but we want to ensure we have a path toward success,” he said in an email Wednesday.

Rodriguez showed Source NM a texted endorsement from Johnson.
Rodriguez, 67, said his beliefs “clearly align with Republicans when it comes to free enterprise, economics, capitalism and reduction in crime,” but said his commitment would be to “reduce poverty in New Mexico.”
He said unaffiliated voter participation in primaries for the first time cannot be understated, noting that nearly one-third of voters are registered as “decline to state,” and he’d be seeking their votes.
“I don’t think you could just simply ignore them anymore,” he said.
 
Decline to state
Gene Pettit, a nondenominational pastor in Radium Springs, told Source NM he is filing as a nonpartisan because “I don’t much like what the parties are doing right now, and our state is in trouble.”
Pettit, 63, has not run for any public office previously.
Pettit said he would make a formal announcement later this year and further develop his platform, but said his platform will center on “bringing God back into the state.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250618_124201-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-19 08:01:53.722703

(Courtesy of City of North Las Vegas)Growing up in Chicago Deborah Evans – founder of Juneteenth Nevada – didn’t know about the holiday despite living about 10 blocks from one of the largest annual parades in the city. 
“I never happened to be on that street at the time that they had the parade,” said Evans, who moved to Las Vegas two decades ago. 
After learning about Juneteenth Day as a high school computer teacher, she picked up her camera to document her first parade and has been promoting the holiday ever since.
“We are still probably the stepchild of holidays,” Evans joked. “Twenty years later, I’m still picking my own pockets to make things happen.”
Efforts to advance the recognition and education of Juneteenth Day hit a snag last week when Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed Assembly Bill 328, a bill that would have established a Juneteenth Educational and Economic Commission within Nevada’s Department of Tourism and Cultural Affairs.
“I’m quite disappointed,” said Evans, who has lobbied for a Juneteenth commission to help educate the public on the history of Juneteenth since 2023, when a previous version of the bill failed to make it out of the Legislature.
A Juneteenth commission would provide a dedicated space to research and preserve the history of Juneteenth Day while spreading awareness about the holiday, said Evans. 
The bill would have created a fund within the treasurer’s office, allowing local governments to voluntarily contribute funding for the development and coordination of formal celebrations for Juneteenth Day.
It has been four years since former President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, and two years since Lombardo signed a bill making it a state holiday. 
Yet, community activists believe that much about the history and meaning of the holiday has been buried.
Juneteenth marks the historic moment that the last recorded enslaved Black Americans were freed by Union soldiers in Galveston, Texas, two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
“We want to expand the information that’s been hidden and written over,” Evans said. “There’s so many names of people that we need to talk about that our children are not aware of.”
Currently much of the work to preserve and promote the holiday in Nevada is done without state-backing by volunteers, like Evans. The Tourism and Cultural Affairs department, which supports yearly cultural events in Nevada like Lunar New Year or Day of the Dead, could help the holiday grow.
Each June, Evans helps coordinate community celebrations and run education campaigns in honor of Juneteenth. On Wednesday, Evans gave a Juneteenth proclamation presentation during a flag raising ceremony in North Las Vegas along with Mayor Pamela Goynes-Brown and U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford.
In his veto message, Lombardo argued the bill “creates an implicit obligation that may pressure local governments into making financial contributions simply because they choose to observe Juneteenth.”
“While honoring Juneteenth is a worthy goal, we must approach new spending and mandates with care, especially during a period of economic uncertainty and increasing budgetary pressures.” Lombardo wrote.
No local governments in Nevada spoke in opposition to the bill. 
Lawmakers who sponsored the bill said Lombardo’s concern the bill would create an economic burden for local governments celebrating Juneteenth were meritless.
“There’s no evidence that it would create a local burden,” said state Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas), who cosponsored the bill.
Local governments are already committing funds to cultural events for Juneteenth Day, she added. A Juneteenth commission would only formalize those efforts and allow donations and more collaboration for the holiday.
“This was just a furtherance of the local work that had been going on for a long time. Most of the local Black leaders have just been creating and funding and doing everything from scratch,” Neal said. 
“Maybe he’s not in tune with the Juneteenth events, and maybe he should attend one,” she continued.
Assemblymember Reuben D’Silva (D-North Las Vegas), a co-sponsor of the bill, noted that the Juneteenth commission bill wasn’t the only multicultural bill vetoed by Lombardo. 
The governor also vetoed bills to establish observance days for several Asian holidays,  designate July as “Muslim American Heritage Month,” and created a day of observance for labor leader Dolores Huerta.
“There’s probably political reasons for that, I would wager,” D’Silva said. “This falls more in line with the overall broader aim to really veto and mitigate any kind of diversity or cultural inclusion bills that came out of the session. That’s what I really feel. This bill fell victim to that, along with all those other ones.”
D’Silva said he spoke with elected officials from the cities of North Las Vegas and Las Vegas throughout the session who were supportive of the bill.
“The cities themselves have budgets for this,” D’Silva said.
Neal and D’Silva said they plan to bring the bill back during the 2027 session. 
“If you don’t continue to share what has happened to the generation that came before you, then the information is no longer used or available for those groups to understand ‘where did you come from and what have you actually gone through?’ That’s why that bill mattered,” Neal said. 
A Juneteenth commission could help bring together businesses, nonprofits and community groups to educate the public about the significance of Juneteenth Day, Evans said. She hopes a successfully expanded Juneteenth Day celebration will also bring new economic activity and energy to North Las Vegas and other Nevada cities. 
Evans said she was proud the bill got farther during the session this year than in 2023, when it failed to even make it to the governor’s desk. She’s optimistic it can be signed into law next session. It’s a marathon, not a sprint, said Evans. 
In 2011, Nevada lawmakers passed a bill recognizing Juneteenth as a day of observance. It would be 12 years before lawmakers successfully moved a bill through the Legislature to make Juneteenth a state holiday. Evans and Juneteenth Nevada played an essential role in both.
“We are not going to stop promoting this commission, because it is a step towards education, inclusion and economic growth in all directions,” Evans said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-18-at-10.50.35 PM-1024x574.png,,,2025-06-19 08:01:53.722703

There has been much discussion about the move of the Food not Cops lunch distribution at the parking garage downtown. What has not been mentioned in all the articles I have read is the work that COTS, one of Chittenden County’s largest providers of services to the unhoused, does and has been doing for 40 years.
I am sure it is an oversight but anyone who isn’t aware of COTS services may think the only place for our unhoused in Burlington to get lunch is in the parking garage.
COTS Daystation, located at 95 North Avenue, is open every day serving a sit-down lunch at 12:30 p.m. An average of 75 people eat lunch daily. 
And COTS does more than just provide a hot meal. In addition to the warm welcome from our passionate staff, COTS provides a safe warm or air-conditioned location, computer access, access to services, phone access, a mailing address, laundry and shower access.
These meals are provided by community volunteers who donate their time to prepare meals in our kitchen and more volunteers are always welcome.
COTS is also a connection point for shelter and housing. COTS has two family shelters and an adult shelter. COTS Daystation also provides a space for service providers to engage with those who may be ready for engagement.
You will find Turning Point, Howard Center’s Street Outreach Team, UVM Health, Pathways and the VA at our Daystation. At COTS you will find community and connection to our community’s services.
COTS has been feeding, sheltering, housing, connecting and caring for our community members for many years. They are a small organization that provides many services, beyond lunch. One of the best things about our Daystation is that while our unhoused community may stop in for lunch, they may leave with shelter and connection to services.

CAHOKIA HEIGHTS — Arianna Norris, 63, paid cash for her home in Cahokia Heights. For as long as she’s lived there, during intense rainstorms, water surrounds her property and last year her basement started flooding.

Norris was around four years ago when residents in Alorton, Cahokia, and Centreville voted for the merger that created Cahokia Heights and disbanded the Commonfields of Cahokia Public Water District. The merger was an effort to address the sewage overflows that have plagued the area for decades, thanks to leaky pipes and broken equipment in the aging system that allow raw sewage to escape, flooding homes, streets and businesses.

But given her experience with months-long floods last summer, Norris is skeptical that the city’s sewer system will ever be fixed, even with the merger’s promise— that combining the three cities would give Cahokia Heights  a larger population and a shot at multi-million dollar federal grants for repairs.

She knows the city has applied for grants, received some of them, and completed some work. She sees crews making repairs, but she also still experiences flooding.

“They might as well have just taken a match to it,” Norris said, of the grant money  “I know they spent it, but I don’t know where.”

Like other smaller communities, the city’s still relatively small tax base and fewer resources hinder its ability to pay for the kind of multimillion dollar projects that could resolve overflows.

It is among five dozen communities in Southern Illinois and the Metro East that account for a third of sanitary sewer overflows reported to the state of Illinois within the last decade, according to data from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Unless authorized by a permit, sewer overflows into U.S. waters are violations of the U.S. Clean Water Act, which the Illinois EPA enforces.



Explainer: What is a sanitary sewer overflow?
Sanitary sewer overflows, SSOs, are a release of untreated or partially treated waste from a city sewer. Sanitary sewer overflows are illegal. But when normal systems become overloaded through heavy rain or a larger load from an increasing population, SSOs occur. When they occur, they must be reported to the Illinois EPA. SSOs can be caused by blockages, line breaks, sewer defects, power failures, improper sewer design, vandalism, or groundwater overloading the system, as is often the case during heavy rainfall. Learn more.




Cahokia Heights tried the 2021 merger and applications for numerous grants to remedy the problem with mixed results. Other communities with overflow issues have tried approaches like selling parts of their sewer systems.

Yet for Norris and others in Southern Illinois, the overflows persist.

While these residents wait for relief they continue to endure property damage, fear and distrust of the drinking water and damaging health impacts.

Surrounded by sewer water

As of 2020 when an engineering report on sewer repairs was completed, Cahokia Heights needed to repair or replace at least 800 feet of sewer pipes, six sections of water main, 19 fire hydrants, eight lift stations, and more than 50 pump stations according to grant applications submitted the following year.

The estimated cost: more than $24 million.

A third of the majority-Black population of Cahokia Heights lives below the poverty line. The community’s median household income is $37,975 — less than half of the state’s median. As of publication, Illinois Answers had not received a requested copy of the city’s most recent budget.

Poorer areas and communities of color often face the greatest risk when it comes to sewage backups, flooding, and access to clean drinking water. Decades of infrastructure disinvestment and neglect can exacerbate problems with old sewer systems, and expensive home repairs from flooding damage or cleanup are tough to make on a limited income.

Two out of the three former cities that make up present-day Cahokia Heights had wastewater collection and transport systems built in the 1980s that have been poorly maintained, according to the Illinois EPA. The newly merged city sits in the Mississippi River floodplain, located about 30 minutes east of St. Louis.

Between 2014 and 2024, the city accounted for a quarter of all sanitary sewer overflow reports submitted to the Illinois EPA by permittees not regulated by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program, according to data obtained from the agency. Those with NPDES permits are allowed to discharge into waterways so long as contaminants are below a certain level.

But a lag in enforcing SSO reporting from more rural communities until recent years may contribute to the issue.

“Historically any time a new requirement comes down the pipeline, it seems like larger communities are the first ones tested for compliance,” said Cody Moake, chief of staff to the Marion mayor.

The sewer system in Cahokia Heights as a whole is still broken and the overflows happen despite repairs. Attorneys with Equity Legal Services, who represent citizens of Cahokia Heights in multiple lawsuits, said residents report that repairs are made but fail within weeks or months.





Other repairs made flooding worse in some residents’ yards and houses.

Last summer during a storm, Norris’ house was surrounded by water for six weeks, and another resident was without hot water for over two weeks after the flood destroyed her hot water tank, according to the complaint filed by attorneys. Within a week, St. Clair County, where Cahokia Heights is located, was declared a disaster zone by the U.S. government.

Solution: A merger to secure more funds

Since the 2021 merger, more than $35 million in grants have been awarded to Cahokia Heights, according to Illinois EPA data. The data indicates an estimated $200 million would be needed for flood mitigation and to repair or replace sanitary sewer and drinking water systems.

The agency aggregates this data from multiple sources, and a disclaimer attached to the data states that there is “no assumed review of accuracy or completeness by EPA.”

Almost $12 million in awarded grants comes from federal agencies including the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, funds earmarked by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth and from the American Rescue Plan Act.

But securing the funds is only part of the battle.

To use these funds, Cahokia Heights has to apply to the various agencies that control the money for approval on how it’s spent.

When applying for a grant, cities have to provide information about how the money will be spent and preparing those plans isn’t cheap. For example, preliminary engineering on two parts of the sewer system over the last two years cost the city more than $400,000, according to invoices from Hurst-Roche, a Hillsboro-based engineering firm.

In Johnston City, about two hours south of Cahokia Heights, officials secured a $68,000 grant from the Delta Regional Authority to map out the sewer system in anticipation of applying for a larger grant, Mayor Doug Dobbins said. The DRA is a federal-state collaboration established 25 years ago to invest in basic public infrastructure in eight states along the Mississippi River.

Dobbins said getting the grant would have been impossible without help from a pro bono grant writer.

An overflow complaint from Johnston City was reported to the Illinois EPA in November of last year citing “dead fish, black water” and “a foul odor.” When EPA staff investigated, they didn’t find dead fish, but noted in a report that repairs were needed to prevent future basement backups. In response to a records request, the Illinois EPA found no Johnston City sewer overflow reports from the last five years.

Dobbins said the November break was an equipment malfunction and “could happen with an old or a new valve.” The break came about a week after record rainfall once again hit the region.

Prior to the overflow, Dobbins said, city staff were developing a replacement plan for the city’s wastewater treatment plant, which began providing service in the early 1980s with an estimated 25-year lifespan. It’s nearly 50 years old.

Keeping an older plant running can cost cities money, too, he said — when equipment would break, sometimes they’d find that the parts needed were no longer made, and they had to pay for a custom fabrication.

Without the no-cost grant writer, Dobbins said he doesn’t think the city would be considered for most grants.

“What takes [a grant writer] three hours would take us three weeks,” Dobbins said. He’s still unsure if the entire plant needs replacing, or just parts of it, but he anticipates a request from state officials in the near future for a plan.

Even if the preparation to make repairs gets done, a small tax base means some funding is out of reach. Grants can require a 50/50 split, meaning a municipality has to pay for half of the project and the agency providing the grant pays for the other half.

“And there’s no doubt in my mind that this project starts with an ‘M,’” he said, referring to the millions he thinks it’ll take to repair or replace the wastewater plant in Johnston City.

“We’re a retirement community,” Dobbins said. “We can’t afford that.”

In Carterville, about two hours south of Cahokia Heights, Mayor Bradley Robinson said the city has spent $1 million just on engineering for the city’s proposed new wastewater treatment plant.

State and federal intervention has had little effect.

Only a fraction of the money sought for Cahokia Heights projects has been spent. Why? May 30, 2024 — The Belleville News-Democrat follows the money and asks questions about why it’s taking a while for the city to receive and spend the money it’s been awarded in multiple grants.

Plan calls for $30 million in Cahokia Heights sewer repairs. Residents say it’s not enough Dec. 10, 2024 — After authorities announced the proposed settlement agreement for the sewage and flooding issues in Cahokia Heights, residents expressed their misgivings about it.




In December, five years after the sewage overflows and severe flooding began getting  widespread attention in the press, the Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul joined a lawsuit, along with the U.S. Department of Justice and the state and federal environmental protection agencies on behalf of Cahokia Heights residents.

As a part of the enforcement, the agencies filed a consent decree that, according to a release from Raoul’s office, “requires Cahokia Heights to pay a $30,000 civil penalty and invest approximately $30 million in extensive sewer improvement projects, conduct system-wide repairs and ensure the community is updated with its progress on upgrades.”

But “the 15 years doesn’t even include [a requirement for] the system being fully functional,” said Nicole Nelson, an attorney for Equity Legal Services, which represents Cahokia Heights residents in a separate lawsuit.

The decree also provides a caveat: If Cahokia Heights “demonstrates that an SSO would not have occurred but for the conditions in the City of East St. Louis sewer system,” the city won’t be obligated to fix the source of the overflow. The two cities’ systems are connected.

In overflow reports from East St. Louis, none blamed Cahokia Heights, but in the last 10 years, eight Cahokia Heights reports cited the East St. Louis system as the cause. A wastewater treatment plant in the nearby village of Sauget also cites East St. Louis in reports as a contributor to overflows there.

Precipitation and equipment failures were cited as causes of overflows in East St. Louis.

But Dawayne Stewart, assistant finance director for East St. Louis, said “there’s never been a comprehensive study” of where sewer problems are located in the city. On April 10, the East St. Louis City Council considered an agreement with an engineering group to complete a sewer study, but it died without any votes.

“We’re still having a ton of problems,” Stewart said. In June, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources announced a $2.6 million plan to buy out flood-damaged properties in East St. Louis citing “stronger and more frequent storms.” In December, state and federal authorities filed suit against overflows in the city of East St. Louis.

Robert Betts, city manager of East St. Louis, declined to comment, but said the “proper functioning of the sanitary and storm water sewer system is of paramount importance.

Meanwhile, with slashes to federal funding targeting environmental projects, federal support for these fixes is at risk.

The main sources of funding for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure are the U.S. EPA, the Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  through programs like the Safe Drinking Water and Clean Water state revolving funds. The Associated General Contractors of America, a construction association, calls these federal funds “highly successful but chronically underfunded.”

U.S. Representative Nikki Budzinski, whose district includes Cahokia Heights, is worried after she said she learned that the Trump administration had plans to cut staff from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, potentially including those who manage natural disaster response.

In April, Budzinski visited Granite City, about 20 minutes north of Cahokia Heights, to meet with residents and criticized Republicans for federal cuts. The cut funding included over $1 million  for part of the project in Cahokia Heights. The city’s engineer said the cut funding would have gone toward separating the Cahokia Heights and East St. Louis systems — they will now have to start the appropriations process again.

In early June, the Illinois EPA announced nearly $10 million in combined grant programs for sewer overflows and watershed management. This comes months after the Illinois Answers Project began requesting records and asking the agency about sanitary sewer overflows.

The state of Illinois also provides funding for sewer infrastructure projects through community development block grants and other grant programs, like the unsewered communities planning grant program announced by the Illinois EPA at the end of last year.

Solution: Fix the Harding Ditch

Despite the consent decree mandating system-wide repairs, a lawyer for Cahokia Heights has attributed the city’s sewage problem to homeowner mismanagement in past court filings.

But an Illinois Answers review of the Illinois EPA overflow reports found only a sixth of the reports made by the city attribute overflows to equipment failures, from line breaks to pumps failing. Three quarters of the reports cite heavy rain or snow melt — or stormwater — as causes.

Stormwater and lack of maintenance of the infrastructure meant to contain it — such as canals or ditches designed to prevent flooding by allowing surface water to drain into them — adds to the overflow problem.

In Cahokia Heights, stormwater eventually flows to several larger ditches, including the Harding Ditch, an 11-mile-long drainage ditch that runs through several Metro East communities.  Two years ago, the mayors of Cahokia Heights and East St. Louis said solving the flooding problems would be tough without remediating the Harding Ditch.

The Harding Ditch is maintained by the Metro East Sanitary District, and is the “primary drainage path” for the southern part of the Metro East levee system, with multiple tributaries that empty into the ditch, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

“The ditch network is supposed to channel water from the ditches into the levee system,” said Kalila Jackson, one of the Equity Legal Services attorneys. “But because the ditches are not clean, they’re not dredged, they’re not properly maintained. They’re dammed up.”

Fixing the stormwater issues will cost millions, according to lawsuit documents. Patricia Greenwood, 75, has lived her entire life in her home in the Piat Place neighborhood. In that neighborhood alone, the current estimate is $12 million or more.

“Yet the city has only applied for two grants to address the stormwater infrastructure across all neighborhoods, one of which was rejected and the other still pending,” according to court filings.

Fixing the Harding Ditch alone could cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take longer than a decade, according to local engineering firms.

At a November MESD board meeting, Tom Schooley, the attorney representing the board, said “By being proactive and cleaning the Harding Ditch, it helps our position in the litigation,” referring to the suit brought by Centreville Citizens for Change against the city of Cahokia Heights and MESD.

In the same meeting, Schooley announced the closing of a $8.4 million deal with Illinois American Water which provided MESD with funding to begin work on the Harding Ditch.

The deal transferred the responsibilities for two MESD-run sewer systems to Illinois American Water, a private water company that has increased its sewer footprint in the Metro East in recent years. MESD no longer owns or operates any sewer systems.

It would have cost too much to fix the systems, said former board president Scott Oney. The board tried to apply for a grant to do so several years ago, but if the grant had been secured, it would have meant an increase on customers’ bills, Oney said. The board decided the best course of action, then, was to sell the two systems to Illinois American Water.

Solution: Selling to Private Water

When repairing and replacing old systems to prevent sewer overflows becomes too expensive, they can become business opportunities for private water companies like Illinois American Water.

Such companies benefit when there is less federal funding for water systems, said Bryan McDaniel, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer rights advocacy group. When systems are in disrepair, they are more likely to be sold to private companies.

In 2013, Illinois passed a law allowing private water companies to purchase public water systems and pass costs on to consumers. An amendment to the law in 2018 extended it for another decade and also removed a limit on the size of water systems that private companies can buy, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Illinois American Water has pledged that it can and does make repairs and investments that “would not be feasible for a single community to take care of on its own,” according to an email from company spokesman Terry Mackin. In two systems purchased by the company since 2019, hourslong sanitary sewer overflows were reported years after the purchases were completed.

In Cahokia Heights, Illinois American Water doesn’t own any of the sewage system, but the company owns about 20% of the drinking water system in former Alorton and Centreville, which it owned prior to the city merger.

Illinois American Water raised rates twice, in 2023 and this year, on customers in Cahokia Heights. In the first increase, bills rose by almost $7 per month, and in the latest hike, bills increased by $15 per month. Both were attributed to “infrastructure projects statewide,” according to an email from Illinois American Water spokesman Terry Mackin.

Since 2010, the company put $10 million into the portion of Cahokia Heights’ drinking water system that it owns, Mackin’s email said, and another $139 million in “replacements and updates” at the regional East St. Louis water treatment plant, which provides drinking water to Cahokia Heights and other Metro East communities.

The remaining 80% of the drinking water system there is owned by Cahokia Heights, Mackin confirmed. The city purchases water wholesale from Illinois American Water, and owns and operates the water distribution and delivery system, including customer service and all infrastructure.

Illinois American Water announced two years ago that it met requirements of a U.S. EPA order to improve drinking water safety in Cahokia Heights. It applies only to the part of the system the company owns.

“Our actions showed that the issues in Cahokia Heights are about wastewater and flooding and not drinking water service from Illinois American Water,” Mackin’s email said.

Still, William McNeal, 73, a Cahokia Heights resident and a customer of the company, said he doesn’t trust the water that comes out of his faucet. Greenwood, also an Illinois American Water customer, doesn’t trust hers, either. They both use bottled water.  In the email, Mackin wrote that  the company works with customers “individually and directly” when they’re contacted regarding water quality issues.



[gallery type=""columns"" columns=""2"" size=""medium"" jnewsslider_zoom=""true"" ids=""71575,71574,71573,71572""]



Using bottled water is a “consumer’s decision,” he wrote, and “for Illinois American Water customers, it is not necessary for health and/or safety reasons.”

“Heavy rain in recent years in the River Bend has presented challenges in wastewater overflows,” Mackin wrote. “Community wastewater systems, in general, are not built to handle the high volume of rain in recent years in this area.” Mackin also wrote that the company has invested approximately $58 million in Alton since acquisition and $10.8 million in Jerseyville, the two systems that had hourslong overflows after the company purchased them.

“It takes time to analyze, review, design, build and implement improvements,” Mackin wrote.

Solution: Generating funds locally by raising the bills

In Murphysboro and Marion, located about two hours south of Cahokia Heights, where locally generated funds are having some impact, former city officials put service fees on wastewater bills years ago in anticipation of future repairs.

“We only have sanitary sewer overflows when we have an extremely heavy downpour,” said Will Stephens, Murphysboro mayor since 2013. The city of 7,000 is about ten minutes west of Carbondale.

Stephens credits the former Murphysboro mayor for putting a $10 assessment on water bills in the late 2000s to prepare for future infrastructure needs. That money effectively helped finance a loan through the Illinois EPA to build a new wastewater treatment plant completed almost a decade ago.

Within the last few years, Murphysboro also began replacing sewer lines using cured-in-place pipe, he said, and the city financed that work with ARPA funds. This method of pipe repair inserts new material into the pipe to replicate its shape, where it hardens in place.

In Marion, sewer lines were replaced with the same cured-in-place method, Moake said. Those repairs, plus drier weather, have helped bring the number of sewer overflows reported to the Illinois EPA down in Marion from more than 100 three years ago to 24 last year.

Marion is financing the repairs with a debt-forgiveness loan from the Illinois EPA and there’s been a debt service fee built into customers’ sewer bills, now $12.31, for decades, Moake said.

The median household income in Marion is $57,281 — almost $20,000 more than the median income in Cahokia Heights. Greenwood showed Illinois Answers copies of three bills totaling $100 that she pays each month for water treatment, water service and sewer service.

Even a $10 per month increase would be a hardship.

“We would have to cut some things out at the grocery store, or gas in the car, or going places,” Greenwood said. “That’s extra money.”

Murphysboro residents expressed similar sentiments in 2005 after sewer bills saw a $10 increase.

Yet the overflows persist

While some communities, like Murphysboro, have found promising solutions, residents in Cahokia Heights and other cities in Southern Illinois and the Metro East are trying to find ways to cope while they wait for solutions they fear may never come.

Represented by Equity Legal Services and environmental justice organization EarthJustice, Cahokia Heights residents are embroiled in two separate lawsuits regarding the sewer overflows. The lawsuits were filed in 2020 and 2021 and are separate from the federal and state agencies’ actions against the city.

The Equity Legal Services team provides McNeal, and dozens of other households with multiple cases of bottled water each month. McNeal said he uses it to cook, drink and brush his teeth.

It’s enough water for him, he said. But he just wants to be able to turn on his tap and trust what comes out.

When there’s substantial rainfall, like there was in April, a sewage overflow next to McNeal’s house turns into a smelly river.

It’s a mix of wastewater and stormwater, and McNeal never knows exactly how contaminated the water is; just that somewhere in the flow, there’s raw sewage. The overflow spills out of the pipe and runs alongside his house, bordering his backyard where he tends a small garden of greens.

His kids want him to sell the house and move, or leave without selling it, he said, but McNeal’s not planning on doing either.

“I worked for this,” said McNeal, whose home is paid off. He shared the same sentiment with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch five years ago when the situation in Cahokia Heights received a flurry of media coverage. Little has changed since then.

The river that springs up next to his house during pounding rain frustrates him. But the water bills bother him even more.

“The killing part is they steady send you bills, and they said the water was treated and I could drink it,” McNeal said.

McNeal said repairs made near his house earlier this year stopped bathtub and toilet backups. But the pipe in his yard still spews water when it rains.

Authorities acknowledge relief may still be years away. In an update last September on the two remaining lawsuits against Cahokia Heights, lawyers for the U.S. DOJ and the Illinois Attorney General’s Office wrote “due to the long-term nature of sewer infrastructure upgrades, some SSOs [sanitary sewer overflows] will likely continue to occur.”

The federal and state attorneys are not party to the lawsuit but were “willing to aid the court in its understanding of this matter.”

In response to emailed questions from Illinois Answers about enforcement in Cahokia Heights and East St. Louis, Illinois EPA spokeswoman Kim Biggs said because the municipalities are in joint enforcement with the Illinois EPA, U.S. EPA and the DOJ, she could not comment further.

Multiple attempts to reach Cahokia Heights officials were unsuccessful.

The continued overflows with no end in sight are not news to residents who live with them. They wait in their flood-prone homes, anticipating another soggy Illinois wet season.

At the home of Cornelius Bennett, one of the residents who originally sued the city in 2020, a new backflow preventer, which prevents contaminated water from flowing back into the clean water supply, ended up causing more issues.

“When it rains hard and/or consistently, the top of his backflow preventer pops off due to the pressure of the system and raw sewage sprays everywhere. He keeps bricks on top of the preventer to stem the flow of sewage that escapes,” a November court filing said.

Norris said her basement flooded for the first time last July after a repair was made nearby. Flooding surrounding her home was common during rainstorms.

Norris feels like giving up, some days, though she thought she’d retire peacefully in Cahokia Heights.

She spends her time working part-time at the Cahokia library and pushing for relief from the overflows. Though she’s exhausted, and she didn’t think she’d “have to go back into fighting mode” in retirement, she’s digging her heels in and is determined to stay. Others, she says, may be running out of steam.

Norris has been to several town hall meetings on the water and sewer projects held by city officials over the years. Attendance at the meetings was once robust, she said, but waned as time went on. The meetings were “minimally advertised,” attorneys said, and they did not see much community engagement.

“It is heartbreaking and sometimes it can be almost soul crushing because you feel like you’re up against it,” Norris said. “That’s the worst part is the feeling that nobody cares.”


Methodology: How we reported this storyIllinois Answers examined a decade’s worth (2014-2024) of sewer overflow data and reports obtained from the Illinois EPA. In response to a Freedom of Information Act seeking sanitary sewer overflow data for the time period, two spreadsheets were provided.

Reports are submitted to the agency by governments when an overflow occurs. For some entities — those not permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System — Illinois EPA staff enter the data from the reports into a spreadsheet for internal tracking purposes. The reports are entered manually by Illinois EPA staff within one week of receipt, said Illinois EPA spokeswoman Kim Biggs. The internal tracking spreadsheet is not public.

Another spreadsheet represents overflows reported by NPDES permittees. SSO reports from NPDES permitted facilities, which are those that discharge to waters of the U.S., are entered into the U.S. EPA’s Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS) database. That database is public, and is where the spreadsheet provided to the Illinois Answers Project came from.

The PDF reports submitted by government agencies, including cities, villages, and sewer districts, were obtained through a series of separate Freedom of Information Act requests. The reports were used to corroborate information in the spreadsheets provided by the Illinois EPA and fill in gaps of time where reports of overflows did not appear in the spreadsheet.

For example, years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 were missing entirely from one spreadsheet.

“Our staff did do additional checking and unfortunately could not find any spreadsheets with those years for your request,” Biggs said. For localities named in Illinois Answers Project stories, PDF reports were requested for the missing years and manually entered by Illinois Answers Project staff into a copy of the spreadsheet.

The reports are handwritten and provide the authors some latitude to describe conditions. If there are ranges provided — for example, if “8 to 24 hours” is provided for duration of overflow — the lower end, 8, was entered into the spreadsheet.

If “unknown” was entered on the form in a space, that value is shown in the spreadsheet. If it was left blank, it is blank in the spreadsheet. When dates were not correct in the spreadsheet or the report showed a different date, they were corrected with the date shown on the report.

When multiple overflows were reported for the same day, even if the rows of data for each overflow were identical and no PDF reports were returned for those records, the rows were not dropped from the spreadsheet because a permittee can have multiple overflows in different locations in one day. In several of those cases, the date of the overflow was the same, but location of the overflow or other important details — amount discharged, what happened to water discharged — differed.

For records in both spreadsheets:

Some rows in the spreadsheets — each row represents one report — matched the reports provided exactly.

Other rows in the spreadsheet existed but efforts to obtain PDF reports for that overflow record were unsuccessful. For some — including ten reports submitted in Cahokia Heights — reports were returned in a Freedom of Information Act request but corresponding rows were not in the spreadsheet. In that case, rows were added to the spreadsheet for data analysis purposes. Reports with no corresponding rows were found more often for overflows occurring in earlier years, prior to 2020, when cases in Cahokia Heights were filed and began to make news.

The form to submit a Sanitary Sewer Overflow to the Illinois EPA can be found here.

I’ve been following Charity Clark’s activities — and those of the other attorneys general, along with groups like Common Cause and the ACLU — closely in recent months.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Nicholas Boke: Charity Clark’s town hall meeting in Chester.","This commentary is by Nicholas Boke of Chester. He is a freelance writer and international education consultant.


It’s been quite a while since many of us have felt so positive. 
We — the very active members of the Chester Town Democratic Committee and others — have been busy ever since Trump took office. Trump’s inauguration got the half-dozen stalwarts who showed up for monthly CTDC meetings to jump to twenty-five virtually overnight.
In January, we created committees that dug into everything from educational reform to legislative activities to “In case of fire,” which met with regional nonprofits in case of floods, or if Trump’s activities made Vermont less safe. CTDC organized and publicized demonstrations: Hands Off!, then May Day Strong and No Kings.
But nothing has had quite the impact that the June 9 hour-and-a-half presentation by Vermont’s Attorney General Charity Clark had. When her mother, who lives in Chester, suggested that the AG might be willing to speak here, the CTDC speakers’ series committee got in touch with Clark’s people, reserved the town hall, told the police chief what was planned and spread the word. 
Clark was to explain at some length what she’d been doing, and then respond to questions people had written and given to the moderator. 
Some hoped that MAGA folks would come, while others feared they might disrupt things. A dozen or so waited on the green outside the town hall amid signs that read “AG Clark — Lawless and Reckless” and “AG Clark Defiles Her Oath of Office.” I asked if any were going to come hear what she had to say. “Some of us will,” I was told. 
Charity Clark really knew what she was doing, and nobody tried to “disrupt” anything. After being introduced by select board member Arne Jonynas, she spoke to the 70-some people for 20 minutes, then opened for questions.
By my count, there were 25 questions. Some focused on details of the 14 lawsuits (as of this writing) that she and the 24 state Democratic AGs had set in motion. There were also questions about the nature of due process, what ICE could demand of local law enforcement members, and what Trump’s sending the National Guard into the LA demonstrations might mean. 
By my count, six of the questions came from people who were trying to unsettle her. There was one about how many “illegals” there were in Vermont — Clark said she preferred the term “undocumented people” and that she didn’t know, because it wasn’t within her bailiwick.
Several people asked how much the lawsuits were costing. “Nothing,” she said each time, explaining that protecting the people of Vermont was her and her staff’s job, the lawsuits being designed to do just that. What about drugs and crime in Vermont? She responded that her office had sued large drug sellers and manufacturers, but didn’t take on the local problems. 
And so on. 
When she didn’t have an answer, she said so. She periodically reminded the audience that the midterm elections were coming up, that protests and letters-to-the-editor matter, that although Trump always pushes back he eventually complies with court orders. 
I’ve been following Charity Clark’s activities — and those of the other attorneys general, along with groups like Common Cause and the ACLU — closely in recent months. Such people seem to be all that stands between our fragile, flawed democracy and a burgeoning oligarchy of the rich, an autocracy that would ignore the millions of people at the other end of the economic spectrum, to say nothing of protecting those desperate to escape an oligarchy elsewhere. To say nothing of protecting moderately “safe” folks like myself.
Mostly though, this brave woman who is on the firing line of what some are already calling a constitutional crisis is working hard to make sure the country does not slide fully into chaos and/or dictatorship. 
Donald Trump, she began the evening by saying, “has an utter contempt for the rule of law.” But, she went on, “This is America. No man is king.” Her job, she explained, “is to protect Vermont and protect the Constitution.”
She believes, she told WCAX last week, that “President Trump … is testing the boundary of his power as president, and it’s up to the courts to lay the boundaries and say, here’s what the Constitution says you can do.” 
I and lots of others left the Chester Town Hall comforted, more hopeful than we’ve been for a long time because this courageous woman is hard at work.

I read, with interest, the letter from Lonnie Poland of Milton regarding the makeup of the body of elected officials in Milton.
My first reaction was, “sour grapes.” She has run for office in Milton and should be commended for that, but she lost.
The immediate issue her letter addresses is how the selectboard seat recently vacated by Chris Taylor should be filled. Chris was recently appointed town manager and, as such, was required to vacate his selectboard seat.

Ultimately, all seats on the board will be filled by candidates that the majority of voters believe represent their own views on town matters. That’s how democracy and representative government work. That is how Chris Tylor gained his now vacated seat.
Any interim appointment to fill that seat should ethically be a candidate who best represents the views and qualifications of the predecessor who was chosen by the voters. That choice should not be based on gender, diversity, lived experiences or even party affiliation as she has inferred.
That is what the voters deserve, expect and will ultimately get.
Sincerely,
Wendell P. Noble
Milton

(Madelyn Hanes/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Secretary of State Diego Morales faced intense scrutiny from state lawmakers on Wednesday about his myriad of controversies while seeking additional funds for his office related to cybersecurity, election oversight and securities duties.
Legislators — both Democrat and Republican — asked him specifically about his spending on no-bid contracts and international travel, the latter of which has been criticized for mixing personal business with state duties. 
“My work ethic is unmatched,” claimed Morales. “I’m going above and beyond the call of duty and we will continue to do so.” 
Other Morales controversies mentioned in the Wednesday meeting include: purchasing a $90,000 car with taxpayer money from a campaign contributor and hiring his brother-in-law.
While in India to speak at two tech conferences in March, Morales missed a key budget meeting — a particular point of contention for lawmakers — and didn’t disclose the trip, or its funders, until later. Last month he went to Hungary on a “personal trip” paid for by a conservative group but also spoke as Indiana’s Secretary of State. 
This week, he brought an entourage to ask for $10.2 million more, with Chief Legal Counsel Jerry Bonnet handling most technical questions. 
Morales, whose office is not tasked with promoting the state abroad, said he believed he and other Hoosiers “need to showcase our state” and “talk about Indiana the same way people talk about other states” internationally. 
  Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, asks Secretary of State Diego Morales a question on June 18, 2025. (Madelyn Hanes/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“I want people to talk about Indiana. I want them to know Indiana is open for business,” said Morales. “… The media should be saying, ‘Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for promoting our state out there.’”
The Secretary of State’s Office registers both domestic and international companies operating in Indiana.
Sen. Fady Qaddoura said the missed budget meeting invited additional scrutiny, saying that such behavior in “most professional places” would impact an employee’s standing. 
“I’m disappointed in your leadership and the way you’re leading your office,” said Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis. 
“It’s unfortunate that I get judged for a couple of things here, but what about the rest?” Morales asked in defense.
“That’s the nature of being a public servant,” Qaddoura responded. 
Morales also claimed he visited all 92 counties faster than other statewide office holders, which he cited as a reason why his office needed the luxury vehicle. He went on to say he’d put so many miles on it — “more than two secretaries of state combined” — that he’d been advised to retire the car for “safety” purposes. 
“You have a vehicle that costs almost twice as much as the average salary of the average Hoosier,” said Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown. “I think we need to pay attention to optics here…”
Morales also didn’t directly answer Garten’s question about campaign contributions related to the additional funds he sought from the committee, saying “lots of people” donate to his political efforts. 
Though he had an intense line of questioning, Garten flashed Morales a thumbs-up gesture after the committee approved the additional funding. 
 Where will the $10.2 million go?

“The office has taken significant measures to contribute to efforts to save money,” Morales said, putting those identified cuts at $2 million.
Morales cited newly enacted transparency requirements to publicize contracting, a rule which will apply to all agencies, as a reason his office needed additional dollars. In the past, the officeholder has taken criticism for his reliance on no-bid contracts, likely inspiring the legislation.
“I’m extremely disappointed that it took legislation to get us there,” quipped Garten. 
That, combined with the budget agency directive to withhold 5% of funds, triggered the appearance before the budget committee, Morales said.

The bulk of the request, nearly $8.2 million, would go to the enhanced access fund, with most of the dollars earmarked for technology and security improvements. 
Bonnet said a new chief information officer, who joined the office in 2023, assessed the IT systems and concluded that the “antiquated systems … (were) in danger of failing.” Improving that part of the office has created “a high spending curve” that Bonnet said would fall at the beginning of next year to between $4-5 million. 
In response to another question from Garten about the office’s staffing, which he said had grown from 46 employees when Morales was elected in 2022 to 80 currently, Bonnet pointed to additional office duties related to elections and cybersecurity. 
“We have a lot to do,” he said.
The additional dollars for the securities enforcement fund and the securities restitution fund will be $500,000 and $800,000, respectively. Finally, the appropriation to meet the Help America Vote Act will get $750,000 more dollars.

A group of young men in Jacksonville, Florida, arranged to celebrate Lincoln’s birthday in 1900. My brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, and I decided to write a song to be sung at the exercises. I wrote the words and he wrote the music. Our New York publisher, Edward B. Marks, made mimeographed copies for us, and the song was taught to and sung by a chorus of five hundred colored school children.
Shortly afterwards my brother and I moved away from Jacksonville to New York, and the song passed out of our minds. But the school children of Jacksonville kept singing it; they went off to other schools and sang it; they became teachers and taught it to other children. Within twenty years it was being sung over the South and in some other parts of the country. Today the song, popularly known as the Negro National Hymn, is quite generally used.
The lines of this song repay me in an elation, almost of exquisite anguish, whenever I hear them sung by Negro children.



Lift every voice and sing   
Till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the listening skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us.   
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.
Stony the road we trod,
Bitter the chastening rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;   
Yet with a steady beat,
Have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,
We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past,   
Till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.
God of our weary years,   
God of our silent tears,
Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way;
Thou who hast by Thy might   
Led us into the light,
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,
Lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;
Shadowed beneath Thy hand,   
May we forever stand.   
True to our God,
True to our native land.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1465399086-e1687179516359.jpg,,,2025-06-19 08:01:53.722703

Picnics. Family  outings. Special jazz concerts sponsored by Black sororities and social clubs.
In those days, Juneteenth was an intra-communal gathering, shared between us like secret knowledge, because we knew the story behind the tradition. In June, 1865, two years after the Emancipation proclamation,and months following the Confederate surrender in the Civil War, Union General Gordon Granger  finally reached a group of slaves in Galveston, Texas, These enslaved people did not know that the South had lost the Civil War. General Granger informed them they were free. The enlightened former slaves threw a joyous celebration, which became alternately known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day or (today) Juneteenth.
It was originally celebrated every June 19th in Texas. Its popularity spread throughout Black communities in the 1930s when it represented the aspirations of Black Americans who knew they were liberated from slavery, yet lacked full equality. The 4th  of July represented independence, in the sense of breaking from England, while Juneteenth symbolized freedom in both a legalistic and spiritual sense — freedom from slavery before the next step toward full humanity.
In 2023, I was the main speaker at the annual Juneteenth event sponsored by the City of Santa Fe, NM, at which the Mayor Alan Webber officially proclaimed Juneteenth Day locally. I reiterated the classic script, describing Juneteenth’s origin, but I also used to the occasion to discuss how New Mexico still  had a way to go achieving freedom from hunger and child poverty, or the malaise of substance abuse. This is the narrative that Juneteenth bequeaths to the country, since becoming a national event: Celebrate social and economic justice, and believe someday it is coming!
There is no doubt in my mind that this country needs a federal holiday like this one, encouraging the populace to address perceived forms of oppression, with belief that they can survive the travails and, in the end, achieve redemption and renewal. Freedom is both specific, to a particular set of circumstances, and universal, which is why Juneteenth eventually spoke to the hearts and minds of all Americans. Yet this year — in 2025— the spirit of the holiday almost contradicts President Trump’s regressive national policy.
The holiday arrives at a time when President Trump is waging an unprecedented war on civil rights, first amendment rights, free speech rights, academic freedom, or the freedom to protest. The administration uses executive order to force government grantees to desist engaging in speech the administration dislikes, including anything that honors diversity, equity or inclusion; seriously addresses climate change; or highlights the LGBTQ community.
It arrives at a time when Trump’s ICE agents engage in massive raids that terrorize Latino communities, indiscriminately ordering civilians inside unmarked vans  and “disappearing” immigrants who have positively contributed to  American society. Following protests that erupted against ICE raids in Los Angeles, California Gov. Gavin Newsom accurately critiqued Trump’s immigration policy, asserting that Trump’s methods do more harm than good because, “Instead of focusing on undocumented immigrants with serious criminal records and people with final deportation orders — a strategy both parties have long supported — this administration is pushing mass deportations. Indiscriminately targeting hardworking immigrant families, regardless of their roots or risk. What’s happening right now is very different than anything we’ve seen before.”
With increasing authoritarianism, without consulting California government officials, Trump deployed National Guardsmen and marines to Los Angeles using tear gas and rubber bullets. This move against the populace (which Gov. Newsom called “ a reckless deployment of American troops to a major American city”) is among the many ways that the administration discourages citizens from engaging in legal protest or enjoying free speech.
This year, we will celebrate freedom from chattel slavery. We will celebrate a victory for humanity. But the celebration is shadowed by an awareness that bondage can take other forms. It is fear of being arrested, economically disenfranchised or “disappeared.” Fear that the country is inching towards totalitarianism is against the spirit of  Juneteenth.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Darryl-1024x461.jpeg,,,2025-06-19 08:01:53.722703

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The Tennessee House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

(Photo via Environment Florida)I’m visiting family in Pensacola this week, and I noticed that the local news has been focused on feces.
I don’t mean they’re cracking lots of poop jokes like SpongeBob SquarePants (“Oh, POOP, you never let us down.”) I mean they’ve been doing Very Serious Stories on how persistent sewage leaks are driving people in one high-end subdivision absolutely bonkers.
“Residents in a neighborhood off Scenic Highway estimate nearly a million gallons of sewage has been leaked into the Escambia Bay,” WEAR-TV reported recently. “Neighbors say this has happened more than half a dozen times in recent years.”
Pensacola is not the only Florida city whose name starts with a P that’s suffering from poopy water. In Palm Bay, over on the state’s east coast, a sewage line burst and spilled more than 3 million gallons of sewage into the bay.
These Florida sewer problems are popping (not pooping!) up more and more these days. Some smart folks have been warning us about it for years. Have we paid attention to the warnings? No, we have not, despite the dire impact these leaks have on our famous beaches.
  Katie Bauman via LinkedIn
An environmental organization called the Surfrider Foundation has been banging the drum like Buddy Rich to get our politicians to pay attention to our sewer problems. I called up Katie Bauman of Surfrider’s Florida office this week to ask if there had been any progress. No, she said.
“It continues to be a major problem in this state,” she told me.
Then she pointed out that both our fine Legislature and our current president seem to be working hard to make things much, much worse for us.
That’s not the kind of news that makes you feel flush with pride.
 Everyone poops
There’s a popular children’s book called “Everyone Poops.”  So far, no Florida school board has banned it from their library the way they have “And Tango Makes Three.”
That’s a good thing, because the book is telling the truth. Poop is a common human product, no matter what your wealth, class, or employment status may be.
If you don’t believe me, I refer you to a recent New York Times story about the South Florida island known as the “Billionaire’s Bunker,” where the likes of Jeff Bezos, Tom Brady, and Ivanka Trump have been wrangling with the nearby town of Surfside over their sewage disposal.
“In a place where many of the estates have more than 10 toilets, nobody has quite figured out how to dispose of what comes out of them,” the Times reported.
In Florida, the disposal choices are limited to septic tanks and sewer lines. Septic tanks tend to fail and leak into our waterways, fueling toxic algae blooms. That’s why people concerned about the future are trying to get as many folks as possible to stop using them and hook up to sewer lines.
But a lot of our sewer lines and sewer plants are so old they make the dinosaurs from Dinosaur World look like spring chickens, which means they’re prone to break.
  Justin Bloom via Suncoast Waterkeeper
“At the advent of the Clean Water Act, a lot of cities made use of the federal funding to build new sewer plants,” said Justin Bloom of Suncoast Waterkeeper, another environmental organization that’s been pushing for better sewage treatment.
Some cities and counties have done a good job of maintaining their sewer plants over the decades since the 1970s, he said, naming Sarasota County as one example
Some have not, he said, naming Bradenton. That selection was not a surprise since Bloom’s organization sued Bradenton in 2022 for releasing too much pollution into the Manatee River.
 The big spill
The high-water mark (so to speak) for Florida’s sewer crisis news came after Fort Lauderdale produced the worst sewage spill in Florida history in 2020.
More than 126 million gallons of sewage gushed into streets, yards, and waterways. The South Florida Sun-Sentinel noted that amount was “enough to fill 192 Olympic-sized pools,” which is not the kind of pleasing mental image that Florida tourism promoters prefer.
The big spill opened the floodgates for lots of news stories that followed.
“Florida has recently experienced several large sewage spills,” the British paper The Guardian reported, “and the issue is expected to worsen in the state due to its growing population, urban development, the climate crisis and aging infrastructure that frequently cause existing wastewater systems to fail.”
“Data from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection show the number of sewage spills in the state has risen steadily over the past decade,” WUFT-FM reported.
Meanwhile, WLRN-FM found that the Fort Lauderdale spill was “a sign of infrastructure woes for other coastal cities.” The station amplified that message by adding this historical note:
“In the last five years, conditions have gotten so bad in South Florida that environmental regulators put three local governments under legal mandates — telling them how to fix the problems. Dozens of others have been cited by” the DEP.
That’s alarming news for a state that depends on clean water for both its seafood and tourism industries to thrive.
The newspaper Florida Today created a website that tracks all the sewage spills reported in Florida. I checked it this week. It showed so many dots for recent and ongoing spills that it looks like a dartboard that’s been hanging in an Irish pub since St. Patrick vanquished the snakes.
 Sewers ain’t sexy
In addition to age, another major problem for all of Florida’s sewer plants is volume.
Because of Florida’s rampant, unchecked growth, a lot of the sewer systems are now handling (so to speak) a lot more wastewater than they were designed to handle.
We now have 23 million residents and more than 100 million annual visitors flushing toilets all over the state. As WLRN pointed out, it’s like the frequent traffic gridlock on our streets has been transferred to our sewer lines. In both cases, too much traffic leads to backups. Of course, one smells far worse than the other.
Then there is the complication of — shhh! don’t let the Legislature hear us talking about this! — climate change.
Not only are we seeing rising sea levels but our warming world is producing lots more precipitation for our stormwater drains to funnel into the sewers. Our rising sea level is pushing the underground aquifer level higher too, the Miami Herald recently reported.
“When tides rise, so too does that water underneath our streets and buildings — an effect that can extend far inland,” the newspaper noted. “Already, those higher groundwater levels have been linked with more intense floods, like those that have swamped homes and streets in Fort Lauderdale, Aventura or Hialeah in the last few years.”
Then one of our increasingly intense hurricanes, fueled by warmer Gulf waters, crashes ashore. That’s how we wind up with a lot of putrid water standing in everyone’s house and street. But it doesn’t take a hurricane to crash our sewer systems these days. Those are just the most dramatic breakdowns.
When increased flooding backs up an antiquated sewer system and breaks it, there’s a flurry of news coverage, but soon that goes away. Even the news coverage of the Michigan sewage lift station named for Florida Pulitzer-winner Dave Barry died down after a while.
Reporters and politicians go chasing after other subjects, and the sewer problem remains unresolved.
“It’s just not that sexy to work on sewage issues,” Bloom said.
But it sure should be, since it affects whether we can use our all-important beaches, a major attraction for tourists.

 Testing the waters
One of the most important things that the Surfrider Foundation does in Florida is test the waters.
No, the Surfrider volunteers are not running around dipping their toes into the waves to check the temperature. They’re testing for fecal material that could make swimmers sick.
The Florida Department of Health runs a Healthy Beaches program that’s supposed to test all the waterways for contamination (more on that in a moment). An environmental group called Environment America compiled the state tests and found that, in 2022, 70% of Florida’s beaches tested positive for fecal contamination.
I’m terrible at math, but even I can see that’s a lot of beaches closed for contamination.
“People read that and think, ‘That’s not the place we should vacation this year,’” Bauman said.
Because the Health Department folks can’t cover every beach in Florida, Surfrider steps in to do testing by volunteers and post the results, Bauman told me. The effort is worthwhile because it can spare beachgoers from contracting a virus from the pollution.
“The public needs to know about this when they’re going for a swim,” she said.
Those Surfrider volunteers are needed more and more these days.
Before 2011, Bauman told me, the state and the feds worked together to pay for the Health Department’s water tests, putting up a total of $1 million a year.
But when Rick “I Live at the Beach But I Don’t Swim There” Scott was governor, the state quit putting up its half. Scott slashed every Florida environmental agency to the bone and even tried to sell off some of our parkland, so his hostility to testing for pollution should be no surprise.
The loss of the state funding left only $500,000 from the federal program to cover the cost. That led to “cuts to where and when the testing occurred,” she said.
It went from weekly to bi-weekly, Bauman said, and major stretches of the state’s coastline went completely untested.
“We’ve advocated for restoring the funding,” she said, “but once it’s cut out of the budget, it’s hard to get it back in again.”
Given that we now have the most anti-environment president in history back in the White House, you can probably guess what comes next.
The president’s proposed budget, Bauman said, calls for eliminating the federal half of the money for testing the waters.
If you’re scoring this at home, that takes the funding for beach testing in Florida from $1 million in 2010 to half that after 2011 to nothing starting this year. Zero. Zip. Nada.
If this budget passes Congress, I think the only tourists who’d want to visit a Florida beach would be the weirdos who cosplay as the Ty-D-Bowl Man.
 The poop on how to fix this
I don’t want you to think all of Florida’s politicians are insane in the membrane when it comes to Florida’s escalating sewer crisis.
Just last year, the Legislature voted to pass a bill called the Safe Waterways Act. The bill was designed to create a statewide system under the Department of Health to send warnings and issue beach, canal, and pool closures within 24 hours of the discovery of dangerous pollution problems.
The goal of the bill was to create a streamlined system for reporting contaminated waterways and swimming spots. Isn’t that great? You can see why it was so popular that every single legislator voted for it, no matter what their party label.
But then it landed on the desk of the one governor in Florida history who seems to really detest clean water. Maybe he’s just looking for any excuse to wear his white go-go boots again.
With or without his boots, Ron DeSantis always seems eager to bigfoot local government. But he vetoed this bill because, he said, it gave a state agency the power over decisions about closing beaches that should be left entirely up to counties and cities. Given his loud objections to things that smell bad, I was surprised at the veto.
Sponsors refiled the bill this year, but this time around they couldn’t get any traction.
I suspect this common-sense measure ran into a roadblock because some folks didn’t want all the bad publicity from having so many beaches being closed at once. Picture the mayor from “Jaws” hurrying to reopen the beach at Amity Island before any more scared vacationers leave.
I have a possible solution for this problem of politicians not taking our sewer crisis seriously. I think we should learn from what happened to Dave Barry and rename our clanking, clattering old sewer plants for the poopyheads who have been ignoring the danger here.
Then, when the plant breaks, I picture the local TV news reporting: “The fecal material that’s stinking up the neighborhood is coming from the Ron DeSantis Wastewater Plant.” Or how about: “Millions of gallons of raw sewage have been seen spewing from the Donald J. Trump Wastewater Plant, which officials said was very old.”
I bet that would get their attention and they would hurry to fix the problem. If this works, then we can all join with SpongeBob and say, “Oh, poop, you never let us down!”

Locals opened the market as a cooperative in 2022 after the tiny town lost its only grocery store (Kevin Hardy/Stateline).If you live in a small town, you probably have fewer grocery stores than you did 30 years ago — and fewer choices inside them.
Independent grocers have disappeared, replaced by big national chains that now decide what’s on the shelves, how much it costs, and who gets to profit.
In 1990, the top four grocery chains controlled just 13% of nationwide sales. By 2019, the top four retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Costco, and Ahold Delhaize — controlled 34% of U.S. grocery sales, according to the USDA.
That concentration hasn’t gone unnoticed. Just last year, the Federal Trade Commission and nine states sued to block a $25 billion merger between grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons, arguing that the deal would harm both shoppers and workers by reducing competition, increasing prices, and consolidating power into fewer hands. The merger has since unraveled, but only after a court battle and mounting public pressure.

In rural counties, market concentration more than doubled between 1990 and 2019, according to USDA data.
One way to measure concentration is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a tool used to track monopoly risk. In rural areas, HHI scores jumped from 3,104 to 5,584 — more than twice the threshold where federal antitrust regulators start to worry about competition. According to a 2023 USDA report, the USDA considers anything above 2,500 is considered highly concentrated.
Now that trend may speed up. The White House has proposed nearly $7 billion in USDA budget cuts, including $721 million from Rural Development programs — the ones that help small towns open grocery stores and other local businesses. One program on the chopping block is the Rural Business-Cooperative Service. Loan funding for community facilities and rural businesses would also drop by 45%, with no new grant dollars offered.
At the same time, the administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” initiative discusses improving nutrition, but proposes cuts to the very programs that help people buy food, including Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), school meal equipment, and farm-to-school efforts.
The bottom line? Rural communities already hit hardest by grocery consolidation are now facing even more roadblocks.

(Photo by 4nadia/iStock / Getty Images Plus)Public transit will no longer enjoy a free ride across two Washington bridges this fall.
Starting Oct. 1, operators of public and private bus services must pay tolls on the State Route 520 floating bridge and the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Vanpool and public rideshare services, most of which are offered by transit agencies, too.
They all enjoy an exemption now. But this past session, as state lawmakers looked for ways to fill a billion-dollar hole in the transportation budget, they directed the Washington State Commission to erase the carveouts.
The repeal is in the six-year, $3.2 billion revenue package passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson. The marquee item — a 6-cent increase in the state’s gas tax — is counted on to produce nearly half the money. Ditching the toll exemption is projected to raise roughly $1 million a year.
“We were disappointed that the state Legislature felt this policy was needed to fund the gap on the backs of public transit users and providers,” said Justin Leighton, executive director of the Washington State Transit Association.
All publicly or privately owned or operated transit buses, vans, and rideshare vehicles will pay bridge tolls when the exemption goes away. School buses will continue to be exempt. 
King County Metro runs buses across the State Route 520 floating bridge and Pierce Transit over the Tacoma Narrows span.
The rules will also be in force when tolling begins on the Interstate 5 bridge across the Columbia River as part of the project to replace the span linking Oregon and Washington. Tolling on that bridge is projected to begin in 2027.
This will be the first time transit providers pay to traverse the floating bridge.
King County Metro is assessing the cost. The toll will depend on the type of vehicle and the time of day it crosses Lake Washington. 
Based on current service levels, there are 118,000 buses, and 100,000 vanpool, Access paratransit and Community Access Transit vehicles that travel across the floating bridge annually, said spokesman Jeff Switzer.
On the Narrows Bridge, it’s a return to a prior practice. Pierce Transit had paid tolls on that span until 2019, when it secured an exemption from the Washington State Transportation Commission.
Though disappointed, Pierce Transit recognizes that it was “a necessary tradeoff to ensure transit funding remained largely intact and kept most transit projects on track,” Communications Director Rebecca Japhet said.
Pierce Transit will shell out approximately $61,380 a year in bus tolls, she said. There will be added expenses for its Rideshare program. The toll would likely be incorporated into the rideshare fee for groups that use the Narrows Bridge at a future rate change, she said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/tacoma-narrows-bridge-1024x541.jpg,,,2025-06-19 08:01:53.722703

Mississippi lawmakers have long resisted reforming the state’s dysfunctional public defense system, which can often leave an indigent defendant in jail for weeks or months without access to a lawyer, a long-held Constitutional right.
Gov. Tate Reeves has until June 19 to sign the funding bill, allow it to become law without signing, or veto it. The bill provides $668,000 for the Office of State Public Defender to set up the one-year test run.

State Public Defender André de Gruy said if the bill becomes law, the money will be used to hire three or four attorneys and support staff working in the seven counties of the state’s 5th Circuit Court District, located in north-central Mississippi. Those new attorneys would work alongside lawyers already handling public defense in the district. He hopes the pilot program will be renewed next year and ultimately run for three years. The new state money would come in addition to what the counties in that court district are already spending on public defense.
A key goal will be to represent indigent felony clients beginning the day they are first charged, de Gruy said. That’s an area where public defense in Mississippi has long failed to meet national standards. 
“The practice of early representation really doesn’t happen anywhere in Mississippi,” de Gruy said, speaking of defendants with court-appointed counsel. 
At only a year’s worth of money, it’s a small step but still marks the most meaningful move from the Legislature in years to improve the state’s patchwork public defense system. If the bill becomes law, it will be the first time any state money has gone toward non-death-penalty cases in local trial courts outside Hinds County.
During state Senate debate, Sen. Brice Wiggins, a Gulf Coast-area Republican who shepherded the funding bill, described the pilot program as a “way for us to start looking at a statewide public defender system.”
In Mississippi, public defense is largely left to a sprawling network of local courts and governments with no state resources or funding. There is also no monitoring or oversight of how local systems perform. A defendant facing felony charges can move through as many as three different courts, sometimes changing lawyers along the way or even going without a lawyer for key stretches of time.
The Office of State Public Defender, which de Gruy was appointed by the governor to lead, handles death penalty cases and appeals by indigent defendants following their original trials. The office also receives some money to help supplement the Hinds County Public Defender’s Office’s funding.
Otherwise, de Gruy’s office plays no role in representing local felony defendants.
Experts have estimated that as many as 80% of the state’s felony defendants are indigent. The percentage is likely higher in counties with high poverty rates. 
“Mississippi has had the same problems for the 30 years I’ve been working on it,” said David Carroll, the founder and president of the Sixth Amendment Center, a Boston-based nonprofit think tank that focuses on the improvement of public defense across the country.
With only one year of funding for just one of the state’s 23 circuit court districts, it’s unclear whether the bill will chart the way toward statewide improvements.
Even as he’s “cheering this on,” Carroll said stronger commitments from the state are needed to turn a short-term program into a lasting reform effort. 
He said effective systems can be built in a piecemeal fashion. He pointed to Kentucky and Georgia, which used incremental, county-by-county approaches to produce statewide changes.
The funding bill also comes amid increasing scrutiny of the state’s so-called “dead zone” — the time between the first appearance before a judge and an indictment by a grand jury, which can take months.
After their first appearance in court, indigent defendants were often unrepresented before indictment, even when jailed. Almost two years ago, the Mississippi Supreme Court banned this practice, at least on paper.
The high court ordered the lower courts to continuously provide a poor defendant with a lawyer.
However, the decentralized nature of public defense in Mississippi means that it’s been hard to determine whether the new rule is being followed.
Reporting by The Marshall Project, ProPublica and the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal found that many courts did not initially have any plan about how to follow the new rule. After the news reports, a former state Supreme Court justice said much the same to a state House of Representatives committee in 2023.
The human toll can be significant. The Marshall Project previously reported that one man spent about a year and a half in jail on a drug charge with no lawyer before a judge assigned him an attorney and ordered him released. In another county, a local judge forced a woman to represent herself during a key court hearing even after she asked for appointed counsel. She ultimately testified on her behalf without an attorney’s assistance.
Solving this “day 1” problem will be a key goal for the pilot program, said de Gruy, the state public defender.
He’s been in talks for months with local officials of the state’s 5th Circuit Court District, including judges, law enforcement figures, and city and county officials. The counties in the 5th district are Attala, Carroll, Choctaw, Grenada, Montgomery, Webster and Winston. Several of these counties have high poverty rates, such as Winston, where U.S. Census data showed nearly 30% of residents living in poverty in 2023. The statewide poverty rate in 2023 was 18%.
Early representation can lead to a quicker resolution of a case, the preservation of evidence, identification of defendants who require mental health intervention, and lower costs for county jails, de Gruy said.
Wiggins, the senator, told lawmakers that an improved and effective public defense system “actually makes our courts run better.”
The proposed funding faced stiff questioning in the Senate, including from several senators who have been paid by counties to provide public defense work. Debate on the measure came during a chaotic two-day special session to pass a budget, and some lawmakers complained that they didn’t know enough about the pilot program de Gruy would oversee. 
The funding for the rural public defender program might very well have been pulled had it not been attached to a larger bill brought up on a do-or-die vote. The Senate last year killed a bill that would have authorized the state public defender to establish statewide public defense standards for local officials to follow. 
In designing the proposed pilot program, the Office of State Public Defense has partnered with the Deason Criminal Justice Reform Center, a research center housed at Southern Methodist University Law School in Texas. If the program funding is approved, Deason will also be involved in the operation and evaluation of the program.

The town settled after lawsuits filed by the solar developer stalled the Bennington High School project, a large-scale public-private partnership to bring housing and community resources to Bennington.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bennington settles with solar developer, sparking community uproar.","After 12 years of legal disputes, the town of Bennington agreed to support two controversial solar projects before the state, following lawsuits from the developer that jeopardized a major local revitalization effort. 
Plans for two adjacent solar projects on a forested, 27-acre plot between the Apple Hill residential area and highway have garnered pushback from residents over the years. The main concerns have been that the project locations are in violation of town plan and zoning rules and could negatively affect the scenic hillside and neighboring community.
The proposed Apple Hill and Chelsea solar fields — each designed to produce 2 megawatts of power — have gone through multiple iterations but were repeatedly denied by the state’s Public Utilities Commission. 
But solar developer and lawyer Thomas Melone has continually appealed the commission’s decision to dismiss his plans to the courts, though the Vermont Supreme Court struck down his appeals in the past, sending the decision back to the commission in 2019. There are four administrative agency appeals regarding the applications for Apple Hill Solar LLC and Chelsea Solar LLC pending in Vermont Supreme Court.
Thomas and his son, Michael Melone, have also filed lawsuits against state regulators, Bennington residents, the town of Bennington and the Apple Hill Homeowners Association. Even Gov. Phil Scott has been caught in the legal crossfire, according to Vermont Public.
Annette Smith, executive director of Vermonters for a Clean Environment, said she views the amount of litigation initiated by the solar developers as unusual and unprecedented in the history of Vermont utilities cases.
Bennington resident Dianna Leazer said at a June 9 Select Board meeting that locals and the town had “successfully defended our beautiful small town from a corporate solar developer who would scar our hillside with a huge commercial size solar development.” Leazer said residents “deserved to know all the factors that led to this decision” to ratify the agreement.

What’s in the agreement?
In a special Select Board meeting on June 3, the board voted 5-1 to ratify the settlement, agreeing to direct the town’s planning commission to consider rezoning the land as rural residential instead of rural conservation. 
“There were a number of factors and risks in either accepting the agreement or rejecting it,” Select Board Chair Tom Haley said at the June 9 meeting. “We want to make clear that after consultation and in consideration of the town’s goals and needs, the Select Board approved the settlement agreement.”
According to the settlement, the town agreed the two projects are in a “preferred area,” are not prominently visible on a hillside, do not violate the town plan or town documents and do not have “adverse regional impact.” The town agreed to support the Melones’ various iterations of Apple Hill and Chelsea solar projects under consideration by the Public Utilities Commission and the Vermont Supreme Court, as long as the projects maintain the same footprint or less.
“The town, having had an opportunity to fully review and assess the solar projects, agrees that it is not under any duress (economic or otherwise) and stipulates and agrees that the projects are in a ‘preferred area,’” the settlement stated.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Melones agreed to drop six lawsuits against the town, including an Open Meeting Law complaint and appeals regarding the Bennington High School redevelopment project —  a yearslong plan to transform the vacant building into affordable housing, office spaces and a hub for child care and community resources under a private-public partnership.
The father-son duo also agreed not to file or threaten any lawsuit regarding the redevelopment project or the “validity of the Town Plan” against Bennington. 
The town supported different versions of the solar development plans in 2018 after making changes based on public input in which the Melones agreed to drop the legal challenge to the town’s energy plan, damage claims and allegations of constitutional rights violations. But, the Public Utilities Commission rejected those versions of projects.

‘Critical juncture’
Lawsuits the Melones filed against the town regarding the Bennington High project placed pressure on the town to support the solar projects, according to court documents filed by the town’s attorney and local officials. 
In a now-dropped lawsuit, Thomas Melone under PLH Vineyard Sky LLC, challenged the town’s support for the Bennington High School redevelopment, calling it a “municipal waste” due to an alleged lack of site remediation and the funding structure of the project.
The complaint, filed May 2 in the Superior Court, also argued the town’s 10-year tax stabilization agreement for the $54 million project violated the Vermont Constitution’s proportional taxation clause by shifting the tax burden to residents. 
In a May 26 affidavit, project developer Zak Hale said a lead bank investor who was set to provide $15 million was spooked by the pending lawsuit and paused funding on May 21. According to Hale, the lawsuit came at a “critical juncture,” jeopardizing construction just after it began on May 20. Hale wrote that the project could collapse, putting him at risk of bankruptcy and the town at risk of losing $1.5 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds. 
Assistant Town Manager Dan Monks wrote in a separate affidavit that Melone had filed repeated lawsuits to pressure Bennington into supporting his solar projects, most of which courts have found baseless. Monks said Melone indicated he would withdraw the complaint if the town backed his plans and the “meritless complaint” threatened the future of the project unless it was resolved. 
On May 20, town attorney Merrill Bent filed an emergency motion to stay discovery in the civil case before the Vermont Superior Court, asserting that the lawsuits challenging the Bennington High School redevelopment was part of a “spate of litigation against the town” to gain state approval of the solar projects.
This litigation waged against the town included seven state court and three federal court actions and “meritless accusations” against the town’s counsel and town officials, Bent wrote. According to the motion filed by Bent, the Melones also engaged in “ongoing, repeat threats to bury the town in lawsuits” under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and the False Claims Act.
“The Plaintiff, along with its counsel, Thomas Melone, continue to weaponize the courts against the Town of Bennington in their singularly focused effort to force the Town to support their solar projects,” Bent wrote.

The community’s response
At the June 9 meeting, Leazer expressed disbelief after learning Bennington settled with the Melones, saying it’s apparent that “the Benn High redevelopment project was the major catalyst to ratification.”
“Essentially, if not ratified, the solar developer would continue to sue the town and delay the Benn High redevelopment project indefinitely, because the solar developer can, because their pockets are deep and they are attorneys,” Leazer said. 
Leazer also expressed concern that the Melones could sue the town again if the agreement is nullified. Under the terms of the settlement, the agreement would be void and both parties could sue again if funding for the Bennington High project falls through and the project is not completed by year’s end.
Smith said the Melones can also sue the town again if the town does not begin the process of reclassifying the parcel as rural residential within 10 days of ratification under the terms of the agreement. The Select Board has referred the discussion to the town’s planning commission, which plans to meet June 18.

Peter Lawrence, a retired attorney and Apple Hill resident, raised concerns at the June 9 meeting about how the settlement was ratified. He said the meeting violated Vermont’s Open Meeting Law by not disclosing the agreement to the public before ratification and not allowing the public to offer comment at the meeting.
Lawrence urged the Select Board to rescind its decision and hold another meeting “at which the public can be fully informed of all the details of the matter being considered and there be opportunity for public comment.” 
But Monks said at the June 3 meeting that settlements deliberated in executive sessions are exempt from the law and are required to be negotiated outside of the public, so agreement could not be disclosed unless it was approved. Board member Ed Woods added that the meeting agenda was only warned for the ratification vote, not for public comment, so the board could not open the meeting for public discussion.
Thomas Melone said he’s pleased the disputes with the town have been resolved.
“My view is that the open meeting law was satisfied,” he wrote in a statement to VTDigger. “The Select Board took the vote in a public meeting and my view is that with respect to litigation that is all that is required under section 313 (of the Vermont statute).”
Bill Knight, Bennington resident and president of the Apple Hill Homeowners Association, said at the June 9 meeting that the two solar farms will be an eyesore for the town, as the elevation of the plot would make development visible from tourist attractions such as the Bennington Battle monument, the Mount Anthony Country Club and Welcome Center.
Thomas Melone said the last time the Public Utilities Commission denied the petition for a Certificate of Public Good, it was due to the project fence’s partial visibility during off-leaf seasons. “That is no longer the case,” he wrote in an email. He added that concerns that the projects will be visible from the Welcome Center are “simply counterfactual.”
State Rep. Mary Morrissey, R-Bennington, said she was concerned the agreement did not stipulate the plans the solar developers could implement. She said the area is contaminated with PFOA, also known as perfluorooctanoic acid, and that previous iterations of the solar development plan included blasting the ledge of the area which would further spread PFOA into the air. 
The Bennington region has the most severe PFAS contamination problem in the state, and PFOA groundwater and soil contamination has spread and increased over time in the area, according to research published this year. 
Melone said he thinks the PFOA issues were addressed in testimony submitted to the Public Utilities Commission in 2018 by a senior hydrologist, who studied the groundwater and soil and concluded that the projects were unlikely to cause PFOA levels to rise in Apple Hill’s residential drinking water wells. 
A Public Utilities Commission final order in September 2018 recommended the commission find no evidence that the projects would exacerbate PFOA groundwater contamination, but denied the Certificate of Public Good. 
Smith said the commission is tasked with making the final decisions regarding the solar projects. After years of rejections by the commission and the Vermont Supreme Court, Smith said the efforts of the developer to gain town support “does not mean that the projects will ultimately be approved.”
Resident Lora Block expressed concern that the Bennington Select Board and Planning Commission may reclassify the site and that the Public Utilities Commission could reverse its stance to support the projects if the zoning is changed. 
“The town has certain aesthetic standards, and this sort of development will be visible from everywhere, from the highway and from the Bennington monument and from the beautiful golf course,” Block said. “The reason why we’re trying to prevent these solar farms is not because we’re against solar, but because the siting of these are against our town plan.”

Once a single-day celebration, Lansing’s Juneteenth festivities have expanded into a weekend-long event. The itinerary features a variety of activities, including the Freedom Festival Family Night, the African American Parade, and the flag ceremony at Lansing City Hall.
State Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) delivered the keynote address at Wednesday’s ceremony, which was held at Lansing Community College. 
Anthony explained that Juneteenth marks a moment in history that shaped the present while calling for the present to shape history in return.

The message of Juneteenth– resilience, joy, and liberation– remains as relevant in 2025 as it was in 1865, she said.
“So what does Juneteenth call upon us to do in a moment like this, in a moment in which they are trying to rob us of our history, rob us of our social and civil rights?” Anthony asked. “It calls upon us to remember not just the facts, but the feelings—our feelings of heartbreak and of hope. It calls us to teach our children the story of America in its entirety, the good and the bad.”
“Juneteenth isn’t just about looking back,” Anthony added. “It’s also about asking ourselves, what are we going to do today to make freedom real for everyone in Michigan?”
State Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D–Lansing) presented the Juneteenth Committee with a commendation signed by leaders from across the state, including State Reps. Kara Hope, Julie Brixie, Penelope Tsernoglou, Angela Witwer, and Amos O’Neal; State Sens. Sam Singh and Sarah Anthony; Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist; and Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who also issued a proclamation declaring June 19, 2025 as Juneteenth Celebration Day.
For many, the formal recognition underscored just how far the holiday has come.
“When I was in school, we did not learn about Juneteenth,” said Robin Smith, who emceed the event. “When I learned about Juneteenth, it was in my home and from my family; it was oral history that was passed down. The honor of having it written and being recognized gives it gravity and weight. Honor is being poured out in the words that are on those documents, and it matters.”
The kick-off event also honored the Juneteenth Essay Contest and Scholarship Program winners. The program, which seeks to educate local youth on the historical significance of Juneteenth, offers prizes and scholarships to students in grades 6-12 in the greater Lansing area. The 2025 awardees– Evie Gruen, Khadija Ujendo, Angel Redmond, Langston Chambers, and Zeinabu Ujendo– were recognized for their essays on the history and importance of Juneteenth.
Additionally, the Juneteenth Committee announced plans for a new scholarship program: The Dr. Wille D. Davis Jr. and Bonnie A. Jones Lansing Juneteenth Social Justice Scholarship. Starting in 2026, the $1,000 scholarship will be awarded to a Lansing area high school senior planning to attend a four-year college, university, or trade program.

(Aerial photography by Ed Saunders)Imagine your town has one car mechanic, and the mechanic just doubled the price for an oil change even though the mechanic’s costs have stayed the same. You have no choice but to use that mechanic, and you have to swallow the cost, even as more and more of your paycheck is swallowed by it. 
That’s exactly what NorthWestern Energy, Montana’s monopoly utility, is attempting to accomplish with its most recent rate increase request to the Public Service Commission. It wants to jack up your energy bills so they can pocket what amounts to a 10.8% profit rate – far above the industry’s benchmark 6.28%. In plain terms, it is asking you to foot the bill for its, and its investors’, greed. Even worse, it is asking you to foot the bill for risky, expensive and unreliable projects such as the Yellowstone County Generating Station in Laurel and the expansion of the Colstrip Power Plant. At the same time, NorthWestern lobbied to block affordable community solar to ensure that its monopoly profits are not interfered with.
Cumulatively, Billings customers would lose $8 million to NorthWestern’s proposed rate increases. Across the state, NorthWestern customers would lose about $88 million a year to the rate increases. This is money that unfairly goes to NorthWestern’s out-of-state shareholders instead of staying in our local economy.
What Montanans need now are cost decreases. According to a December 2024 report from Congress’s Joint Economic Committee, Montanans are paying $1,119 more per month to purchase the same basket of goods and services than in January 2021. Montanans have to spend $106 more per month to maintain the same standard of living as in 2023. And, according to a Montana Free Press-Eagleton poll, three in four Montanans were concerned about being able to afford housing in the state during the next five years.
Ratepayers should not absorb the costs of the risky and imprudent investments in the Laurel gas plant and Colstrip Power Plant. For the remaining generation assets, Montanans deserve a reduction – rather than a brazen increase. Lowering NorthWestern’s return on equity to the roughly 6% industry benchmark would save Billings households about $100 a year.
The Public Service Commission has the opportunity to stand up for Montanans by denying NorthWestern’s rate increase proposal. It did so in January when it denied a $42.4 million rate increase proposal from NorthWestern on the grounds that such an increase would not fairly balance the interests of the monopoly’s shareholders with the interests of Montana ratepayers. Importantly, it rejected NorthWestern’s claim that the proposed rate hike was necessary to maintain its financial integrity, attract capital, and compensate investors for the risks it assumed. Rather, the PSC saw through the smoke and mirrors and emphasized that NorthWestern has paid increasing dividends to shareholders every year since 2004.
NorthWestern’s most recent ask is no different than the proposal denied in January. Simply put, NorthWestern is again trying to pass off the costs of bad investments to Montana ratepayers because it is a monopoly selling to captive ratepayers. Instead of investing in innovative technologies to produce cheaper, cleaner energy, it has dug its heels into Colstrip despite researchers predicting it will be uneconomic to run existing coal plants by 2030. The Laurel gas plant, which will cost $320 million to construct and will accrue $2.3 billion in lifetime costs, is the same story.

Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) said at the Tuesday celebration. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Exmainer.)Wisconsin state leaders spent the week leading up to Juneteenth recognizing the holiday and calling for the fight for freedom and equality to continue. 
Juneteenth marks the official end of slavery in the United States on June 19, 1865. On that day, Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, to announce to more than 250,000 enslaved Black people that they were free, about two and a half years after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. 
The Juneteenth flag was raised over the Wisconsin State Capitol on Wednesday afternoon for the sixth year in a row. Gov. Tony Evers spoke at a ceremony held on the observation deck in the rain. The flag will be up over the Capitol until sunset on Thursday. 
The star in the center of the flag is meant to represent Texas — the Lone Star State — as well as a nova to signify a new beginning and freedom for Black Americans, while the red, white and blue colors are meant to represent that enslaved people and their descendants are Americans and shall be forever free.
Evers said the holiday is a time to celebrate the “critical progress” that’s been made and to commit to “make sure our work is building a more just, a more equitable and a freer state and country.”

“Now more than ever, we must not be silent about the realities faced by communities who have felt the disproportionate impacts of centuries of injustice. Now, more than ever, we must work towards the future where every family, no matter their background, race, zip code, or socioeconomic status has the tools and resources required,” Evers said  And now, more than ever as leaders in D.C. try to sow division We must remember that there is more that unites us than divides us and that our diversity is our strength, not our weakness.” 
The legislative Black Caucus hosted a celebration of Juneteenth in the rotunda of the state Capitol on Tuesday and the theme of the celebration was “Voices of Freedom: Justice in Motion, Leading with Purpose.” The caucus also honored La Crosse Mayor Shaundel Washington Spivey and Racine Judge Jamie McClendon, who are both the first black elected leaders to serve in their respected roles.
Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee)  said they were gathered to celebrate “not just Black history but American history.” 
“We honor the legacy of those who fought for our emancipation and those who continued to fight for our civil rights and economic progress,” Drake said. 
Drake noted that the significance of Juneteenth has grown with its recognition as a federal holiday reflecting “a broader acknowledgement and importance of freedom and equality in American history.” 
At the celebration, D’Mario Cockfield, co-chair of the Milwaukee County Youth Council, spoke, quipping that he was sure people were wondering why a teen was giving remarks at the Capitol. 
“If you grew up like I did you probably had a Black mother who told you to stay out of grown folks’ business but — believe me I’ve heard that more times than I can count — but as I’ve gotten older, I’ve learned something very important that when it comes to freedom, justice and equality that this is my business and it’s all of yours as well. It’s a shared responsibility,” Cockfield said. 
Cockfield told the crowd that Juneteenth is about remembering how much Black Americans have struggled and overcome and also remembering to be present, aware and to be the change that those who came before us could only wish to see. He said the work towards justice is the work of every generation. 
“Freedom isn’t given, it’s earned through struggle, through sacrifice and through courage,” Cockfield said. He said it also takes the will to be “in grown folks’ business.”

(Photo courtesy of the African American Library at The Gregory School, Houston Public Library)The United States’ newest federal holiday, celebrated annually on June 19, has quickly become its most puzzling one. Four years after President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Americans have wrestled with what to make of the holiday.
What is Juneteenth? What is the proper way to celebrate it? Should holiday observers attend barbecues and cookouts? Should Juneteenth’s observance be a day of learning? Is there a way to acknowledge the holiday without misappropriating it?
This confusion likely emerged because many Americans did not even learn about Juneteenth until around when it became a federal holiday in 2021. Moreover, the Trump administration and state legislatures across the country have further complicated matters with their increased efforts to ban the type of education that led to the national recognition of the holiday in the first place.
‘All slaves are free’
Juneteenth – short for June Nineteenth – recognizes the day in 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with roughly 2,000 federal troops from the 13th Army Corps. Upon arriving, Granger issued General Order No. 3. The order read:
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”

	Granger’s order effectively freed 250,000 enslaved people in the region.
Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the enslaved in all the states that had seceded from the U.S., nearly 2½ years earlier, Texas, a Confederate state, rebelled against it.
At the time, Texas had a minimal number of Union soldiers to enforce the proclamation’s emancipation of enslaved people residing within Confederate territory. Consequently, many of those enslaved in Texas remained ignorant of the proclamation’s potential impact on their lives, or of the fact the Civil War had functionally ended two months earlier.
In an interview published in 1941, for example, Laura Smalley of Hempstead, Texas, remembered how her enslaver fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He returned without informing those whom he enslaved of their freedom. In her interview, she recounted, “Old master didn’t tell, you know, they was free … I think now they say they worked them, six months after that.”
‘Second Independence Day’
June 19, 1865, a Monday, changed that.
The news of emancipation culminated a generations-long struggle for Black people to obtain a modicum of freedom in the U.S.
For this reason, some refer to Juneteenth as the nation’s second Independence Day. The end of bondage was ostensibly codified in the 13th Amendment ratified later that year.
Spontaneous Juneteenth celebrations emerged almost immediately. Celebrants referred to the day as “Emancipation Day,” “Freedom Day,” “Juneteenth” and “Jubilee Day.” The latter title alluded to the biblical period following seven sabbatical cycles that resulted in canceling debts and freeing the enslaved.
Flake’s Bulletin, a weekly, Galveston-based publication, reported on an Emancipation Celebration occurring on Jan. 2, 1866, that included upward of 800 people. A similar gathering occurred in Galveston on June 19, 1866, in what is now the church known as Reedy Chapel AME. Annual celebrations continued, beginning in southeastern Texas, with events such as historical reenactments, parades, picnics, music and speeches.

Legacies of slavery
While the holiday marked a joyous occasion for some, Juneteenth met early and persistent opposition, particularly in the time following Reconstruction.
For years, local reporting spoke of Juneteenth, as the Galveston Historical Foundation put it, in a “flagrantly racist nature.” Additionally, the racist stereotyping – “idleness” – in the final sentence of Granger’s order simultaneously illustrated its complicated nature while also “[foreshadowing] that the fight for freedom would continue,” National Archives staffer Michael Davis wrote in 2020.
Historian Keisha Blain explains, “The enslavement of Black people in the U.S. may have ended but the legacies of slavery still shape every aspect of Black life.”
Advocates such as Opal Lee, commonly referred to as the “grandmother of Juneteenth,” pressed for Juneteenth celebration to continue and, ultimately, for it to be made a national holiday.
Lee began her advocacy in earnest during the mid-1970s in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. The oldest member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, Lee spearheaded several campaigns to draw attention to Juneteenth. These campaigns included initiatives such as an online petition promoting the holiday’s observance launched in 2019 that amassed 1.6 million signatures.
In speaking on the significance of Juneteenth, Lee said, “Freedom is for everyone. I think freedom should be celebrated from the 19th of June to the Fourth of July; however, none of us are free until we are all free. We are not free yet, and Juneteenth is a symbol of that.”

National recognition
Because of this advocacy, Juneteenth has grown from relatively obscure regional celebrations to, starting in 2021, a federal holiday.
The establishment of the holiday was the capstone of initiatives during the racial reckoning. Historians refer to the racial reckoning as the time period beginning in the summer of 2020 until the spring of the following year that witnessed heightened attention to America’s nagging history of racism.
This reckoning included the historic protests prompted by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.
During this time, numerous institutions, ranging from colleges and universities to major companies, made commitments to racial equity. The recognition of Juneteenth represented a symbolic means to honor those commitments.
In remarks marking his signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Biden said, “Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come.”

Backtracking on gains

	
But within a year, some had already begun to argue the nation had, as community organizer Braxton Brewington wrote, “betrayed the spirit of Jubilee Day.”
Many of the racial equity commitments made during the racial reckoning quickly vanished within a year or two. Economist William Michael Cunningham revealed American companies pledged $50 billion to racial equity efforts in 2020, yet had only spent $250 million by 2021.
By the spring of 2025, companies such as Walmart and McDonald’s announced they will discontinue their diversity, equity and inclusion work. Moreover, Walmart will stop using the term altogether. Amazon, Meta and dozens of other large corporations made similar announcements.
And members of the Trump administration have mounted continual attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and used the term as a politically expedient slur to deride Black people. This is also exacerbated by the Trump administration’s challenges to birthright citizenship, a key right that gave citizenship to the formerly enslaved and later guaranteed important rights to the entire populace.
This major shift has fueled arguments that the U.S. has regressed from efforts toward racial equity and thus undermined the meaning of Juneteenth. And such backtracking arguably makes some Juneteenth celebrations performative exercises rather than celebrations of true racial equity.
As one critic asked, has the holiday devolved “into an exploitative and profit-driven enterprise for companies that disregard the true significance of this day to the Black community?”
All of this has led to increasing confusion over how to commemorate Juneteenth, if at all. Juneteenth is not the first federal holiday with a complicated history. Nevertheless, with other complex holidays, Americans had years to process their misgivings. In short, the nation is still deciding what it means to be free.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Friction between Democrats and Republicans was on display Wednesday as the Senate passed several bills along party lines that create programs, grants and facilities without state funding attached. 
Republicans argued the bills need to be signed before funding is included in the budget to assure them there won’t be any changes made by Gov. Tony Evers using his partial veto, and Democrats said the funding needed to be included to assure them the bills don’t become unfunded mandates.
The first bill — SB 41 — would instruct the Office of School Safety in the Department of Justice to establish a program that allows public and private schools to apply for grants to improve safety in school buildings and provide security training to school staff. The program would sunset in July 2027 under the GOP bill.
The bill initially had $30 million in funding attached, but Republican lawmakers passed an amendment that removed the funding.
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said, while the Senate debated the bill, that his caucus has “no trust” in Evers and his office and said that is the result of vetoes in the past on bills. 
LeMahieu noted three vetoes from last session as example: the veto in the state budget that extended revenue limit increases for schools for 400 years, one on a bill funding a new literacy program and another on a bill meant to help combat PFAS. 
“It is our commitment to you that we are hoping these bills get bipartisan support — they’re bills that are important for Wisconsin,” LeMahieu said. “And if they get through both the houses and the governor signs them. We intend to fund this through the budget process.”  
LeMahieu said that otherwise lawmakers would be funding a program without knowing what it will look like.
“Frankly, there is a trust issue between our caucus and Evers,” LeMahieu said. 
Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback said in a statement to the Examiner after the floor session that the GOP-led Legislature has “spent years undermining our constitutional checks and balances by giving themselves outsized influence and control over the policymaking process.” 
“It’s ‘my way or the highway’ for Republicans, who’d rather go as far as passing a Frankenstein budget in pieces than try to work together to get good things done for the people of our state,” Cudaback said. “If Republican lawmakers spent more time working across the aisle in good faith than they do trying to exhaust every avenue to preserve their political power while they still have it, Wisconsinites would be better off.”
Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) said during floor debate that Democrats cannot trust the funding will actually come if the bills are done in that way.
“We’re supposed to trust that bills are going to get passed with no funding because they are going to get funded later,” Smith said, adding that “when there is no funding behind the bill it’s hollow. It means nothing.”
Smith authored an amendment that would have put the funding back. Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) — the author of the bill — voted in favor of every amendment to the bill, including the ones authored by Democrats to provide the funding and in favor of the amendment that he authored that removed the funding from the bill. He made similar votes on other bills that he authored. 
Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) said he has asked Republican lawmakers, including those on the budget committee, about funding for several proposals, but has never gotten a clear answer on funding. 
“Come back and talk to us when you’ve decided. Is it $ 5 [million]? Is it 10 [million]? Is it nothing? Are we actually doing this? If you were bringing this up later with the budget, if we actually had a budget, if we weren’t just waiting for you all to decide whether you’re going to cut the UW budget, if we had a budget in front of us… maybe we could talk,” Spreitzer said. “We have absolutely no idea what you’re doing on the budget. We have no idea if you actually have 17 votes on a budget.” 
With the budget still in process, Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) and Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) have expressed reluctance to support  the budget proposal as approved so far by the Joint Finance Committee. This could leave Senate Republicans — who hold an 18-15 majority — without much wiggle room to pass a budget.
That could give Democrats more leverage. Hesselbein said she is hopeful she can work with Republicans to pass a budget that invests in priorities including public education, higher ed and child care.
“It certainly seems that Sen. Kapenga has been very clear,” Hesselbein said. As for whether Democrats will vote for it, she said, they will “have to see what that budget looks like” but her “door remains open to have those conversations.”
The Senate floor session came after Evers had been urging lawmakers to make sure their bills include funding. 
Evers’ legislative affairs director Zach Madden sent letters to Republican authors of bills last week, which Democrats read during the floor session, expressing Evers’ concern about the lack of funding attached. His office identified 16 bills needing funding.
“While the Governor is supportive of the policy concept the bill aims to accomplish, the bill does not include the necessary funding to implement the bill. Without providing the necessary funding, the legislation is effectively nothing more than an empty promise,” Madden wrote. 
Madden wrote that Evers is requesting the bill be amended to include the funding, the bill be incorporated into the budget bill or that language be added to the bills to “make clear the requirement of the bill is only mandated after adequate funding is appropriated in subsequent legislation specifically for the purpose of the bill.” 
“The Legislature has increasingly tried to pass legislation to create new and unfunded mandates, add additional requirements or policies that require resources to implement, and tie up hundreds of millions of dollars in critical investments in a trust fund or the JFC supplemental fund that never leave Madison to serve the purposes for which they were intended,” Madden wrote. “Due to the Legislature’s inaction, districts still haven’t seen one cent of that funding even as the various policy requirements went into effect.” 
Madden said that lawmakers splitting the bills in the budget from their funding is  “unsustainable and untenable,” and is interfering with the Evers’ ability to exercise his partial veto power. He said the change needs to be made if the bills are going to be signed into law. 
“It is clear the overarching goal of these practices is designed to prevent the Governor from exercising his constitutional veto authority, and it is further apparent the Legislature is now attempting to use this practice to effectively try to pass a biennial budget in pieces.” 
Wanggaard called the letters “intimidating” and “threatening” at one point. 
“That was the intimidating letter that was sent,” Spreitzer said, after reading one of them. “If that was intimidating, then you must not have worked in politics long.” 
The debate became heated with Spreitzer at one point standing up and asking for his name to be removed as an author from one of the bills he had co-sponsored, saying it was an “unfunded mandate.” 
Youth corrections bills
Several of the bills the Senate voted on came out of a study committee held over the summer of 2024 charged with considering legislative solutions to issues with the emergency detention of minors.
One bill — SB 106 — would establish psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTF) in Wisconsin. The facilities are meant to offer long-term treatment for children diagnosed with psychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, substance use disorders, severe emotional disturbance or post-traumatic stress disorder. Lawmakers want to establish the facilities to help prevent minors from being sent out of state when they’re in crisis. 
“We’re willing to vote for this if it’s real, if it has funding,” Smith said. One of the Democrats’ proposed amendments to the bill would have provided DHS with nearly $1.8 million in 2025-26 and 2026-27 for the administration and funding of PRTFs. 
Sen. Eric Wimberger called Democrats’ amendments a “stunt” and said the Wisconsin Supreme Court had changed the rules for how Wisconsin does the budget. 
“If we were to put an appropriation in the bill, he could line-item the whole thing and just take the money,” Wimberger said. “We’re going to maintain the authority of our branch.”  
Wanggaard said that if Evers vetoes the bill it is on him and not on the Legislature. 
Other bills passed by the Senate that Democrats said needed money attached included:

SB 108, which requires the Department of Health Services (DHS) to develop an online portal that would facilitate sharing of safety plans for a minor in crisis with specific people. Democrats had requested $1 million in funding to be attached.


SB 111, which establishes that counties are responsible for the transportation of a minor to emergency detention if they approve detention for a minor. Democrats wanted to include open-ended funding, while an amendment was made to provide a specific amount of funding. 
SB 182, co-authored by Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) instructs the Technical College Board to provide grants to technical colleges that provide emergency medical services courses that train and prepare people for their initial certification or licensure as an emergency medical responder or services practitioner. The bill also instructs the Higher Educational Aids Board to reimburse students or their employers for tuition and materials necessary for someone to qualify for the initial certification or licensure as an emergency medical responder or an emergency medical services practitioner.
SB 283, which requires the Department of Transportation to establish and administer a public protective services hearing protection program. 

Assembly talk about education, child care plans
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said on Wednesday morning ahead of the Assembly floor session that the proposals from Republican lawmakers aren’t adequate.
“Our public schools are in crisis. Our communities are being forced to go to referendum year after year, our child care industry needs direct investment to keep it afloat, and our universities need essential dollars to provide the best services for our students,” Neubauer said. She added that Republican lawmakers declined to raise special education funding in schools to 60% and are preparing cuts to the University of Wisconsin system.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said his caucus supports cutting $87 million from  the UW system, but wouldn’t say if that’s the final proposal the budget committee will take up. The system has said it needs additional funding and Evers had requested $855 million in his proposal for it. Vos says Republicans want “reform” of the UW for the “broken process that we currently have.”

“That would have serious consequences for economies across Wisconsin and the future of our state. A cut like that could mean closed campuses — the Platteville, River Falls or Stevens Point Marathon County — at risk,” Neubauer said. “Cuts like that would have consequences for thousands of students, staff, and faculty, and is just unacceptable.” 
Neubauer said that lawmakers need to work with Evers and Democrats to pass a budget that will “ensure the continuity of essential services” in Wisconsin.
“There is still too much political correctness on campus,” Vos said. “We don’t have enough respect for political diversity — heaven forbid, if you’re a student who’s Jewish or has a different viewpoint on campus, where you feel like you’re either targeted or the victim of potential hate.” 
During the last legislative session, Republican leaders leveraged pay raises and funding for building projects to get the UW system to concede on diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Assembly Republicans also announced their plans to address the child care crisis in Wisconsin — again rejecting Democrats’ calls for funding Child Care Counts, which faces a quickly approaching deadline for when funding runs out. Evers had requested a $480 million child care measure and some providers have argued it’s necessary to help keep child care businesses open. 
The outline announced Wednesday includes allowing 16-and 17-year-olds to staff child care facilities as assistants and to count towards staff to child ratios, increasing the number of children that a family provider can have from 8 to 12 and creating a zero-interest loan for child care providers and a 15% tax credit for the business expenses at a child care facility.
Vos said Democrats’ approach to the child care issue wouldn’t be effective. He said Republicans’ plan was “comprehensive” and a “good idea.”
“The plan that they have basically put out is saying that the way we drive down the price of groceries is to pay the owner of the grocery store more, hoping that it will trickle down to cost carrots and eggs less,” Vos said. “What we prefer to do is to give the money to the consumer to the parents to actually make those decisions.” 
Shawn Phetteplace, national campaign director for Main Street Alliance, told the Examiner that the proposal is a sign that Republicans are “deeply unserious” about working to improve the child care crisis. 
“If you look at what the actual crisis is in child care, it is the fact that parents can’t afford it, and that providers do not make enough to be able to make a living and stay and enter the industry. We believe at Main Street Alliance that the solution to this is to invest in the Child Care Counts program and not to do budget gimmicks that have been proven to be failures over the years.” 
Phetteplace said that Vos’ grocery comparison was “oddly” appropriate given that the U.S. already subsidizes farmers. 
“We provide generous subsidies to allow them to have consistent, predictable markets for their goods,” Phetteplace said. “What we’re asking for is to make sure that the child care providers are making enough, and the parents can afford it to ensure that we have a market and child care that works for Wisconsin families. The proposal today by the Speaker and Assembly Republicans is simply an effort to deflect this issue and to make it less politically salient. We believe that is not the right approach, and we urge them to get serious and to negotiate with [Evers].” 
The Joint Finance Committee is scheduled to meet to continue its work on the budget Thursday.

The Wyoming Department of Transportation has bumped back a weekend closure of Teton Pass, with the road now scheduled to shut down at 6 p.m. June 27 and reopen at 6 a.m. June 30, in time for the morning commute.
Final fix for Teton Pass landslide will require a weekend closure

“We had some rain recently that put us behind schedule, and we wanted to make sure the crews were absolutely ready for the compressed weekend schedule,” WYDOT resident engineer Bob Hammond said in a Tuesday statement. “We didn’t want to schedule the closure during the week and disrupt commuters, so we opted to move the work to the following weekend.”
Closing Wyoming’s busiest two-lane highway, even for a weekend, during the height of the summer tourism season will disrupt travel for thousands of commuters and visitors who rely on Teton Pass. But trying to do the work without a full closure would drag out that disruption, WYDOT says.

Once the closure commences, crews will work 24 hours a day to complete the job. Crews will be paving the final stretch of new roadway after a painstaking rebuild of the “Big Fill,” which collapsed last year.
During the closure, motorists will have to detour through Swan Valley, Alpine and the Snake River Canyon. The mountain pass accommodates an average of 10,000 vehicles per day.
“I know that rescheduling the work will impact people’s daily lives, but we want to be sure we are ready when the weekend comes,” Hammond said in Tuesday’s update.

The highway will be closed between the Coal Creek Campground on the west side and the gate at mile marker 7 on the east side. People can still bike and otherwise recreate on the east side of Teton Pass and access the Coal Creek Campground on the west side. But WYDOT is warning walkers and bikers to beware of heavy trucks and not descend from the top of the pass down the west side toward the work site.

Equality State politicians have butted heads before. But it’s rare to see it play out so publicly.
The post Gordon, Gray feud escalates as Wyoming’s top officials grapple with mining, wind projects appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—Observers expected tension when Wyoming officials met early this month to determine the fate of a prized state property at the base of Casper Mountain. 
Since early 2024, a group of Natrona County residents has protested the development of a state-approved gravel mine at the site. They formed an organization and gathered tens of thousands of signatures. Soon local office holders amended zoning rules, effectively halting the project. Then the gravel mining company struck back with a lawsuit against the county. A month later, the gravel pit opponents filed their own suit. 
The dustup would come to a head at the June 5 meeting of the State Board of Land Commissioners, a standing panel consisting of Wyoming’s five statewide elected officials. The mine operator’s state-land leases were up for renewal, and stakeholders awaited the board’s ruling on the fraught dispute. 
And yet, perhaps the meeting’s most contentious moments came in an exchange between Gov. Mark Gordon and Secretary of State Chuck Gray, after the latter criticized the chief executive over his management of the meeting. 
“You need to be patient, sir, and allow the process to work,” Gordon said. 
“Mr. Chairman, I’ve been — I would like to respond to that,” Gray said. “I’ve been very patient with you in requesting the parameters for public comment on this meeting and they have never been provided. So I just, I really would appreciate that these continued false accusations towards me cease, thank you.” 
As the governor and the secretary went back and forth for the next couple minutes, the three other commissioners mostly averted their eyes. Some members of the audience audibly groaned. 
It wasn’t the first time the two electeds had sparred on a state board issue. 
In the weeks prior, Gray took to social media to criticize Gordon for his vote on a wind farm lease on state lands. Gordon fired back in his newsletter. In the days before the June 5 land commissioners meeting, Gray also published a press release calling Gordon’s decision to keep the meeting in Cheyenne “a dereliction.” And when the board arrived at the gravel pit agenda item, Gray reiterated his “disappointment that this meeting was not moved to Casper to allow for public comment.”
(None of the public comments at the meeting that would follow — neither for or against the gravel mine — addressed the location of the meeting.)
“We smile a lot,” Treasurer Curt Meier chuckled after the meeting when asked how he deals with ongoing tensions between his fellow commissioners.

Over the years, Gray and Gordon haven’t seen eye-to-eye on a number of issues. That isn’t unusual for Wyoming’s top officials. Several former office holders and longtime political observers, however, told WyoFile it’s much less common to see those disputes play out so publicly in meetings and online, and in such acrimonious fashion amongst members of the same political party. 
At least one longtime observer of state meetings says the public spat has slowed the board’s process.
“The main thing I see is that issues that normally would be resolved with a discussion and a vote 10 minutes later now end up being issues that go on for maybe 30, 40 minutes, so it makes the meetings longer, ” said Jim Magagna, who lobbies for Wyoming’s agricultural industry. “And then other issues probably don’t get the attention that they deserve, because things got hung up.”
Origins and differences 
The acrimony between Gray and Gordon dates back to the secretary’s time as a state lawmaker, when the governor vetoed some of his legislation, Meier noted. 
As a lawmaker, Gray had led the charge on a 2019 bill granting the Legislature $250,000 and the authority to pursue a legal challenge against Washington state for denying construction permits for coal export terminals. 
The bill passed both chambers by wide margins before Gordon rejected it with one of his first vetoes as governor. 
“I understand and applaud the desire of the Legislature to be ever vigilant in protecting the economic interests of the state and its citizens. I share that same dedication and zeal for assuring that Wyoming is not harmed by the actions of other states,” Gordon wrote in his veto letter. 
“Even so, I can see no compelling reason for potentially confusing the courts, complicating matters at hand, disrupting the coalition of states friendly to our perspective, or introducing reasons to delay an expeditious hearing of the case currently before the court.” 
Gray called the governor’s decision “unfortunate” at the time, according to the Casper-Star Tribune. 
“The veto is detrimental to efforts to protect the coal industry from a radical Leftist political ideology that seeks to put it out of business by any means necessary,” Gray told the newspaper. “It’s going to take a team effort between the executive and legislative branches for there to be success on this issue.”

These days, Gray — like his allies in the Wyoming Freedom Caucus — casts Gordon himself as left-leaning for his “all-of-the-above” energy strategy, which involves low-carbon and renewable power sources. 
Outside the legislative process, Gray and Gordon have also disagreed about the executive branch’s rulemaking process. Last year, Gordon rejected two rulemaking proposals by Gray’s office, both on the basis that the proposals went outside the secretary’s authority. 
In August 2023, the Wyoming State Loan and Investment Board — another committee made up of the same five members — approved a policy to require companies doing business with the state to disclose any investment practices guided by environmental, social, governance principles. As members of the board, both Gordon and Gray voted in favor of the policy. 
Meanwhile, Gray proposed stiffer rules by requiring all investment brokers, broker-dealers and securities agents in Wyoming — not just those working with the state — to disclose ESG principles in writing every three years. 
While Gordon wrote in a letter to Gray that he also “vehemently opposes the national push” for implementing ESG, he also said “our zeal to oppose this radical push does not justify implementing rules that go beyond the legal authority of a state agency.”
Gray pushed back, maintaining his office acted within its legal bounds, and said that “Wyoming needs real leadership on these issues, rather than the defensive tone that Governor Gordon lays out in his letter.”
Months later, when Gordon rejected separate rules proposed by Gray that would have added proof of residency to the voter registration process, the secretary said, “they should have been signed.” 
War of words on wind
On May 19, Gray posted a photograph on X and Facebook of a wind turbine that appears to have a broken blade. Of the five statewide electeds, the secretary is among the most active on social media. 
“A photo of Mark Gordon’s outrageously wrong ‘vision’ for Wyoming,” Gray wrote in the post, in which he also tagged Cowboy State Daily and a Blaze News senior editor. 
Gray had been the sole dissenting vote when the State Board of Land Commissioners approved state leases for the Pronghorn and Sidewinder wind projects in early April. A few days after Gray’s post, Gordon responded in a newsletter — an unusual move for the governor, who tends to avoid public feuding.

“Typically, I have paid little attention to the insults our Secretary of State spews because they are bogus,” Gordon wrote. “But after Mr. Gray’s most recent social media lie suggesting my vision for Wyoming energy only includes wind power, the record needs to be set straight.” 
That Friday evening, Gray responded in a five-minute video posted to his social media. 
“In this video, I respond to Mark Gordon’s lies. He’s upset that I’m exposing the truth about Gordon’s left-wing, green boondoggle wind policies,” Gray wrote on the post in which he also tagged the governor, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, the State Freedom Caucus Network, Cowboy State Daily and two national conservative commentators. 
From their own perspectives 
WyoFile sent Gordon and Gray identical inquiries for this story, which included written questions about whether ongoing tensions are hampering their ability to communicate, work together and accomplish the people’s business. Both responded. 
“The ‘tensions’ are little more than a distraction. The Secretary seems overly eager to manufacture issues to garner attention from the media or get views on Facebook; it reveals his inexperience as a statesman,” Gordon wrote in an email. “It is sad that he wants to resort to half-truths or outright deception. My hope is he will focus on the demands of his current position, even if his ambitions to other offices are getting the best of him.”
“For my part, I am confident the people of Wyoming can see that I am singularly focused on ‘accomplishing the people’s business,’” Gordon wrote. “I will continue to work with him, and others, to protect our property rights, our core industries, our children’s futures, and strengthen our economy. That’s what I was elected to do by an overwhelming majority.” 
Gray says the disagreements between the two men center on policy, as Gordon seeks to “advance the most liberal policies possible, while providing made up excuses as to why common sense conservative policies can’t be achieved,” Gray wrote in an email. 
“Because his allies in the media also want liberal policies, they repeat his misleading claims and excuses,” he wrote. “But what has made us particularly effective is that I’m not afraid to stand up to Gordon’s false statements and expose them as being false talking points and excuses of the Left. Gordon understands that the exposure of how liberal his preferred policies are presents a particular problem for him. So Gordon responds to my statements with personal attacks and theatrics, because he doesn’t want to have a policy debate.”
Both Gordon and Gray’s full responses can be read here. 
Historical comparison
Joan Barron spent nearly half a century covering Wyoming politics before retiring in 2014. She can recall one other instance when two of the state’s top electeds had a similar kind of feud. It occurred during the 2000s, when Republican U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis served as state treasurer alongside Democratic Gov. Dave Freudenthal. 
The two had testy public exchanges fairly frequently, Barron said, particularly at meetings for the State Board of Land Commissioners and the State Loan and Investment Board. The coinciding boards are the only panels on which all five electeds serve together as a voting body. 
“It’s not uncommon for members [of those boards] just to rub each other the wrong way,” Barron said. 
But even then, most of Lummis and Freudenthal’s squabbles took place behind the scenes, Barron said, until a comment the governor allegedly made resurfaced and caught headlines more than two years after the fact. 
“If you cross me, I’ll cut your head off and you won’t know it ‘til it hits the ground,” is what Lummis recalled Freudenthal saying during a 2005 luncheon for the five statewide electeds, according to the Associated Press. 
Freudenthal didn’t deny he made such a remark at the time, but said if he had, it had been in jest. Lummis, meanwhile, said it felt like a threat.

Retired politicians weigh in
For Diana Ohman, a Republican who first served Wyoming in the 1990s as superintendent of public instruction and then as secretary of state, the times have simply changed. There’s less compromise among officials, she told WyoFile, and more of a my-way-or-the-highway mentality. 
“Politicians are choosing more and more just to go straight out in public with how they think, and not come together in a 10-minute meeting to talk about, ‘How can we iron this out?’”
While officials need to be transparent with the public, Ohman said, it doesn’t help negotiations when officials “start using social media instead of picking up the phone and talking to somebody or walking down the hall and seeing if you can make an appointment.” 
Those kinds of face-to-face discussions, Ohman said, weren’t without hiccups, but ultimately kept things on the rails during her eight years in office. 
“A lot of what we did had to do with bringing everybody around the table. And Mike [Sullivan] was especially good at it,” Ohman said. “He had no problem with calling up any of the electeds and saying, ‘You know, let’s get together. It looks like we’re kind of far apart on this.’ And for me, that was the saving grace.”
Mike Sullivan, a Democrat who served as Wyoming’s governor from 1987 to 1995, told WyoFile some of those discussions “weren’t necessarily pretty.”
“In many ways, maybe they weren’t civil, but I think they were much more civil than these days,” he said, adding that they were also more private. 
“I mean, you weren’t having them in public to try to gain an advantage of some kind.”
Former Republican Gov. Jim Geringer, who succeeded Sullivan and worked alongside Ohman, said there were no major disputes among the top five elected officials during his time as governor. 
“At times, we were challenging each other to fully understand maximizing revenue for the schools versus looking out for public interest in other ways. You know, ‘Should we be giving greater economic deference to certain decisions that the land board could make?’ whether it be by loans to agriculture or respecting tribal authority,” Geringer said. “There were differences of how we might approach it, but there was nothing that disintegrated into misrepresentations on social media. That’s the difference today.”

The broader world is always present in Wyoming, columnist David Romtvedt writes.
The post Remembering where we come from appeared first on WyoFile .","It’s June. I look out my office window and watch the baby robins in a tree only six feet away. The young birds squawk and rock at the edge of their nest as they consider taking their first flight. Later, I tend the garden, amazed by the almost visible daily growth of the raspberry and tomato plants. I make dinner and wash the dishes after eating. I walk along the creek, the water rising as the snow melts in the mountains above town. This is the shape of daily life for me in Wyoming. 

Opinion

And yet the broader world is always present. Migration is one of the most obvious ways I feel this. Some 57.4% of Wyomingites were born outside the state, according to the five-year American Community Survey. With a total 2024 US Census population of 587,618, this means that 337,292 of us have moved here from somewhere else. While the leading sources of newcomers are the states of Colorado, California, Utah and Nebraska, the 2024 census also shows that 3.5% of Wyomingites were born outside the country. That’s 20,566 of us who are first-generation Americans. The largest numbers of our immigrant neighbors have come from Mexico, China and Canada, but many other countries have contributed to Wyoming’s population. Indeed, aside from the original Native peoples, we are migrants from the entire planet.
I first came to Wyoming in 1984 and have now lived here for more than half my life. But I was born in Oregon and raised in Arizona. I attended school in those two states along with Texas and Iowa. I’ve worked extensively in Alaska, Washington and Montana, with shorter-term jobs in New York, Arkansas and Illinois. I’ve also lived and worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, India, Argentina, Mexico, Nicaragua and the Basque Country. Then there was my very brief stint as an undocumented worker on a landscape gardening crew in British Columbia.
In coming to Wyoming, I felt I’d come to a new country, a place with people whose experience, different from my own, would enrich my life. I wonder if my sense of displacement, coupled with the pleasure I’ve taken in my new home in Wyoming, arose from my family’s immigration history, a history of constant motion, of longing to be settled.
One of my great-grandmothers on my mother’s side was a Sephardic Jew who fled the Iberian Peninsula for Amsterdam, then a haven for Jews. Rather than stay in Amsterdam, though, she went north to Norway, where she married into a family of Lutheran ministers and farmers who wrote poetry and ran a newspaper on the side. My great-grandfather, who did all four of these things, took especially seriously his role as a small-town journalist, writing on behalf of Norwegian independence from Sweden. In danger of arrest for his opinions, he and his family left for the United States, landing in Minnesota, where many Scandinavians already lived. 
His son, my grandfather, moved on, saying of Minnesota’s winters, “If I’d wanted to stay in Norway, I would have.” He went to Texas but was uncomfortable there, too. “Too hot,” he said and headed farther west, to live on the Oregon coast in a Bellamy Colony, a rural experiment in communal life with shared property and labor.
My father’s mother was born in Victoria, British Columbia shortly after her Belgian Catholic family arrived there. She claims her birth was on the boat as it sat moored in the inner harbor. Over time, more people from both sides of the family immigrated, almost all of them ending up in British Columbia, Washington, or Oregon, so as a kid I felt both and neither Canadian and American.
My parents served in WWII — my mother as a Women’s Army Corps clerk and my father as an Army Air Corps tail gunner in a B-25 medium range bomber. Twice injured, he spent 11 months in a Greenville, South Carolina, hospital undergoing reconstructive facial surgery. When I was a small child, he moved our family to southern Arizona seeking relief from debilitating rheumatoid arthritis. I grew up there in mixed Anglo and Chicano communities and schools. My classmates were largely Mexican Americans whose family roots often dated back to the time before the US invasion of Mexico in 1845 and the appropriation of over one-third of Mexico’s national territory. Once upon a time, Arizona was Mexico. Moving here, I remembered that in those days, a small sliver of southern Wyoming was part of Mexico, too.
That’s the condensed history of my American family, a family shaped by flight and arrival, seeking to find a home. And that’s where I’d like to end — having come to Wyoming and made a life here, a life shaped both by the unique history of this place and by the broader history it shares with the country and the world.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Legislation that would declare that drivers for app-based ride-share and delivery businesses are independent contractors will go to Gov. Tony Evers after clearing both houses of the Legislature Wednesday.
The legislation also authorizes the affected companies to offer drivers benefit plans without classifying them as employees.
After two previous attempts to pass the bill, in the Legislature’s 2021-22 and 2023-24 sessions, the Senate and Assembly votes Wednesday — mostly along party lines — marked the first time the measure will get to the governor’s desk.
The bill — AB 269 — applies to drivers for delivery and transportation businesses such as Uber, Lyft and DoorDash who are hired by customers using online apps or similar technology.
It defines those drivers as independent contractors who are not subject to laws guaranteeing minimum wage, unemployment compensation and workers compensation.
It passed the Assembly on a vote of 56-36, with four Democrats joining the Republicans who all voted for the measure. In the Senate, it passed 16-15, with no Democratic support and one Republican, Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) voting in opposition.
As of Wednesday the Wisconsin Ethics Commission had no public reports on money spent lobbying for or against the legislation. But since early this year DoorDash has been running digital ads on WisPolitics.com and elsewhere promoting the legislation’s “portable benefits” provision.
DoorDash issued a statement Wednesday lauding the bill’s passage. “Dashers and customers in Wisconsin have sent hundreds of letters to the governor, urging him to sign the bill into law,” the company stated.
If Evers signs the measure, Wisconsin would be the first state in the country to enact such legislation. DoorDash has pilot benefit programs without legislation in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Georgia, the company said.
While the bill authorizes the companies to offer the benefit plans, it does not require them to do so. It sets the standards of coverage for such plans if they are offered. It also allows the businesses to establish deferred compensation retirement plans for their drivers.
“This bill will provide meaningful, affordable benefit opportunities for these independent contractors,” said Rep. Alex Dallman (R-Green Lake) at an Assembly press conference before Wednesday’s floor session. “They’ll be able to solidify that they get to choose when and where they want to work, the freedom that they have to be able to earn benefits through the work that they provide for these different companies, and be able to really set themselves up for a future of success by having things such as health insurance.”
A new independent contractor standard
The legislation lists four practices that would exclude a ride-share or delivery company from the independent contractor protections: If it requires drivers to be logged into the service on certain dates, certain times or for a minimum number of hours; if it terminates a driver’s contract for not accepting a specific service request; if it bars drivers from working with other such businesses; and if it bars drivers from working in any other occupation or business.
A company would have to flunk all four of those provisions to be disqualified.
In both the Senate and the Assembly, critics said the bill would serve the contracting companies, not their drivers.
“We don’t need to create a new category of workers with fewer protections, which is what this bill does,” said Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) on the Senate floor. “The sad realization is that all of the so-called benefits talked about in this bill may never come to fruition for any gig driver. And yet the bill makes mandatory the loss of employee status for every single app-based driver.”
Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin), said drivers testified in favor of the legislation that “they don’t want to be employees.” Bradley is the lead author of the Senate companion legislation. 
“If you watch any of the hearings, they’ll tell you, ‘We love the flexibility of being an independent contractor.’ They chose to be independent contractors because of the flexibility.”
Under state law and regulations, the state Department of Workforce Development (DWD) uses a nine-part test to determine if workers are employees rather than independent contractors, said Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) during the Assembly debate.
“The big problem with this bill, though, is that it actually allows the executives of these companies to dictate their own test to fit their own needs,” Sinicki said.
‘Difficult way to pay the bills’
“Driving for ride-sharing services like Lyft or Uber is a grueling, difficult way to pay the bills,” said Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), who said he’s a ride-share driver.
He said the industry’s claims that a driver collects $25 or $30 an hour are based on the travel time alone.
“So in an hour, if I take two people on rides which cost them $7 each and I get about $3.50 from each of those, Lyft might report that I got $30 an hour because they don’t count all the minutes between the rides. But I actually gross $7 that hour,” Clancy said.
The bill allows a company to contribute up to 4% of a driver’s earnings to the proposed benefits account. He said Uber drivers have an average weekly revenue of $513, so 4% “would come out to just $267 a quarter” — too little to cover a health insurance premium.  
The bill aims to keep drivers from being classified as employees because “it’s far easier to exploit an independent contractor than it is an employee,” he said.
Clancy said drivers across the U.S. have been “trying to get recognized as the employees they are, and to try to get access to basic benefits and workplace protections and access to unemployment insurance, just like the vast majority of employees in Wisconsin.”
Rep. Sylvia Ortiz-Velez (D-Milwaukee), a co-sponsor of the bill, was one of four Assembly Democrats to vote for it.
“I heard countless testimonies from drivers who wanted the flexibility of being independent contractors,” Ortiz-Velez said, adding that she has received “a ton of emails, a ton of support” for the bill this year as well as in the last two-year session.
“This bill offers portable benefits that right now don’t exist,” Ortiz-Velez said. “It won’t exist if we don’t pass this bill.”
Dallman, the bill’s lead Assembly author, said on the Assembly floor that critics of the bill can simply choose not to work for the companies it covers.
“This is for the independent contractor and the freedom that they have to get ahead in life by working a couple extra jobs, a couple extra trips on a weekend to make a little bit of extra cash,” Dallman said. “While at the same time, voluntarily partnering with one of these companies . . .  to pay for their benefits, to pay for their retirement. Again, the opportunity for workers to make choices on their own to get ahead in life.”

(Photo via U.S. National Archives)Edda Fields-Black was working on a book about rice plantations when she came across the story of a raid in Beaufort that freed more than 700 slaves from Lowcountry plantations.
The Carnegie Mellon University professor decided to pursue the story and, nearly a decade later, published “COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid, and Black Freedom During the Civil War,” which recently won the Pulitzer Prize for history.
Fields-Black first learned about the June 1863 raid reading an account by Minus Hamilton, who was an 88-year-old slave when the daring mission led by Tubman freed him. He told of how three steamships traveled up the river in the dead of night before sounding their whistles, sending slaves working on the neighboring plantations running to the river and to freedom.
Hamilton also talked about his awe at seeing fellow Black men in uniform for the first time, and that image struck Fields-Black.
“I was like, ‘Wow,’ and I tucked it away for a long time,” said Fields-Black, of Pittsburgh.
Fields-Black tried to read more about the raid Hamilton recounted. But she found little beyond mentions here and there in biographies of Tubman, who’s best known as a conductor on the Underground Railroad. So, she set out to write the history herself, telling it from the perspective of the raid’s participants and detailing the importance of the rice plantations in pulling it off, she said.
“I wanted to pull out all of those elements, and I thought that I could tell that story,” Fields-Black said.
“COMBEE,” the Gullah pronunciation of the Combahee River, won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize alongside “Native Nations: A Millennium in North American” by Kathleen DuVal in a category that rewards “a distinguished and appropriately documented book on the history of the United States,” according to the Pulitzer website.
The 776-page book told “a richly-textured and revelatory account” of the raid, “weaving military strategy and family history with the transition from bondage to freedom,” the prize’s jury wrote.
 Harriet Tubman

Tubman, who became known as the Moses of Her People after escaping slavery herself in 1849, spoke about the Combahee River Raid during her life.
Her role in the raid made her the first woman ever to lead a major military operation in the U.S. and the only Black woman to lead troops during the Civil War. A statue of her unveiled in May 2024 at Beaufort’s Tabernacle Baptist Church commemorates her part in the raid and her years spent in Beaufort.
But historians, lacking official records, rarely delved into the details, Fields-Black said.
When she started telling friends and colleagues about her plans, they similarly insisted there was no way to tell the story from the perspective of enslaved people because no records of the raid existed. But they did exist — just not the kind most researchers rely on, she said.

“There’s a broader question about believing women, believing marginal people and taking our words and our descriptions of our own experiences at face value,” Fields-Black said. “And that hadn’t been done.”
The rice plantations, with their snakes and alligators, made Tubman’s work even more impressive. Other historians had written about the raid as if the environment were the same as in the more northern states where Tubman had worked, but as a researcher of rice fields, Fields-Black knew the specific challenges they presented.
“She could’ve been on the moon, and she would’ve figured out how to survive,” she said.
 Finding the story

As she started to research in earnest, Fields-Black knew she couldn’t rely solely on the official military records of the raid, which were written by the Confederate troops controlling Beaufort at the time. Slave narratives from the 1930s mentioned the raid only in passing, and official records in Beaufort and Colleton counties were burned as cities went up in flames during the Civil War, she said.
Fields-Black turned instead to a lesser-used historical resource: pension files. Following the war, soldiers relayed information about themselves and their experiences in an attempt to receive payment from the government.
Among those submitting applications were members of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, a regiment consisting largely of freed men from the sea islands that drove boats up the Combahee River for enslaved people to board and escape.
Through scouring hundreds of pension files, Fields-Black came across a familiar name.
She had known about a Hector Fields from whom her family descended, but she had thought he lived in nearby Colleton County, not Beaufort. The pension files, however, told the story of Fields as a Civil War veteran who fought in the volunteer infantry, helped free slaves and eventually settled down in Colleton County, she said.
Fields-Black grew up in Florida, but she still has family in that area. Her own father was born in Green Pond, a small town in the same county, and the family’s roots in South Carolina are strong, she said.
The story “has become a source of immense pride in our family,” Fields-Black said.
Even after they were freed, many of the people in the raid returned to Confederate territory, risking their lives and freedom, to help others, she said. The raid itself happened after the Emancipation Proclamation, which had proclaimed all slaves in Southern states to be free.
But in Confederate-controlled areas, that wasn’t put into effect. The nation’s last slaves weren’t freed until two years later, on June 19, 1865, known as Juneteenth.
“It’s the actions of these folks that some would say, and I would agree with them, are even more important than, say, the Emancipation Proclamation in the demise of slavery and ending the institution of slavery,” Fields-Black said.

That’s how people should commemorate Juneteenth, according to North Dakota organizers and advocates for the federal holiday.
Juneteenth events across the state kicked off last week in Jamestown, but more community celebrations are scheduled in Fargo, Grand Forks, Minot, Moorhead and Bismarck in coming days, giving North Dakotans a chance to commune with neighbors, families and friends.
One of the featured speakers at the upcoming Juneteenth events, Frederick Edwards Jr. of Fargo, said he’s noticed an expanded interest in the still relatively new national holiday. He said sharing the commemoration with a wide swath of people is a way for members of the Black community to share their collective history with those who may not have been exposed to it.
“Because it is no longer seen as a secretive, mystery event, I think it does get a pedigree of importance,” Edwards said. “People are OK even talking about Juneteenth, whereas three or four years ago a person wouldn’t have even asked me what I’m doing for Juneteenth.”

Edwards founded a nonprofit focused on creating connections through cultural exchanges called Fred’s Dissonance. He said the holiday commemorates African Americans overcoming chattel slavery, and the sharing of that history with people from every generation can bring communities closer together.
He said celebrations of Juneteenth happened every year in the Twin Cities and other communities where Edwards lived even if it had only become a national holiday in 2021. He said the holiday is similar to an African-American independence day.
“People celebrate collectively at my events, and I know all across America they are having Juneteenth events that people can tap into,” Edwards said. 
Former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed a bill in 2021 that recognizes June 19 as Juneteenth to commemorate the ending of slavery. Still, it is not an official North Dakota state holiday. Several county courthouses are closed.
Gov. Kelly Amstrong issued a Juneteenth proclamation that stated the national holiday recognizes “the triumph of the human spirit over slavery” and commemorates the “strength and resolve of Black Americans throughout our national history.”
The holiday is growing. Edwards said he used to have to solicit donations from communities in order to have the funds to put on some of his events, but he doesn’t have to do that anymore because of expanded knowledge and engagement around Juneteenth.
People have access to free digital toolkits through the National Museum of African American History and Culture for organizers to use to set up their own Juneteenth events, or for anyone to learn more about the holiday on their own, he added.

If organizations or groups need help planning a future Juneteenth event, Edwards said he’d also be willing to give them advice on how to organize the celebration, no matter the size of the city or town.
“My philosophy is community power sharing. My liberation is your healing,” he said.
Lyn Dockter-Pinnick, chair of the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition Board, said Juneteenth is more important than ever as some people attempt to “whitewash” American history and demonize previously celebrated ideals like diversity, equity and inclusion.
“For the community that is honoring Juneteenth to allow the rest of us in, first of all, I think is amazing,” Dockter-Pinnick said. “And secondly, including all of us is a way to recognize the diversity of this country and just never forget where we’ve been.”

Edwards attended the second annual Juneteenth event in Jamestown earlier this month and said he was inspired to see about 250 people attend — even in the rain.
Heather McDougall, chair of the planning committee for Jamestown’s Juneteenth event, said people in the community seemed more receptive to the event this year.
“The first year was such a good success and really showed people that it is a celebration,” McDougall said. “It’s about celebrating everyone in our community and our country’s evolution, and honoring all of that.”
She said the planning committee tripled in size, from four to 12, for this year’s event.
“I think we more than doubled our fundraising, which was essential to pull off this year’s event,” McDougall said.
To commemorate the holiday, McDougall suggested connecting with people who are celebrating and asking questions.
“Just be open, and curious, and ready to learn,” she said. “It’s the value of community. No matter who you are, what you look like, just knowing that there are people who are willing to show up for each other in that kind of a setting, that just builds bonds that can go so much further than the event itself.”

Jerome Zamgba, a member of Jamestown’s Juneteenth planning committee, is an immigrant from Liberia who came to the United States in 2006. After living in Pennsylvania, he moved to Jamestown in 2019 and opened JayCon Grocery.
He said he met Edwards at the 2023 Juneteenth event in Fargo, which prompted him to help bring a similar celebration to Jamestown the following year.
“If we talk about celebrating this holiday, we talk about celebrating Americans,” Zamgba said. “What we want to do is to bring people together, not just Africans, or African Americans, but everybody to come together to celebrate this.”
He said the Emancipation Proclamation was about more than just ending slavery.
“It was a good thing for America to have a better image of our country, of our people, and the things that happened, to do away with them and just come together,” he said.
Zamgba said the Jamestown Juneteenth planning group hopes to introduce a new event next year in Valley City.
“Everything starts from somewhere,” he said.




Upcoming Juneteenth events will be held on:

June 19 in Moorhead, Minn., on the Bell Tower lawn near the Knutson Campus Center at Concordia College from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.
June 19 in Grand Forks at University Park from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.
June 21 in Fargo at Black Coffee and Waffle Bar from noon to 3 p.m. and Broadway Square from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
June 21 in Minot at Oak Park from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
June 28 in Bismarck at Kiwanis Park from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m.

Advocates say it's overdue, as costs skyrocket.","Legislation now in Trenton would expand oversight of hospitals and health care costs. Advocates say it's overdue, as costs skyrocket. (Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)Every day across our state, New Jersey families are struggling to keep up with the crushing cost of health care. Insurance premiums are skyrocketing. Copays are rising. Everyone is straining under the weight of rising health care costs, with some facing double-digit increases year after year. And taxpayers are footing the bill when public plans spiral out of control.
The question before us is will we continue to allow this tidal wave of hardship to crash down on working families, or will we take action to safeguard the health and financial security of our residents? Eighty-five percent of New Jersey adults worry about affording health care in the future, while 49% have delayed or gone without care due to cost. This is not sustainable, but it is solvable.
Earlier this year, Assemblywoman Verlina Reynolds-Jackson (D-Mercer) and Sen. Joe Vitale (D-Middlesex) introduced A-5376/S-4299 that would codify and strengthen the Office of Health Care Accountability and Transparency to oversee cost and spending trends across the entire health care industry. Just as importantly, it would create an independent, nonpartisan commission to serve as an essential watchdog in the fight against out-of-control health care pricing, including by establishing cost growth benchmarks for health care entities and hospital prices.
In practice, that means we would no longer allow hospital systems or insurance giants to raise prices unchecked, year after year, without accountability. 
The commission would hold annual hearings, requiring hospitals and insurers to justify cost increases that exceed the benchmark. If those increases aren’t warranted, the state could mandate performance improvement plans or take corrective action. This kind of oversight already exists in other states like Massachusetts, Oregon and California, and it works. Cost growth has begun to stabilize, transparency has improved and policymakers have gained real tools to make the system more accountable.
Here in New Jersey, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Just last month, the State Treasury Department issued a blunt warning: the State Health Benefits Program for Local Government is in crisis. Cities and towns are pulling out in droves, unable to sustain the 20-25% rate hikes that have hit their budgets in recent years. And those municipalities that do leave the State Health Benefits Program still face 9-10% rate hikes each year. Family premiums in New Jersey have been increasing almost twice as fast as income.
These aren’t abstract numbers, this is money being pulled away from classrooms, road repairs, public safety, and essential services. This means property taxes are going up because we refuse to rein in outrageously high prices.
For too long, powerful interests in the hospital and insurance industries have operated without meaningful accountability, dictated prices without explanation, and failed to acknowledge the exponential rate increases that we know are happening year after year. While families agonize over whether they can afford to go to the doctor, major hospital conglomerates have failed to meet federal transparency standards and offer no solutions for the crushing rise in hospital costs.
We are entering a moment of serious fiscal uncertainty. The federal government has signaled deep cuts to Medicaid and other safety-net programs could be targeted next. Our state budget is under immense pressure. In this environment, we must pursue cost-saving reforms – not by slashing services, but by making the system more efficient, more transparent, and more equitable.
We cannot continue slapping Band-Aids on a system that is hemorrhaging public trust and private dollars. Our families can’t wait. Our cities can’t wait. The time is now.

(Photo: Angela Dennis)As cities across Tennessee prepare for Juneteenth celebrations with banners unfurling, vendors setting up, and leaders finalizing programs honoring Black liberation, a deeper question lingers: What does it mean to celebrate freedom in a state restricting how that freedom’s history is taught?
In Tennessee, state lawmakers have gutted DEI programs, banned books by Black authors, and restricted how teachers can talk about race and history in the classroom. 
This year’s celebrations have also come with cutbacks. Across the country, Juneteenth events have been scaled back due to shrinking DEI funding, canceled federal grants and  retreat from corporate support for racial justice initiatives. 
For many Black educators, organizers, and students, the policies feel like a modern day echo of the delayed freedom Juneteenth was created to mark. It represents a continued struggle for true freedom and liberation.
Republican supermajority passes bills to “dismantle” DEI in state, local government

“The attacks on our history, on information, professors, universities and on teachers, are horrifying,” said Tennessee State Rep. Justin Pearson. “One of the first tools of oppression is to deny the education of people. In this moment in Tennessee and across the country, we are seeing policies and practices that are very harmful to our society’s memory about how we have gotten to where we are.”
On June 19, 1865, enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been free for more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. That delay in freedom highlights, for many, the same struggle seen today as laws and policies seek to suppress the teaching of Black history and limit the freedom of education. 
What began as a regional celebration has grown into a national symbol of Black freedom, with Juneteenth becoming a federal holiday in 2021, signed into law by President Joe Biden. Gov. Bill Lee signed a law recognizing Juneteenth as a state holiday in 2023.
“Recognizing Juneteenth as a state holiday, while passing laws that harm Black communities, reveals deep hypocrisy,” said Pearson. “We’re still trapped by systems, academically, environmentally, politically, and civically, despite being technically free.”
For other community leaders, the recognition of Juneteenth as a federal holiday is significant but raises important questions about the intent and timing of such a move.
Chris Woodhull, a longtime civic leader in East Tennessee, reflected on how he and others were teaching the significance of Juneteenth decades ago, long before it gained national visibility.
“Back in the ’90s, I was teaching about Juneteenth with young people through our organization called Tribe One,” Woodhull said. “We were talking about emancipation and the legacy of slavery before it was popular.”
  “Recognizing Juneteenth as a state holiday, while passing laws that harm Black communities, reveals deep hypocrisy,” said Rep. Justin Pearson, a Memphis Democrat. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
When Juneteenth was made a federal holiday in 2021, Woodhull couldn’t help but notice the timing after the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer — and subsequent uprisings —and growing momentum behind the movement to defund the police.
“Juneteenth became a federal holiday not in a vacuum but in the wake of George Floyd’s death, when people were in the streets demanding justice, systemic change, and real transformation,” he said.
While he appreciates the symbolism of the recognition, Woodhull said it felt, in part, like a concession, a gesture meant to appease, rather than challenge systems of power. Still, Woodhull believes Juneteenth holds real significance, especially when it’s rooted in truth and history.
“There are a lot of well-meaning people who want to celebrate Juneteenth but don’t really understand what it means,” he said. “We can’t afford for it to become just another day off. The challenge is to make sure we’re not just marking the day but honoring the story, and the struggle behind it.”
In recent years, Tennessee lawmakers have passed sweeping legislation targeting the teaching of race, diversity and Black history. In 2021, the state passed a law banning divisive concepts in public education, followed by restrictions in 2022 on mandatory DEI training in higher education. These measures were followed by further legislation in 2025 aimed at dismantling DEI programs across the state.
Book bans and curriculum restrictions have also spread across Tennessee. In January 2022, McMinn County removed the Pulitzer-winning graphic novel Maus from its eighth-grade curriculum. 
That same year, Hamilton County established a review board to evaluate books for “offensiveness,” leading to the removal of titles with Black and LGBTQ+ voices. In Knoxville, 113 books, including Push by Black author Sapphire, were pulled from schools. Wilson County removed nearly 400 books, including works by Toni Morrison, while Nashville’s public libraries responded by promoting banned books during Banned Books Week. In Chattanooga, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas was also removed.
Despite political efforts to restrict classroom content, educators across Tennessee are finding ways to teach Juneteenth and center Black freedom.
“Juneteenth has always been a topic I discussed in my classes,” said Dr. Learotha Williams, associate professor of African American and Public History at Tennessee State University and director of the North Nashville Heritage Project. “It’s one of those celebrations that has persisted.”
Williams believes Black history must extend beyond traditional classrooms. His courses split time between lectures and community exploration, including visits to historic sites. At Hadley Park Community Center in Nashville, he also led a community course on Black Nashville, taking community members to former enslaved markets and lynching sites. He draws that inspiration from Carter G. Woodson — the author and historian known as the “Father of Black History” — who urged scholars to consider whether their work uplifts or alienates the communities they study.

“That was one of the most rewarding teaching experiences I’ve ever had,” he said. “It involved students and many elders in the community engaging directly with their city’s history.”
In Knoxville, Dr. Melody Hawkins, a nationally recognized and award-winning educator, sees Juneteenth as an opportunity for reflection and liberation in classrooms, despite growing restrictions on educators like herself
“Whenever people hear about all the banned books, there’s this assumption that it means we can’t still do the work,” she said. “But you can still be affirming. We just call it being good teachers.”
She believes the focus should be less about restricted terminology and more about how educators show up for their students.
“Juneteenth teaches us about our history and also helps us build classrooms where Black students feel safe, valued, and free to thrive,” she said.
Her upcoming book, Black Girl in the Middle, explores how race and gender bias shape education for Black girls, particularly in middle school. While educators didn’t create the systems that marginalize students, Hawkins says, “we’re still responsible for how we respond to them.”
In East Tennessee, Black in Appalachia, an educational organization, preserves and amplifies Black history and community stories in the region, especially in rural areas where much of the history is whitewashed. Director William Isom sees the current climate as part of a larger historical pattern of erasure.
“From my perspective, none of this is new. This repression is just a continuation of our history,” he said. 
Isom points to Reconstruction as a parallel.










Juneteenth strengthens the whole idea of the American narrative and any effort to erase the difference in perspectives around this significant day.


– Adam Dickson, Langston Centre


 “If local archives and historical societies looked closely at how their communities were shaped by Reconstruction, and its dismantling, they’d see the throughline.”
His advice is to focus on community record-keeping.
“Everyday people creating their own records, sharing their family stories, can be more powerful than anything an organization can do.”
Adam Dickson, Cultural Director of the Langston Centre in Johnson City, runs a monthly public series called Community History 365. He believes the burden of preserving and teaching Black history now rests heavily on local communities.
“Juneteenth strengthens the whole idea of the American narrative and any effort to erase the difference in perspectives around this significant day,”  Dickson said.“For so long, the Black perspective around Juneteenth had been ignored. That’s why it’s such a pivotal moment and never really considered as it should have been so it was a pivotal moment.”
For Pearson, embracing Juneteenth is also about Black joy. He said it’s as essential as any political or educational fight. 
“There’s a song that says, ‘This joy that I have, the world did not give it to me, and the world can’t take it away,’” he said. “We are still here, despite everything that has been done to diminish our humanity. That’s good news. And we have a responsibility to carry the spirit of those who came before us, both in our struggles and in our celebrations. Because they persevered, we can persevere. Because they sacrificed, we can serve. Because they gave, we can do more.”

This story was originally reported by Errin Haines of The 19th.
Thursday marks the first national observance under President Donald Trump of Juneteenth, the day commemorating the end of slavery in the United States that became a federal holiday in 2021.
This year, it comes as Trump’s presidency has been marked by attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion and attempts to erase and minimize Black history as part of the American story. What does it mean to claim resistance and resilience in an age of exclusion?
For perspective on how to consider Juneteenth this year, I spoke to Dr. Kaye Wise Whitehead, president of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, the organization that founded Black History Month. Whitehead shared her insights on the politics of history, memory and race and why traditions matter even more in the current political climate.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Errin Haines: How do you understand the meaning of Juneteenth — not just as a holiday, but as a marker of America’s unfinished work?
Kaye Wise Whitehead: The country has significantly changed between January 19, 2025, and today. Every single thing that we have fought for — that, I would argue, we began to take a little bit for granted — has either been canceled, erased or is under fire. Juneteenth is no different.
We don’t wait to be celebrated; we celebrate ourselves. We celebrate our history, and we celebrate our contributions to this country. Our lives and our histories are etched into the stones of the buildings. So we don’t have to have a proclamation from anyone else but ourselves.
What does it mean to celebrate emancipation in a political era marked by rollbacks of civil rights and diversity policies?
This is why it’s even more important that we take a moment to stop and understand the significance of Juneteeth. Juneteenth, as a holiday, has been celebrated within the Black communities of Texas and Louisiana since right after American slavery ended. They did not wait for it to be a holiday.
That is really the message of the American historical narrative. It is the people that lead the government. It’s not government leading the people. It is “We the People.” And Juneteenth is a great example of that.
If we don’t center the teaching and the understanding of Black history, if we don’t amplify it, if we don’t force it onto America’s agenda, then it can be erased. People don’t understand that if you erase the contributions of Black people to America, you are essentially erasing the American historical narrative, because Black history is American history. It is tied to the fabric that makes up the blanket of this country.
Juneteenth is a celebration. It is a time of firing up the grill, it is a time to line dance, of getting out the fans, and celebrating the beauty and the wonder and the joy that is essentially in the heart of Black culture. Our culture is not rooted in just tears and tragedy and trauma and slavery and oppression and lynching. Our culture is rooted in joy and laughter and tenacity and the ability to overcome and find places of happiness despite what the situation is around us.

What parallels do you see between the delayed freedom of Juneteenth and the current efforts to delay or deny racial progress — whether in education, policy or civic life?
We are not powerless in the face of those who seek to erase us. In fact, this is the best time for us to reclaim our power — our history is a part of this story. We can turn all of our spaces into freedom schools: a church basement, if you’re standing in the middle of a coffee shop, if you’re sitting with young children. You put it on your bags, you put it on your T-shirt, you put it on your social media. They can’t stop us from telling our story. Even though they are banning books, they don’t stop me from buying books and giving them to people. We have to take back our power in this moment, because otherwise, that is how authoritarianism wins. It makes you believe you’re powerless.
You’ve spoken and written powerfully about memory as resistance. How does celebrating Juneteenth become a form of resistance in a time of historical erasure?
I argue that you only have four choices right now. You fight, which to me means practicing small, daily acts of resistance. You have flight: If you have an exit plan, you activate it — and most folks do not. You freeze, and you pretend that everything is normal and that you pretend you can’t do anything. Or you fawn: You bend your knee and you kiss the ring and say, “I support this administration.”
I’m telling people, choose to fight and practice small, daily acts of resistance. Unfortunately, in this environment, celebrating Juneteenth is an act of resistance.
I believe that this moment is about both reclaiming the historical memory, but it’s also about a moment of looking forward, because if we stand right now and say that we’re not going to be erased, we are holding fast to our memory, we’re holding fast to our history, we’re holding fast to our contributions, then we’re laying the groundwork, setting up the framework for what’s going to come next.
What role have Black women played — historically and now — in defending and advancing the truth of our history against efforts to distort or erase it?
Black women have always been, as Zora Neale Hurston has said, “the mules of the world.” I talk about this as Black women being the ones that are willing to push and carry this country forward, because that is what we have done, whether it was during the time of American slavery trying to hold our family together, whether it was using quilts to stitch a road to freedom, whether it was braiding in routes to freedom in the hair of our children. Or as 19th-century women lifting as they climb, setting up club groups, raising money for the family, or coming today with the political activism that Black women have continued to be involved in and have continued to stand firm on trying to save this country, politically, culturally, socially and economically, for hundreds of years.
We’re at a moment now where a number of Black women are saying, “This is a moment that we sit out. We are tired. We’re exhausted. We’ve been teaching and reteaching the same lessons.” I’m making the argument that as much as I want to sit down, I cannot, as much as I want to stop I cannot. I can take rest breaks, but I do have to keep pushing the work, I do have to keep getting involved politically. I do have to keep talking about the reclamation of memory and history. I do have to keep standing up and resisting, even in very small ways. We are planting seeds for trees that will never give us shade. I am very clear that the work I’m doing right now is not work that I’m going to actually benefit from.
So then, what does rest, joy and celebration look like for Black women in this political climate? How do Black women hold space for both resistance and restoration?
That’s where Juneteenth comes in! Juneteenth is a great example of resistance and restoration. I’m telling Black women like I tell myself: No one’s asking you to fight 24/7, we’re not looking for that. Even Harriet Tubman rested. So where are the moments when you can actively get involved without draining your social battery? Maybe it’s an economic choice that you made. I can choose to vote with my feet, to vote with my dollars, write an op-ed. I can’t go out and march, but I can call into the radio station, I can give $5 to the institutions and the organizations that are holding up the work. That’s what restoration and resistance look like. You choose the moments when you can engage and then you practice radical self-care when you can’t — and be honest with yourself about what those moments look like.
For people who feel disheartened by the moment we’re in, what do you say about the power of showing up?
I’m gonna say this, and I know that it goes to the opposite of what a number of folks are saying right now, but our ancestors didn’t stop.
We can’t be the generation that stops. I know I’m tired, but I can’t be the one where the baton stops. As much as we want to stop in this moment, we have so much to lose. We cannot offer our children and their children a world that’s so destructive and just falling apart because we got tired and we stopped.
If Juneteenth is a mirror, what should we be reflecting on this year?
I would not say Juneteenth is a mirror; I would say Juneteenth is a prism into what we used to be, into who we are now, and into who we can be.
I think Juneteenth this year should be a space of radical imagination. It is clear that whatever this form of “democracy” has been, it does not exist anymore. I don’t want to go back to that. That was not a space of freedom, equality and diversity. That was not a space where we could rest.
So since that system is collapsing all around us, let’s use Juneteenth as a moment of radical imagination. What should come next? What exactly are we working for? Because at times I ask myself, “What am I fighting to save?” We need to have a plan for how we go forward, not their plan, but our plan.
That’s how we should celebrate and uplift Juneteenth: Throw up the grill, party, get the fans going — and then while people are sitting around the table and they’re passing the beans and the corn, say, “What should come next?” Let’s get some plans on paper. Let’s start getting people into the room to have these conversations. Standing still is not what we want to do at this moment.

But just across the border from Hortman’s home state, Wisconsin Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden seized on the double murder of Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were shot dead in their home, and the near-fatal shootings of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, to mock Democrats and try to score political points. Van Orden falsely characterized the suspected shooter, a right-wing religious fanatic on a mission to murder Democrats and abortion providers, as an anti-Trump protester who “decided to murder and attempt to murder some politicians that were not far Left enough for them.”
This wildly misleading analysis came straight out of the MAGA alternative reality machine on social media, where, Minnesota Reformer editor J. Patrick Coolican wrote, right-wing influencers began peddling misinformation about Hortman’s murder just hours after it happened. 
Van Orden was not alone in helping to spread those lies. Wisconsin’s former Republican Gov. Scott Walker also did his part. In a now-deleted post on X, Walker wrote that if the assassination “ends up being done by an ultra-liberal activist … watch for many on the left to be silent or even justify it. Wrong!” 

It is now clear that suspected murderer Boelter was a Republican who, as an evangelical Christian minister, gave sermons railing against abortion and LGBTQ people. Walker at least had the good sense to take down his post — lapsing into the silence he’d predicted “many on the left” would observe. 
Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah was shamed by his colleagues into taking down a similarly callous post in which he blamed “Marxists” for the murders and appeared to gloat that it was a “nightmare” for Walz. 
Van Orden, on the other hand, doubled down.
“I stand by my statement,” he wrote on X after U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan chastized him for replying to Walz’s remembrance of Hortman by saying that the Democratic governor is “stupid” and a “clown.” Van Orden responded to Pocan with an obscenity. That’s the post he stood by.
Van Orden, who attended the Jan. 6 rally in Washington after President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election alongside the Capitol insurrectionists, is hardly a model of statesmanship. His boorish behavior in Washington on more than one occasion has embarrassed our state.
But there’s something more troubling going on here than one politician’s loutish behavior. 
The horrifying political assassination in Minnesota is a direct result of the same MAGA disinformation machine that went into overdrive trying to distort the truth about the assassin’s aims. Van Orden is one of many Republicans who have hyped the idea that the U.S. is under attack from “criminal, illegal aliens” who were allowed by the Biden administration to “wander around the nation at their leisure.” (In fact, immigrants commit violent crimes at lower rates than U.S.-born citizens, and Van Orden’s district is full of hardworking immigrants who lack legal status but without whom Wisconsin’s dairy industry would collapse.)
Republicans following Trump’s lead have stirred up a moral panic around immigration, abortion, LGBTQ people and other non-threats in increasingly hysterical terms. Their rhetoric laid the groundwork for actual physical violence. It has been used to justify the unprecedented spectacle of masked federal agents seizing people on U.S. streets and deporting them without due process, as well as the Trump administration’s outrageous manhandling and handcuffing of Judge Hannah Dugan in Milwaukee, Sen. Alex Padilla in California and a mayoral candidate and Comptroller Brad Lander in New York City.  
Trump’s invitation to physical violence against his opponents and the press are a hit with his base. It seems inevitable that eventually someone would take him up on it. 
Adding fuel to the fire, Trump’s MAGA minions have made his sociopathic callousness part of their brand. Trump refused to call Walz after the murders in Minnesota, and instead took a gratuitous swipe at the man who campaigned against him as Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate in 2024, calling him “whacked out” and “a mess.”
 “I could be nice and call, but why waste time?” Trump told reporters. 
In a terse statement, Walz spokesperson Teddy Tschann explained why: “Governor Walz wishes that President Trump would be a President for all Americans, but this tragedy isn’t about Trump or Walz. It’s about the Hortman family, the Hoffman family, and the State of Minnesota, and the governor remains focused on helping all three to heal.”
What happened in Minnesota is a tragedy for all of us. It’s made worse by the lack of leadership from politicians who not only don’t have the wisdom and maturity to respond appropriately, but who, by failing to take responsibility for their actions, are actively propelling us toward a more terrible future.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)On unanimous voice votes, lawmakers approved legislation Wednesday that allows nurses with advanced training to practice independently in Wisconsin.
The bill now heads to Gov. Tony Evers, who vetoed similar bills twice before but who is now expected to sign the measure after negotiating changes to address his previous objections.
“I can’t stress what a team effort this was. It was bipartisan,” said Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc), the lead Assembly author on AB 257, before the vote on the Assembly floor. “People put their pettiness aside and they actually got a good product across the finish line.”
The Assembly passed the legislation Wednesday and the Senate concurred later in the day.
“While this legislation had been vetoed in the previous two sessions, I’m proud to say and stand before you that we have an agreement and a deal that when this reaches the governor’s desk, that is going to become law,” said Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point).
The bill creates a new formal nursing credential under state law, Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN).
To win Evers’ signature, authors of the bill agreed to increase the amount of training and supervision before an APRN can practice independently, added additional supervision requirements for APRN practitioners who specialize in pain management and included language to restrict the titles APRN practitioners use so patients aren’t confused about their credentials.
Evers previously vetoed APRN measures in 2022 and 2024, specifying in his veto messages that he didn’t sign them because of those issues.
“I wish it didn’t take us nearly a decade to do this,” said Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) in the Assembly floor session. “But It needed to and I’m glad that we’re getting it done now and I’m glad that we’re getting it done right.”
Under the proposal, the Wisconsin state nursing board would oversee the credentialing of advanced practice nurses. The credential would include certified nurse-midwives, certified registered nurse anesthetists, clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners.
“This is a really important bill,” said Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Milwaukee) before the Senate passed the measure. “It is going to increase access to high-quality patient care for people around the state, but especially people in underserved communities.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Scientists at Southeastern Louisiana University have found dangerously high levels of toxic metals and other contaminants in Lake Maurepas and have traced most of the pollution to industrial and other human activities.
Led by SLU chemistry professor Fereshteh Emami, a team of researchers analyzed 400 water and sediment samples collected from multiple locations and depths in the lake from June through December 2023 and developed new methodologies to trace the origin of the pollutants, track how they spread and determine the factors that make them worse. The results were “alarming,” according to the study, which was published in Environments in November and accepted for publication in another scientific journal, ACS Omega, this month.  
The analysis revealed concentrations of heavy metals and nutrients far beyond the thresholds the Environmental Protection Agency considers safe. Arsenic levels peaked at 420% above the safe limit for lakes and 6,300% over the EPA’s drinking water threshold. Lead and cadmium were detected at similarly high levels averaging orders of magnitude above safe limits. Nickel, copper, and manganese concentrations were also observed above their respective safety thresholds.
Heavy metal exposure is known to cause severe health problems and can be fatal to humans. 
“I was just surprised how polluted the area is,” Emami said in an interview. 
Emami’s team at Southeastern developed new methodologies that allowed them to trace the pollutants to Pass Manchac and three rivers that feed into Lake Maurepas: the Blind, Amite and Tickfaw. It indicated that industrial and agricultural activities are major sources of the pollution.
The researchers also detected a spike in contaminants near Pass Manchac following the Oct. 23, 2023, “super-fog” multi-vehicle pileup on Interstate 55, indicating that toxic chemicals from combustion vehicles are also running off into the lake. 
The heavy metal concentrations found in Lake Maurepas are similar to those later detected following breaks in the waste containment levees at the Atlantic Alumina (Atalco) facility in Gramercy last year. Atalco’s toxic metals — which also included arsenic, cadmium and lead, among others — ended up in a public drainage system that flows into the Blind River Swamp of Lake Maurepas. 
Although Emami’s new methodologies did not trace the pollutants to specific facilities, news of the Atalco incident brought to light a previously unknown event that aligns with their findings, at least anecdotally, Emami said. More sampling and analysis is needed deeper upstream into those rivers in order to further narrow down the sources, she said. 
The researchers found other contaminants in the lake, including high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and a parameter called chemical oxygen demand, which indicates the presence of organic pollutants in water. According to the study, all three parameters were elevated at averages beyond what is considered safe. Their methodologies traced these pollutants to urban runoff and agriculture.  
The samples contained other toxic metals, such as mercury, at levels that were within safe limits. But the study noted they still pose a threat to humans and the environment through bioaccumulation, in which low doses of a heavy metal can amass in a living organism over time and add up to a dangerous level. 
“Because of the non-biodegradable and bioaccumulative nature of these heavy metals, they could accumulate and biomagnify in fish and other aquatic animals,” the researchers wrote. “As a result, they could enter the human body eventually through the food chain.”
Emami said mercury is particularly dangerous because it easily bioaccumulates in crops and animals such as fish. Her team is conducting a follow-up study in which they are testing aquatic samples from Lake Maurepas and surrounding rivers for heavy metals and other contaminants such as polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as “forever chemicals.”
Corinne Gibb, a chemist who works for the environmental advocacy Louisiana Bucket Brigade and was not involved in the study, said the research very clearly points to pollution that is flowing into Lake Maurepas from other water bodies.
“What they’re showing for sure is that the pollution is coming through those rivers,” Gibb said.

Southeastern has been monitoring Lake Maurepas since the proposal of a carbon sequestration project by Air Products & Chemicals. The company plans to use carbon capture technology to trap emissions from an $8 billion hydrogen manufacturing complex in Ascension Parish and take them by pipeline to Lake Maurepas, where Air Products will have the capacity to inject an estimated 5 million tons of CO2 per year about a mile below the lakebed. 
In the first half of 2023, Air Products performed seismic testing to map the geological formations under the lake. In August of that year, the company moved a large temporary drilling rig into Lake Maurepas that served as a test well for the collection of core and fluid data, which ended in early 2024.
Emami’s team initially suspected but were ultimately unable to link any chemical pollutants to Air Products’ activity in the lake. Aside from providing a multi-million dollar funding grant, the company played no role in any aspects of the study, its design or the decision to publish the results. 
“We’re committed to protecting the Lake Maurepas environment and ecosystem, which is why we have supported the independent monitoring of the Lake,” Air Products spokeswoman Christina Stephens said Wednesday after learning about the SLU study’s findings. “It’s important for people to understand the lake’s ecosystem, and as our work progresses we will continue to operate in a safe and responsible fashion.”
That still doesn’t assuage concerns of some local lawmakers. Rep. Kim Coates, R-Ponchatoula, who ran for office on a platform of protecting Lake Maurepas, pointed out the study shows the baseline water quality of the lake is already deeply concerning and could be made worse with general disturbances that accompany lakebed drilling and similar industrial activities.  
“Adding deep geological carbon sequestration to an ecosystem already under strain from nutrient pollution raises serious questions,” Coates said. “Even well-intentioned projects can have unintended consequences in such a delicate and dynamic environment. Until more is known, extreme caution is not just warranted — it’s essential.”
SLU’s study is the first of its kind to combine dynamic statistical models with water quality data to trace pollutant sources and their driving factors. This allowed Emami’s team to provide a comprehensive assessment of the chemical composition of Lake Maurepas based on a wide array of data. The methodology can also be used to predict when and where pollutants will flow or migrate to other areas, she said. 
“Using the models, we were looking for the origins of the pollutant sources, and I wanted to know if the pollution sources in the Blind River could [let us] predict what was gonna show up in Manchac,” Emami said. “And it did.”
Emami said Pass Manchac’s significant tidal exchange between Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain has allowed her team to conclude that the water quality and levels of pollution between the two estuaries are virtually the same. 
Until the start of Southeastern’s research, there was no ongoing public monitoring for toxic metals in Lake Maurepas.
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality spokesman Matthew Day said the public should be aware of existing fish consumption advisories, such as one issued last year for Lake Maurepas based on elevated mercury levels detected in fish tissue. However, the agency does not conduct any regular heavy metal monitoring in Lake Maurepas because it is not required under Clean Water Act obligations, Day said.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)While on her way home from a coworking space in Denver last year, Colorado state Rep. Jenny Willford says she was sexually assaulted by her Lyft driver.
In her lawsuit filed against Lyft in January, Willford alleges she was “subjected to unwelcome, nonconsensual sexual contact, touching” and lewd comments during the ride.
Willford was picked up by a different driver than the person identified in the Lyft app, according to the suit.
Her experience — and those that other survivors shared with her after hearing her story — prompted Willford, a Democrat, to introduce legislation this year that aimed to require safety measures for both riders and drivers using ridesharing apps.
“In my mind, all of these things are very basic when it comes to safety,” Willford said. “They’re just so common sense that it’s been really disheartening and frustrating to me that Uber … threatened to leave the state if the bill becomes law.”
Her bill would have required rideshare companies to conduct more regular background checks for drivers, to create a program for passengers or drivers who want to audio or video record their rides and to develop other safety policies.
But following Uber’s threats to leave the state if the measure passed, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis vetoed it in late May. The bill would jeopardize rideshare services in Colorado “to an untenable degree, and could very well lead to companies that Coloradans rely on exiting the market, raising prices, or reducing the number of drivers,” his veto letter said.
Colorado isn’t alone. State and city leaders across the country are looking for ways to make rideshares safer. But lobbying campaigns from Uber and Lyft in many cases are blocking legislation meant to strengthen protections for both drivers and passengers.
Uber and Lyft, the two companies that dominate the U.S. rideshare industry, argue they have sufficient safety features within their apps.












Working on an app-based platform — like with delivery workers and rideshare workers — that sort of work is relatively new, so there's not a clear standard.


– Lorena Roque, the interim director of education, labor and worker justice at The Center for Law and Social Policy




“At Uber, we put safety at the heart of our operations, using technology, transparency, and accountability to help protect riders, drivers, and the broader community, with robust background checks and safety features like Audio and Video Recording, the Emergency Button, PIN verification, and RideCheck,” Uber wrote in a statement to Stateline.
“We remain committed to this work, and to dialogue with bill sponsors on sensible policies that keep people safe while protecting privacy and access.”
But there’s still a gap in regulations for rideshare companies because of their evolving technologies, said Lorena Roque, the interim director of education, labor and worker justice at The Center for Law and Social Policy, a left-leaning anti-poverty advocacy organization.
“Working on an app-based platform — like with delivery workers and rideshare workers —that sort of work is relatively new, so there’s not a clear standard,” Roque said.
Uber and Lyft are employing lobbyists at the state and local levels. In Rhode Island, another state where legislators are pushing rideshare safety bills that the companies have objected to, Uber is on pace to spend $50,000 this year on lobbyists, according to the state’s lobbying database. Lyft has been spending $5,000 monthly on lobbyists in Rhode Island.
Across the country, Uber and Lyft have testified against measures in state legislative hearings and city council meetings. In Colorado’s case, a number of officials representing Uber spoke out against Willford’s legislation at committee hearings, while Lyft sent a letter to Gov. Polis urging him to veto it. Jerry Golden, Lyft’s chief policy officer, wrote in the letter that the legislation’s requirements “ignore and ultimately will not improve conditions for riders and drivers.”
Uber told the state Senate it would be “impossible” for rideshare companies to comply with the bill’s requirements immediately upon approval and that the  audio and video requirement is “not possible to enforce.”
“The intention of my legislation was never to drive out Uber or Lyft,” Willford said. “The intention was always to require a higher level of accountability and safety from them. But we can’t do that if they’re going to throw tantrums and pick up their toys and go home every time somebody asks them to do better.”
Safety for passengers
As a part of Lyft’s safety measures, drivers must complete annual background checks and mandatory driver safety education. The app is also programmed to check in with riders when drivers take long stops or deviate from the route they were assigned.
Uber conducts periodic criminal screenings for all active drivers and requires drivers to regularly verify their identity by sharing a selfie with Uber using the app. Both companies offer live emergency assistance to riders.
Between 2020 and 2022, Lyft reported 23 fatal physical assaults of people using the Lyft platform and 2,651 instances of the five most serious categories of sexual assault, according to its 2024 Safety Transparency Report. While incidents of sexual assault had decreased 21% since the last report, which covered 2017-2019, fatal physical assaults jumped by 185%.
Uber saw 36 physical assault fatalities in 2021 and 2022 and 2,717 incidents of the most serious categories of sexual assault, according to the company’s most recent safety report. Despite a 22% decline in sexual assault and misconduct, there was an increase in fatal physical assaults since its 2019-2020 report.
State lawmakers in several states have tried to address rideshare safety concerns with varying degrees of success.
Pending legislation in New Jersey and Massachusetts aims to prevent sexual assault and misconduct against passengers.
The New Jersey measure would require rideshare companies to share information concerning sexual misconduct investigations into a driver and would allow companies to ban drivers during an investigation. It remains in committee.
The bill in Massachusetts, introduced by Democratic state Sen. Rebecca Rausch, would create a specific criminal penalty for the sexual assault of a passenger by a rideshare driver. The bill also would deem any rideshare passenger incapable of consenting to any sexual contact during a ride.  A hearing on the bill took place yesterday.
“We need to be able to make sure that people are safe and that people can trust those kinds of spaces to be safe,” Rausch said.
In May, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation that creates criminal penalties for impersonating a rideshare driver. Starting July 1, the crime counts as a second-degree misdemeanor. Uber supported the legislation.
But in Rhode Island, Lyft is pushing against legislation that would require fingerprinting as part of criminal background check. Brendan Joyce, the Lyft public policy manager, testified against the measure in April, saying the fingerprinting requirement relies on the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information System, which Joyce said has incomplete data. He also asserted that fingerprint checks “disproportionately impact and have potential discriminatory effects on communities of color.” Uber also testified against the proposal.
Rhode Island legislators introduced another measure that would prevent people under the age of 16 from using a rideshare service alone. Both bills are being held for further study.
Driver protections
JC Muhammad, 57, has been a rideshare driver in and around Chicago since about 2016.
Now, he works full-time as an organizer for faith-based organizations and groups that support rideshare drivers, including The People’s Union, a membership-driven organization aimed at supporting workers in the city.
Muhammad was attacked by a passenger during a Lyft ride in 2022, he said. The passenger asked to borrow Muhammad’s phone and opened its Cash App. The passenger also hit him over the head twice, he said, and threw a brick at his car, denting the side.
“I was angry as hell,” Muhammad said. “I really wanted to engage the kid, but I said, ‘No, let me get back in my car.’”

After sharing the incident with Lyft, the company responded by saying it would not match him with that passenger again. But the person who rode with Muhammad did not match the profile of the person who originally requested the ride, he said.
Muhammad also said he couldn’t go to the police because he did not know the identity of the person who was in his car — and Lyft would not share the identity of the account holder who ordered the Lyft.
Uber and Lyft customers have the option to verify their account, but not everyone does, Muhammad said.
“That gives us some measure of comfort, but it really doesn’t do enough, especially when it comes to calling rides for other people,” Muhammad said. “The account holder may not be the actual passenger.”
Rideshare drivers across the country — especially those of color — are frequently harassed, according to a 2023 report from the Strategic Organizing Center. The center is a coalition of labor unions representing more than 2.5 million workers across the country.
The survey of over 900 app-based rideshare drivers found the majority had been verbally abused and more than a quarter of respondents were threatened with physical harm. Nearly 15% of the drivers were grabbed, groped or hit, according to the report.
There have been several incidents in Chicago where drivers are lured by a false account to a location where they are then robbed or attacked, said Deana Rutherford, the communications manager at the Chicago Gig Alliance, a subset of The People’s Lobby.
“These drivers just show up and they have no idea who’s about to get into their car,” Rutherford said. “And Uber doesn’t know who they are either.”
To address some of the safety and labor issues drivers were facing, the Chicago City Council began considering an ordinance backed by The People’s Lobby that would require passenger verification.
If passed, the ordinance would have also set a minimum wage for drivers, require companies to be more transparent about fares, have them disclose the details of driver account deactivations and more. Both Uber and Lyft initially opposed the ordinance. Uber warned the measure’s sponsor that the changes in pay rates would drive up costs for customers and force the company to cut 10,000 drivers, according to a letter Uber sent to a city alderman that was obtained by Stateline.
But Uber this week agreed to a deal that scraps Chicago’s ordinance in exchange for the company’s support for state legislation that would allow rideshare drivers to unionize, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

(Photo courtesy of Visit Fargo-Moorhead)As super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.
And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”











Now they’ve seen measles in their community so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’


– Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas



In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”
Outbreak moves north
In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”

Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas
According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 13, there are 1,197 confirmed cases affecting 34 states. Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
There have been 21 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Photo by Jan Ellen Spiegel/CT Mirror)Connecticut’s Shore Line East commuter rail line, which serves nine train stations between New Haven and New London, is slated to receive a $4 million boost in 2027 to restore some of the service that was pared back in recent years.
While the $4 million adds an extra 10% to the line’s appropriated budget over the current year, and will add some additional trains to the line, advocates are concerned it won’t go far enough. Gov. Ned Lamont and the state Department of Transportation say funding for Shore Line East must be balanced with other rail service priorities, and they want to monitor ridership on the coastal route before committing to further increases.
The funding boost came after Senate Bill 714, which would have restored service on the line to pre-pandemic levels, failed to come up for a vote in either chamber during the waning days of the General Assembly’s 2025 session. Annual state funding for Shore Line East currently stands at roughly half where it was before the pandemic, and estimates for restoring full service to the line vary from $25 million to over $80 million.
According to the state Department of Transportation, nearly $40 million is authorized in the current state budget for Shore Line East in 2026 and $41 million for 2027. By comparison, the Hartford Line received roughly $60 million per year in the current budget.
The additional $4 million, secured for the second year of the biennial 2026-27 budget, comes on top of a $5 million boost Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, pushed to include in the current biennium budget. That funding came out of remaining federal COVID emergency funds.
The added funding will only expand service by a few trips a day between the shoreline’s nine communities. But Cohen, who co-chairs the legislature’s Transportation Committee, said it’s a start.
“We still have more work to do to restore service to pre-pandemic levels, but I am proud that we were able to secure an additional $4 million this year on top of the $5 million I secured in the last budget,” said Cohen, on whose request the sum was added as a line item in this year’s budget.
Shore Line East is the smallest of Connecticut’s six commuter rail lines, and it currently runs 20 daily trains, according to the DOT. It faced struggles beginning in 2018, when Amtrak’s seasonal track work reduced services significantly, advocates say. Then several incidents of trains malfunctioning further set back ridership.
“We kind of limped our way through, and then we got to COVID,” said Susan Feaster, founder of SLE Riders Advocacy Group. “So even before COVID, our numbers were starting to go down.”
In 2019, Shore Line East ran 36 daily trains, but COVID-19 led to further service reductions across all of the state’s commuter rail lines. In 2023, after budget cuts reduced the route’s service by another seven trains, the line was then running only 16 trains.
At the same time, other routes were seeing ridership rebound. The Hartford and the Waterbury lines, which have received millions in state investments to upgrade infrastructure and service, have exceeded pre-pandemic ridership levels. But those lines also serve some of the more densely-populated cities in Connecticut.

Last year, with the $5 million in American Rescue Plan funding, Shore Line East was able to add four weekday trains, along with round-trip direct service between Stamford and New London. While the ARPA funds were temporary, the $4 million secured in the next budget should help sustain that additional service.
For the last year, the line saw ridership just over a quarter of its pre-pandemic level. And last July, the line only carried only 18,559 riders as compared to over 60,000 in July of 2019. November was the line’s single best month since March 2020, with a total of 20,840 trips.
While the full impact of the four reinstated trains is still unclear — and DOT officials say they need more data — advocates estimate ridership has increased by 50%.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesman for Gov. Ned Lamont, said the governor’s administration wants to improve rail service by encouraging more housing development near transit, adding express trains to New York, and establishing a new bridge between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme — all of which is expected to speed up and improve service.
Shore Line East, Blanchard said, would cost more to restore to full service than any other rail line. “The current per-passenger-trip subsidy for Shore Line East is significantly more than any other mass transit option in the state,” Blanchard said. “We must balance the overall fiscal health of the [state’s transportation fund] with services that deliver value for Connecticut residents and businesses.”
The current subsidy per ride for Shore Line East is $183, as compared to the Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line’s $6.48 subsidy per ride. Comparably,  in 2021 when ridership for Shore Line East began to drop, its subsidy per rider was $55.28.
Advocates maintain the line must be reinstated to full service.
Jim Gildea, Chairman of the Connecticut Public Transportation Council said, “Restoring Shore Line East to full service will not only improve accessibility but also strengthen our public transportation network, ensuring that it meets the needs of all Connecticut residents.”
Feaster said Shore Line East has received less support than other lines.  “It seems like every time our numbers are good, they keep changing the target for us,” she said. “Lamont said one of the problems was that we didn’t have enough housing down here, which was not a criteria for any other branch line– Danbury [or] Waterbury.”
Feaster and Gildea both argue that restoring more trains to the line is what helps build ridership, and not the other way around.
“With last year’s funding of $5 million, we are witnessing a dedicated effort to enhance our rail services, which is vital for attracting riders back to the line,” Gildea said.

In an office overlooking downtown Erie, Pennsylvania, Saeed Taraky pulls a pen from a box beside his desk. He presses the stylus, and a small light illuminates the barrel of the pen. A message reads:
“Welcome to America! Welcome to Erie, PA! Create a Great Future For You and Your Family!”
The pens will go to new American citizens after they complete their naturalization ceremonies, which Taraky conducts. The small gift is the kind of earnest and optimistic gesture that says a lot about how this Pennsylvania city approaches new arrivals.
Taraky, once a refugee from Afghanistan, is now Erie’s refugee and immigrant liaison. He and his family arrived in 2022, after fleeing the Taliban’s return to power, and found a welcoming community in Erie. Today, trying to provide the kind of welcome he once received, he helps newcomers resettle and coordinates an immigrant and refugee council that offers immigrant perspectives on city policies.
But for city officials in Erie, creating a welcoming atmosphere for immigrants is not just about generosity. It’s a path city leaders say they have chosen out of necessity. After decades of industrial decline, Erie has become a case study in how some Rust Belt cities are surviving by welcoming newcomers. Once home to more than 138,000 people, the city now has a population that hovers at 90,000. Erie’s ailments have continued long into this century. For the past two decades, factories and manufacturing jobs have been leaving Erie for the South and for Mexico. A major blow came in 2018 when General Electric, the city’s major employer for more than 100 years, sold its Erie branch.

Faced with declining industries and population, city leaders made a bet: What if they made their city a destination for immigrants and refugees?
“Immigration can be a kind of panacea for population decline,” said Elizabeth Jones of the Welcoming Center, which promotes immigration as a catalyst for economic development in the Philadelphia area. Immigrants are more likely to be working age, start businesses and file patents — key drivers of economic growth.
Erie embraced that philosophy. Its mayor, Joe Schember, made getting the city designated a “welcoming community” a priority. That has included promoting English classes, ensuring there are pipelines for immigrants to enter the workforce and launching a New American Council to gather insight from immigrants and refugees themselves. Research backs their efforts: According to a report by the Economic Research Institute of Erie at Pennsylvania State University at Erie, the Behrend College, immigrants contribute $253 million to the county economy each year, and thanks to immigration, the population has stabilized after years of decline.
While many local leaders credit newcomers with strengthening the tax base, filling essential jobs and revitalizing schools, not all politicians representing the area are as welcoming. And the progress the region has made in integrating new arrivals is now threatened by a resurgence of federal anti-immigrant policies — putting Erie’s fragile revival at risk.
Federal funding cuts have shaken refugee agencies. The three agencies in Erie, which provide resettlement services including housing assistance, English classes and assistance with the health system, receive a significant portion of their budgets from the federal government. Despite multiple court orders for the Trump administration to unfreeze funding, their grants remain paused.
“Given what has happened so far, we almost have to assume the worst-case scenario,” said Katie Kretz, the executive director of refugee agency the Multicultural Community Resource Center.
Kretz and leaders of the two other agencies appealed to the Erie Foundation in March for emergency funding. Since then, the foundation has set up a rapid response fund.But Erie’s other agencies, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants’ Erie field office and Catholic Charities, have already laid off employees, and the future is uncertain.
While the U.S. — and thus Erie — has not accepted any new refugees since the start of the Trump administration, service providers are assisting recent arrivals on shoestring budgets.
“Hopefully [the anti-immigrant mood] is a short-term blip, and the longer-term trend is that we continue to realize the value of inviting new people into your community,” said Chris Groner, director of Erie’s office of development services.

Erie County is represented by Republican Rep. Mike Kelly, who has made immigration one of his key issues. “President Biden’s open border policies have turned every state into a border state,” Kelly said on the House Floor last year. He has specifically spoken out about crossings at the northern border given that Lake Erie forms part of the U.S. border with Canada. “If [immigrants] were wearing the uniform of a foreign country, we would think we were being invaded and we would say, my God, who is watching the border?” Kelly said at a hearing on the northern border in 2023.
Erie County, which is made up of a more progressive city surrounded by more rural, conservative areas, is known for being a swing county and a bellwether of national elections. Since 2008, a majority of voters in Erie County have chosen the winner of the presidential race. That includes choosing Trump in 2024.
Immigration was one of the top issues for voters during the presidential election, with Trump promising to ramp up immigrant arrests and deportations while in office. A September 2024 Pew Research poll found that 56% of registered voters supported mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.
Trump has made good on his promises, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting more than 66,000 people in the first 100 days of the new administration.
Yet people’s views are nuanced, as 64% of Americans believed that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the U.S. “if certain requirements are met,” according to a November 2024 Pew poll.
To Jim Wertz, a Democrat who is currently running for Erie County Council, anti-immigrant sentiment hasn’t been a noticeable problem in the city of Erie or even the county. “Regardless of political [identity], folks recognize the value of these communities,” he said, suggesting it may be because of residents’ real experiences with immigrants. “Folks here go to the grocery store and meet people actually affected” by anti-immigrant policies, added Wertz, who is a professor of broadcast journalism and digital media at Pennsylvania Western University at Edinboro.
That includes the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants.
Though officials in the city of Erie have said they do not expect the police department to work with ICE, the Erie County Sheriff’s Office has detained immigrants in Erie County Prison on behalf of the federal agency. At the end of February, nine immigrants were detained in the jail, according to Erie News Now, before some were transferred to a central Pennsylvania facility.
Against this backdrop, Taraky said that the city is planning to help “remove that gate” between immigrants and U.S.-born residents by inviting nonimmigrants “to see the culture of immigrants [and] what they bring to the table,” which includes the “food and fun” aspect of cultural integration: new cuisines, cultural performances and gatherings.
One of the new arrivals putting that approach into practice is Karim Hanif, a doctor in Afghanistan before he and his family fled the Taliban and moved to northwestern Pennsylvania. In February, he opened Ariana Halal Kitchen — the first Afghan restaurant in Erie. His son, Mohammad Abid, translated as Hanif explained that he wanted to work for himself and also give back to the Erie community. Erie’s Afghans love the familiar food; “The restaurant will be growing fast because a lot of Afghans keep coming to Erie,” Hanif said. But Hanif’s customers are diverse: He serves other Muslims who are seeking halal food, like Somalis and Syrians, as well as U.S.-born Americans who are broadening their palates, eating cuisine they’ve possibly never tried before.

There are at least 6,000 first-generation immigrants in the city of Erie, and more than half are refugees who were forced to flee dangerous conditions in their home countries. In addition to Afghanistan, Erie’s refugees hail from countries including Bhutan, Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, Burundi, Ukraine, Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Eritrea, Kosovo and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Metropolitan areas in the Rust Belt were famously immigrant enclaves in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But today, these cities’ foreign-born residents tend to represent a relatively small percentage of the overall population compared to the U.S. average. Fewer than 7% of the city of Erie’s residents are foreign born, compared to about 14% in the U.S.
Even so, those immigrants bring jobs and businesses and inject money into the local economy, researchers across the country say. The city actively supports immigrant- and refugee-owned small businesses with microgrants, which have provided many of them with an initial infusion of capital. Immigrant entrepreneurs operate at least 100 ventures in the city, from day care centers and grocery stories to art galleries and auto repair shops.
For his part, Taraky remains committed to highlighting the benefits of immigration — both through his words and his wardrobe — as he supports newcomers in integrating into the community. On a day in March, he wore a dark three-piece suit, complete with a patterned red pocket square. Dressing well allows people in the community to see an immigrant as a professional, he said.
The hope, Taraky added, is that rather than clash, immigrants and nonimmigrants will “come together [and] understand each other.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Legislature held its first floor sessions after the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband and the near-fatal shootings of another state lawmaker and his wife. Leaders said that political violence is unacceptable and expressed willingness to discuss increasing security at the Capitol and for Wisconsin public officials.
Police have identified 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter as the suspected gunman in the assassination of Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor House leader Melissa Hortman and her husband over the weekend. He is also the suspect in the shooting of Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. Boelter was apprehended Monday and faces federal and state murder charges. 
Wisconsin lawmakers had requested increased security in the Wisconsin State Capitol following the shootings and ahead of Wednesday’s floor sessions. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) told reporters that they made the right decision in requesting the increased security and said his caucus would be open to talking about new security proposals but it isn’t clear those are the right actions to take.
“Whenever an incident like this happens the most important thing that we can do is to take a breath and look at what’s going to be the actual best potential solution as opposed to a knee-jerk reaction,” Vos said. 
Vos added that the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) believes the Minnesota case may be one of the first political assassinations of a state lawmaker in the nation’s history and also noted that the “scariest” thing is that the shootings happened at the lawmakers’ homes.
“The idea of trying to make the Capitol into a fortress, I don’t know if that necessarily would even have ever done anything in this situation to help the awful situation that happened in Minnesota,” Vos said. “We’re going to talk about it as a caucus. I think we made the right decision to increase security here.” 
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) echoed Democrats at another presser, where lawmakers didn’t take questions. 
“Political violence is never the answer. We need to solve our differences through legislation,” LeMahieu said. 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) spoke about the attacks at a joint press conference ahead of Wednesday’s floor sessions. Boelter had a list of dozens of people including elected officials and abortion providers in his vehicle, according to police. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 11 Democratic lawmakers were found on that list.
Neubauer thanked law enforcement and her colleagues in leadership for coming together in a joint statement over the weekend to say that “no one should ever fear for their lives because of their service to their communities.” She said she and Hortman “shared a strong commitment to service and our communities” and that her heart is broken for Hortman’s family.
“I would also like to ask everyone to remember that these threats, even after the suspect has been apprehended, have had real impacts on the mental health of everyone affected, and we ask that you please respect the duress members and their families have been put through and extend understanding to them,” Neubauer said. 
Hesselbein said that differences should be settled with debate, not political violence.
“In addition to inflicting physical harm, political violence is meant to silence opposition. It is meant to discourage participation in our democracy by residents, by people thinking of running, by public officials. No one should fear for their lives because of their service to the community or because of their involvement in public life,” Hesselbein said. 
“I feel safe in our Capitol building. I think we’re going to continue to have conversations to make sure that everyone else feels safe as well,” Hesselbein said. 
Neubauer said Democrats are open to longer term conversations about security measures in the Capitol. 
Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) has suggested that Wisconsin should install metal detectors in the Capitol and should ban members of the public from carrying guns inside the building. 
State lawmakers have passed bipartisan laws in the past to help protect judges. While debating a bill — SB 169 — that would make a minor change to one of those laws enacted last year that provides privacy protections for judicial officers when there is a written request, there was some discussion about extending additional privacy protections for public officials. 
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said the bill speaks to keeping judges safe in their homes and said she hoped her colleagues would consider joining her in working on a proposal to extend privacy protections to anyone who serves the public in a public-facing role. 
“There are many people who serve the public in an important capacity, judges are certainly one, but legislators as well, constitutional officers… who are now in this world of high risk,” Roys said.
Vos earlier told reporters that the jobs of judges and state lawmakers are a little different, which could influence conversations about additional privacy protections for public officials in various roles. 
“State legislators are just so much more accessible, which, frankly, is like our superpower. We are the most accessible and the most responsive to the public because we are constantly at events, we are meeting with people, we are doing town halls. We are doing all the interactions that you want in a healthy democracy,” Vos said. 
During the Assembly Floor Session, Vos spoke about knowing Hortman, saying he met her through his work with the National Conference of State Legislatures and called Hortman “funny and engaging and incredibly smart.” 
Hortman was elected to the Minnesota State Legislature in 2004. “Over the next two decades,” Vos said, “she became a formidable force in state politics on her intelligence and her effectiveness.” 
“We all have responsibility when it comes to toning down the political rhetoric we use each day,” Vos said. “All political parties suffer political intimidation, name calling and the risk of physical violence, and we owe it to those who elect us to be role models for civil discourse.” 
The Senate and Assembly both held moments of silence for the Hortmans.
Vos and Hesselbein both read portions of the statement put out by the Hortmans’ children, Sophie and Colin Hortman: “Hope and resilience are the enemy of fear. Our parents lived their lives with immense dedication to their fellow humans. This tragedy must become a moment for us to come together. Hold your loved ones a little closer. Love your neighbors. Treat each other with kindness and respect. The best way to honor our parents’ memory is to do something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.”

But it saw hours of debate on the budget proposal as well as dozens of remaining bills, many of which traveled back and forth between chambers as lawmakers weighed which would pass and which would not.
However, the chambers adjourned shortly after 9:30 with several proposals left in limbo, including a data privacy bill (LD 1088) that the Maine House of Representatives rejected 77-70 but was never taken up by the Senate.
Ahead of the House vote, sponsor Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford) said data privacy had been a “hot topic in caucuses” this week. Henderson’s bill is the version favored by businesses that uses a notice and consent model, allowing companies to collect data as long as consumers agree to it in privacy notices. However, the House has yet to vote on the competing plan, which was backed by the Judiciary Committee. Sponsored by Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth), LD 1822 uses a standard called data minimization, which broadly means limiting the collection of personal information to only what is necessary to fulfill the consumer service. The Senate has yet to consider either bill. (Read more about these proposals here).
The chambers opted not to adjourn sin die, or finally, on Wednesday and plan to reconvene next week in coordination with when the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee “runs the table.” 
About 300 bills that passed both chambers but need funding still remain in limbo on what’s called the appropriations table. The appropriations committee, which manages this table, will ultimately decide which proposals to fund with any remaining unappropriated money.
Some of those proposals are bills to establish a task force to suggest reform to the real estate property tax, ensure the already required teaching of Wabanaki and African American studies are effectively taught in Maine schools, provide more funding for family planning services, fund proper disposal of syringe litter and expand testing for forever chemicals in private wells, among others.
It remains to be seen whether the chambers will also take up data privacy or other stranded measures when they return.
For now, here’s an overview of what happened Wednesday.
Both the House and Senate enacted a bill (LD 1971) to restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, after narrowly giving initial approval on Tuesday. (Read more about the proposal here.)
Both chambers have now backed legislation (LD 556) that would prohibit a municipality from banning a particular energy system or distributor, after the Senate voted 17-16 on Wednesday to align with the House in favor of the measure. Sen. Matt Harrigton (R-York) noted that many municipalities currently have climate agendas in which they outline future plans to ban certain heat sources, “we should be doing everything in power…to make sure those plans are halted ahead of time,” he said. Ahead of the enactment vote in the House, Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick) said he feared this would be one of the most environmentally damaging bills the Legislature would send to the governor this session. The bill is currently being held in the House.
After initially rejecting the measure, the Senate voted 19-15 on Wednesday in favor of a proposal (LD 1270) to make the governor’s energy office a cabinet level department, following the House in support. The bill is now on the appropriations table. (Read more about this proposal here).
Both chambers rejected a bill ( LD 746) that would permit municipalities to impose a 2% sales tax on short-term lodging, if approved by referendum, to be used to fund affordable housing. (Read more about this bill here.)
A suite of bills aiming to amend portions of the Right to Repair law (LD 442, LD 1227 and LD 1394) were rejected by both chambers in light of the passage of another bill (LD 1228) that would clarify certain terms in the Automotive Right to Repair Laws passed by citizens initiative in November 2023.
Legislation (LD 532) that sought to study assaults on health care workers is essentially dead after the chambers could not agree on the issue.
Following the House, senators on Wednesday finally enacted legislation (LD 1666) that would expand ranked-choice voting for general and special elections for gubernatorial, state senators and state representative races. 
After both chambers insisted on their positions regarding LD 1298, which would establish an alternative pathway for someone to become a licensed social worker who has failed the licensure exam, the bill is now effectively dead. During the extensive House debate, lawmakers highlighted a tension between the state’s dire need for behavioral health support and the risk posed to children by having potentially unqualified people making important determinations about health and safety.
 education Emergency legislation (LD 549) directing the Department of Public Safety to establish a sexual assault forensic examination kit tracking system, and another emergency bill (LD 1816) to conduct an inventory of existing forensic examination kits in the possession of law enforcement passed both chambers with support of more than two-thirds of members, which is required to take effect immediately. They were both moved to the appropriations table to vie for remaining funds. (Read more about this issue here).

(University of Kentucky)
The United States’ newest federal holiday, celebrated annually on June 19, has quickly become its most puzzling one. Four years after President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Americans have wrestled with what to make of the holiday.
What is Juneteenth? What is the proper way to celebrate it? Should holiday observers attend barbecues and cookouts? Should Juneteenth’s observance be a day of learning? Is there a way to acknowledge the holiday without misappropriating it?
This confusion likely emerged because many Americans did not even learn about Juneteenth until around when it became a federal holiday in 2021. Moreover, the Trump administration and state legislatures across the country have further complicated matters with their increased efforts to ban the type of education that led to the national recognition of the holiday in the first place.
 ‘All slaves are free’

Juneteenth – short for June Nineteenth – recognizes the day in 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with roughly 2,000 federal troops from the 13th Army Corps. Upon arriving, Granger issued General Order No. 3. The order read:
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”

  The official handwritten record of General Order No. 3, preserved at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. (National Archives)
Granger’s order effectively freed 250,000 enslaved people in the region.
Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the enslaved in all the states that had seceded from the U.S., nearly 2½ years earlier, Texas, a Confederate state, rebelled against it.
At the time, Texas had a minimal number of Union soldiers to enforce the proclamation’s emancipation of enslaved people residing within Confederate territory. Consequently, many of those enslaved in Texas remained ignorant of the proclamation’s potential impact on their lives, or of the fact the Civil War had functionally ended two months earlier.
In an interview published in 1941, for example, Laura Smalley of Hempstead, Texas, remembered how her enslaver fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He returned without informing those whom he enslaved of their freedom. In her interview, she recounted,
“Old master didn’t tell, you know, they was free … I think now they say they worked them, six months after that.”
 ‘Second Independence Day’

June 19, 1865, a Monday, changed that.
The news of emancipation culminated a generations-long struggle for Black people to obtain a modicum of freedom in the U.S.
For this reason, some refer to Juneteenth as the nation’s second Independence Day. The end of bondage was ostensibly codified in the 13th Amendment ratified later that year.
Spontaneous Juneteenth celebrations emerged almost immediately. Celebrants referred to the day as “Emancipation Day,” “Freedom Day,” “Juneteenth” and “Jubilee Day.” The latter title alluded to the biblical period following seven sabbatical cycles that resulted in canceling debts and freeing the enslaved.
Flake’s Bulletin, a weekly, Galveston-based publication, reported on an Emancipation Celebration occurring on Jan. 2, 1866, that included upward of 800 people. A similar gathering occurred in Galveston on June 19, 1866, in what is now the church known as Reedy Chapel AME. Annual celebrations continued, beginning in southeastern Texas, with events such as historical reenactments, parades, picnics, music and speeches.

 Legacies of slavery

While the holiday marked a joyous occasion for some, Juneteenth met early and persistent opposition, particularly in the time following Reconstruction.
For years, local reporting spoke of Juneteenth, as the Galveston Historical Foundation put it, in a “flagrantly racist nature.” Additionally, the racist stereotyping – “idleness” – in the final sentence of Granger’s order simultaneously illustrated its complicated nature while also “[foreshadowing] that the fight for freedom would continue,” National Archives staffer Michael Davis wrote in 2020.
Historian Keisha Blain explains, “The enslavement of Black people in the U.S. may have ended but the legacies of slavery still shape every aspect of Black life.”
Advocates such as Opal Lee, commonly referred to as the “grandmother of Juneteenth,” pressed for Juneteenth celebration to continue and, ultimately, for it to be made a national holiday.
Lee began her advocacy in earnest during the mid-1970s in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. The oldest member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, Lee spearheaded several campaigns to draw attention to Juneteenth. These campaigns included initiatives such as an online petition promoting the holiday’s observance launched in 2019 that amassed 1.6 million signatures.
In speaking on the significance of Juneteenth, Lee said, “Freedom is for everyone. I think freedom should be celebrated from the 19th of June to the Fourth of July; however, none of us are free until we are all free. We are not free yet, and Juneteenth is a symbol of that.”

 National recognition

Because of this advocacy, Juneteenth has grown from relatively obscure regional celebrations to, starting in 2021, a federal holiday.
The establishment of the holiday was the capstone of initiatives during the racial reckoning. Historians refer to the racial reckoning as the time period beginning in the summer of 2020 until the spring of the following year that witnessed heightened attention to America’s nagging history of racism.
This reckoning included the historic protests prompted by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.
During this time, numerous institutions, ranging from colleges and universities to major companies, made commitments to racial equity. The recognition of Juneteenth represented a symbolic means to honor those commitments.
In remarks marking his signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Biden said, “Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come.”

 Backtracking on gains

But within a year, some had already begun to argue the nation had, as community organizer Braxton Brewington wrote, “betrayed the spirit of Jubilee Day.”
Many of the racial equity commitments made during the racial reckoning quickly vanished within a year or two. Economist William Michael Cunningham revealed American companies pledged $50 billion to racial equity efforts in 2020, yet had only spent $250 million by 2021.
By the spring of 2025, companies such as Walmart and McDonald’s announced they will discontinue their diversity, equity and inclusion work. Moreover, Walmart will stop using the term altogether. Amazon, Meta and dozens of other large corporations made similar announcements.
And members of the Trump administration have mounted continual attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and used the term as a politically expedient slur to deride Black people. This is also exacerbated by the Trump administration’s challenges to birthright citizenship, a key right that gave citizenship to the formerly enslaved and later guaranteed important rights to the entire populace.
This major shift has fueled arguments that the U.S. has regressed from efforts toward racial equity and thus undermined the meaning of Juneteenth. And such backtracking arguably makes some Juneteenth celebrations performative exercises rather than celebrations of true racial equity.
As one critic asked, has the holiday devolved “into an exploitative and profit-driven enterprise for companies that disregard the true significance of this day to the Black community?”
All of this has led to increasing confusion over how to commemorate Juneteenth, if at all. Juneteenth is not the first federal holiday with a complicated history. Nevertheless, with other complex holidays, Americans had years to process their misgivings. In short, the nation is still deciding what it means to be free.

On Wednesday, Newton gave his answer: “No.”
As Newsline reported last week, when the bill was first considered by the Senate Committee, Newton — a committee co-chair — put forth a proposed amended version that defined the state’s recognition of two biological sexes: male and female. Newton also proposed the state maintain the vital records of anyone seeking to change the sex on their birth certificate.
At Wednesday’s committee hearing, Newton went a step further by introducing new language aimed at transgender individuals and school libraries. One amendment would extend the statute of limitations on medical malpractice lawsuits brought by people who have undergone a gender transition procedure from three years to ten.
“We have a fairly detailed, longstanding malpractice system on our state. I’m wondering what the reason is for treating this particular type of medical care differently than standard malpractice and other kinds of medical care?” asked Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake).
Newton said individuals who’ve sought out gender transition procedures are often in a “very precarious frame of mind” when they make the decision to have surgery or undergo treatment.

“A lot of times they’re not aware of a lot of the circumstances, negative implications for themselves until much, much later after traditional statute limitations would run. So, we thought it was appropriate to extend it out to ten years,” said Newton.
Grafstein responded that more people regret knee replacement surgery than regret gender affirming care.
Newton said the extended statute of limitations on malpractice lawsuits was appropriate since gender reassignment surgery had become “fashionable.”
The Wake Democrat called that comment “snide” and an insult to people who make important life decisions around these issues.
 Parental access to library books 
Unrelated to the malpractice provision, a second change in Newton’s new version of the legislation would also provide parents with access to a searchable list of library books available at each public school.
Local boards of education would be required to adopt policies to allow a student or their parent to request that the student be excused from specific classroom discussions or assigned readings if they believe it “imposes a substantial burden on the student’s religious beliefs” or invades the student’s privacy by calling attention to the student’s religion.

Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham) suggested the amendment as worded could lead to censorship, preventing a student from reading or learning about the Holocaust in school.
Brian Gwyn, a staff attorney and legislative analyst, said in that example students would be given an alternate assignment aligned with the standard course study.
“So just to confirm, the answer is a parent can forbid a child from reading books about the Holocaust if they believe that didn’t occur. Is that correct?” pressed Chitlik.
“From checking out a book in the library, that is correct,” answered Gwyn.
Newton could not answer as to whether the NC Department of Public Instruction or the NC School Board Association were consulted.
He said his amendment was intended to empower parents.
“We’re seeing a lot of instances of libraries being filled up with all kinds of materials at the very least or not age appropriate for the children who would check it out. Parents are totally in the dark.”
Grafstein said Newton’s assessment simply was not true.
“There’s a narrative out there that librarians, who we all grew up learning from and being guided by, that somehow, they’ve turned evil and they’re trying to harm children. It’s just a false narrative,” Grafstein told the committee.
 Part of a larger strategy?

Tami Fitzgerald with the North Carolina Values Coalition praised the amendment for offering a remedy to transgender individuals who may later detransition.
“Second, it solves or attempts to solve the obscenity problem in our schools, both related to curriculum and library books,” Fitzgerald said.
Reighlah Collins, Policy Counsel for the ACLU of North Carolina, said the amendment and reworked bill amount to harmful attacks on transgender people.
“It’s part of a larger strategy to push transgender people out of public and civic life,” Collins responded.
Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) again appealed to Newton to strip out his controversial amendment and return to the original bill to protect women and minors, bipartisan legislation that raised no objections in the state House.
“You’ve been around this place long enough to know pretty much how it works, and so the answer to your question is respectfully, ‘no,'” answered Newton.
HB 805 advanced on a voice vote to the Senate Rules Committee, which is slated to hear the bill on Thursday.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Newton_6182025.jpg,,,2025-06-19 05:59:44.551834

The United States’ newest federal holiday, celebrated annually on June 19, has quickly become its most puzzling one. Four years after President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Americans have wrestled with what to make of the holiday.
What is Juneteenth? What is the proper way to celebrate it? Should holiday observers attend barbecues and cookouts? Should Juneteenth’s observance be a day of learning? Is there a way to acknowledge the holiday without misappropriating it?
This confusion likely emerged because many Americans did not even learn about Juneteenth until around when it became a federal holiday in 2021. Moreover, the Trump administration and state legislatures across the country have further complicated matters with their increased efforts to ban the type of education that led to the national recognition of the holiday in the first place.
 ‘All slaves are free’

Juneteenth – short for June Nineteenth – recognizes the day in 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with roughly 2,000 federal troops from the 13th Army Corps. Upon arriving, Granger issued General Order No. 3. The order read:
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”

  The official handwritten record of General Order No. 3, preserved at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. National Archives.
Granger’s order effectively freed 250,000 enslaved people in the region.
Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the enslaved in all the states that had seceded from the U.S., nearly 2½ years earlier, Texas, a Confederate state, rebelled against it.
At the time, Texas had a minimal number of Union soldiers to enforce the proclamation’s emancipation of enslaved people residing within Confederate territory. Consequently, many of those enslaved in Texas remained ignorant of the proclamation’s potential impact on their lives, or of the fact the Civil War had functionally ended two months earlier.
In an interview published in 1941, for example, Laura Smalley of Hempstead, Texas, remembered how her enslaver fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He returned without informing those whom he enslaved of their freedom. In her interview, she recounted,
“Old master didn’t tell, you know, they was free … I think now they say they worked them, six months after that.”
 ‘Second Independence Day’

June 19, 1865, a Monday, changed that.
The news of emancipation culminated a generations-long struggle for Black people to obtain a modicum of freedom in the U.S.
For this reason, some refer to Juneteenth as the nation’s second Independence Day. The end of bondage was ostensibly codified in the 13th Amendment ratified later that year.
Spontaneous Juneteenth celebrations emerged almost immediately. Celebrants referred to the day as “Emancipation Day,” “Freedom Day,” “Juneteenth” and “Jubilee Day.” The latter title alluded to the biblical period following seven sabbatical cycles that resulted in canceling debts and freeing the enslaved.
Flake’s Bulletin, a weekly, Galveston-based publication, reported on an Emancipation Celebration occurring on Jan. 2, 1866, that included upward of 800 people. A similar gathering occurred in Galveston on June 19, 1866, in what is now the church known as Reedy Chapel AME. Annual celebrations continued, beginning in southeastern Texas, with events such as historical reenactments, parades, picnics, music and speeches.

 Legacies of slavery

While the holiday marked a joyous occasion for some, Juneteenth met early and persistent opposition, particularly in the time following Reconstruction.
For years, local reporting spoke of Juneteenth, as the Galveston Historical Foundation put it, in a “flagrantly racist nature.” Additionally, the racist stereotyping – “idleness” – in the final sentence of Granger’s order simultaneously illustrated its complicated nature while also “[foreshadowing] that the fight for freedom would continue,” National Archives staffer Michael Davis wrote in 2020.
Historian Keisha Blain explains, “The enslavement of Black people in the U.S. may have ended but the legacies of slavery still shape every aspect of Black life.”
Advocates such as Opal Lee, commonly referred to as the “grandmother of Juneteenth,” pressed for Juneteenth celebration to continue and, ultimately, for it to be made a national holiday.
Lee began her advocacy in earnest during the mid-1970s in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. The oldest member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, Lee spearheaded several campaigns to draw attention to Juneteenth. These campaigns included initiatives such as an online petition promoting the holiday’s observance launched in 2019 that amassed 1.6 million signatures.
In speaking on the significance of Juneteenth, Lee said, “Freedom is for everyone. I think freedom should be celebrated from the 19th of June to the Fourth of July; however, none of us are free until we are all free. We are not free yet, and Juneteenth is a symbol of that.”

 National recognition

Because of this advocacy, Juneteenth has grown from relatively obscure regional celebrations to, starting in 2021, a federal holiday.
The establishment of the holiday was the capstone of initiatives during the racial reckoning. Historians refer to the racial reckoning as the time period beginning in the summer of 2020 until the spring of the following year that witnessed heightened attention to America’s nagging history of racism.
This reckoning included the historic protests prompted by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.
During this time, numerous institutions, ranging from colleges and universities to major companies, made commitments to racial equity. The recognition of Juneteenth represented a symbolic means to honor those commitments.
In remarks marking his signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Biden said, “Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come.”

 Backtracking on gains

But within a year, some had already begun to argue the nation had, as community organizer Braxton Brewington wrote, “betrayed the spirit of Jubilee Day.”
Many of the racial equity commitments made during the racial reckoning quickly vanished within a year or two. Economist William Michael Cunningham revealed American companies pledged $50 billion to racial equity efforts in 2020, yet had only spent $250 million by 2021.
By the spring of 2025, companies such as Walmart and McDonald’s announced they will discontinue their diversity, equity and inclusion work. Moreover, Walmart will stop using the term altogether. Amazon, Meta and dozens of other large corporations made similar announcements.
And members of the Trump administration have mounted continual attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and used the term as a politically expedient slur to deride Black people. This is also exacerbated by the Trump administration’s challenges to birthright citizenship, a key right that gave citizenship to the formerly enslaved and later guaranteed important rights to the entire populace.
This major shift has fueled arguments that the U.S. has regressed from efforts toward racial equity and thus undermined the meaning of Juneteenth. And such backtracking arguably makes some Juneteenth celebrations performative exercises rather than celebrations of true racial equity.
As one critic asked, has the holiday devolved “into an exploitative and profit-driven enterprise for companies that disregard the true significance of this day to the Black community?”
All of this has led to increasing confusion over how to commemorate Juneteenth, if at all. Juneteenth is not the first federal holiday with a complicated history. Nevertheless, with other complex holidays, Americans had years to process their misgivings. In short, the nation is still deciding what it means to be free.

The 6-foot-2 man had dropped to 115 pounds and sat drenched in sweat between bouts of vomiting at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. He sat before Rep. Becky Currie, chairwoman of the state House Corrections Committee, at the facility in the Delta known for its long history of deaths and violent disturbances. 
Currie, a registered nurse, could tell the man had liver disease. She asked that the man’s name be concealed to protect him from retribution from prison officials. Currie said the inmate told her he contracted liver disease from untreated Hepatitis C. The contagious virus can be treated with antiviral medication that, if administered properly, is highly effective, curing more than 95% of patients. 
The man said he had been asking for medication for years, to no avail. Another man Currie met in prison with Hepatitis C had blood ammonia levels so high that he was hallucinating and had been told he had three months left to live. 
“He didn’t have but a five-year sentence,” Currie said. “Now he’s got a death sentence.”
Currie voiced her dismay to Burl Cain, commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. 
Currie’s committee has legislative oversight of Mississippi’s corrections system, and Cain became aware of her increasing skepticism of the department’s ability to police the provision of health care in its facilities. 
So he told Currie in April that MDOC had withheld $2 million in state funding from the private company providing prison health care for having inadequate staff. 
But when lawmakers returned to Jackson in late May for a special session to set a state budget, MDOC requested an additional $4 million in a “deficit appropriation” – money to cover a shortfall – for the medical program provided by that same company. 
Currie said the money appears to be a bailout for VitalCore Health Strategies, canceling out any financial consequence the company was supposed to face. She also said there is no explanation for why MDOC is running a deficit for its medical program as sick prisoners languish without proper medical care, turning some short prison stints into death sentences. 
“A month ago, Commissioner Burl Cain told me that he had fined VitalCore $2 million for a lack of health care workers to be able to provide health care to inmates,” Currie said. “Then, in their budget, VitalCore and MDOC asked for $4 million to shore up a health care deficit. What this means is VitalCore and MDOC are working together to manipulate their budget.”
In a statement, an MDOC spokesperson confirmed the agency withheld $2 million from VitalCore under its contract with the company for staffing issues, but it said the financial punishment wasn’t a “fine.” It also said the $4 million budget request was to cover increased costs of providing health care. 
“MDOC has not ‘fined’ VitalCore,” wrote Kate Head, a corrections department spokesperson. “Rather, MDOC has withheld approximately $2M in proceeds under the contract due to VitalCore’s failure to meet certain contractual staffing requirements.”  
In a separate statement, Timothy Keck, a company spokesperson, said VitalCore has not received additional funds beyond what is outlined in its contract and has made progress hiring more medical staff. The company disputed claims that it denied treatment and said it complies with all state policies.
MDOC did not respond to a follow-up question asking why the cost of providing care had increased, the same question Currie kept asking as she embarked on several tours inside Mississippi’s prisons. Once inside the grounds of these facilities, the lawmaker says she witnessed widespread suffering. The suffering is preventable, and raises questions about how hundreds of millions in taxpayer money have been spent, she said.
“I disagree with them that they are living up to standards of care,” Currie said. “I am also aware that what money they don’t spend on inmates, they keep.”
‘Trapped here with no help’
Currie said the first man she met at Parchman later received medication for Hepatitis C, but only after she inquired directly with Cain about the holdup. 
She said the episode further affirmed to her that untreated illness among prisoners was not happenstance but the result of deliberate decisions made by those tasked with caring for inmates. 
Allegations that Mississippi denies inmates treatment for Hepatitis C stretch back years. The denial of medication, either willful or the result of mismanagement, has caused Hepatitis C to go untreated inside Mississippi’s prisons, Currie said she found while touring jails. 
But that isn’t all she found. 
Currie met a 23-year-old woman with a lump growing out of her breast from untreated cancer. Other women were denied pap smears and mammograms. She met men with untreated HIV. Many more inmates were charged for care they never received.
Then Currie began receiving letters — pleas for help scribbled on notebook paper. Mississippi Today reviewed some of the letters and is protecting the identity of its authors, who shared sensitive details about their medical conditions.

Last fall, Currie met a 69-year-old woman incarcerated at the Mississippi Correctional Institute for Women in Rankin County. The woman said she was having trouble breathing, but couldn’t get prison officials to let her see a doctor. In a letter to Currie months later, the woman said she still hadn’t seen a doctor despite her lips turning purple and blue. She also suffers from gastrointestinal issues that have gone untreated.
“It has affected my eyes, mouth, throat and now my urethra,” she wrote. “I have yet to see a urologist either. I am submitting another sick call to the clinic this week. I don’t know what else to do.”
A 60-year-old woman at the Delta Correctional Facility in Greenwood said she had urinary incontinence, but was denied pads and wipes because facility medical staff, directed by VitalCore, demanded she have a pelvic exam first. She had the exam and was still denied supplies.
“It looks to me like they are setting the criteria too high because at the end of the day, I still have urinary incontinence and am left to fend for myself without means to fend,” the woman wrote. “This is cruel and I am not the only one affected. We are trapped here with no help.” 
The steady stream of letters, each new arrival sounding more desperate than the last, suggested to Currie that the conditions inside Mississippi’s prisons, already condemned by federal officials, were worse than she imagined.

“When people are writing me letters begging me for treatment for health care needs it’s hard for me to just ignore it,” Currie said. “When they need a liver transplant from untreated Hep C or begging me for help with untreated HIV. When they beg me for supplies because they make them reuse colostomy bags over and over that don’t fit, when they are bowel and bladder incontinent and they don’t provide diapers to them it is hard for me to hear that (MDOC) feels that they provide adequate care.”
VitalCore told Mississippi Today it does not deny treatment and provides “comprehensive and competent health care services in accordance with prevailing standards of care.”
Kate Head, the corrections department spokesperson, said the care provided to inmates exceeds “constitutional standards,” and the department “denies any allegation” that inmates receive care below such standards. 
More money, more sickness
Currie was awarded chairmanship of the House Corrections Committee after the 2023 statewide election. She is a conservative Republican with no appetite for the decarceral aspirations of many prison-reform activists.  
With these conservative bona fides in mind, House leadership dispatched Currie to answer a question of government efficiency: Why were Mississippi’s inmates getting sicker even after the state continued increasing its spending on medical care for prisoners? Currie wanted to know why she had been receiving letters from inmates detailing an environment where sick prisoners got sicker even as the state spent more money to treat them.     
In the next fiscal year, Mississippi is set to spend over $121 million on prison medical services, a number that has been climbing for years. But there is little evidence that the money is being spent on providing quality care, Currie said. 
“In my investigations, very little health care is given. We have Hep C and HIV patients dying from no care. We have diabetics who have no possible way of treating their diabetes. High blood pressure inmates who end up on dialysis. Cancer patients are dying from lack of care. So it is obvious to me that this is a game they have played for some time.”
Untreated illness in facilities around the state prompted Currie to author a bill during the 2025 legislative session that would have directed the state Department of Health to conduct a sweeping review of the medical care for inmates at Mississippi prisons.
The legislation passed the House with a large bipartisan majority, but it didn’t survive negotiations with the Senate. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves wanted to hire an out-of-state firm to conduct the review instead of the Department of Health, Currie said.
Months later in the special legislative session for the state budget, the Legislature approved a $690,000 appropriation for MDOC to review its medical services, money that Currie said will go to a private firm. The report will be presented to legislative leaders by Dec. 15.
But Currie said a private out-of-state firm will not be able to infiltrate prisons and identify systemic issues the way a state entity such as the Department of Health could. Plus, it wouldn’t cost the state extra money.
“I am glad the governor is going to look into health care, but it will be a waste of taxpayers’ money not to find out the truth about health care, and the only way to do that is to talk to inmates,” Currie said. “Their problems will not be found in their medical chart.”
A spokesperson for Reeves did not respond to a request for comment. But in a late May press conference announcing the special session, Reeves said he inherited a corrections department that oversaw numerous deaths, and that the department made progress under his watch. He also joked that he would support moving the management of the troubled MDOC to the Lieutenant Governor’s or the House speaker’s office. 
“I made this offer publicly before. I make it privately regularly. I tell my friends in the Lieutenant Governor’s Office and the Speaker’s Office that if they have a problem with something going on at the Department of Corrections, that if they would like to sponsor a bill to move the management of corrections, I’d probably support it.”
Reeves appointed Cain to lead Mississippi’s corrections in 2020. A former warden of the notorious Angola State Prison in Louisiana, Cain’s controversial career has regularly garnered national headlines. He resigned his post in Louisiana in 2015 after allegations that he misused public funds, but he has denied wrongdoing and was later cleared in an investigation conducted by the state’s legislative auditor. 
Pulling the wool over lawmakers’ eyes
The apparent mismatch between increased government spending and stagnant or diminishing health outcomes among prisoners is hidden from public view, some experts say. 
Marcella Alsan and Crystal Yang, professors at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and Harvard Law School, have studied health care delivery in jails. They said the scale of death and sickness inside Mississippi’s prisons may fly under the statistical radar.
“Our research documents significant underreporting of deaths in custody within official statistics,” Alsan and Yang told Mississippi Today. “The issues uncovered within Mississippi prisons reveal poor management and an absence of clear standards of care, much like the jails in our study.” 
Stronger accreditation standards for correctional facilities can help tackle the “inefficiency dilemma” within correctional institutions, the professors said. 
For Currie, the problem lies with a legislative process that has allowed MDOC and VitalCore to use more taxpayer dollars without accounting for how the money is spent. 
“In the rushed special session where we had a self-imposed time limit to vote on a budget, the Department of Corrections and VitalCore pulled the wool over legislators’ eyes,” Currie said. “They act like we are spending more on inmates’ health care and these stupid legislators won’t ask questions. We swap money between health care and MDOC to make sure they get to spend or waste taxpayers’ money, and the Legislature doesn’t ask for any information supporting why they need more money.”
Without improved care and transparency around spending, she warned, prisoners will continue to languish with untreated illnesses with life-altering or fatal consequences. 
Susan Balfour, 63, echoed that sentiment. Balfour was incarcerated for 33 years at Central Mississippi Correctional Facility until her release in December 2021. Balfour said she was among a group of prisoners asked to clean the facility without protective equipment.
She was later diagnosed with terminal breast cancer, a condition that would have been identified earlier had she been provided medical screenings and treatment, according to a lawsuit Balfour filed in federal court.
“They ignored my pleas for help and let my cancer grow untreated for 10 years until it was terminal and too late,” Balfour said. “I never knew when I’d be seen after filing a medical request, and was always at their mercy. It’s like Mississippi is co-signing on their inhumane practices that prioritize corporate profits over people’s lives. Who do these public officials work for? And why are profits protected more than people?”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/17162611/MT-Prison-Health-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2025-06-19 05:59:44.551834

(Photo courtesy of Carnegie Mellon University)Edda Fields-Black was working on a book about rice plantations when she came across the story of a raid in Beaufort that freed more than 700 slaves from Lowcountry plantations.
The Carnegie Mellon University professor decided to pursue the story and, nearly a decade later, published “COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid, and Black Freedom During the Civil War,” which recently won the Pulitzer Prize for history.
Fields-Black first learned about the June 1863 raid reading an account by Minus Hamilton, who was an 88-year-old slave when the daring mission led by Tubman freed him. He told of how three steamships traveled up the river in the dead of night before sounding their whistles, sending slaves working on the neighboring plantations running to the river and to freedom.
Hamilton also talked about his awe at seeing fellow Black men in uniform for the first time, and that image struck Fields-Black.
“I was like, ‘Wow,’ and I tucked it away for a long time,” said Fields-Black, of Pittsburgh.
Fields-Black tried to read more about the raid Hamilton recounted. But she found little beyond mentions here and there in biographies of Tubman, who’s best known as a conductor on the Underground Railroad. So, she set out to write the history herself, telling it from the perspective of the raid’s participants and detailing the importance of the rice plantations in pulling it off, she said.
“I wanted to pull out all of those elements, and I thought that I could tell that story,” Fields-Black said.
“COMBEE,” the Gullah pronunciation of the Combahee River, won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize alongside “Native Nations: A Millennium in North American” by Kathleen DuVal in a category that rewards “a distinguished and appropriately documented book on the history of the United States,” according to the Pulitzer website.
The 776-page book told “a richly-textured and revelatory account” of the raid, “weaving military strategy and family history with the transition from bondage to freedom,” the prize’s jury wrote.
Harriet Tubman
Tubman, who became known as the Moses of Her People after escaping slavery herself in 1849, spoke about the Combahee River Raid during her life.
Her role in the raid made her the first woman ever to lead a major military operation in the U.S. and the only Black woman to lead troops during the Civil War. A statue of her unveiled in May 2024 at Beaufort’s Tabernacle Baptist Church commemorates her part in the raid and her years spent in Beaufort.
But historians, lacking official records, rarely delved into the details, Fields-Black said.
When she started telling friends and colleagues about her plans, they similarly insisted there was no way to tell the story from the perspective of enslaved people because no records of the raid existed. But they did exist — just not the kind most researchers rely on, she said.
“There’s a broader question about believing women, believing marginal people and taking our words and our descriptions of our own experiences at face value,” Fields-Black said. “And that hadn’t been done.”
The rice plantations, with their snakes and alligators, made Tubman’s work even more impressive. Other historians had written about the raid as if the environment were the same as in the more northern states where Tubman had worked, but as a researcher of rice fields, Fields-Black knew the specific challenges they presented.
“She could’ve been on the moon, and she would’ve figured out how to survive,” she said.
Finding the story
As she started to research in earnest, Fields-Black knew she couldn’t rely solely on the official military records of the raid, which were written by the Confederate troops controlling Beaufort at the time. Slave narratives from the 1930s mentioned the raid only in passing, and official records in Beaufort and Colleton counties were burned as cities went up in flames during the Civil War, she said.
Fields-Black turned instead to a lesser-used historical resource: pension files. Following the war, soldiers relayed information about themselves and their experiences in an attempt to receive payment from the government.
Among those submitting applications were members of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, a regiment consisting largely of freed men from the sea islands that drove boats up the Combahee River for enslaved people to board and escape.
Through scouring hundreds of pension files, Fields-Black came across a familiar name.
She had known about a Hector Fields from whom her family descended, but she had thought he lived in nearby Colleton County, not Beaufort. The pension files, however, told the story of Fields as a Civil War veteran who fought in the volunteer infantry, helped free slaves and eventually settled down in Colleton County, she said.
Fields-Black grew up in Florida, but she still has family in that area. Her own father was born in Green Pond, a small town in the same county, and the family’s roots in South Carolina are strong, she said.
The story “has become a source of immense pride in our family,” Fields-Black said.
Even after they were freed, many of the people in the raid returned to Confederate territory, risking their lives and freedom, to help others, she said. The raid itself happened after the Emancipation Proclamation, which had proclaimed all slaves in Southern states to be free.
But in Confederate-controlled areas, that wasn’t put into effect. The nation’s last slaves weren’t freed until two years later, on June 19, 1865, known as Juneteenth.
“It’s the actions of these folks that some would say, and I would agree with them, are even more important than, say, the Emancipation Proclamation in the demise of slavery and ending the institution of slavery,” Fields-Black said.

(Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)With summer officially kicking off on Friday, elected officials and worker advocates are pushing for more state legislation aimed to support people who have to work outside in the hot temperatures.
When a person’s body can’t bring their internal temperature down in these warm climates, it can lead to heat stroke or heat exhaustion. Heat stress is the leading cause of weather-related deaths and can exacerbate underlying illnesses including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health, and asthma, and can increase the risk of accidents and transmission of some infectious diseases, according to the World Health Organization.
“This is an urgent issue because this affects mainly low wage workers who often don’t have a choice but to go to work … under these extreme heat conditions to be able to make a living,” said Ramón Zepeda Ramos, Economic Justice Organizer of Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy.
Currently, there are no federal rules or statewide regulations of when outside workers should be allowed breaks or access to shade and water when temperatures rise. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is beginning public hearings about a rule proposed by former President Joe Biden’s administration that would trigger shade and water access requirements when the heat index reaches 80 degrees. Additionally, it would require 15 minute breaks every two hours when the heat index reaches 90 degrees.
Advocates said even with the OSHA hearing starting this week, the state needs to take action because OSHA can often take years to implement a rule and there is no clear idea if the current administration would implement such a rule. Also, with federal cuts likely to impact the agency, advocates feel it will be unlikely the rule will be put into effect even if it is passed.
“We can’t keep waiting for federal action that may never come. Every worker deserves dignity of safety, access to water, rest, and shade. Also the ability to speak up without fear,” said Manuel Gago, Worker Justice Program Director at the Legal Aid Justice Center.
According to the Virginia Department of Health, since May 1 of this year, over 400 people have been treated for heat-related illness. Heat impacts can often be difficult to identify so it is likely the true scope of patients with heat-related illnesses is underreported.
Two bills were introduced in the 2025 General Assembly session that looked to provide relief to workers who have to be exposed to the elements. House Bill 1980 and Senate Bill 1103, sponsored by Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, and Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, would have allowed workers impacted by the heat to collect damages of $1000, injunctive relief or both. Both bills were left in the Senate Finance Committee.
“It is a simple strategy that has worked for thousands of years across all of nature,”  Hernandez said in a statement. “Our approach to protecting workers is a novel, data driven approach that examines where workers in Virginia are facing the most risk and tailoring the rules to address those areas.”
The New York Times reported that in a Congressional hearing this week, opponents to the new rule claimed it could cause financial havoc on businesses and communities. Seven states have adopted their own heat protection rules for indoor and outdoor workers.

(Photo courtesy of Henrico County Public Schools)After a competitive application process, multiple school divisions and a regional technical center will receive $83.4 million in grants for school construction projects, a move the Virginia Board of Education approved on Wednesday.
A total of $80 million from the fiscal year 2025 application process will be allocated to 10 school divisions, including Lunenburg County for Central High School, the city of Richmond for Woodville Elementary School, and Massanutten Technical Center in Harrisonburg. The Petersburg High School project, which received $13 million towards the project’s $91 million total, was the only project that did not receive full funding.Petersburg missed out on an additional $13 million.
The remaining $3.4 million are reallocated funds collected by the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) because some school divisions canceled their projects in 2022 and 2024. The awards will go to schools in the counties of Pittsylvania and Giles and the city of Richmond.
The canceled projects totaled $8.8 million; $5.3 million of those funds will be transferred to grant processes in fiscal year 2026. 
VDOE said on Wednesday that it decided to carry over the funds because the grant application process for fiscal year 2025 was underway before the state’s budget was finalized.
“All of this work was already completed,” said Christina Berta, VDOE’s chief operating officer. “So, in order to give opportunity to other school divisions that is why we chose to make that decision to marry it with (2026) funding.” 
Applicants have also requested additional training and webinars on applying for construction grants, according to Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson. She said a handful of divisions “thought” they were complying with protocols, but ultimately did not receive funding.
“We’ve been stepping back just to make sure that we are as transparent and clear as possible going into this new fiscal year so that regardless of size or expertise at your division, it’s really clear from the school board member side as well as the leadership side at the division,” Gullickson said.
In 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and lawmakers established the School Construction Assistance Program, which is designed to fund school infrastructure projects.
VDOE reviewed 28 grant applications from 25 divisions and three regional career, technical, and education (CTE) programs to determine the grant recipients. The competitive applicant criteria focused on supporting school boards and regional CTE program governing boards that display “poor building conditions, commitment and need” for funding the construction, expansion, or modernization of public school buildings.
To qualify, schools and regional CTE programs must have projects that lack sufficient funding or financing to cover the full cost of the project, and are either in the local planning phase or already documented in an active local Capital Improvement Plan. 
Applications must also have construction projects that have not started.
Applications are then ​​awarded based on a tiered percentage of approved costs, capped at $100 million. Grant percentages are determined by a school’s local composite index, or a locality’s ability to pay for its own schools by assessing the local tax base.  
Lawmakers, including Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, have backed efforts to direct more funding to school construction projects. One measure that has failed multiple times is a proposal to allow localities to impose a 1% sales tax on school construction. 
Youngkin has vetoed similar measures, including one in March, after citing the state’s existing efforts to fund school construction and concerns over the bill’s impact on taxpayers.
Since 2019, Virginia has allowed nine localities — Charlotte, Gloucester, Halifax, Henry, Mecklenburg, Northampton, Patrick and Pittsylvania counties and the city of Danville — to implement a similar sales tax for school construction funding. Advocates argue it’s time to expand that authority statewide.

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)Cincinnati-based Bon Secours Mercy Health describes itself as a “ministry” that seeks to serve “the poor, dying and underserved.”
However, it’s one of two Ohio “nonprofit” hospital systems to face scrutiny from Congress over the huge amounts it’s raking in from a federal program meant to subsidize care for the poor.
It’s using some of that money to pay lavish salaries and buy stadium-naming rights. Meanwhile, it is reportedly boosting the bottom line by serving wealthy communities and neglecting poorer ones — an outcome that, if true, would directly counter the program’s intent.
In April, the U.S. Senate Health, Labor and Pensions Committee released the results of a years-long investigation it made into a federal program that has exploded over the past 15 years. Among the committee’s concerns was that there appeared to be few — if any — controls on the way hospitals, clinics, and contract pharmacies spend the billions they receive from the program.
And it singled out two Ohio-based hospital chains for special focus — Cleveland Clinic and Bon Secours Mercy Health.
“These hospitals were selected for this investigation as a result of media reports alleging abuse of the 340B Program, such as hospitals cutting services to underserved populations and expanding into affluent areas to increase reimbursement rates and subsequent revenue under the 340B Program,” the committee report said.
The committee’s findings about Cleveland Clinic, which received nearly $1 billion from the program over a 38-month period, are detailed here.

The report focused on Bon Secours Mercy Health because of media reports that it had gained 340B status from a hospital it owns in a poor, Black neighborhood in Richmond, Va. It steadily depleted resources at that hospital, while adding them at facilities in more affluent neighborhoods nearby, the reporting said.
Bon Secours Mercy Health didn’t respond to requests for comment. But observers said such conduct is likely happening elsewhere in the 50-hospital chain.
 Explosive growth

Intended to subsidize care for the needy, the 340B program has grown from $5 billion a year in 2010 to nearly $67 billion in 2023, and analysts say that growth is only accelerating.
The program works by requiring drugmakers to give deep discounts off of list prices for drugs to qualifying hospitals, clinics, and the pharmacies with which they contract. Those entities are then allowed to charge insurers and uninsured customers the full list price and pocket the difference.
The idea behind 340B was to help providers with a large share of uninsured and Medicaid patients make ends meet while they shoulder the cost of uncompensated and under-compensated care.
Cleveland Clinic claimed last month that the program has no impact on taxpayers. But Antonio Ciaccia, a Columbus-based drug-pricing analyst, said the program creates billions in higher costs for insurers and ultimately consumers.
After Congress created the Medicaid Prescription Drug Rebate Program in 1990, it created 340B in 1992, requiring drugmakers to give discounts to qualifying hospitals and clinics that were equal to the Medicaid rebates.
The program grew relatively slowly until passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, when rules changes allowed a lot more entities to qualify. It’s since grown by leaps and bounds and is now the second-largest federal prescription-drug program, behind only Medicare Part D.
Growing numbers of hospital systems have joined the 340B program through seemingly giant loopholes.
Cleveland Clinic, for example, doesn’t admit enough Medicaid and uninsured patients to qualify under the original 340B rules. But under a quirk in the new rules, it was allowed in as a “rural-referral center” even though it’s headquartered in the middle of a big city.
Rural referral centers have lower barriers to qualify and are the fastest-growing type of 340B hospitals. Possibly indicating abuse, by 2022, 82% of so-called “rural referral centers” were located in urban areas, as were 77% of their patients, according to the Berkeley Research Group, a consulting firm.
 Intended outcome?

Facilities owned by another Ohio-based group — Bon Secours Mercy Health — qualified another way. Its Richmond Community Hospital in Virginia is located in a low-income Black neighborhood in the city’s East End, where it qualifies as a federal “disproportionate share” hospital and thus for the 340B program.
However, the New York Times reported in 2022 Bon Secours Mercy Health hollowed out Richmond Community, closing its intensive care unit, its maternity ward, and other vital departments.
At the same time, it created legal connections between the hospital and other clinics it owned in wealthier parts of town so that they could get 340B drug discounts. In those facilities it could reap a greater percentage of the 340B benefit because more patients are privately insured. That’s because transactions involving Medicaid patients aren’t eligible for the discount.
The paper reported on the perverse outcome of Bon Secours Mercy Health’s practices: It stripped its hospital in a poor neighborhood of resources while it used money meant for it to build and renovate lavish facilities where few poor people went.
“Bon Secours was basically laundering money through this poor hospital to its wealthy outposts,” Dr. Lucas English, who worked at Richmond Community until 2018, told the Times. “It was all about profits.”
For participating hospitals, the profits can be huge.
Bon Secours Mercy Health collected $276 million in 340B benefits over a five-year period that ended in 2023, the Senate committee reported. That was just for the facilities that participate in 340B under Richmond Community’s designation — not those connected to any of the chain’s dozens of other hospitals that might separately be part of the 340B program.
 Questionable spending

Some critics who want to see reform say there must be greater controls over how money collected under the program is spent. As it is, there don’t appear to be any.
Bon Secours Mercy Health and Cleveland Clinic told Senate investigators that they simply put the money into their general revenue and don’t specifically account for it after that.
As tens of billions more flow each year into hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies that participate in 340B, some are accused of spending on things that have nothing to do with health care — much less health care for the poor.
Bon Secours and Cigna reach agreement, keeping 30,000 Virginians in-network

For example, how much New York University’s Langone Hospitals receive from the 340B program is not publicly available, but the number surely isn’t small. The system raised eyebrows when it spent an estimated $8 million advertising itself during the Super Bowl.
Bon Secours paid more than $4 million for the naming rights of a Greenville, S.C. sports arena, claiming it would produce better health outcomes for the community.
“We’ve truly used this collaboration to expand our reach beyond hospital walls and live out our mission of building healthier communities, which is why we are very excited to extend this partnership and continue working together to make a difference in our community for many years to come,” Mark Caldwell, an executive with the 340B hospital, said in a written statement.
How the community would be made healthier by the arena’s food and beverage offerings isn’t obvious.
“The arena proudly offers Carolina Smoke BBQ, Well Pressed and Swamp Dog food stands, Reedy River Roost (our in house fried chicken shop!), GVL Pizza, Moe’s Southwest Grill, Pepsi products, and a nice selection of craft beer, domestic beer, and wine,” says the arena’s website, which has a picture of a bartender pouring gin into a cup.
Mercy Health also held the naming rights to the Lake Erie Crushers baseball stadium in Avon, Ohio, until last year. Mercy Health Lorain Hospital, 12 miles away, is a 340B facility.
 Community benefit

Nonprofit hospitals receiving huge amounts from 340B aren’t just facing questions about whether they’re using those funds in the best interest of the poor and uninsured. Nonprofit hospitals generally have been coming under fire as analyses have shown that most are not providing community services that are commensurate with the huge tax breaks they enjoy.
Theoretically, institutions are given tax exemptions in exchange for providing community benefits, but in Ohio most nonprofit hospitals receive more than they give, according to a recent analysis.
The nonpartisan Lown Institute this year reported that Ohio’s nonprofit hospitals get $2.2 billion annually in tax breaks. Yet nearly three quarters (74%) of them provide less than that in community service, the report said.
That creates a $1.3 billion annual “fair share” deficit — the second-highest of the 20 states studied, the report said. Cleveland Clinic was the biggest offender in the state, with a $207 million annual deficit. That also qualified as the fifth-highest among any hospital in the 20 states, the report said.
Some of these “nonprofit” hospitals are also paying their top brass huge salaries. In the case of Bon Secours Mercy Health, CEO John Starcher Jr. made $8.8 million in reportable compensation in 2023 and an estimated $3.5 million more in “other compensation from the organization and related organizations,” the nonprofit’s IRS Form 990 says. The resulting $12.3 million is 176 times the median household income in Ohio.
The Economic Research Institute in 2022 put Starcher among the 10 highest-paid nonprofit CEOs in the country. The average nonprofit CEO made much less — just $152,199, the report said.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is pushing to reshape the federal housing safety net by slashing spending and shifting the burden of housing millions of people to states, which may be ill-equipped to handle the mission.
President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners

Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
Trump’s hopes for next year
The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Cities lead bans on algorithmic rent hikes as states lag behind

Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Stockton Williams, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Stockton wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” he wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

(Photo courtesy African American Library at The Gregory School, Houston Public Library)The United States’ newest federal holiday, celebrated annually on June 19, has quickly become its most puzzling one. Four years after President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Americans have wrestled with what to make of the holiday.
What is Juneteenth? What is the proper way to celebrate it? Should holiday observers attend barbecues and cookouts? Should Juneteenth’s observance be a day of learning? Is there a way to acknowledge the holiday without misappropriating it?
This confusion likely emerged because many Americans did not even learn about Juneteenth until around when it became a federal holiday in 2021. Moreover, the Trump administration and state legislatures across the country have further complicated matters with their increased efforts to ban the type of education that led to the national recognition of the holiday in the first place.
‘All slaves are free’
Juneteenth — short for June Nineteenth — recognizes the day in 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with roughly 2,000 federal troops from the 13th Army Corps. Upon arriving, Granger issued General Order No. 3. The order read:
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”
Granger’s order effectively freed 250,000 enslaved people in the region.
Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the enslaved in all the states that had seceded from the U.S., nearly 2½ years earlier, Texas, a Confederate state, rebelled against it.
At the time, Texas had a minimal number of Union soldiers to enforce the proclamation’s emancipation of enslaved people residing within Confederate territory. Consequently, many of those enslaved in Texas remained ignorant of the proclamation’s potential impact on their lives, or of the fact the Civil War had functionally ended two months earlier.
In an interview published in 1941, for example, Laura Smalley of Hempstead, Texas, remembered how her enslaver fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He returned without informing those whom he enslaved of their freedom. In her interview, she recounted, “Old master didn’t tell, you know, they was free … I think now they say they worked them, six months after that.”
‘Second Independence Day’
June 19, 1865, a Monday, changed that.
The news of emancipation culminated a generations-long struggle for Black people to obtain a modicum of freedom in the U.S.
For this reason, some refer to Juneteenth as the nation’s second Independence Day. The end of bondage was ostensibly codified in the 13th Amendment ratified later that year.
Spontaneous Juneteenth celebrations emerged almost immediately. Celebrants referred to the day as “Emancipation Day,” “Freedom Day,” “Juneteenth” and “Jubilee Day.” The latter title alluded to the biblical period following seven sabbatical cycles that resulted in canceling debts and freeing the enslaved.
Flake’s Bulletin, a weekly, Galveston-based publication, reported on an Emancipation Celebration occurring on Jan. 2, 1866, that included upward of 800 people. A similar gathering occurred in Galveston on June 19, 1866, in what is now the church known as Reedy Chapel AME. Annual celebrations continued, beginning in southeastern Texas, with events such as historical reenactments, parades, picnics, music and speeches.

Legacies of slavery
While the holiday marked a joyous occasion for some, Juneteenth met early and persistent opposition, particularly in the time following Reconstruction.
For years, local reporting spoke of Juneteenth, as the Galveston Historical Foundation put it, in a “flagrantly racist nature.” Additionally, the racist stereotyping – “idleness” – in the final sentence of Granger’s order simultaneously illustrated its complicated nature while also “[foreshadowing] that the fight for freedom would continue,” National Archives staffer Michael Davis wrote in 2020.
Historian Keisha Blain explains, “The enslavement of Black people in the U.S. may have ended but the legacies of slavery still shape every aspect of Black life.”
Advocates such as Opal Lee, commonly referred to as the “grandmother of Juneteenth,” pressed for Juneteenth celebration to continue and, ultimately, for it to be made a national holiday.
Lee began her advocacy in earnest during the mid-1970s in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. The oldest member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, Lee spearheaded several campaigns to draw attention to Juneteenth. These campaigns included initiatives such as an online petition promoting the holiday’s observance launched in 2019 that amassed 1.6 million signatures.
In speaking on the significance of Juneteenth, Lee said, “Freedom is for everyone. I think freedom should be celebrated from the 19th of June to the Fourth of July; however, none of us are free until we are all free. We are not free yet, and Juneteenth is a symbol of that.”

National recognition
Because of this advocacy, Juneteenth has grown from relatively obscure regional celebrations to, starting in 2021, a federal holiday.
The establishment of the holiday was the capstone of initiatives during the racial reckoning. Historians refer to the racial reckoning as the time period beginning in the summer of 2020 until the spring of the following year that witnessed heightened attention to America’s nagging history of racism.
This reckoning included the historic protests prompted by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.
During this time, numerous institutions, ranging from colleges and universities to major companies, made commitments to racial equity. The recognition of Juneteenth represented a symbolic means to honor those commitments.
In remarks marking his signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Biden said, “Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come.”
Backtracking on gains
But within a year, some had already begun to argue the nation had, as community organizer Braxton Brewington wrote, “betrayed the spirit of Jubilee Day.”
Many of the racial equity commitments made during the racial reckoning quickly vanished within a year or two. Economist William Michael Cunningham revealed American companies pledged $50 billion to racial equity efforts in 2020, yet had only spent $250 million by 2021.
By the spring of 2025, companies such as Walmart and McDonald’s announced they will discontinue their diversity, equity and inclusion work. Moreover, Walmart will stop using the term altogether. Amazon, Meta and dozens of other large corporations made similar announcements.
And members of the Trump administration have mounted continual attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and used the term as a politically expedient slur to deride Black people. This is also exacerbated by the Trump administration’s challenges to birthright citizenship, a key right that gave citizenship to the formerly enslaved and later guaranteed important rights to the entire populace.
This major shift has fueled arguments that the U.S. has regressed from efforts toward racial equity and thus undermined the meaning of Juneteenth. And such backtracking arguably makes some Juneteenth celebrations performative exercises rather than celebrations of true racial equity.
As one critic asked, has the holiday devolved “into an exploitative and profit-driven enterprise for companies that disregard the true significance of this day to the Black community?”
All of this has led to increasing confusion over how to commemorate Juneteenth, if at all. Juneteenth is not the first federal holiday with a complicated history. Nevertheless, with other complex holidays, Americans had years to process their misgivings. In short, the nation is still deciding what it means to be free.

An advocacy group is trying to pressure the state’s Republican U.S. senators to vote against it.
Republican lawmakers in D.C. and Columbus are hashing out budgets. As they do, they’re looking for ways to cut spending to finance tax cuts weighted heavily toward the wealthy.
The reconciliation bill — President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” — passed by the U.S. House of Representatives would provide about would cut taxes by more than $3 trillion and give 70% of the money to the richest 10% according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
At the state level, Policy Matters Ohio said that a flat-tax proposal passed by the Ohio Senate would cost the state $1.1 billion a year and give 96% of the benefit to the state’s top 20% of income earners.
Some Republicans at both levels also have plans to make deep cuts to the social safety net.
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute last week published an issue brief saying that cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act marketplace would result in a $1 trillion loss in health spending for poor and working people. Ohio alone would lose $31 billion as part of that, the analysis said. 
The Medicaid cuts would cost Ohio’s hospitals $9.5 billion — and they’d have to shoulder more uncompensated care as more Ohioans would become uninsured. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would create 16 million more uninsured Americans by 2034.
Study: Ohio among hardest hit if Congress, Trump cut Medicaid

“The Medicaid cuts Congress is considering would be the largest funding reduction in the program’s history, and it is hard to overstate just how devastating the impacts would be,” Katherine Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said in a written statement. “Such drastic changes to Medicaid financing would have ripple effects that go well beyond people covered by the program, further squeezing hospitals, limiting access to care for entire communities, and destabilizing state and local economies.”
Significant federal funding cuts to Medicaid would be particularly hard on Ohioans. Gov. Mike DeWine’s proposed budget has a provision that would end the state’s 11-year-old Medicaid expansion. That would cost 770,000 Ohioans — most of whom are working — their health coverage.
The Commonwealth Fund in May said the Buckeye State would be one of the five hardest hit by the proposed cuts. And they would come at a critical time, the organization said in a report released Wednesday. 
Ohio ranked 30th overall for health system performance. It scored particularly badly in terms of infant mortality, preventable hospitalizations, and mortality disparities between Black and other Ohioans.
Not only would Republican spending proposals slash health funding for lower-income Americans, it would decimate food assistance for the poorest. 
“The House-passed Republican reconciliation plan would cut nearly $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through 2034, based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates — by far the largest cut to SNAP in history,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote in May. 
“As a result of these cuts and other policies in the legislation — which are being used to pay partly for trillions in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy — millions of people would lose some or all of the food assistance they need to afford groceries, when many low-income households are struggling to afford the high cost of food and other basic needs.” 
If those proposed cuts become reality, Ohio’s foodbanks won’t able to ameliorate the hunger they create, the executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks said earlier this month.

Tax cuts weighted toward the wealthiest and cuts in benefits to the most vulnerable have the group Families Over Billionaires trying to put pressure on Republican senators to vote no on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. As part of a seven-state, $5 million buy, a commercial went up in Ohio this week.
“We sent Senators (Bernie) Moreno and (Jon) Husted to Washington to lower costs,” the narrator says. “So now that they’re in charge, what are they doing about it? They’re kicking 16 million people off of health care, taking food from 18 million kids, and driving costs through the roof for 80 million families. All to give the super-rich a $250,000 tax cut while your costs go up. They pay less and you pay more. That’s the billionaire tax scam. Tell your senators to vote no.”
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that 16 million would lose health coverage under the Republican plan. The Urban Institute estimates that 18.3 million children would lose food assistance. Economists widely expect Trump’s tariffs — taxes on imports — to cause significant inflation. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that the 1% of wealthiest households would get an average annual tax cut of $250,000.

Kelly Ayotte, banning cell phone use in schools has been a day one priority. “Screens are negatively impacting our learning environments, drawing students’ attention away from their classes, and becoming a barrier for teachers to do their jobs,” she told lawmakers during her inaugural address in January. “No more.”  It’s an idea that […]","New Hampshire lawmakers have until 4 p.m. Thursday to craft a final deal on a school phone ban. (Getty Images)For Gov. Kelly Ayotte, banning cell phone use in schools has been a day one priority.
“Screens are negatively impacting our learning environments, drawing students’ attention away from their classes, and becoming a barrier for teachers to do their jobs,” she told lawmakers during her inaugural address in January. “No more.” 
It’s an idea that has gained traction across the country recently in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a wave of learning loss and socialization issues in schools, and a broader push to reduce children’s screen time. And for a while, it appeared that Ayotte’s desired ban might sail through the Legislature.
But in the final days of the 2025 legislative session, the Senate and House are facing disagreements over how the state should best do that.
On one side is the House’s proposal to require school districts to adopt policies banning the use of cell phones for the entire duration of the school day, a policy known as “bell to bell.”
That version, attached as an amendment to Senate Bill 206, is closest to what the governor suggested in her budget proposal back in February, although the House took out the $1 million in state grant funding Ayotte had devoted to help schools buy materials to implement the policy. 
On the other side is the Senate’s suggestion: to require school boards to adopt cell phone restriction policies, but to give them the freedom to craft one of their choosing.
Lawmakers have until 4 p.m. Thursday to craft a final deal, and Ayotte has sought to increase the pressure to approve the House’s more prescriptive approach.
On Tuesday morning, the governor’s office released a statement from author Jonathan Haidt that praised the House’s version of the law. Haidt, a social psychologist, wrote the 2024 book “The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness,” and has been credited with inspiring other states’ cell phone ban legislation.
“I am thrilled to see New Hampshire taking amongst the strongest efforts in the nation to protect our children’s futures in considering NH SB 206,” Haidt said in the statement. “New Hampshire’s policy mandating bell-to-bell device separation will help bring conversation and laughter back to the hallways of schools across the state.”
Haidt and others argue the proliferation of smart phones has increased mental health problems among adolescents, stunted their social and emotional development, and created deep distractions in the classroom that have contributed to lower proficiency scores measured in tests such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress. 
As of May, 26 states have passed laws regulating cell phone usage in schools, and 17 of them did so in 2025, according to the Associated Press. Ten of those states have passed bell-to-bell bans for the entire school day; others include midday breaks or other exceptions. 
In New Hampshire, few lawmakers dispute that action over cell phones is needed. But some in the Senate say school districts should have flexibility over how to craft their policies, and should do so with input from their constituent parents.
“It’s limiting the use of cell phones, and it’s giving tools to the districts to do so,” said Sen. Donovan Fenton, a Keene Democrat, in an interview. “Some schools ban it completely. Some schools say, ‘No, you have to talk to the principal or your teacher.’ Some schools have zones where … (students) can check their cell phones. I think it’s up to the districts to decide that.” 
The original Senate bill would have required school districts to craft “a policy for personal device use by students during the school day and be implemented school-wide, with approved exceptions determined by student medical, disability, or language proficiency need.” The policy would have to be created in collaboration with teachers and parents, the Senate bill states.
The House attached an amendment that would also require collaboration with teachers and parents. But the House amendment states that the policy “shall prohibit all personal communication device use by students from when the first bell rings to start instructional time until the dismissal bell rings to end the academic school day, with approved exceptions determined by the superintendent or their designee with respect to student medical, disability, or language proficiency need.”
Rep. Glenn Cordelli, a Tuftonboro Republican and the chairman of the Education Policy and Administration Committee, says the Legislature should be more decisive and give districts little wiggle room.
“We think that with all the discussion about mental health in the schools and anxiety, depression and issues about screen time, that there has to be a bell-to-bell policy in the schools in the state,” Cordelli said in an interview, speaking for himself and fellow House negotiators. “We can’t have one policy in one district and one policy in another district.”
Fenton disagrees, arguing that a top-down state mandate would prevent schools from developing policies with reasonable exceptions and accommodations. The House’s amendment would exempt the cell phone ban from applying to “students with medical needs, such as insulin pumps and glucose sensors, or disabilities from using a device to support their learning as identified by their individualized education program.”
“I think the governor is too willing to go to the extreme too fast,” he said. 
As a father of a child entering first grade, Fenton said he supports limits on cell phone use, but would worry if his son had no access to his phone throughout the day when he’s older.
“I think it makes you far more nervous if you can’t reach your child,” he said. 
The New Hampshire School Boards Association has joined the call for a state law limiting cell phone use, but it has not taken a position on whether the House or Senate version is ideal.
To Barrett Christina, the president of the association, a state law could help school teachers, administrators, and school board members enforce a cell phone ban without taking as much heat from students and parents.
“We support the general policy of having restrictions in law relative to cell phone use or personal electronic communication devices if for no other reason than it gives school districts some cover to point to the law, when getting parents to come around on the issue,” Christina said. 
And Christina added that whatever law gets passed — whether the flexible or the rigid version — school boards and school district officials will need to proceed with as much interaction and consultation with parents as possible.
“The biggest issue, whatever comes out of this, is going to be the parental buy-in and educating and teaching to parents about what the policy says — why it’s being implemented,” he said. “… We certainly understand and respect the needs and desires of parents and children to communicate among the family from time to time for a variety of reasons.” 
For her part, Ayotte has been clear that a more aggressive policy is needed. “We have the opportunity to make our schools an even better place to learn, and I urge the Legislature to meet the moment and pass a bell-to-bell ban on cell phones in schools,” she said in a statement Monday. 
A final resolution is expected Thursday, when House and Senate negotiators will meet again at 2 p.m. in State House Room 100 to work on a final agreement. Fenton predicted Ayotte would use the time to try to convince senators that her approach is better.
“The governor’s going very heavy-handed into this,” Fenton said. “And I think there are some people on both sides of the aisle that don’t agree.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/phonesstudent-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-19 05:59:44.551834

And at such a moment, it’s imperative that all Americans – and especially our elected leaders – disavow violence or even the appearance of endorsing it.
And it’s in light of this that Wake County State Rep. Julie von Haefen was clearly in error recently for briefly posting an image on social media of a protester’s sign that portrayed a guillotine and a head resembling President Trump.
To her credit, though, von Haefen quickly realized her mistake, took down the image, and publicly apologized. Would that the conservative politicians attacking her in the aftermath of the incident would do likewise.
Indeed, that should start with Trump himself, who both as a candidate and president, has made violent imagery and threats targeting his opponents a central part of his speeches for years.
The bottom line: Emotions can run high in politics and sometimes people get carried away. Rep. von Haefen learned this lesson the hard way. Her honest admission and pledge to do better should inspire leaders of all parties to follow suit.

State Reps. Dontavius Jarrells, D-Columbus, and Veronica Sims, D-Akron, are working on a joint resolution that would remove slavery from the state’s foundational document.
“This isn’t political,” Jarrells said Wednesday during an Ohio Legislative Black Caucus press conference. “This isn’t personal. This is a moral overdue journey to change our constitution once and for all. Other states have already done it. We simply want Ohio to live up to this promise of freedom.”

The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for being convicted of a crime. The Ohio Constitution currently says “There shall be no slavery in this state; nor involuntary servitude, unless for the punishment of crime.” 
Seven states have removed the slavery loophole from their constitution — Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Utah, Colorado, and Nebraska, according to the Abolish Slavery National Network. 
“I submit that slavery and or involuntary servitude in any shape, form or fashion, should be disembodied from the sacred pages of the founding document of our great state,” Sims said. “It is time to remove any exception under any circumstances, slavery is a vile, despicable imposition upon another human being.”
This is not the first time there have been legislative attempts in Ohio to remove slavery from the state’s constitution. Jarrells had a bipartisan joint resolution that was unable to get out of committee during the last General Assembly. A Senate Joint Resolution was also unsuccessful back in 2020. 
If the House and Senate pass the new joint resolution, it would go to the statewide ballot for the voters to decide. 
Wednesday’s press conference was hosted by members of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus in honor of Juneteenth, a federal holiday Thursday remembering the end of slavery in the United States on June 19, 1865 — two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. 
“Juneteenth signifies the end of slavery, and it’s a time to celebrate,” said State Rep. Terrence Upchurch, D-Cleveland. “Although we are proud of the progress we have made, that does not negate the fact that there are still several challenges Black Ohioans face across the state. People are still struggling with finding housing, healthy foods, good paying jobs, satisfactory education, fair treatment in the justice system, and so much more.” 
Jarrells introduced House Bill 306 last month, also known as the Enact the Hate Crime Act. 
“It empowers victims with real civil remedies and gives law enforcement clear, enforceable tools to hold perpetrators accountable,” he said. “This bill says that every single person in this state deserves to live without fear, and if you are targeted for who you are, this state will stand with you.”
State Rep. Darnell T. Brewer, D-Cleveland, talked about recent gun legislation he is working on. 
“Gun violence is devastating our communities,” he said. “We can no longer afford to be silent or inactive.”
Black youth are 11 times more likely to die from firearm homicide than their white peers, according to Brady: United Against Gun Violence. 
Brewer said he plans on introducing a resolution to encourage responsible gun ownership by promoting safe storage practices to prevent children from accessing guns and a resolution on safe firearm storage education. 
“Gun violence is not just an emergency,” he said. “It’s a daily reality.”
Infant mortality, when a child dies before their first birthday, is higher for Black babies compared to white babies. The national infant mortality rate is 5.5 per 1,000 live births for babies and 10.9 for Black babies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The infant mortality rate for Ohio Black babies in 2022 was 13.4 per 1,000 live births.
“Why do we stop caring about babies after they’re born?” State Rep. Derrick Hall, D-Akron, asked.
State Rep. Ismail Mohamed, D-Columbus, talked about House Bill 281, a bill that would withhold Medicaid funding from hospitals that do not cooperate with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. State Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., introduced the bill last month. 
“What this bill does is essentially force medical providers to choose between honoring your oath as medical providers or complying with the state’s political agenda,” Mohamed said. “It will discourage immigrant communities from seeking life saving treatment care out of fear.” 
Mohamed also talked about House Bill 1, a piece of legislation that would place restrictions on foreign ownership of land. State Reps. Angie King, R-Celina, and Roy Klopfenstein, R-Haviland, introduced the bill earlier this year. 
“It is arbitrary,” Mohamed said. “It is discriminatory in its face, and will negatively impact economic development in the state of Ohio.”

The intricate circuitry and components highlight the precision and complexity of modern technology, ideal for electronics and artificial intelligence.Ohio Senators saw the first pushback on a proposal establishing new rules restricting the use of artificial intelligence to create pornography, particularly images depicting minors. An organization made up of tech company leaders argue the bill’s intent is good, but they worry it could hamper their business.
The proposal and the opponent
Senate Bill 163 updates state obscenity laws to include an “artificially generated depiction.” The sponsors argue bad actors could evade prosecution for child sexual abuse material, or CSAM, if the images in their possession are made with AI.
Notably, the bill restricts this definition to depictions of an actual person. In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down as over broad a law prohibiting what “appears to be” obscene images of minors.
In addition to prohibiting AI-produced porn involving minors, the bill also bars several uses of AI to conduct identity fraud. That includes using deepfake porn as well as any other depiction intended to harm another person’s reputation. But it goes further — extending to fabricating a person’s image or voice to elicit a financial decision, for instance.
The group TechNet is made up of executives in the tech industry including several companies deeply invested in artificial intelligence. The organization didn’t send a representative to testify against the bill in person, but it did submit several objections to the measure as written.
The broad contours are familiar to many recent debates about emerging technology: don’t hold us liable for our users’ actions and don’t dictate our response to rapidly changing technology.
Backers urge Ohio lawmakers to pass AI restrictions

TechNet’s critique
TechNet was at pains to insist it supports lawmakers’ efforts to respond to fabricated imagery.
“We appreciate the committee’s efforts to address the challenges posed by deceptive media and believe that it is crucial to establish clear standards and protections in this evolving landscape — especially given the absence of federal law,” its testimony read.
As initially drafted, the Senate bill required a watermark on artificially generated media. TechNet argued tools for determining “content provenance” are good but objected the bill’s approach.
“Standardized, industrywide specifications are still emerging,” TechNet argued, “and it is important Ohio maintains a flexible approach that can align with best practice.”
Watermarks are “rigid” and “easily removed” the group insisted — putting markers in metadata makes more sense. Wednesday, the bill’s co-sponsor, state Sen. Louis Blessing, R-Colerain Twp., amended the measure. The change redefines watermark as “data embedded within an AI-generated product.” The amendment also clarified the bill is focused on generative AI.
When it comes to distribution of CSAM, the group argued its members are already working with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. The group wants to ensure those efforts don’t “erroneously lead to liability.”
“We also recommend language making clear that liability should be squarely on the bad actor: the person creating, viewing, promoting, or distributing CSAM,” the group wrote.
As for broader protections of a person’s likeness, TechNet sought to distance its members from culpability. It depicted its members as “intermediaries” who “cannot see the content traversing over their networks and platforms.”
TechNet also pushed back forcefully on allowing anyone to file lawsuits for violations. That provision, “can lead to a flood of opportunistic lawsuits that burden courts, create legal uncertainty, and stifle innovation,” the group argued. Instead, the “sole enforcement” authority should rest with the Attorney General.
Where things stand
Although his amendment seems to push the bill closer to TechNet’s metadata suggestion, Blessing said he doesn’t believe it would bring the organization on board. He expressed frustration with the group’s opposition to allowing anyone to file a lawsuit. Unsurprisingly, Blessing said, there’s strong support within his party’s caucus to go after child pornography and identity fraud.
But if the provision allowing private lawsuits gets removed, “in a very large way, it guts the bill,” he argued.
“I have seen this time and time again in other states, in other bills,” Blessing said. “If you can sort of create a bottleneck in the AG’s office, you now have basically regulatory capture.”
“All the AG’s office has to do to help TechNet is to literally do nothing,” he added.

(Getty Images)In September 1864, in the midst of the Civil War, something remarkable happened in Leavenworth.
A group of Jewish residents — many of them immigrants — gathered with Col. Champion Vaughan of the 4th Kansas Cavalry and Christian community leaders, including pastors and judges, to dedicate the first synagogue in Kansas. They toasted religious liberty, trial by jury and President Abraham Lincoln, who had less than two years earlier issued the Emancipation Proclamation. One speaker declared that the Jewish people across the world would “hold him in grateful remembrance for all time.”
Today, the congregation no longer exists. The former synagogue, B’nai Jeshurun, was sold and converted into apartments in 1974. Its founding date is often misremembered — even on the historical marker — as having taken place in 1866. But newspaper archives confirm the dedication occurred two years earlier, in September 1864.
That error may explain why the true story of this groundbreaking Kansas congregation, and the spirited public debate it sparked, has remained hidden for so long.
The story began not just with goodwill, but with a controversy. In June 1864, a Methodist minister in Leavenworth, Rev. Daniel P. Mitchell, criticized local Christians who had donated to support the construction of a Jewish house of worship. He claimed from the pulpit — and later in a published letter titled “A Hebrew on the Hebrews” — that no Christian could morally support what he considered a false religion.
Judaism, in his view, was a “bad moral cause,” comparable to a stillhouse or gambling hall. He argued that generosity, if not tied to promoting Christ, was meaningless.
His remarks prompted a powerful public reply in the Leavenworth Bulletin, signed only “HEBREW.” The Jewish writer accused the minister of sectarian bigotry and defended the growing synagogue as a place that would provide education, reduce vice, and inspire civic virtue.
He challenged the pastor directly: “We don’t think as Mr. M. thinks — so we are morally wrong.” He then called for charity, pluralism, and the freedom of conscience guaranteed in a democratic society. “Any true Christian,” he wrote, “will feel glad to see his fellow citizens enabled to worship God according to the dictates of their conscience.”
The writer also asserted that actions — not creeds — should define moral character. Quoting, “By their fruits shall ye know them,” he offered to publicly defend Judaism against the minister’s attacks and framed the synagogue as a moral anchor for a frontier town, not a threat.
When the dedication finally came in September, it was not a quiet or defensive affair. The synagogue’s founding celebration lasted into the night, complete with music, speeches, and dinner. The published list of toasts offers a rare glimpse into the spirit of the moment. One toast honored “our friends who have nobly assisted us in our work,” another celebrated the virtue of charity and another still praised “The mothers and daughters of Israel.”
Vaughan toasted the free press. And Henry Sykes, a member of B’nai Jeshurun, responding to a toast to “The President,” honored Lincoln as a liberator. “The Jewish people,” he said, “would hold him in grateful remembrance for all time” for his Emancipation Proclamation.
This was a moment of convergence: Jewish and Christian, immigrant and citizen, sacred and civic. In the middle of the most brutal war in our country’s history, Kansans came together to bless a building — and in doing so, to bless the fragile pluralism of American democracy.
That building no longer functions as a house of prayer. In April 1974, just months before its closure, the congregation welcomed a group, United Methodist Women, for a synagogue tour. Still, B’nai Jeshurun was a place of hospitality and interfaith friendship. The spirit of that 1864 gathering still speaks.
The Jewish writer who sparred with Mitchell never signed his full name. He did not seek credit or praise. What he wanted — what he insisted on — was dignity. The dignity to worship freely. The dignity to be seen as a moral equal. The dignity of belonging, not just in faith, but in Kansas civic life.
Today, as Jewish institutions face rising threats and other faith communities worry about their place in public life, the story of B’nai Jeshurun’s founding is more than a historical footnote. It is a reminder that religious freedom is not just a constitutional ideal. It is a lived tradition: sometimes fragile, sometimes challenged, but always worth defending.
In 1864, Kansas didn’t just tolerate its Jewish community. It toasted it.
Let’s remember it.

The United States’ newest federal holiday, celebrated annually on June 19, has quickly become its most puzzling one. Four years after President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Americans have wrestled with what to make of the holiday.
What is Juneteenth? What is the proper way to celebrate it? Should holiday observers attend barbecues and cookouts? Should Juneteenth’s observance be a day of learning? Is there a way to acknowledge the holiday without misappropriating it?
This confusion likely emerged because many Americans did not even learn about Juneteenth until around when it became a federal holiday in 2021. Moreover, the Trump administration and state legislatures across the country have further complicated matters with their increased efforts to ban the type of education that led to the national recognition of the holiday in the first place.
 ‘All slaves are free’

Juneteenth – short for June Nineteenth – recognizes the day in 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with roughly 2,000 federal troops from the 13th Army Corps. Upon arriving, Granger issued General Order No. 3. The order read:
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”

  The official handwritten record of General Order No. 3, preserved at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. (Photos from the National Archives.)
Granger’s order effectively freed 250,000 enslaved people in the region.
Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the enslaved in all the states that had seceded from the U.S., nearly 2½ years earlier, Texas, a Confederate state, rebelled against it.
At the time, Texas had a minimal number of Union soldiers to enforce the proclamation’s emancipation of enslaved people residing within Confederate territory. Consequently, many of those enslaved in Texas remained ignorant of the proclamation’s potential impact on their lives, or of the fact the Civil War had functionally ended two months earlier.
In an interview published in 1941, for example, Laura Smalley of Hempstead, Texas, remembered how her enslaver fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He returned without informing those whom he enslaved of their freedom. In her interview, she recounted,
“Old master didn’t tell, you know, they was free … I think now they say they worked them, six months after that.”
 ‘Second Independence Day’

June 19, 1865, a Monday, changed that.
The news of emancipation culminated a generations-long struggle for Black people to obtain a modicum of freedom in the U.S.
For this reason, some refer to Juneteenth as the nation’s second Independence Day. The end of bondage was ostensibly codified in the 13th Amendment ratified later that year.
Spontaneous Juneteenth celebrations emerged almost immediately. Celebrants referred to the day as “Emancipation Day,” “Freedom Day,” “Juneteenth” and “Jubilee Day.” The latter title alluded to the biblical period following seven sabbatical cycles that resulted in canceling debts and freeing the enslaved.
Flake’s Bulletin, a weekly, Galveston-based publication, reported on an Emancipation Celebration occurring on Jan. 2, 1866, that included upward of 800 people. A similar gathering occurred in Galveston on June 19, 1866, in what is now the church known as Reedy Chapel AME. Annual celebrations continued, beginning in southeastern Texas, with events such as historical reenactments, parades, picnics, music and speeches.

 Legacies of slavery

While the holiday marked a joyous occasion for some, Juneteenth met early and persistent opposition, particularly in the time following Reconstruction.
For years, local reporting spoke of Juneteenth, as the Galveston Historical Foundation put it, in a “flagrantly racist nature.” Additionally, the racist stereotyping – “idleness” – in the final sentence of Granger’s order simultaneously illustrated its complicated nature while also “[foreshadowing] that the fight for freedom would continue,” National Archives staffer Michael Davis wrote in 2020.
Historian Keisha Blain explains, “The enslavement of Black people in the U.S. may have ended but the legacies of slavery still shape every aspect of Black life.”
Advocates such as Opal Lee, commonly referred to as the “grandmother of Juneteenth,” pressed for Juneteenth celebration to continue and, ultimately, for it to be made a national holiday.
Lee began her advocacy in earnest during the mid-1970s in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. The oldest member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, Lee spearheaded several campaigns to draw attention to Juneteenth. These campaigns included initiatives such as an online petition promoting the holiday’s observance launched in 2019 that amassed 1.6 million signatures.
In speaking on the significance of Juneteenth, Lee said, “Freedom is for everyone. I think freedom should be celebrated from the 19th of June to the Fourth of July; however, none of us are free until we are all free. We are not free yet, and Juneteenth is a symbol of that.”
 National recognition

Because of this advocacy, Juneteenth has grown from relatively obscure regional celebrations to, starting in 2021, a federal holiday.
The establishment of the holiday was the capstone of initiatives during the racial reckoning. Historians refer to the racial reckoning as the time period beginning in the summer of 2020 until the spring of the following year that witnessed heightened attention to America’s nagging history of racism.
This reckoning included the historic protests prompted by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.
During this time, numerous institutions, ranging from colleges and universities to major companies, made commitments to racial equity. The recognition of Juneteenth represented a symbolic means to honor those commitments.
In remarks marking his signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Biden said, “Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come.”
 Backtracking on gains

But within a year, some had already begun to argue the nation had, as community organizer Braxton Brewington wrote, “betrayed the spirit of Jubilee Day.”
Many of the racial equity commitments made during the racial reckoning quickly vanished within a year or two. Economist William Michael Cunningham revealed American companies pledged $50 billion to racial equity efforts in 2020, yet had only spent $250 million by 2021.
By the spring of 2025, companies such as Walmart and McDonald’s announced they will discontinue their diversity, equity and inclusion work. Moreover, Walmart will stop using the term altogether. Amazon, Meta and dozens of other large corporations made similar announcements.
And members of the Trump administration have mounted continual attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and used the term as a politically expedient slur to deride Black people. This is also exacerbated by the Trump administration’s challenges to birthright citizenship, a key right that gave citizenship to the formerly enslaved and later guaranteed important rights to the entire populace.
This major shift has fueled arguments that the U.S. has regressed from efforts toward racial equity and thus undermined the meaning of Juneteenth. And such backtracking arguably makes some Juneteenth celebrations performative exercises rather than celebrations of true racial equity.
As one critic asked, has the holiday devolved “into an exploitative and profit-driven enterprise for companies that disregard the true significance of this day to the Black community?”
All of this has led to increasing confusion over how to commemorate Juneteenth, if at all. Juneteenth is not the first federal holiday with a complicated history. Nevertheless, with other complex holidays, Americans had years to process their misgivings. In short, the nation is still deciding what it means to be free.

While on her way home from a coworking space in Denver last year, Colorado state Rep. Jenny Willford says she was sexually assaulted by her Lyft driver.
In her lawsuit filed against Lyft in January, Willford alleges she was “subjected to unwelcome, nonconsensual sexual contact, touching” and lewd comments during the ride.
Willford was picked up by a different driver than the person identified in the Lyft app, according to the suit.
Her experience — and those that other survivors shared with her after hearing her story — prompted Willford, a Democrat, to introduce legislation this year that aimed to require safety measures for both riders and drivers using ridesharing apps.
“In my mind, all of these things are very basic when it comes to safety,” Willford said. “They’re just so common sense that it’s been really disheartening and frustrating to me that Uber … threatened to leave the state if the bill becomes law.”
Her bill would have required rideshare companies to conduct more regular background checks for drivers, to create a program for passengers or drivers who want to audio or video record their rides and to develop other safety policies.
But following Uber’s threats to leave the state if the measure passed, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis vetoed it in late May. The bill would jeopardize rideshare services in Colorado “to an untenable degree, and could very well lead to companies that Coloradans rely on exiting the market, raising prices, or reducing the number of drivers,” his veto letter said.
Colorado isn’t alone. State and city leaders across the country are looking for ways to make rideshares safer. But lobbying campaigns from Uber and Lyft in many cases are blocking legislation meant to strengthen protections for both drivers and passengers.
Rideshare drivers win more benefits, protections despite industry pushback

Uber and Lyft, the two companies that dominate the U.S. rideshare industry, argue they have sufficient safety features within their apps.
“At Uber, we put safety at the heart of our operations, using technology, transparency, and accountability to help protect riders, drivers, and the broader community, with robust background checks and safety features like Audio and Video Recording, the Emergency Button, PIN verification, and RideCheck,” Uber wrote in a statement to Stateline.
“We remain committed to this work, and to dialogue with bill sponsors on sensible policies that keep people safe while protecting privacy and access.”
But there’s still a gap in regulations for rideshare companies because of their evolving technologies, said Lorena Roque, the interim director of education, labor and worker justice at The Center for Law and Social Policy, a left-leaning anti-poverty advocacy organization.
“Working on an app-based platform — like with delivery workers and rideshare workers —that sort of work is relatively new, so there’s not a clear standard,” Roque said.
Uber and Lyft are employing lobbyists at the state and local levels. In Rhode Island, another state where legislators are pushing rideshare safety bills that the companies have objected to, Uber is on pace to spend $50,000 this year on lobbyists, according to the state’s lobbying database. Lyft has been spending $5,000 monthly on lobbyists in Rhode Island.

Across the country, Uber and Lyft have testified against measures in state legislative hearings and city council meetings. In Colorado’s case, a number of officials representing Uber spoke out against Willford’s legislation at committee hearings, while Lyft sent a letter to Gov. Polis urging him to veto it. Jerry Golden, Lyft’s chief policy officer, wrote in the letter that the legislation’s requirements “ignore and ultimately will not improve conditions for riders and drivers.”
Uber told the state Senate it would be “impossible” for rideshare companies to comply with the bill’s requirements immediately upon approval and that the  audio and video requirement is “not possible to enforce.”
“The intention of my legislation was never to drive out Uber or Lyft,” Willford said. “The intention was always to require a higher level of accountability and safety from them. But we can’t do that if they’re going to throw tantrums and pick up their toys and go home every time somebody asks them to do better.”
 Safety for passengers

As a part of Lyft’s safety measures, drivers must complete annual background checks and mandatory driver safety education. The app is also programmed to check in with riders when drivers take long stops or deviate from the route they were assigned.
Uber conducts periodic criminal screenings for all active drivers and requires drivers to regularly verify their identity by sharing a selfie with Uber using the app. Both companies offer live emergency assistance to riders.
Between 2020 and 2022, Lyft reported 23 fatal physical assaults of people using the Lyft platform and 2,651 instances of the five most serious categories of sexual assault, according to its 2024 Safety Transparency Report. While incidents of sexual assault had decreased 21% since the last report, which covered 2017-2019, fatal physical assaults jumped by 185%.
Uber saw 36 physical assault fatalities in 2021 and 2022 and 2,717 incidents of the most serious categories of sexual assault, according to the company’s most recent safety report. Despite a 22% decline in sexual assault and misconduct, there was an increase in fatal physical assaults since its 2019-2020 report.
State lawmakers in several states have tried to address rideshare safety concerns with varying degrees of success.
Pending legislation in New Jersey and Massachusetts aims to prevent sexual assault and misconduct against passengers.
The New Jersey measure would require rideshare companies to share information concerning sexual misconduct investigations into a driver and would allow companies to ban drivers during an investigation. It remains in committee.
The bill in Massachusetts, introduced by Democratic state Sen. Rebecca Rausch, would create a specific criminal penalty for the sexual assault of a passenger by a rideshare driver. The bill also would deem any rideshare passenger incapable of consenting to any sexual contact during a ride.  A hearing on the bill took place yesterday.
“We need to be able to make sure that people are safe and that people can trust those kinds of spaces to be safe,” Rausch said.
States and cities eye stronger protections for gig economy workers

In May, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation that creates criminal penalties for impersonating a rideshare driver. Starting July 1, the crime counts as a second-degree misdemeanor. Uber supported the legislation.
But in Rhode Island, Lyft is pushing against legislation that would require fingerprinting as part of criminal background check. Brendan Joyce, the Lyft public policy manager, testified against the measure in April, saying the fingerprinting requirement relies on the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information System, which Joyce said has incomplete data. He also asserted that fingerprint checks “disproportionately impact and have potential discriminatory effects on communities of color.” Uber also testified against the proposal.
Rhode Island legislators introduced another measure that would prevent people under the age of 16 from using a rideshare service alone. Both bills are being held for further study.
 Driver protections

JC Muhammad, 57, has been a rideshare driver in and around Chicago since about 2016.
Now, he works full-time as an organizer for faith-based organizations and groups that support rideshare drivers, including The People’s Union, a membership-driven organization aimed at supporting workers in the city.
Muhammad was attacked by a passenger during a Lyft ride in 2022, he said. The passenger asked to borrow Muhammad’s phone and opened its Cash App. The passenger also hit him over the head twice, he said, and threw a brick at his car, denting the side.
“I was angry as hell,” Muhammad said. “I really wanted to engage the kid, but I said, ‘No, let me get back in my car.’”

After sharing the incident with Lyft, the company responded by saying it would not match him with that passenger again. But the person who rode with Muhammad did not match the profile of the person who originally requested the ride, he said.
Muhammad also said he couldn’t go to the police because he did not know the identity of the person who was in his car — and Lyft would not share the identity of the account holder who ordered the Lyft.
Uber and Lyft customers have the option to verify their account, but not everyone does, Muhammad said.
“That gives us some measure of comfort, but it really doesn’t do enough, especially when it comes to calling rides for other people,” Muhammad said. “The account holder may not be the actual passenger.”
Rideshare drivers across the country — especially those of color — are frequently harassed, according to a 2023 report from the Strategic Organizing Center. The center is a coalition of labor unions representing more than 2.5 million workers across the country.
The survey of over 900 app-based rideshare drivers found the majority had been verbally abused and more than a quarter of respondents were threatened with physical harm. Nearly 15% of the drivers were grabbed, groped or hit, according to the report.
There have been several incidents in Chicago where drivers are lured by a false account to a location where they are then robbed or attacked, said Deana Rutherford, the communications manager at the Chicago Gig Alliance, a subset of The People’s Lobby.
“These drivers just show up and they have no idea who’s about to get into their car,” Rutherford said. “And Uber doesn’t know who they are either.”
To address some of the safety and labor issues drivers were facing, the Chicago City Council began considering an ordinance backed by The People’s Lobby that would require passenger verification.
If passed, the ordinance would have also set a minimum wage for drivers, require companies to be more transparent about fares, have them disclose the details of driver account deactivations and more. Both Uber and Lyft initially opposed the ordinance. Uber warned the measure’s sponsor that the changes in pay rates would drive up costs for customers and force the company to cut 10,000 drivers, according to a letter Uber sent to a city alderman that was obtained by Stateline.
But Uber this week agreed to a deal that scraps Chicago’s ordinance in exchange for the company’s support for state legislation that would allow rideshare drivers to unionize, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

Julia Beverly for the Georgia RecorderSelina and Howie Newton were first-time visitors at Marietta’s Juneteenth festival, but the anniversary of the official end of slavery in America has always been a big deal in their household. 
Selina enjoys decorating the front of their house during the month of June to mark the occasion. And as they strolled through Marietta Square last weekend, the couple sported Juneteenth shirts and color coordinated shoes. 
“We really don’t celebrate the Fourth of July as Independence Day the way some people do,” Howie Newton said. “So that has a lot to do with why I feel the way I do about Juneteenth.” 
This year, Georgia’s Juneteenth celebrations  are happening at a fraught time nationally for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, as President Donald Trump moves to scale back DEI programs and funding. And some of these Juneteenth celebrations, including here in Georgia, have felt the impact, as some sponsors withdraw their support. 
“In spite of those efforts and the repressive, tense political climate generally, there will be a number of Juneteenth celebrations here in the metro Atlanta area and throughout the state this year,” said Clarissa Myrick-Harris White, who is a professor of Africana studies at Morehouse College.

Juneteenth commemorates the freeing of the final group of slaves under the Emancipation Proclamation. Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the proclamation in 1863, it took an additional two years for the news to reach Galveston, Texas. It wasn’t until General Gordon Granger led Union troops through Galveston on June 19, 1865, that over 250,000 slaves learned of their freedom. 
Juneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021 after the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by former President Joe Biden. Georgia Gov. Brain Kemp signed similar legislation in 2022 making Juneteenth a state holiday with paid time off for state employees.
While at least one state – West Virginia – has revoked the 2025 holiday observance, Juneteenth is still a federal and state holiday in Georgia.
“It has just really always been the intention to embrace what freedom is, embracing freedom and inclusion all the way across the board,” said Jeriene Bonner-Willis, the Cobb County NAACP president. “This has been about unification. As we look at 2025, it’s a celebration. It’s supposed to honor the history and the experience of enslaved, African Americans.”
Pat Snipes, the executive director of the Before Slavery Project, saw Juneteenth as the perfect place to reach her target audience. The project aims to educate people on the rich history and legacy of the people caught up in the Transatlantic slave trade. 
With an exhibit at the Marietta History Center just steps away from where she set up her booth, Snipes said she hopes to help African Americans forge deeper connections with their culture. Aware that the emphasis on Black history could be diminished by DEI cutbacks, Snipes is determined to continue her mission not only on Juneteenth, but every day. 
“It’s disheartening to hear that our country is taking several steps back, but we can’t let that stop us,” Snipes said. “We have to continue to move forward and be hopeful.”
While some celebrated Juneteenth on Saturday, others participated in “No Kings” Protests across the state. This juxtaposition occurred in Marietta, where smells of smoked meat and fresh popcorn floated in the air joining echoes of noisy chants from neighboring protesters.
The anti-Trump protests transpired as a nationwide response to a D.C. military parade for the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army. Saturday was not the first time Trump has hosted a large event around Juneteenth. He faced criticism during his first term for planning a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19, 2020. The rally was eventually rescheduled for the next day, but not until after Trump claimed to popularize the holiday with his scheduling conflict. 
Marietta wasn’t the only city celebrating Juneteenth last weekend. Atlanta also celebrated with a parade and music festival in Piedmont Park. Other cities, including Augusta, will continue celebrations throughout the week.

Atlanta and Augusta’s festivals faced difficulty fundraising after sponsorships were withdrawn due to DEI reversals. Johnny Gregory III, the president of Band of Brothers Augusta, which hosts the Juneteenth festival, said that a few previous sponsors of the annual celebration ended their sponsorship after company-based DEI changes. 
“We’ve noticed that it’s more of the corporations that are internationally and nationally known that are not supporting the local events and cultural events,” Gregory III said.
Juneteenth Atlanta faced similar problems, according to an Instagram post just days ahead of last weekend’s celebration.
“As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, we’ve faced unexpected challenges with sponsorships this year due to the national DEI backlash. But here’s the thing: our community deserves this celebration, and we believe in the power of coming together!” the post said.
As Juneteenth celebrations continue, a shared sense of preservation and perseverance remain. 
Small business owners in Augusta have helped fill the gap of withdrawn sponsorships. In Atlanta, festivities continued through summer showers. Even with the challenges this year, supporters of Juneteenth say the holiday serves as a reminder and opportunity to celebrate and reflect.
“Music, parades, food and cultural commemorations are very good and important, but it has to go beyond that,” Myrick-Harris White said. “There needs to be an understanding that Juneteenth, in and of itself, as a national holiday, is symbolic. It affirms the importance of remembering historical events that uniquely impact Black people.

They were there to begin saying goodbye to state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, who were gunned down in their Brooklyn Park home early Saturday because of Melissa Hortman’s politics, and especially support for abortion rights, law enforcement officials say.
Unlike the fractious and chatty House over which Hortman presided for five years, the vigil included no speeches and no politics to speak of.
Instead, the vigil featured music that crossed culture and genre; the flicker of candlelight in a darkening sky; and reverential reflection about the gift of life and its finitude — all in stark contrast to the nation’s increasingly toxic political atmosphere.

The orchestra performers played a rendition of “Make me a Channel of your Peace”; Hortman, a Roman Catholic, carried around a small prayer card with these words of St. Francis of Assissi on it, her mother said this week.
Hortman merely tolerated the spotlight and was not well known by the broader public, but she won fierce devotion from the countless people she mentored, Capitol staff, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor House caucus she led for more than eight years — and her Republican adversaries, too.

“She was my friend,” said Rep. Danny Nadeau, a Republican who represents the other side of District 34, which Hortman represented for two decades. “She’s an example of what a public servant should be.” The two worked on human services issues together.
The Red Lake Drum Group played “Prayer Song,” “Traveling Song” and “Bear Song,” the rhythms like a heartbeat for a community in need.
Law enforcement officials say Hortman was on a list of targets compiled by the man they say is the killer. State Sen. Erin Maye Quade, DFL-Apple Valley, was also on the list. She said she’s spent the past five days alternating between states of grief, rage and numbness.
The vigil was helping, though: “I feel steadier now,” she said, even as Barber’s “Adagio for Strings” blended soaring hope and crushing despair in the same instant.
As they made their way out, many old friends seemed to be catching up, just as Hortman would have wanted.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250618_0480-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-19 02:58:49.311522

I, too, sing America.
I am the darker brother.
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes,
But I laugh,
And eat well,
And grow strong.
Tomorrow,
I’ll be at the table

They’ll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed—

“The Weary Blues” 
Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
I heard a Negro play.
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
He did a lazy sway….
He did a lazy sway….
To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.
With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that poor piano moan with melody.
O Blues!
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.
Sweet Blues!
Coming from a black man’s soul.
O Blues!
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone
I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan—
“Ain’t got nobody in all this world,
Ain’t got nobody but ma self.
I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’
And put ma troubles on the shelf.”
Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.
He played a few chords then he sang some more—
“I got the Weary Blues
And I can’t be satisfied.
Got the Weary Blues
And can’t be satisfied—
I ain’t happy no mo’
And I wish that I had died.”
And far into the night he crooned that tune.
The stars went out and so did the moon.
The singer stopped playing and went to bed
While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.
He slept like a rock or a man that’s dead.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)A report released Wednesday by the Maryland Comptroller’s Office confirmed what thousands of Maryland workers already knew: The state’s economy is deeply tied to the federal government.
The 91-page report, which was produced in partnership with the University of Maryland, College Park’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, aimed to establish a “baseline” of how the state’s economy relies on federal jobs, retirement income, grants, direct payments and contracts by studying data from before the start of the second Trump administration. The project team analyzed data from over the past decade, but focused on the last fiscal year, to determine what the federal government “has meant and still means” to the Maryland economy.
The report described the federal government as the state’s “economic engine” and a driver of its employment growth. In the most recent annual data, the report found that Maryland drew more than $150 billion in economic value from the federal government, including $26.9 billion in income alone.
The release of the report comes a week before the inaugural meeting of the General Assembly’s Joint Federal Action Oversight Committee. The 26-member committee, co-chaired by Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), was established in April by the legislature to “monitor and keep legislators informed” of changes to federal funding, polices and regulations.
In a letter included in the report, Comptroller Brooke Lierman said that for decades, Maryland and the federal government have enjoyed a mutually beneficial economic relationship.
“The Trump Administration’s sweeping cuts to federal government jobs and spending put this longstanding relationship at risk,” Lierman said.
Maryland invests $1 million more in ‘Feds to Eds’ program for laid-off federal workers

Maryland houses 14 major military installations and more than 60 federal agency offices, including the headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Social Security Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the report said.
Despite being only the 18th largest state in population, Maryland ranks third in the number of federal employees, behind only Virginia and Washington, D.C., with its estimated 229,000 federal workers, according to the report. Those employees make up about 6% of the state’s total workforce and 10% of its wages, with an average salary of $126,468.
In addition to active federal workers, the report said more than 150,000 people receive retirement income, totaling about $8.8 billion each year.
The report said this significant federal presence across the state has fostered a “symbiotic relationship” between federal agencies and state institutions, such as Maryland’s colleges and universities serving as “feeders” for scientists and national security analysts.
But the state lost an estimated 5,300 federal jobs in March and April alone due to Trump administration cuts to federal spending and jobs, cuts that will damage the state’s economy, the report said.
Maryland also ranks third in federal contract spending per capita, again behind Virginia and Washington, D.C. In fiscal 2024, the federal government spent about $46.2 billion on contracts in Maryland and about $31 billion in grants. It also spent $38 billion in direct payments, which include costs such as subsidies to farmers, unemployment benefits, and Social Security and Medicare payments.
While crafting the report, the project team hosted roundtable discussions with federal workers who had been fired, laid off or placed on administrative leave.
The team found that a majority of the workers they spoke to were bracing for a long, challenging job search and expected a pay cut of 10-25% at their new position given the relatively lower salaries for nonprofit or local government jobs. Many were sad leaving their jobs as they were “passionate about their work and the service they provided to the public”.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
University of Maryland professor Vojislav Maksimovic, a member of the project’s team, said the report follows one released about 10 years ago which analyzed federal expenditures in Maryland.
“Clearly a lot has changed over the time, and they wanted to take another look and be prepared for whatever might be coming,” Maksimovic said in an interview Wednesday.
He added that the next phase of the project will also include scenario analysis to study the ripple effect of potential federal cuts. For example, he said, if a federal agency sees cuts to its contracts, its workers may not go out to restaurants as often or be able to shop as much.
“This report looks at direct effects,” Maksimovic said. “But the indirect effects are also going to affect everybody, and we’re going to be trying to quantify those effects.”
Maksimovic emphasized the value the partnership between the school and state government provides — both for Maryland as well as the many graduate and doctoral students who contributed to the report.
In the report, Robert H. Smith School of Business Dean Prabhudev Konana said that as a public, land-grant institution, the university has an “unwavering commitment to workforce development and the promotion of business excellence, driven by our fundamental belief that the economic vitality of Maryland is a shared responsibility.”
Wednesday’s report will be followed by a second later this summer which will include analysis of different scenarios to estimate the financial impacts of federal actions on the state’s economy, including the 2026 fiscal year budget and already-implemented federal cuts.
The project’s final output will be an interactive tool which will let users input specific scenarios by agency, program or county, and calculate the resulting lost wages or spending.
Konana said in the report that the “intuitive visual interface” will help policymakers and stakeholders “visualize and understand the cascading impacts of federal funding variations at both state and county levels.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/federalworkers-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-19 06:59:46.365201

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Hours after being sworn in as Prince George’s County Executive on Wednesday, Aisha Braveboy announced that George Nader will be the county’s next police chief.
Nader, who has worked as the assistant chief for the Metro Transit Police Department since 2016, worked previously in Prince George’s for 20 years that began in 1996 that included the rank of deputy chief.
“I am a man of faith. I do believe that the Lord puts our path in front of us. It’s up to us to take that path. I believe he put me here with such a talented team,” Nader, 54, said during a news conference in Largo where he was introduced. “From the bottom of my heart, county executive, thank you for the opportunity. I will not let you down.”
It is the third major appointment by Braveboy since her June 3 election, even though she was only officially sworn in Wednesday.
Nader replaces Police Chief Malik Aziz, who was one three finalists for the same position in Phoenix when he was replaced Wednesday by Nader. Aziz was hired in March 2021 by former county executive and now U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D).
“His leadership helped guide Prince George’s County through unprecedented challenges and his commitment to professionalism and progress will not be forgotten,” Braveboy said of Aziz. “We truly wish him the best in future endeavors.”

A spokesperson from the police department did not respond Wednesday evening to a phone message and an email seeking comment.
The event to announce Nader at the Wayne K. Curry Administration Building in Largo was packed with supporters, including state and county officials, several of the county’s municipal police chiefs and leadership of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 89.
Del. Karen Toles (D-Prince George’s) recalled working with Nader on county legislation when she served on the County Council from 2010 to 2018. Nader worked as a commander at the police station in her council district in the Suitland area.
“I am so elated and proud of County Executive Aisha Braveboy for this pick,” Toles said after the news conference. “I am going to be telling all my colleagues in the [Prince George’s] delegation to support him. He understands the job and the people in the community.”
One of those people was Elsie Jacobs, a community leader in Suitland who turned 84 this month.
“Thank you!” Jacobs yelled as Braveboy was joined by several others at the podium. Standing alongside Braveboy and Nader were County Council Chair Edward Burroughs III; George Nichols Jr., a police veteran in the department who Nader announced as his assistant chief; and Melvin Powell, who Braveboy announced Wednesday as a director of public safety.
“I think this is the first time since I’ve been on this Earth that the police chief, fire chief, the council, the county executive and [public safety director] will come together. I think Prince George’s County will make history,” Jacobs said after she was asked to give a few remarks at the podium.

Even before Braveboy officially became county executive Wednesday, she already worked on naming several people to her administration. Less than a day after her election she tapped Maxene Bardwell, an administrator in Montgomery County, to serve as chief administrative officer, and last week she named Shawn Joseph as interim superintendent for the county’s public schools.
Joseph will replace former Superintendent Millard House II. House, who was pushed out after a vote of no confidence by the county teacher’s union, left on Wednesday.
In a statement Tuesday, the county-executive elect announced two more people to serve in her administration.
Vennard Wright will serve as director of the Office of Information Technology. Wright is currently president and CEO of PerVista, an artificial intelligence company that helps detect firearms and other weapons.
Betsy Ramirez will become an education liaison in the county executive’s office. Ramirez worked as a school counselor in the Montgomery County public schools from 2006-2023.
Braveboy had a message Wednesday for the county’s more than 900,000 residents in her choice for Nader as police chief.
“This appointment is a commitment,” she said. “A commitment to equity in policing, to innovation in practice and to a safer future for every community … Chief Nader’s return to this department is not simply to resume a role, but to reimagine what’s possible.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Aisha-Braveboy-and-George-Nader-6-18-2025-1024x631.jpg,,,2025-06-19 06:59:46.365201

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Maryland Deputy Health Secretary Ryan Moran, the official tasked with overseeing Medicaid and health care financing, will leave Maryland for a new position in Washington state come August.
Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson (D) announced Wednesday that he had selected Moran to direct the state’s Health Care Authority, which administers Medicaid for the state, manages health benefits for state employees and coordinates behavioral health supports.
“Ryan’s passion and experience make him a great choice to lead the Health Care Authority,” Ferguson said in a prepared statement Wednesday. “His expertise will help us provide equitable, high-quality health care to the people of Washington.”
Moran currently serves as deputy secretary for Health Care Financing and Medicaid director, and will continue to serve in those positions until August. It’s not clear if the department has anyone lined up to fill Moran’s position when he leaves.
“I am honored to join Governor Ferguson to lead the Washington State Health Care Authority to support strengthening the health and wellbeing of nearly a third of Washingtonians through the delivery of health care coverage via Medicaid, public and school employee benefits, and behavioral health and recovery,” Moran said in a written statement.
“I look forward to advancing the work and mission of the agency in such a critical time for health care nationally and am committed to ensuring those we serve receive access to integrated, person-centered care,” his statement said.
Kalyanaraman becomes latest to leave Maryland Department of Health

News of Moran’s departure comes on the heels of other changes at the health department in recent weeks. Nilesh Kalyanaraman, the former deputy secretary of public health services, left the department earlier this month. The health department has also lost a former chief of staff and a communications spokesperson.
In February, Moran stepped in as acting-secretary when the former health secretary, Laura Herrera Scott, left amid several controversies at the department. Current Secretary Meena Seshamani took over as head of the department in April.
“His (Moran’s) leadership has cultivated operational excellence in the daily operations to serve Marylanders enrolled in Medicaid, along with making innovative advancements and investments in social determinants of health and behavioral health services,” Seshamani said in a written statement.
“I want to thank Ryan for his commitment to strengthening Maryland’s Medicaid program since he joined MDH in April 2023 and also for his service as Acting Secretary of Health earlier this year,” her statement said.
It’s a busy time for the state’s Medicaid director, especially as the Trump administration works to make significant changes in funding to the joint state-federal health care plan. State officials are watching Congress to see how severe federal cuts to Medicaid will be for Maryland, as federal lawmakers deliberate budget reconciliation legislation that calls for steep cuts in federal spending.
The health department is also transitioning into a new hospital system, known as the AHEAD model, at the start of nezt year. While the transition began under President Joe Biden (D), the Trump administration has signaled interest in reevaluating Maryland’s current authority to set hospital rates in the state as negotiations continue.
Moran led the health department through the “Medicaid unwinding” following the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency. During the pandemic, annual Medicaid eligibility determinations were suspended, leading to a surge in enrollment. When annual redeterminations resumed in 2023, the health department had to reevaluate the eligibility of all 1.8 million Medicaid recipients in the state, a hefty undertaking that eventually cut enrollment to about 1.6 million people.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In November, Moran worked with members of the developmental disability community to help iron out administrative issues that were leading some recipients of Medicaid disability waivers to “erroneously” lose coverage for their care.
Laura Howell, CEO of the Maryland Association of Community Services, said Moran had been helpful during those administrative challenges with Medicaid. She wishes him Moran success in his new position.
“He’s been a very responsive, collaborative leader,” Howell said. “We’re really sorry to see Ryan leave his position at MDH … We wish him the best.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4487-Copy-scaled-e1750291141301-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-19 06:59:46.365201

The court upheld the law Wednesday. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court ruled 6-3 Wednesday to overturn a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
In Pride month, transgender Marylanders reflect on strengths, weaknesses, of state protections

Tennessee’s House Republican Caucus issued a statement calling it “a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision.
“We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors,” the group said in a statement. “We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor [Bill] Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.

U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out when asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion that the case “carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field.”
“The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” Roberts wrote.
“Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process,” he wrote.
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

The Tennessee House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”",https://stateline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2188214627.jpg,,,2025-06-19 00:59:21.220513
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-19 04:02:24+00:00,CT Mirror,The scale of CT’s housing crisis,Casey Moran,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/19/the-scale-of-cts-housing-crisis/,The CT housing market is failing everyone -- those trying to buy a home and those trying to size up or downsize.,"In Connecticut, we have a housing crisis and we need to wake up to this reality.
Statewide we used to have about 20,000 homes for sale during the spring and summer buying season, now we have less than 5,000.
Try to buy a home today in the greater Hartford region, a region of 600,000 people in the roughly 10 mile radius from the city center. You’ll find just 416 total homes at any price point for sale at the time of writing. In the whole of Fairfield County (960,000 population) there are just 483 homes for sale for less than $600,000. There are functionally no homes to purchase.
But what of those who are comfortable in already owning their homes? Well they are trapped too. Unable to move to take advantage of job opportunities, size up to accommodate a growing family, or downsize into a more walkable place as they age. In short, the current housing market is failing everyone.
Just how severe is our housing crisis? Turns out it is worse than even I thought, the recently completed analysis by ECONorthwest found a total housing shortage of 379,000 homes. The scale of this shortage is immense and admittedly hard to fathom. What this means practically is our state with just over 1.5 million homes today, only has 80% of the homes a natural unconstrained market would provide. This shortage has cost our state a full federal representative in Congress.
Our current annual home permitting rate in Connecticut is between 5,000 and 6,000 homes. It would take about 63 years to permit our way out of this crisis at our current rate, without any new growth over that time. You’ll hear opponents of building housing deflect and point to “the five L’s” of home building in a well rehearsed dance. Labor, Lending, Lumber, Lots, and Laws/Regulations. While a nice deflection, the first four matter little if getting government approval to build a new home is nearly impossible.
I spent the better part of a year tracking housing denials across the state of Connecticut and over the last two years our towns denied no fewer than 8,000 homes, roughly 40% of all homes proposed in our state end up being denied. 

Let me share a few examples of what “local control” looks like in practice:

Newtown: Between 2022-2025 has denied 853 homes during the permitting process including a proposal to provide housing to 172 of our seniors. This session their state delegation snuck through a rat which strips the ability to ever develop housing on that site again. Meanwhile the first selectman sent a letter to our governor that stated: “Newtown has a long history of responsible and community driven land use policy.” – Responsible to whom?
Enfield: Recently negotiated with a builder to eliminate 53 homes in order to add 20 parking spaces near the soon-to-be-completed Enfield train station paid for at great state taxpayer expense.
New Canaan: Invented new fire safety regulations to deny housing; turning away 102 homes for lack of a third staircase (state building code explicitly requires two) and another 93 homes for insufficient driveway width at only 20 feet (town regulations explicitly require a 20 foot driveway).
Newington: To this day has refused to update its zoning code to legalize incremental housing adjacent to its two Fastrak bus stations. Instead of our investment in the nation’s leading bus rapid transit system resulting in a dynamic new community forming, a transit adjacent car wash was recently constructed at the Cedar Street station. Why? Because it was legal to build while housing was not.

These are just a fraction of the thousands of homes lost during the permitting process here in Connecticut. The price of lumber and labor is immaterial if a builder is unable to secure building permits in a reasonable timeframe and at a reasonable cost. Is this level of nanny state micromanaging really making our lives better?
There is only one way out of our housing crisis, to build more housing and a lot of it. HB 5002 is the gentle path. It empowers towns to take the housing crisis seriously and plan for solutions while setting some reasonable guideposts for planning good practice. For instance, parking reform is a common sense way to add flexibility to new projects by reducing the spatial and financial cost of new development. 
An example is in Trumbull, today to add an in-law suite for your aging parents to your single-family home (a second kitchen and a lockable door) you’d need to provide for four (Yes! Four!) additional parking spaces. These parking mandates are often designed to block projects rather than meet true parking demand – plus they are terrible for our environment. It is time to evolve beyond them.
We used to permit over 20,000 homes annually in the Nutmeg state, I believe not only that we can, but that we must return to this level of permitting. Our state’s future is dependent on our leaders taking this stand, HB5002 is an appropriate step forward.

These weren’t forced upon me, they were a part of how I learned to understand the political world.
Like many kids raised in conservative households, I grew up proud of these beliefs. But once I got to college, I started hearing a different message: that those same values were outdated, wrong, or even dangerous. Now, this may just be where I chose to go to school, but I have heard similar concerns from friends at other schools.
Parents often worry that liberal institutions are brainwashing their kids. Some campuses do feel like ideological bubbles. According to the  2025 College Free Speech Rankings, schools like Harvard are ranked at the bottom. Harvard, being one of the most prestigious schools, you would think they would rank high when it comes to free speech. This is becoming especially relevant in today’s political climate, with conflicts such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One of the key findings in the 2025 College Free Speech Rankings was that 55% of students feel it is difficult to “have an open and honest conversation on campus”.
The idea that universities lean left isn’t some right-wing talking point, it’s a reflection of what many students experience. That’s not to say every college professor is pushing an agenda. I’ve had many professors who welcome debate and challenge me to think critically.
It becomes more of an issue socially.  According to a recent study  about free expression and constructive dialogue in the University of North Carolina System, 68% of conservative students are “at least slightly concerned” about social opinion. Meaning that many conservative college students fear that voicing their opinions will result in losing friendships.
Not only do students feel that they may lose the respect of thier peers, they also feel that there are too few opportunities to hear conservative speakers compared to liberal speakers. 56% of students believe that there are too few opportunities to hear conservative speakers compared to 20% for liberals speakers. Overall, there seems to be a lack of conservative voices in higher education, and when there are, they feel they need to keep their views to themselves.
This isn’t a call to cancel progressive ideas. It’s a call to make room at the table for political diversity, the kind that includes all views. College should actively seek to bring an equal mix of liberal and conservative speakers, creating forums where students can engage with different perspectives openly and without fear. In today’s increasingly polarized climate, civil political discourse is becoming harder to find. If we want a more politically stable future, that change can start on college campuses. When students feel pressured to self-censor, universities lose what should be their greatest strength: intellectual challenge. Which is considered a loss for everyone.
As a college student who goes to a very liberal institution, I feel it is becoming increasingly more difficult to voice my beliefs without fear of judgment. It’s not that I expect everyone to agree with me, but I do expect mutual respect, especially in a place that prides itself on open-mindedness. That expectation was shattered during the most recent election. I lost what I thought were close friendships simply because of what I believe. These weren’t heated political debates that ended badly, they were people cutting me off entirely, refusing to talk, or posting messages about how they can’t associate with people like me. I never said anything hateful. That experience made it painfully clear that tolerance on campuses often runs in one direction.
Conservatives are starting to lose faith in our institutions, and that trend is accelerating. According to a Gallup study, in 2015, 56% of Republicans had a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in higher education. Now, that number has plummeted to just 20%, while 50% now say they have little or no confidence in higher education. That is a drastic difference. This reflects a broader perception that these institutions no longer represent different viewpoints. When colleges are seen as spaces that overwhelmingly reflect progressive views, it’s no surprise that public trust has eroded. 
If higher education wants to live up to its mission of fostering open dialogue and intellectual growth, it must be willing to embrace political diversity and not just tolerate it. That means creating space not just for political argument, but political disagreement without fear.
Real learning happens when we’re exposed to ideas we don’t already hold, and when everyone feels free to contribute. Until that becomes the norm, the distrust in higher education will continue to grow, and so will the political divide. College should be a place where all students, regardless of their political beliefs, feel like they belong and can express their views freely. When college stops welcoming debate, it stops educating.

I qualified for food stamps. 
I shared a one-bedroom basement apartment with four other people. I drove a beat up Nissan pick truck through St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, building floor systems and hanging siding for new homes meant to replace those destroyed Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
But what I remember most are the people. A crew of volunteers — politically, racially, and religiously diverse — united by one thing: a belief that America is better when neighbors show up for one another.
That term of service changed me. It grounded me in community. It introduced me to some of the most selfless people I have ever met. And it launched a career built around a simple idea: that service — real, grassroots, people-powered service — can change lives.


That’s what AmeriCorps does. Quietly. Every day. In communities large and small, urban and rural, across all 50 states.
Which is why what is happening in Washington right now is so damaging.
Since April, the Trump administration has taken aggressive steps to dismantle AmeriCorps. The newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) abruptly  terminated nearly $400 million in AmeriCorps grant funding — cutting off support to more than 1,000 nonprofits and 32,000 service members, including AmeriCorps Seniors. More than 750 FEMA Corps and NCCC members were issued stop-work orders with no notice. Over 85% of agency staff were dismissed, halting key functions like enrollment, member deployment, and grant disbursement.
These actions do not just jeopardize a federal agency; they destabilize community-based programs that serve children, seniors, veterans, disaster survivors, and so many others.
Here in Connecticut, those cuts landed hard.
At Big Brothers Big Sisters of Connecticut, we operate a Foster Grandparent Program, which gets 90% of its funding through AmeriCorps Seniors. It is simple and powerful: low-income older adults mentor children in under-resourced classrooms across Hartford, New Britain, Windham, Norwich, and New London. Many serve up to 40 hours a week, offering one-on-one support to students who need extra guidance and care.
In the past year alone, our Foster Grandparents helped nearly 400 children catch up to their peers. Without AmeriCorps, this program and others like it will have to shut down.
Thankfully, there is a path forward. The State of Connecticut joined 23 other states and the District of Columbia in suing the administration over the termination of funding awards. Just recently, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction, allowing participating states to restore AmeriCorps programs to status quo as of April 25.
This is a major win for communities like ours, but it is far from a total fix. The ruling provides no relief to the 26 states and territories not included in the suit. Tens of thousands of AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers remain without support. Their service terms have ended, their stipends and education awards are frozen, and their work has been cut short.
And the President’s FY26 budget still calls for the complete elimination of AmeriCorps.
That would be a tragic mistake.
AmeriCorps is one of the most effective, efficient, bipartisan service models our country has ever created. Each year, it mobilizes over 200,000 members to address local needs — tutoring students, supporting disaster relief, fighting hunger, helping seniors age with dignity. AmeriCorps members aren’t flown in by Washington — they’re recruited locally to respond to their communities’ needs.
While serving, corps members develop job skills and a commitment to the common good. For older adults, service reduces social isolation, builds purpose, and offers meaningful connection at a time in life when those things are often in short supply.
AmeriCorps works. That’s why nonprofits, schools, and faith-based organizations across the country depend on it. That’s why I believe in it. And that’s why I’m asking our federal delegation to act now.
Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, and U.S. Reps. John Larson, Joe Courtney, Rosa DeLauro, Jim Himes, and Jahana Hayes — please protect AmeriCorps. Restore full funding. Defend the people and communities this program serves. And speak out against the continued politicization of national service.
This is not about partisanship. It’s about people. It’s about keeping teachers supported, children mentored, homes rebuilt, and local nonprofits equipped to meet rising needs.
AmeriCorps taught me that service is one of the purest expressions of citizenship. We need more of it—not less. And in this moment, we need leaders who understand that public service is worth preserving.
Let’s not dismantle what’s working. Let’s protect it—and make it stronger.

And with adding $3.4 trillion to the national deficit, this boon for the wealthy could also be at the expense of an economy rattled by Trump’s on-and-off again tariffs.   According to […]","The U.S. Capitol is seen on a cloudy day in an undated photo. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)The Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill, or BBB, is a boon for America’s ultrarich at the expense of the poor and the working class. And with adding $3.4 trillion to the national deficit, this boon for the wealthy could also be at the expense of an economy rattled by Trump’s on-and-off again tariffs.  
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Republican bill slashes $295 billion from food stamps. Here in Alaska, this would mean that the 63,000 Alaskans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  would be at risk of losing a quarter of their benefits if the State of Alaska does not step up to fill the financial gap. The Republican bill also cuts $793 billion from Medicaid. This would result in 279,000 Alaskans (that’s approximately 38 % of our population) being at risk of insufficient health coverage. Jared Kosin, president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said if Congress makes substantial cuts to Medicaid, “It would be catastrophic, not only for the health care system, [but] for Alaskans across our entire state.” Add in the elimination of renewable energy tax credits, you get a lot ‘ugly’ in this bill that negatively affects Alaskans. 
Oh, but not to worry as those supporting Trump’s push for unfettered development of Alaska’s oil, gas and coal, say Alaska will be better off with BBB. Somehow, high-risk, mega-projects, like oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — remember no major oil company bid on ANWR under the first Trump administration — and the Alaska liquefied natural gas pipeline will offset the economic harm of slashing Medicaid and upending viable renewable energy projects across the state. 
Adding more substance to the discussion of Alaska LNG is Roger Marks, a former petroleum economist with the state of Alaska, notes, “exporting LNG would not help the U.S. to either revive manufacturing, defend against unfair competition, maintain security, or protect emerging industries.” Marks continues, “The control of Congress may change in 19 months, and the president is gone in four years. No investor will touch a project until they are confident policies will endure over the long term.” In other words, there is no laying down pipe at the end of this year or in the immediate future. As such, the economic harm of the BBB to Alaskans remains real and immediate. 
 While these are disturbing facets of the BBB, there is a lesser-known provision that is the real ‘ugly’.  Republicans snuck in a little noticed but rather important provision into the thousand-page bill that would effectively remove the ability for judges to hold litigants in contempt of the court. The fine print of the bill would require judges to impose a security bond on the litigant even when the lawsuit alleges illegal conduct by the government. Because no ordinary — read, nonbillionaire — citizen or organization could ever afford to pay a bond large enough to challenge the federal government, restraining orders and injunctions on federal actions then become more of a request than a command of the court.
If this buried provision isn’t enough to signal that the intent of this provision is to specifically shield President Trump and members of his administration from the consequences of violating court orders, there is the “prior to enactment” part that seals the deal for them. The ability for courts to punish for contempt is considered essential to the administration of justice. 
If Republican senators play by their own rules, this provision should be struck out by the budget reconciliation rules established for a simple majority vote. The rules, recently imposed on Democrats, require that all components in a budget reconciliation bill have a direct effect on federal revenues. Clearly, this provision, intended to protect Trump from the rule of law, does not meet that standard. 
If this provision does make it to the Senate floor, it will be incumbent on our Alaska senators to move to amend and remove this judicial end-run. It’s no surprise that this end-run attempt happens when federal judges are considering whether or not to hold the Trump administration in contempt for violating orders related to deportation of immigrants. 
If this provision becomes law it would be a disaster for our system of checks and balances. It would bring us front and center with the constitutional crisis that’s been looming ever since Trump took office and began challenging Congress for control of the purse. 
The BBB has an ugly way of benefitting the ultrarich at the expense of working households. Even here in Alaska, where there is a high dependency on Medicaid and SNAP, the negative impacts will ripple far and wide. But worse, the Republican bill as currently written contains a constitutional poison pill. If swallowed the constitutional crisis awaits.

Rosa DeLauro lamented Wednesday night the lack of “civil discourse” in the country, whether it’s about the conflict between Israel and Gaza or the Trump administration’s response to protests opposing immigration raids.
That sentiment came up after a brief exchange with a member of the audience during The Connecticut Mirror’s “In the Room” event as the congresswoman discussed her support for Israel and escalating tensions in the Middle East.
DeLauro sat for an interview on a theater set as part of the CT Mirror’s interview series hosted by John Dankosky at CitySeed in New Haven. The intimate setting with the crowd led to her at times directly engaging with the audience. In some less tense moments, someone asked “How do we fight?” when she was talking about Trump’s overhaul of the government and certain services.
But a man in the audience and listening to her answers regarding Israel at times booed or said “genocide.” He later stood up and walked toward the stage where he threw a bill and said, “Here’s money, send it to Israel.” As he headed to the door, a New Haven police officer escorted him out of the theater.
“Do you see why we can’t have a civil conversation in the United States of America?” said DeLauro, a Democrat representing Connecticut’s 3rd District. “There is no civil discourse. I don’t get up and throw anything at anyone, nor would I ever do it.”
At one point, another member of the audience commented, “That is civil discourse.”
“I’m an elected official. My job is to be able to come to consensus and to bring people together, to not divide them,” DeLauro said to some applause. I don’t have any tolerance for that. Let’s have a conversation about these things.”
DeLauro went on to blame the Trump administration for seeking to divide the country on the issue of immigration as people protest the growing number of raids and detainments by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
She argued that ICE agents are going after people who have been in the country for years and are working, instead of prioritizing violent criminals. She pointed to a mother in New Haven who was recently detained in front of her children.
“That is not what we want, but that’s what this administration is doing. Why? Because they can divide the country on that issue, and they figure it’s in their political interests to do it. Let’s not feed into that,” she said to applause.
She was critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when asked if he was a good partner to the U.S. and of Israel’s handling of humanitarian aid for Palestinians. But she said Israel has a right to defend itself and said she wouldn’t engage in a conversation with anyone who won’t condemn Hamas.
And as President Donald J. Trump weighs whether to engage in a growing conflict between Israel and Iran, she said the U.S. should not strike Iran’s nuclear facilities.
DeLauro, 82, has been longtime staple in Connecticut politics and has served in the 3rd Congressional District since 1991. She rose up the ranks to served as the chairwoman of the influential House Appropriations Committee when Democrats were in the majority. With Republicans at the helm in the House, she is now the ranking member and still plays a large role in negotiating and drafting government funding legislation.
She gave a rundown in the style of “Schoolhouse Rock!” on how the appropriations process works in Congress and how her committee directs taxpayer dollars.
Similar to her other colleagues who have been in Congress for a while, DeLauro said the “camaraderie” between Democrats and Republicans isn’t the same. She said there were always differences of opinion, but “there wasn’t the kind of ad hominem attacks on individuals” that have become part of the political environment in Washington.
DeLauro said expanding the federal tax credit was one of the biggest accomplishments of her decades-long career because of the tangible relief it brought to working and middle-class families.
The expansion was included in Democrats’ pandemic relief legislation, the American Rescue Plan. It was enacted in 2021 but expired at the end of that year.
That enhancement increased the rebate up to $3,600 per child under the age of 6 and $3,000 per child aged 6 to 18. The tax credit was based on income and given out in monthly installments. It is now back to $2,000 per child under age 17.
“For me, it was social security for kids,” she said, running through numbers that show the one-year expansion lifted almost half of children out of poverty.
Debate over the child tax credit was one of the areas where DeLauro said she took on members of her own party. She wanted to make it permanent, but she said she faced resistance while negotiating with the Biden administration on how long the expansion should last. The cost of the program brought it to an end after a year.
She was pressed about where Congress could find more money and if it’s in places that are seen as a “third rail” in U.S. government: What about cuts to defense spending?
DeLauro said there are a lot of places to look for cuts to federal spending, saying there’s not much of an “appetite” in Congress to make cuts to the defense sector.
Connecticut’s economy is made up of a number of larger defense contractors and the supply chain that works with them. Sikorsky, which is owned by Lockheed Martin, is based in Stratford and part of DeLauro’s district.
“I don’t have problems where we would need to cut things. But I am going to support Connecticut’s industry,” DeLauro said, adding that if fewer helicopters are going to be made, “I’ll be damned if they’re not going to be made in Stratford, Connecticut, at Sikorsky.”
When asked about the frustration among some Americans that members of Congress have been in office too long, DeLauro seemed to indicate she would not be slowing down, pointing to her seniority in Congress. Debate over age and the length of service of politicians hit a fever pitch during the 2024 election with former president Joe Biden, who ultimately abandoned his efforts to win a second term.
DeLauro believes relationships are at the heart of her job and that she’s earned the trust she has from both parties. Axios recently reported that she plans to run for another term in 2026.
“I believe this, and it might sound very self-serving, but I do have the trust of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. They’ll know that I’m not trying to take them down a wrong road, or hurt them in some way, that I’m doing something that I think can be beneficial overall,” she said, noting it helped her with the child tax credit.
“That doesn’t happen in one year, two years, even five years. It happens over a period time to get to know you,” DeLauro said. “That’s not to say that the time comes when you should say, ‘I’ve had a good run.'”
She didn’t say when that time might come for her. But DeLauro made it clear throughout the hour-long interview that she does things on her own terms — and that includes decisions about her purple hair, tattoos and fashion choices.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FLEMING-NEON — Anna Gomez doesn’t know how long she’ll remain on the Federal Communications Commission under President Donald Trump. But for the time being, she says she’s speaking out against “this administration’s campaign of censorship and control.” 
“It is my responsibility to respond to these attacks on the First Amendment,” Gomez told a small gathering in Eastern Kentucky on Wednesday. “I refuse to stay quiet while the government chips away at fundamental rights by weaponizing our regulatory authority.”

Gomez is one of three current commissioners — the only Democrat among them — overseeing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), an independent federal agency that regulates a broad range of communications industries, including television, radio, satellite, internet and cable. 
Traditionally, the agency has overseen the licensing of television and radio stations, taken on initiatives such as combating robocalls and worked to expand internet access across the country. But actions launched by the FCC in the months since the Trump administration has returned to power have greatly troubled Gomez. 
Under FCC chairman Brendan Carr, a Republican confirmed by the U.S. Senate during President Donald Trump’s first term, the regulator has launched investigations into public media stations’ use of sponsorships; opened a probe into the promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion programs at Comcast, the parent company for NBC News; and revived complaints that media coverage was biased against Trump.  
​​”The FCC has targeted the editorial decisions of news networks, independent reporting by public media and internal labor practices by private companies. These are dangerous and unprecedented actions by an independent government regulator,” Gomez said. 
Gomez has embarked on a nationwide tour advocating for First Amendment rights and speaking out against what she sees as Trump administration actions to undermine those rights. Her first two stops were in two of the country’s largest cities, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., but her latest stop Wednesday was at a community center in the Letcher County community of Fleming-Neon, population around 500.

She said recent FCC actions are especially troubling because media corporations targeted by Trump and the FCC also have business before the FCC.
One example Gomez poses: CBS News and its parent company Paramount. 
One of the FCC’s revived complaints over media coverage centers on CBS News’ “60 Minutes” news magazine show. Trump had sued the show over claims that an interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris was deceitfully edited, something CBS News’ parent company Paramount has denied. 
Paramount is trying to settle the Trump lawsuit at the same time it is seeking approval from the Trump-appointed FCC for a merger with media company Skydance. As lawsuit settlement discussions continue, both the executive producer of “60 Minutes” and the president and CEO of CBS News have resigned. Bill Owens, the 60 Minutes executive producer, had said he could no longer lead the show independently.
“The FCC is supposed to make decisions based on law, facts and technical expertise, not politics,” Gomez said. “We need journalists who feel free to report the truth even when it cuts against our own political biases, and corporate parents who give journalists the independence they need.”
The Lantern sought the FCC’s response to Gomez’s criticisms by emailing an address associated with Republican FCC Chair Carr but received no response by late Wednesday.
Gomez also doesn’t know how long she’ll be in her position. Other members of independent agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Commission have been fired by Trump this year. She said she checks her email daily to see if she’s next, even though she plans to continue her tour even if the Trump administration seeks to remove her. 
“I don’t know why I haven’t been fired. I have not been quiet,” Gomez said. 
‘Speak their truth’ 
Other members of the panel Gomez joined in Letcher County were also not quiet in advocating for rights protected by the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, including freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and freedom to petition one’s government with grievances.

Other panelists included a journalist, a church deacon, a former Democratic Kentucky state representative and the leaders of Letcher County nonprofits Appalshop, the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center and the Center for Rural Strategies which organized the event. 
“People being able to speak their truth is what is going to really be healing for our country,” said Tiffany Sturdivant, the executive director of the media, arts and education center Appalshop in Whitesburg. “I want us to really, really be brave. Freedom of speech is to me — it’s about telling the truth and not being afraid of that.” 
Wading through the near-instant accessibility of information and news sources is a different challenge, though. Sturdivant said people should try to “seek out the truth for themselves” and have conversations in person and in their communities beyond social media. 
While stereotypes about Eastern Kentucky are perpetuated in the national media, she said, there can be “something special” about having an in-person conversation that can dispel those narratives.
Wes Addington, executive director of the nonprofit law firm Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, told the gathered audience that it was up to people to continue to advocate for the right to petition one’s government — specifically in court before a judge. 
  Bill Weinberg (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)
Another panelist, author and former Democratic Kentucky state Rep. Bill Weinberg, mentioned how Elon Musk had at one point called for the impeachment of judges who defy or delay the Trump administration’s efforts to overhaul the federal government. 
Addington responded by saying while some court decisions go down in history as deplorable — such as the U.S. Supreme Court allowing the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II — decisions can be reversed. But not abiding by decisions in real time is “when you cross that line.” 
“When the decisions of the Supreme Court become something you can decide in the moment whether you’re going to follow or not,” Addington said, “that’s when you lose what this country was founded on.” 
Gomez said hearing from the other panelists reaffirmed her belief in the need for journalism and the need to protect journalism. 
“A lot of people that I speak to tell me they’re tired. It’s a little too soon to be tired,” Gomez said. “We need to take care of our precious liberties, and the way that we do that is by being aware and by speaking up and pushing back.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Top law enforcement officials briefed Utah lawmakers during closed-door caucus meetings on Wednesday about the shooting during the “No Kings” protest in Salt Lake City on Saturday  which saw a bystander marching in the protest shot and killed by a security volunteer.
Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Jess Anderson and Salt Lake City Police Brian Redd met separately with both Republican and Democratic caucuses at the Utah Capitol. House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, told reporters during a media availability that Anderson and Redd didn’t share many details. 
“Honestly, we don’t really know any of the details,” Schultz said. “(Anderson and Redd) can’t share any details, because it’s an ongoing investigation.” 
Schultz, however, said he’s confident the investigation will be “treated fairly” and provide answers to questions that “a lot of us have.” The speaker also said he’s “really proud of the way Salt Lake City and the state of Utah came together to make sure there wasn’t violence” during the rest of the protest. 
“I’m proud of the organizers of the protest, that was important to them, that they didn’t have violence,” the House speaker said. “And I really felt like overall things were pretty good. There is that one incident that’s sad, and we certainly condone any type of violence.” 
Man dies after being shot in chaotic scene at Salt Lake City’s ‘No Kings’ protest

Schultz added that lawmakers will be reflecting on the facts of the investigation when it’s finished. 
“We look forward to getting more information as it becomes available, and we’ll sift through what went wrong or what are the issues,” Schultz said. 
According to Salt Lake City police, the shooting happened after two men described as “peacekeepers” confronted another man, 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa, who was carrying an AR-15 style rifle during the protest. One of the “peacekeepers” fired three shots from a handgun, grazing Gamboa but also hitting an “innocent bystander,” Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, who was pronounced dead at a hospital. 
Shortly after the shooting, police arrested Gamboa, and he was booked into jail for investigation of murder. Police say, however, that Gamboa did not fire his rifle. The two “peacekeepers,” who wore high-visability vests, were initially detained by police, but were released after being questioned. Police said the man who fired the three shots is cooperating with investigators. 
The protest was organized by Utah 50501, a state chapter of the 50501 Movement, a grassroots group that organizes rallies to protest actions by President Donald Trump and his administration. Organizers have expressed “profound heartbreak” for the death of Ah Loo. 
In the days following the chaotic shooting, unanswered questions remain, including details of who the “peacekeepers” were and how they were vetted, if at all, to be acting as armed security.

Event organizers said people who served as “safety volunteers” were “selected because of their military, first responder, and other relevant de-escalation experience,” and they said when those volunteers saw Gamboa with the AR-15 style rifle, they “believed that there was an imminent threat to the protesters and took action.” Organizers said the man who was involved in the shooting is a “military veteran.” 
Questions also remain regarding Gamboa’s intentions and why he brought a rifle to the protest. As of Wednesday, charges had not been filed against Gamboa or anyone else involved in the shooting. 
Should Utah consider changes to gun laws?
Utah is a “constitutional carry” state, which means its laws allow the open and concealed carrying of firearms without a permit for those who are legally allowed to possess them. In 2021, with HB60, the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature eliminated the state’s concealed carry permit requirements. Now, anyone 21 and over who can legally possess a gun is free to carry it loaded and hidden in public. 
Unlike 26 other states, Utah — a Republican-controlled state — has not adopted a law prohibiting carrying long guns at state capitols or, according to Everytown Research & Policy, an organization that produces research on gun violence and advocates for gun violence prevention. The group has ranked Utah as No. 36 in the country for “gun law strength.”
When pressed on whether lawmakers would be open to considering some type of policy to restrict the open carrying of long guns during protests, Schultz declined to say what lawmakers will or won’t be willing to do, but “I can speak from my own perspective.” 
“Utah is a very proud Second Amendment state,” he said. “Finding that balance is what we want to try to do, and I think we’ve done a good job with it in the past.” 
Schultz, however, left the door open to a discussion. 
“As we enter into the legislative session and we have more details around what happened, I’m sure some of those conversations will happen and we’ll see where it goes from there,” Schultz said. 
‘Peacekeeper’ involved in shooting at SLC ‘No Kings’ protest is a military veteran, organizers say

While Democrats typically propose various bills during each legislative session seeking tighter firearm regulations, Utah’s GOP-supermajority Legislature usually doesn’t let those bills progress. 
Schultz said “any violence of any sort is terrible,” also pointing to the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses over the weekend.  
“It’s sad right now,” he said. “I think it speaks a little bit to the times that we’re living in.” 
Security discussion in the wake of Minnesota murders
Schultz said Anderson also briefed lawmakers on their own security, including resources available to lawmakers if they experience threats or have heightened concern. He praised the Utah Department of Public Safety for always being responsive to make sure lawmakers have protection when needed. 
House Majority Whip Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, said she saw the news from Minnesota, “I just kept thinking how we have got to find a way to turn down the heat when it comes to politics.” 
“We have to get to a place where we disagree without thinking the other person is evil,” she said, adding that it was “terrifying” that the man accused of shooting the Minnesota lawmakers had a list of names of other lawmakers.

In the days after the Minnesota shooting, however, Utah Sen. Mike Lee drew widespread backlash for a pair of social media posts that appeared to make a joke about the suspect accused of the Minnesota shootings, claiming it was the result of “Marxism” and attempting to connect the suspect to Gov. Tim Walz. 
On Tuesday, Lee deleted the posts from X. His office has not returned a request for comment about them, and he hasn’t issued a public apology. 
Asked about Lee’s posts, Schultz brushed them off, saying he doesn’t spend time on X, (formerly known as Twitter). 
“If I get on Twitter and look at what people say about me, it puts me in a bad mood, so I don’t even get on Twitter,” he said. “I don’t think we have any comments around that. We’re focused on Utah.” 
Pressed on whether they condemn the tweets, House Majority Leader Casey Snider, R-Paradise, said: “you’d have to ask the senator about his tweets; he’s the one that made them.”
“I’m in the same boat. I don’t spend much time on social media. … you’d have to ask the senator what he said and what he meant by it,” Snider said. 
Sen. Mike Lee takes down controversial X posts after widespread criticism

On Monday, House Democratic leaders issued a statement in the wake of the Minnesota shootings and the shooting during the Salt Lake City protest, calling them “heartbreaking but unfortunately not surprising” while also calling for more gun regulations.  
“The conditions for this kind of violence have been building for years, driven by a toxic combination of hateful rhetoric and easy access to firearms,” House Democrats said. “That rhetoric, often amplified by leaders at the local, state, and federal levels, has created an environment that often leads to violence.” 
House Democrats said their Republican colleagues often argue “guns don’t kill people — people kill people.” 
“Yet many of those same leaders use their platforms to target marginalized communities, spread misinformation, and stoke division,” they said. “We urge all elected officials to reflect on the impact of their words and how they contribute to the dangerous climate we face today.” 
House Democrats said they “remain committed to advancing policies that reduce gun violence, promote accountability, and protect the safety and dignity of every Utahn. We call on others to join us in that commitment.”
Later Wednesday afternoon, the full Senate — while convened to vote on several judicial and cabinet appointments from Gov. Spencer Cox — held a moment of silence for the victims of violence in and outside of Utah over the weekend. 
Senators bowed their heads for Ah Loo, as well as for the two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses who were shot, and the three killed during an unrelated act of violence seen in Utah over the weekend — a shooting at a carnival in West Valley City on Sunday.

The House Concurrent Resolution Regarding Advanced Nuclear Manufacturing, proposed by Rep. Carl Albrecht, R-Richfield, “expresses support for the advanced nuclear manufacturing industry and declares the state’s desire to have nuclear manufacturing done in the state.” 
“If we’re going to have some of these projects in the state of Utah, we just well be building them here, right?,” Albrecht told the Public Utilities, Energy, and Technology Interim Committee on Wednesday.

This year’s session, legislators passed HB249, a lengthy bill setting up the structure to push nuclear developments in the state. But, amid high competition among different states and multiple companies to sign nuclear technology deals, Utah wants to make its intentions to become a nuclear hub even clearer with a concurrent resolution during next year’s session. 
Utah has a chance to lead the way in the west, Albrecht said, since most nuclear facilities in the country are east of the Mississippi River.  
“We want to send the message as the governor, the legislature, that we want to help these technology companies overcome the remaining challenges regarding safety of the industry, manufacturing, transportation and waste management,” Albrecht said.
While concurrent resolutions have no force of law, when both legislative chambers and the governor sign into one, they send a message about the state’s position on a determined issue. The interim committee voted unanimously to adopt the proposal as a committee bill, meaning that it will advance to the House floor without another committee hearing in 2026. 



Let us know what you think...


 


Apart from the small nuclear reactors officials often reference, Albretch’s vision for the state includes projects related to medical radioactive isotopes, often used for diagnosis and treatment of various diseases, and recycling spent nuclear fuel that could be used for batteries.
Since the state approved HB249, Albrecht and other officials working on energy issues in Utah have received multiple calls about potential collaborations. Albrecht attributes the high interest to the state’s vast natural resources and the presence of entities like the White Mesa uranium mill and the San Rafael Energy Research Lab, which the state bought in 2024.
The state has also recently signed two agreements with nuclear developers, and is studying whether to lease part of Camp Williams, a Utah National Guard base, for a manufacturing facility for uranium enrichment hardware.
While many at the Legislature are enthusiastic about the nuclear prospects, some Utahns are receiving the news with skepticism, including those who have advocated for people harmed by Cold War-era nuclear weapons development in the state, who called for a deliberate process when considering radioactive projects.
As Cox advances nuclear agreements, he says the cost to develop technology is nothing so far

During the public comment hearing on the bill, Lexi Tuddenham, director of the environmental nonprofit HEAL Utah, said that while going down the nuclear path has promise, it also has a lot of peril, so communities that can be potentially affected by the technology should be included in the decision-making process.
“If we are truly to pursue this all-of-the-above energy approach, we need to be taking a truly clear-eyed look at what it implies and what the implications are,” Tuddenham said. “There is no long-term repository for the waste, and that means that it’s going to stay on site for a long, long time. Reprocessing at this point is not particularly efficient.”
Tuddenham also pointed out that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the state is suing for what it describes as “overburdensome” regulations, is needed to keep nuclear technology safe, which means that it needs to have enough staffing, funding and time to work appropriately.
However, for some, including Craig Peterson, who is a lobbyist but spoke representing himself, the state can’t afford to delay its nuclear plans. 
“Utah’s future is going to rely heavily, in my opinion, upon the availability of power,” he said during the public comment period. “And this is absolutely an opportunity that Utah cannot squander, that we cannot continue to delay.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy has signed a bill expanding the exemptions that allow some Alaskans who are absent from the state to receive Permanent Fund dividends.
House Bill 75, from Rep. Jeremy Bynum, R-Ketchikan, was one of four bills that became law last week.
“We were pleased to see that it was signed into law,” said Bynum on Tuesday.
Bynum was elected to the House in 2024, and HB 75 was his first bill. It also was the first bill from the House’s Republican minority caucus to become law this year.
The governor did not hold a signing ceremony, and the governor’s office did not issue a statement about the signing of that bill or three others that he signed last week. 
Official notices were published by the clerks for the Legislature on Monday.
“Having a little bit of fanfare would have been kind of a nice thing, but at the end of the day, it’s really more about what the bill is going to do and how it is going to help Alaskans,” Bynum said.
Under HB 75, Alaskans who are absent from the state while undergoing training for the U.S. merchant marine will not have that absence count against them when considering eligibility for the Permanent Fund dividend. 
College students who take holiday breaks away from Alaska also will not have those absences count against them, and members of the federal government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps and the Public Health Service commissioned corps will not lose PFD eligibility if deployed out of state.
The PFD department also will be able to conduct fingerprint background checks of its employees.
In addition to HB 75, Dunleavy allowed Senate Bill 80 and Senate Bill 137, renewing some of the state’s professional licensing boards and the state parole board, to become law without his signature.
He also signed Senate Bill 152, which names the airport in Ruby after longtime local pilot Harold Esmailka.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)A dozen demonstrators gathered half a block from the state Capitol Wednesday morning to urge Arkansas’ U.S. senators to vote against President Donald Trump’s suite of tax and spending cuts currently pending in the upper chamber of Congress.
Organized by chapters of the Arkansas Community Organizations, the demonstrators carried signs, spoke of how the legislation — dubbed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” by Trump and adopted by the GOP — would affect them and other Arkansans personally. They then entered the Victory Building and submitted comments to staff of Sen. Tom Cotton’s and Sen. John Boozman’s Little Rock office’s, which are in the structure.
William Gerard, the Southwest chapter vice president of ACO, said he receives Medicaid and SNAP benefits and Section 8 housing vouchers. If the tax and spending legislation makes it into law, he said, he was likely to end up homeless and unable to afford his medications due to being unable to meet work requirements that are part of the bill. 
“My medicines are in the thousands; I have seizures, I have cerebral palsy,” Gerard said. “I only get $50 in food stamps. What’s $50 going to buy these days? Nothing.” 
U.S. Senate GOP tries to ease the pain for states in sharing costs of SNAP benefits

When the group went to Boozman’s office to fill out comment forms, William Mitchener, a farmer from Jackson County and self-described registered Republican, told staff that he had two bins full of rice he wasn’t able to sell, which he said was due in part to cutbacks in federal programs that would buy his crops to “feed the world.” He said he’d been in Washington, D.C., over the weekend to see the military parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army — on the same day as Trump’s birthday — and said Boozman “couldn’t see me then.”
“I lost $100,000,” Mitchener said of his unsold rice. “How long do you think I’m gonna be able to continue doing that? I can’t make my payments, I can’t pay my taxes, and he’s going to cut my Medicaid. Man, I got to have some help.”
As the group streamed out of Boozman’s office to head to Cotton’s, they chanted: “This bill will kill.”
The so-called Big, Beautiful Bill is projected to increase the federal deficit by $3 trillion, despite GOP promises to cut back federal spending. That’s despite changes to benefits programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that are relied upon by millions of low-income Americans. 
Driving the increases are the GOP’s inclusion of Trump campaign promises such as no taxes on tips and overtime and extensions of the tax cuts passed in 2017, which are set to sunset this year if they aren’t extended.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6181150-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-18 22:01:15.327697

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Attorney General Tim Griffin on Wednesday asked a state court to prevent the Arkansas Board of Corrections from spending any public funds on a lawyer he says the board hired illegally.
Griffin sued the corrections board in December 2023, alleging it had violated the state Freedom of Information Act by discussing the hiring of an attorney outside of a public meeting and hiring him with no public discussion.
In Wednesday’s amended complaint, the attorney general argues that any use of public funds to pay the lawyer would amount to an illegal exaction resulting from its FOIA violations. The Arkansas Constitution allows any citizen to sue to prevent the unauthorized or illegal use of public funds.
Griffin also asks the judge to declare that a discussion between board chairman Benny Magness and member Lee Watson was an illegal public meeting, the board illegally entered executive session to discuss hiring an attorney, and failed to properly respond to a records request made by his office.
The revised complaint also seeks to enjoin the board from employing a lawyer in any future executive session and from paying any funds to the lawyer it “unlawfully” hired.
Wednesday’s court filing is the latest twist in a complex battle over who has ultimate authority over state prisons – the Board of Corrections or the governor. The Arkansas Constitution grants a fair amount of independent authority to the prison board under Amendment 33, which sought to distance certain boards and commissions from political interference.

 The winding road

The corrections board met in a 45-minute executive session on Dec. 8, 2023 to discuss an “employment matter.” Upon returning to open session, the board voted to hire a special counsel, then voted again to sign an engagement letter with attorney Abtin Mehdizadegan. A week later the attorney filed suit on behalf of the board against the governor and other officials challenging the constitutionality of two state laws the board argues violate Amendment 33.
Three days after the board’s votes on hiring Mehdizadegan, Griffin wrote to Magness advising him that the board not only violated the FOIA but also the state law requiring state agencies to certify a need for special counsel with the attorney general. Griffin gave the board another three days to “cure” its actions in another meeting.
The board did meet on Dec. 14, but only to ratify its engagement agreement with Mehdizadegan. Griffin filed his FOIA complaint in Pulaski County circuit court on Dec. 15.
On Dec. 19, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox found Griffin in “clear violation” of his legal duty to the board and gave him 30 days to work out an agreement with Mehdizadegan to let the lawyer represent the board. Fox later dismissed the suit. Griffin appealed to the state Supreme Court, which last month ruled that important issues in the case hadn’t been resolved and sent it back to Fox for more hearings.
In January 2024, in the board’s suit against the governor, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Patricia James temporarily blocked implementation of the two laws the corrections board challenged, and Griffin appealed, seeking to have that case dismissed. 
Two weeks ago, the state Supreme Court denied his appeal and returned the case to the lower court for further action.
This week, the corrections board sent a letter written by Mehdizadegan certifying its need to hire an independent counsel because of Griffin’s conflict of interest in representing the state against the board.

And it’s not your stereotypical dairy operation.

Dari Processing, a fourth-generation company run by the Tuls family, which also owns Tuls Dairies of Rising City, expects eventually to haul in 1.8 million pounds of cow milk daily. The 240,000-square-foot facility will then process and package shelf-stable milk — which needs no refrigeration.
Popular in places like Europe and New Zealand and starting to catch on in the U.S., the aseptic milk can stay on the shelf for up to a year until opened. That’s possible through ultra-high temperature pasteurization and a sterile packaging process that will take place at the site.
Among key products to be distributed nationally and perhaps worldwide will be Dari’s Moo’v, a high-protein, lactose-free milk that comes in multiple flavors and kid-friendly packaging. 
TJ Tuls, at a groundbreaking event Wednesday, said that since he was a kid he wanted to be a pilot or follow dad, Todd, into the dairy farm business. But he said he knew the dairy industry had to evolve and modernize, and the new plant venture rising on nearly 40 acres will provide room for ideas and products to grow.
“We’re looking to level up dairy,” he said. 
Aging dairy processing plants
Tuls, his dad, his son and other family members were joined by Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, Seward Mayor Josh Eickmeier and other business and dairy leaders for the groundbreaking of the Dari facility at the Seward Rail Park.
The still-developing industrial park serving the Seward and Lincoln region is attractive for its proximity to Interstate 80, the BNSF railroad mainline, an airport and a regional workforce pool that includes the City of Lincoln. 
Tuls, during a YouTube interview, said another state also had been in the running, but Nebraska “wanted it significantly more” than the other.

Public funds boosting the Dari project include: $1 million in state-administered federal community development block grants, to be matched by the City of Seward; $8.6 million in tax-increment financing approved by the City of Seward and nearly $600,000 for infrastructure from a Department of Transportation economic opportunity program. DED also is awarding $500,000 of site and building development funds, and the state is helping to fund the extension of a main boulevard and sewer and water extensions to support the new plant.
Jonathan Jank, president and CEO of the Seward County Chamber & Development Partnership, said numerous partners helped secure the project. He said the last dairy processing plant built new in Nebraska was some six decades ago — in 1963.
“Today represents a generationally transformational project for our state’s dairy industry,” Jank said.
Not ‘almond nut juice’
Pillen, noting that his friendship with Todd Tuls goes back 25 years, said 95% of agriculture in Nebraska is family owned, and that he wants to see more family-owned brands in the state.
“I’ve seen enough Dollar Generals in this state to sink a ship,” he said. “No disrespect to publicly-traded companies, but we should be doing business with the family-owned businesses who are the stakeholders in our communities across the state. It’s who we are.”
He called the planned Dari operation — projected open in 2027 — a “big deal for Seward, the state of Nebraska and every family-owned ag business.”

Jim Pillen. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
Pillen, in an interview with Nebraska Examiner, referred to his disdain for products he says masquerade as milk — things like “almond nut juice.” He said the Dari processing plant should boost other dairy operations in the state. The plant, for example, will be processing milk from cows on area farms.
“Milk, just for the record, comes from cows, not from nuts,” he said, adding that the Dari operation “is focused on value-added agriculture.” 
Reduce fuel, energy use
Tuls told the group that Nebraska is a great state to milk cows and that his family has been doing that for four generations. 
But as milk plants have aged and operations slow, milk gets shipped farther away for processing.
“Adding new processing capacity helps ensure that we can continue our family’s legacy of milking cows here in Nebraska,” said Tuls. He projects that the plant will help keep 30% of the state’s milk production from being processed elsewhere and create more local jobs.

“By keeping Nebraska milk in Nebraska, we’ll reduce the amount of miles that trucks haul raw milk, reduce fuel usage and reduce our overall carbon footprint,” Tuls said.
He said the processing techniques at the state-of-the-art facility should give milk products a longer shelf life and eliminate the need for cooling prior to opening — helping also reduce the energy needed. 
“It’s the future of milk,” he said. 
Longer shelf life also opens more opportunities to ship finished projects domestically and globally, Tuls said, adding that the facility will be one of the few nationally that combines aseptic packaging and ultrafiltration into a single plant. 
“Ultrafiltration helps concentrate proteins and remove some of the lactose and sugars from milk, making it even healthier for you.”
‘Ducks in a row’
Jank said the Dari project helps close the gap needed to wrap up the first phase of the industrial park, which dates back about 15 years when planning began. Streets, power, other infrastructure and environmental concerns all were addressed in advance to create such shovel-ready sites ready to build on.

The first major business came around 2020, he said, with the opening of Petsource by Scoular’s $50 million freeze-dried pet food ingredient manufacturing facility. It has expanded since.
Other tenants include: WCR Inc., which builds and services heat exchangers; Levander’s Body Shop, and Plum Creek Seed Services. A Parker Baby facility also is to break ground this summer. 
Jank said he took on his current role 13 years ago and grabbed the baton to help recruit business and development for the industrial park area. 
“Nebraska really can’t grow without those sort of shovel-ready sites,” Jank said. “Businesses aren’t going to sit around and wait for communities to get their ducks in a row.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)NORTH PLATTE, Neb. — A Nebraska state senator announced this week that he has faced a serious form of skin cancer for the past two years but remains committed to finishing his term and seeking reelection in 2026.
State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte, in a Wednesday post, publicly announced to supporters that he was diagnosed the first week of January 2023 with metastatic melanoma, which can spread to other parts of the body. Jacobson said the cancer has spread to his right lung, and he’s continued a range of treatments over the past two years.
Jacobson said he’s faced challenges, including swelling and weakness in his legs and muscles, leading to occasional falls. The most recent led to a brief hospitalization this week.
“Despite these setbacks, I want to assure you that I am firmly on the path to recovery,” Jacobson wrote. “While my physical presence in the district may be limited at times during this healing process, please know that my commitment to serving our community remains unwavering.”
He continued: “My resolve to fight for the people of our district has never been stronger.”

Former Gov. Pete Ricketts appointed Jacobson to the Legislature in February 2022. Jacobson won a four-year term that November and can run for one more term under current limits. 
Legislative District 42 consists of Lincoln, Hooker, Thomas, McPherson and part of Perkins Counties. 
Jacobson is one of multiple senators who have faced public cancer diagnoses in recent years, including State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln and former State Sen. Tom Brewer of north-central Nebraska.
Jacobson announced his 2026 reelection campaign one week ago, when he pointed to his 2022 promise to put his district “over politics” and to get results. He currently chairs the Legislature’s Banking, Commerce and Insurance Committee.
The senator said he has received “excellent” care from North Platte’s Great Plains Health and the University of Nebraska Medical Center. He and his wife, Julie, thanked his care team.
Jacobson said he and his wife remain “cautiously optimistic as we face this journey together.”
“The continued prayers, kind words and support from constituents and colleagues mean the world to us,” Jacobson wrote, “and we are deeply grateful.”
No one else has announced intentions to seek Jacobson’s seat in 2026. The top two vote-getters of the nonpartisan legislative primary in May 2026 would advance to the November 2026 general election.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Memphis police arrested a man Wednesday and charged him with stalking, aggravated criminal trespass and attempted kidnapping after he went to Mayor Paul Young’s house Sunday night. 
Trenton Abston, 25, jumped a wall leading into the subdivision in which Young and his family live, according to a Facebook post by Young. 
Memphis police said in a statement on Facebook that Abston walked directly to Young’s home after accessing the subdivision. He had a taser, gloves, rope and duct tape in his vehicle when arrested, according to police. 
Police viewed public and private security camera footage after residents reported earlier this week they saw a man behaving suspiciously in the neighborhood. 
The incident came less than two days after Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were shot and killed and a Minnesota state senator and his wife were shot multiple times by Vance Boelter, who was arrested after a two-day manhunt. 
“In today’s climate, especially after the tragic events in Minnesota and the threats my wife and I often receive online, none of us can be too careful,” Young wrote on Facebook. “The link between angry online rhetoric and real-life violence is becoming undeniable.”
A state representative from Memphis raised concerns about the potential for political violence in the aftermath.
“No resident — no public servant, no child, no spouse — should ever have to fear for their safety because of their service,” said Democratic Rep. Torrey Harris in a social media statement. “Trespassing at (Young’s) home and threatening his family crosses every line of human decency. This is not disagreement — this is dangerous and reckless.”

Greg Gianforte vetoed a bill to boost private community solar projects across Montana, arguing it gives “vast, unfettered discretion” to the Public Service Commission to determine solar credits.
“While I appreciate the sponsor’s commitment to expanding energy production and his good intention with Senate Bill 188, the bill’s lack of guidance to and guardrails on the PSC gives me great pause,” said Gianforte, a Republican, in his veto letter.
Sponsored by Sen. Christopher Pope, D-Bozeman, SB 188 passed with significant bipartisan support, although Pope said Thursday he wasn’t immediately clear if it would be up for an automatic veto override poll.
However, he said he believes the governor had been “ill advised” on the bill, which offered the opportunity to lower the cost of power.
“It’s just really unfortunate,” Pope said. “This should have been a straight line, and it should have been an easy consideration, and a lot of Montanans would have benefited.”
The bill would have allowed multiple households or businesses to share one solar array.
It created a framework for developers, such as private parties or municipalities, to build a solar facility that generates from 50 kilowatts to five megawatts. They’d be then allowed to sell the electricity to subscribers within a service area and the subscribers would receive a bill credit for their share of the project.
In his June 13 veto letter, however, Gianforte said the bill departs from a strategy of “unleashing innovation” in energy. He said it mandates public utilities connect with the solar projects and assign credits — with rules adopted by the Montana Public Service Commission.
“It is impossible to predict how the PSC will proceed with implementing Senate Bill 188,” Gianforte said. “Without clear statutory guidelines and guardrails, current and future PSC members could allow excessive credit rates, which consequently would impose unreasonable costs on ratepayers.”
Pope said he and other bill supporters are “extremely disappointed” the legislation got as far as it did without getting across the finish line, mainly because it “has so many opportunities to improve the Montana economy” and “create quality jobs.”
He also said it would have provided a potentially less expensive way to produce electricity over the long term.
The bill was not expected to cost the state any money.
“It’s very much supported by people across the state who are excited about the environmental stewardship that solar energy provides,” Pope said.
But he said the bill drew support from a diverse coalition.
It included an advocate from the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a conservative lobbying group, who Pope said had an interest in the energy independence and consumer protection the legislation offered.
He said Big Sky Resort supported it, as did environmental groups and the mayors of Billings, Bozeman and Missoula.
He estimated it received 180 letters of support from the business community expressing an interest in investing in the Montana energy economy through the bill.
“It restored my hope that someday we’ll get back to a place where people of all different walks of life and points of view can find common ground and move ahead in a way that does no harm,” Pope said.
He also said NorthWestern Energy and Montana-Dakota Utilities testified against the bill at numerous public hearings.
“They have a right to support or not support things that would be in their interests, but they are routinely unable to put more modern approaches to energy generation and also consumer economics and other things into their playbook,” Pope said. “And it’s disappointing.”
In a statement, Northern Plains Resource Council member Scott Sweeney said the bill could have provided needed financial relief to Montana ratepayers.
He said Montanans are experiencing tough economic challenges, especially as NorthWestern Energy continues to raise rates, recently in advance of approval by the PSC.
“Gov. Gianforte is clearly out of touch, and this veto puts the interests of wealthy, corporate energy executives above the needs of Montana’s families, small business owners, farmers, and ranchers,” said Sweeney, also retired general manager of Fergus Electric Cooperative.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1187889308-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-06-18 20:59:26.645723

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Over 100 state and local officials from the Midwest and West, including  North Dakota and South Dakota, are asking the U.S. Senate to eliminate tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration as part of a federal budget reconciliation bill.
Established by Congress and then-President George W. Bush in 2008, the 45Q tax credits incentivize companies to capture carbon dioxide from processes such as ethanol production and sequester it underground, so it won’t contribute to climate change by acting as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The carbon can also be sequestered as part of enhanced oil recovery, in which pressurized gas is used to push more oil to the surface.
Opponents say the credits don’t work as intended.
“The 45Q tax credits really only make sense to the industries that are poised to make billions of dollars from them,” said North Dakota state Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo. “They are supposedly intended to reduce carbon emissions, but in fact, 45Q tax credits pay polluters for polluting and subsidize private oil production at the expense of the taxpayer.”
Companies receive up to $85 per metric ton for regular sequestration and up to $60 per metric ton for sequestration via enhanced oil recovery — though there is a provision in a draft portion of the Senate reconciliation bill that would raise the maximum oil recovery credit to $85.
The repeal effort includes officials from Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. A few of those officials held a virtual press conference Wednesday.
South Dakota state Sen. Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, described the tax credits as wasteful spending.
“We are concerned about preserving taxpayer dollars, and I guess that’s the main gist of our conference today,” Hohn said.
Mathern said repealing the tax credits would put projects like Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed five-state carbon dioxide pipeline “in dire danger.”
“And that’s really positive,” he said.
Summit’s project alone could qualify for more than $1 billion annually from 45Q credits. It aims to capture some of the CO2 emitted by dozens of ethanol plants and ship the carbon via pipeline to a sequestration area southeast of the oilfields in western North Dakota.
North Dakota approves CO2 storage for Summit pipeline

Earlier this year, South Dakota’s legislators and governor adopted a law banning the use of a legal process known as eminent domain to acquire land access for carbon dioxide pipelines. South Dakota regulators also rejected Summit’s project application, saying there was no path forward for the project under the eminent domain ban.
Those moves came after several years of anti-pipeline activism by landowners focused on property rights and the danger from potential leaks of toxic carbon dioxide plumes. The project has permits in other states, but some of those are being challenged in court.
Congressional Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move a budget package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. The House recently passed its version of the bill without a repeal of the 45Q tax credits. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, voted for the bill.
A spokesperson for Johnson sent a statement when asked via email if the congressman supports repealing the tax credits: “While Dusty wished the reconciliation bill was more conservative, he voted in favor of it when it passed the House. We’ll see what the Senate passes.”
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, said Rounds met with a group of South Dakota lawmakers when they traveled to D.C. to voice opposition to the 45Q tax credits.
“Senator Rounds has long held the belief that many industry specific tax credits should not be perpetual, a belief which this group of landowners shares,” the statement said. “However, he has not had a chance to hear details of President Trump’s interest in this program. While many in South Dakota may oppose 45Q, it has been a popular proposal for other states for almost two decades and was included in the House-passed reconciliation bill.”
The office of Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, did not respond to South Dakota Searchlight’s request for his position.

(Courtesy of attorney general office)Last fall, thousands of businesses and charities received bills that appeared to be from the state of Washington.
Many recipients obliged, sending payments totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars in response to the state’s “Corporations & Charities Division.”
While that agency exists within the secretary of state’s office, the letters were part of a fraud and money laundering scheme carried out by a former postal worker arrested this week, according to an indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle. 
Johnny Nguyen faces 11 counts of mail fraud and money laundering. The San Jose, California, man was arrested Tuesday in northern California.
Nguyen, 49, sent the letters with billing statements on fake Washington state government letterhead, according to the indictment. The notices said payment was required for business and nonprofit filing fees. One example tells a business it owes $230, well beyond what the state charges.
The official-looking letters directed victims to send checks payable to “Business Entities” to post office boxes he’d rented, including in Olympia. Months earlier, Nguyen formed a company in California under that name, according to the charges.
On top of 350 checks worth $82,000 from Washington, the defendant deposited another 60 from California totaling $8,600, prosecutors allege. The indictment calls for Nguyen to forfeit the more than $90,000 he is accused of receiving.
Investigators reportedly seized another 1,700 checks worth $395,000 before Nguyen could deposit them.
After receiving the money, Nguyen would make transactions trying to conceal its source, according to court documents.
After numerous complaints last year, the Washington secretary of state and attorney general’s offices warned businesses of the fraudulent letters.
“Washington businesses are a foundational aspect of our state and critical to our economy’s health,” Secretary of State Steve Hobbs said at the time. “Business owners deserve to feel protected and equipped with information to deny malicious attempts on their franchise.” 
Then-Attorney General Bob Ferguson identified a couple clues indicating this was a scam last year. One of the letters listed a Sacramento address on the letterhead. A QR code on the document also went to a .org website instead of a .gov address.
Businesses can verify their filing status on the secretary of state’s Corporations and Charities Filing System.
The secretary of state also lists tips on its website to help businesses identify fraudulent solicitations. The U.S. attorney’s office in Seattle suggests calling the agency that sent the communication using a phone number on its website to verify its legitimacy.
Nguyen is scheduled to appear in court July 1.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/f3d866a3-dadd-0800-ebd7-52f1c5d03805-scaled-e1733442700108-1024x609.jpg,,,2025-06-18 20:03:15.119840

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The U.S. Supreme Court sided with Utah and Oklahoma on Wednesday in a case that started over disagreements with the Clean Air Act, and evolved into a debate over where certain lawsuits could be heard. 
The high court issued a unanimous opinion in Oklahoma v. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday, ruling that local courts can hear objections to federal air quality laws, rather than defer to courts in Washington D.C. 
The case stems from a 2015 decision by the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, that made air quality standards for ozone more strict. 
Ozone pollution happens when nitrogen oxides react with volatile organic compounds, often called VOCs, according to the EPA. Essentially, when pollutants from cars, refineries, boilers and other sources of emissions react to sunlight and hot temperatures, ground-level ozone forms.
Ozone pollution can be common in Utah, especially during summer months. It’s been linked to a number of health issues, causing respiratory problems and even intellectual disabilities, according to a recent study from the University of Utah. 
States were required to submit plans outlining their compliance with the new ozone standards, which included how they would adhere to the Clean Air Act’s “good neighbor” provision — essentially, how the state would try to reign in emissions that might impact air quality in other states.

The EPA rejected plans put forward by 21 states, including Utah and Oklahoma, which sued the agency in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado. But the EPA argued the lawsuits should be heard in a Washington D.C. Circuit Court, since its rule disapproving of the state air quality plans constituted a “single, nationally applicable action.” 
The Colorado court complied — but Utah and Oklahoma disagreed, instead taking the issue of jurisdiction to the Supreme Court. 
And in Wednesday’s opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court agreed, handing the case back to the 10th Circuit in Colorado. 
“These two disapprovals are undisputedly locally or regionally applicable actions. A (state implementation plan) is a state-specific plan, so an EPA disapproval on its face applies only to the State that proposed the (state implementation plan),” Thomas wrote. 
In a statement, Utah Attorney General Derek Brown celebrated the ruling, describing it as a win for Utah. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The Court agreed with Utah’s argument involving the Clean Air Act that local courts should handle local issues, and the federal government should collaborate with the states — not ignore their unique differences,” Brown said. “We are also grateful to the Trump Administration’s EPA for reconsidering its ruling that required litigation in the first place, and look forward to our continued partnership on behalf of Utah.”

A lightning-caused wildfire west of Pinedale was burning across more than 1,300 acres Wednesday, and largely uncontained. Though the blaze is sizable for this time of year, two officials told WyoFile it wasn’t an early indicator of a difficult fire season.
The post Wyoming Range wildfire’s considerable size doesn’t portend extreme season, officials say app[...]","A wildfire burning in the Wyoming Range due west of Pinedale grew to more than 1,300 acres as of Wednesday afternoon, five days after a lightning strike ignited it.
Though the fire is sizable for the time of year, a U.S. Forest Service spokesperson and the Wyoming State Forester told WyoFile the blaze wasn’t an early indicator of a difficult fire season. Instead, they attributed the fire’s growth to a bounty of dead and downed trees in that part of the Wyoming Range, and to the area’s high elevation — where conifer trees and other plants have not loaded up as heavily with moisture for a spring “green up” as they have in Wyoming’s valleys and plains. 
Dubbed the Horse Fire, the conflagration has not shown extreme fire behavior or made any big, dramatic runs that can quickly increase a fire’s size, Bridger-Teton National Forest spokesperson Mary Cernicek said. The fire has forced the closure of portions of several forest service roads in the area, including Horse Creek Road, both for public safety and because they’re seeing heavy use from firefighters and equipment. 

Firefighters also wrapped a historic fire lookout post on Prospect Peak with a layer of the material used in fire shelters — a mix of aluminum and other materials that firefighters will cover themselves in as a last resort when trapped by the flames. Other than the lookout, there does not appear to be any significant threat to structures. 
The fire is burning in an area of conifer forests and meadows, at an elevation where there are still a few patches of snow on the ground, Cernicek said. But the flames have grown in intensity most afternoons alongside the winds, she added. The area is currently listed as at moderate fire danger, but on June 13, the day the fire ignited, that segment of the national forest was listed as in low fire danger. 
But that doesn’t mean fires won’t start and grow. “The misconception is if it’s low fire danger, there’s no chance of fire,” Cernicek said, but “it started in just perfect conditions,” for a fire, even if the danger for rapid spread was low overall. 
There are 208 people working on the fire, including hot shot crews, helicopters and fire engines, according to the Horse Fire Inciweb page – Inciweb is a government website where fire updates are posted throughout the year. The approach is “full suppression,” Cernicek said, “and it has been since the beginning.” Tough terrain and thick downed trees have made firefighters’ job challenging and led to a strategic suppression strategy, she said. As of 5 p.m. Wednesday, Inciweb only listed 6% of the fire’s perimeter as contained.
Because it’s early season and the West isn’t confronting large or dangerous wildfires yet, plenty of personnel and resources are available, Cernicek said. 
Early spring and fall fires are common in the mountains of western Wyoming, State Forester Kelly Norris told WyoFile. Worse fires come in the fall, when spring’s new growth dries out and becomes combustible. A June wildfire “is typical and is going to continue to be typical in that area just because of the amount of dead trees we have in those forests,” Norris said. 
She expected an aggressive response to the Horse Fire. “It’s not the easiest place to go full suppression … but our expectation is for firefighters to make a point to put that out,” she said.

So far, weather and fuel modeling at this point in the year suggest an average wildfire season for Wyoming, Norris said. But as Wyomingites know, high winds and drying weather can change a fire season’s projection in an instant. 
“We were to have an average fire season last year too, and that didn’t turn out as expected,” Norris said.
Wyoming had a record-breaking, and state bank account-draining, fire season in 2024. Wildfires burned across 840,000 acres in grasslands and mountains across the state, a season surpassed only by the famous 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park. About half of last year’s acreage burned in four big fires in the northeastern part of the state in late August. 
Once again this year, the northeastern corner of the state, stretching into the Bighorns, is predicted to have a higher-than-normal fire risk come August and September, Norris said. Modeling predicts high temperatures and reduced precipitation later in summer, despite a rainy May and June across the grasslands. Spring grass fires are also not unusual, she noted, but Wyoming has not seen any so far this year. 
“We know the [precipitation] faucet is turning off sooner rather than later,” Norris said. “It does not take much in Wyoming, with the amount of wind and a lack of moisture, for fire danger to increase quickly.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.

The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

Charles Dalzell, 46, of St. Thomas, made his initial appearance by video from the Grand Forks County jail before Magistrate Judge Alice Senechal at the federal courthouse in Fargo.
Dalzell and his attorney, public defender Rhiannon Gorham, requested an immediate hearing to determine if he could be released while awaiting trial on charges of making interstate threats to injure another person and threatening to assault, kidnap or murder a United States official.

In making the case that Dalzell should stay in jail, Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Lee said Dalzell had recently gone to the Pembina County Sheriff’s Office to retrieve a gun that had been confiscated from him in connection with another case. 
“I don’t think it’s a coincidence that he’s going to the sheriff’s office to retrieve a firearm,” Lee said. 
Dalzell is accused of sending a threatening email Sunday to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in North Dakota that references the shooting death of a Minnesota state representative. 
“I don’t want this situation to end up like Minnesota over the weekend,” Dalzell wrote, according to the criminal complaint in the case. 
Lee said investigators found methamphetamine and a machete at Dalzell’s property after Dalzell was arrested Monday. 
Senechal cited the seriousness of the charges, the information from Lee and Dalzell’s criminal history in ordering that Dalzell remain in custody. 
Dalzell responded by begging the judge to allow him to visit his mother, who he says is dying of cancer. 
“Let me say goodbye to my mother,” an emotional Dalzell asked the judge. “I want to tell her I love her.” 
Senechal declined to change her order. 
North Dakota man charged with threatening official after email citing Minnesota shootings

The complaint says Dalzell initially contacted the U.S. Attorney’s Office in February 2024 raising concerns about an attorney he hired to assist him with a property issue. Dalzell indicated in the 2024 email he was considering violence against the individual, according to court filings.
FBI agents in February warned him that his emails were “borderline threatening” and that it is against the law to threaten people over the internet, the complaint says.
In Sunday’s email — addressed to a U.S. Attorney’s Office employee whom court records identify as “J.P.” — Dalzell claims he was being ignored by federal and state officials, law enforcement and a judge.
Dalzell on Wednesday said Gov. Kelly Armstrong was “breaching his oath of office.” 
Dalzell maintained that he is not a threat to anyone. 
He said the gun was taken from him in relation to a disorderly conduct case. He said he only swore at a group of juveniles and the gun was not involved, but was taken away.
Dalzell’s criminal history also includes other convictions for disorderly conduct, as well as criminal mischief and domestic violence, court records show.

In the 15 years since the famous “Citizens United” court case, which opened the floodgates for more spending in political races, the amount of money spent on federal elections has increased 2,800%.
Former U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana who was unseated by Republican Tim Sheehy, outspent his opponent in 2024 and still lost, with estimates of the single Senate seat race spending totaling $275 million — without a primary election challenger.
When Tester first ran for the Senate in 2006, the primary and general election spending was $27.5 million.
As spending in politics has continued to balloon, leaders in Montana, spurred on by former Commissioner of Political Practice Jeff Mangan, have kicked off an initiative to put a new idea forward for curbing the influence of dark money in politics. Dark money is a term used where corporations or organizations don’t have to disclose their donors or their gifted amounts, making it nearly impossible to tell who is involved in some political campaigns.
The idea, called the “Transparent Election Initiative,” would be a state constitutional amendment that would simply prohibit corporations from making political campaign donations, using the state’s power to control how corporations operate in the state. Mangan kicked off the initiative in a call with reporters on Wednesday.
While the organizers of the initiative have not released the text of the amendment, which they say is still being drafted and perfected, the idea is simple: Corporations doing business in Montana would be barred from spending money on political campaigns. However, individuals would still be free to donate as the law allows.
Former Gov. Marc Racicot, a Republican governor who was at one time chairman of the Republican National Committee, is supporting the measure, as well as Tester, because of its straightforward approach. Racicot, who also served as the state’s attorney general, explained that the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives states the right to regulate commerce and corporations that do business in the state. Therefore, by simply making it illegal for any corporation to spend on political campaigns, Racicot said the state is exercising the power the federal government gives each state to regulate commerce.
The organizers of the initiative admit they may face a United States Supreme Court that has seemed to give increasing power to corporations and has equated the power to spend money freely as a part of protected political speech, but they said the high court cannot avoid the constitution’s power given to the states to regulate commerce. Furthermore, Mangan, who is also an attorney, and Racicot, argued that while corporations enjoy some of the same protections as individuals, there is a host of things corporations cannot do. That includes voting or sitting on juries.
Mangan said the genesis for the idea is nonpartisan: Residents are fed up with how much money is being spent on campaigns, the flooding of media and mailboxes with attack ads, and no transparency when it comes to identifying groups behind the messages.
“States have always had the ability to limit the corporations in their states, they have just chosen not to,” Mangan said.
He said states can revoke or modify the charters that allow corporations to operate within their borders, and this would be just one example of limiting their scope of business.
At one time, Montana had some of the strictest campaign laws in the country, and a history of grass-roots efforts to fight against corporations and wealthy individuals when it came to campaigning, based upon its checkered past when copper and gold mining magnates ran roughshod over the politics of the state. More than a century ago, Montana established the Corrupt Practices Act which barred certain political activities. However, many of those same laws fell after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision because the high court ruled in a 5-to-4 split decision that spending money to support causes or candidates amounted to political speech, which is protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution. Since then, organizations and leaders have tried to re-establish campaign laws, with little success.
Tester said that states like Montana will have to take the lead on these initiatives because Congress — the very body that could make the changes — is too tied to the funding and money raised by dark money and corporations.
“The notion that Congress will do something about this is foolish,” Racicot said.
Tester said the issue of taking money out of politics appeals to citizens, regardless of party affiliation.
“Not once during my time in the Senate did someone say to me, ‘You know what? We need to spend more on campaigns,’” Tester said.
Mangan said when trying to figure out how to reform the election system while respecting the U.S. Supreme Court, they went back to the future, so to speak, borrowing a power from when states had to push back against large corporate interests, like railroads.
“I am almost shocked this hasn’t been done before,” Racicot said. “And it’s important no person’s rights are being restrained. It’s profoundly simple: The state gives corporations power in the first place. In this case, you’re just telling them they don’t have the power to spend money like this in the first place.”
“Montana has a long history of standing up against corruption in politics,” said Sarah Haan, a professor at Washington & Lee University’s School of Law. “Now it is taking the lead with a powerful new solution: Treat electioneering as a state-conferred power, not an intrinsic right. The Montana Plan restores democratic accountability to the people without treading on anyone’s speech.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1380958948-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 20:03:15.119840

(Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images)Gov. Patrick Morrisey celebrated a decision from the United States Supreme Court released on Wednesday that upholds a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors.
The decision in U.S. v. Skrmetti overturned a lower court’s previous finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent the case to the high court.
The court ruled 6-3 on Wednesday that children who seek such treatment don’t qualify as a protected class. Since they are not being denied the medications due to their sex, barring the treatments is not discrimination. 
In a statement, Morrisey said he is “optimistic” that the ruling from the nation’s highest court will allow West Virginia to enforce its “common sense law” that bars trans children from playing on sports teams that match their gender identity.
That law was passed under Gov. Jim Justice in 2021. In May 2021, the West Virginia arm of the American Civil Liberties Union along with Lambda Legal filed a lawsuit, B.P.J. vs. the West Virginia Board of Education, against the state challenging the law. The ACLU and Lambda Legal were representing Becky Pepper-Jackson, who was 12 years old at the time and who would have been kicked off of her middle school track team if the law was enforced.
The U.S. Court of Appeals in February 2023 blocked the state from removing Pepper-Jackson from her school’s track and field team as legal advocates appealed a lower court’s ruling upholding the ban. Two months later, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a request from Morrisey — acting then as the state’s attorney general — to overturn the lower courts decision and enforce the law by removing Pepper-Jackson from her track team.
In April 2024, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the state’s law, saying it violated transgender students’ rights under Title IX, a federal civil rights law prohibiting discrimination based on sex in education programs.
Following that ruling, Morrisey again asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case and review the state’s trans athlete ban.
In his statement Wednesday, Morrisey did not specify how he believed that the ruling on Tennessee’s gender-affirming care ban would support West Virginia’s legal fight against Pepper-Jackson. He said he was “grateful” for the ruling, which represented a “big step forward” toward removing the current injunction. 
This legislative session, lawmakers passed a near-total ban on gender-affirming care for minors. Senate Bill 299 closed loopholes left open in a previous bill that law allowed children diagnosed with severe gender dysphoria to receive medical therapy, including hormonal treatment, if they are considered at risk for self-harm or suicide.
Medical treatments for children with gender dysphoria can include prescribing certain hormones or hormone blockers, which delay the onset of puberty temporarily to stop the development of permanent physical characteristics that don’t match the child’s gender identity. 
Studies show these medical interventions are highly successful in preventing long term and serious psychological issues — including depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation, which are already more common in transgender youth and adults than their cisgender peers.
The Women’s Health Centers of West Virginia and Maryland — one of only a few remaining providers for gender-affirming care in the Mountain State — issued a statement Wednesday saying the Supreme Court’s decision “threatens access to essential, often life-saving care for transgender youth across the country.”
“By allowing this cruel and discriminatory law to stand, the Court has set a dangerous precedent, one that could further erode access to critical health care and embolden states to escalate their attacks on trans communities,” said Danielle Maness, interim executive director for the clinics. “At the Women’s Health Centers of West Virginia and Maryland, we remain resolute … We will not back down. We will keep showing up for a future in which bodily autonomy is the right of every Appalachian.”
Maness said the clinics will continue to provide gender-affirming care to adults in West Virginia and to children in Maryland.
“We do this because each of us deserves the right to make decisions about our bodies, futures and care with dignity and support,” Maness continued.
According to a 2024 survey by the LGBTQ advocacy nonprofit The Trevor Project, 51% of trans and non-binary children in West Virginia considered suicide in the previous year while 16% of them attempted suicide. 
Nationwide, states that have implemented bans on gender-affirming care for children have seen a significant increase in suicide attempts by transgender and gender nonconforming teenagers in the years following those bans taking effect. 
Doctors warned West Virginia lawmakers during the session that if SB 299 were to become law, they will likely see an increase in anxiety, depression and suicide among the state’s trans and nonbinary children.
That possibility will now occur as the Trump Administration also on Wednesday made cuts to the national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, ending specialized suicide prevention services for LGBTQ+ youth.

“Our investigations division, they’re running with a standard investigation, just like we would do with any similar such incident, just to investigate if there’s anything that could have gone better or not,” said Lt. Matt Naylor, public affairs officer for the Coast Guard sector covering Southeast Alaska.
“Thankfully, nobody appeared to be injured. There didn’t appear to be any significant damage, so they’re going to be proceeding forward with that investigation, and we’ve gotten some videos from the public already, which have been super helpful,” he said.
On Monday, a sudden storm prompted the National Weather Service to issue the first-ever severe thunderstorm warning for Alaska’s capital city.
High winds and heavy rain hit Juneau’s port, where the cruise ship Celebrity Edge was moored at the AJ Dock, a privately owned facility.
Videos taken by local residents and shared on social media appear to show the ship breaking its moorings and being blown toward the Carnival Luminosa, another cruise ship moored in the middle of the port.
The Edge’s drift stops only when it drops anchor in the middle of the port, halting it short of the Luminosa, which later maneuvers further away and leaves the port.
The Edge later returned to shore without incident.
After the near-miss, the Coast Guard put out a call on local social media, asking for additional videos. Thanks to local residents, it no longer needs videos, Lt. Naylor said.
“At this point, we’ve gotten tons of submissions,” he said.
Naylor was unable to say on Tuesday how long the Coast Guard’s investigation will take.
“We’re grateful for everybody who has submitted videos to us, and we are especially grateful that this did not end up being anything bigger than it was, with no injuries and no significant damage,” he said.
“That’s what we’re the most grateful for, and we’re grateful to the crews of all the ships that were involved for their fast action.”

Kansas’ uninsured rate dropped from 17.5% in 2013 to 11.9% in 2023. The number of Kansas adults who said they went without care at least once because of cost decreased from 13.6% of adults in 2013 to 11% in 2023.
But those gains are at risk, said David Radley, senior scientist for the organization.
“The Congressional Budget Office estimates that legislation currently making its way through Congress would allow the premium tax credits to expire and to make it harder for low-income people to maintain their Medicaid coverage,” he said at a Tuesday media briefing.

Nine of the 10 states that haven’t expanded Medicaid, including Kansas, scored worse than the national average, according to the fund’s performance measures.
Disparities are expected to increase as federal changes to Medicaid and marketplace subsidies loom. States that haven’t expanded Medicaid, including Kansas, are still likely to see significant detrimental impacts, particularly in the marketplace, if cuts proceed.
Thirty-three percent of low-income Kansans younger than 65 pay high out-of-pocket costs for care, which increased from 29% in 2019, the scorecard found.
Black Kansans are at least three times as likely to die early from preventable and treatable causes as other racial groups. In every state, avoidable premature deaths among Black residents were elevated, but Kansas’ rate is one of the worst. Overall, Kansas’ health system underperforms for Black residents, the scorecard found. 
Sara Collins, senior scholar and vice president of the fund, said she fears federal changes could cause states to backtrack. States already struggling could fall even further behind, she said.
“Federal policy changes, both underway and proposed,” Collins said, “threaten to reverse the improvements achieved by states, exacerbate areas of slippage, and deepen geographic income and racial and ethnic disparities and health outcomes.”
The Affordable Care Act, which allowed states to expand Medicaid coverage to low-income adults, was put in place because not everyone had health insurance through an employer, Collins said. Expanded Medicaid and marketplaces subsidies were ways to address that gap, which encompassed 49 million people who lacked health insurance, she said.
“And as we make it harder for people to access both of those, we’re likely to see people just becoming uninsured because the reality is they still won’t have access to employer-based coverage,” she said.
According to a separate analysis from the Commonwealth Fund, an estimated 66,000 people in Kansas will become uninsured in the next decade if Congress allows the extra premium tax credits that subsidize health plans on the marketplace to expire.
Based on 2023 data, the scorecard ranked Kansas 35th for health care access and affordability and 50th in income disparity.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2176362473-scaled-1-1024x618.jpg,,,2025-06-18 19:05:50.249212

Melissa Hortman talks to colleagues during a special legislative session Monday, June 9, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)On the last scheduled day of the legislative session, amid contentious debate on the state budget, House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) stepped down from the rostrum to introduce a resolution expressing condolences to the members of the Minnesota Legislature for the deaths of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman.
The Hortmans were shot early Saturday morning in an apparent political assassination. Another Minnesota lawmaker, Democratic Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife were also shot multiple times, though survived with injuries.
“Sometimes the bad things that happen in our nation and our world can feel distant and maybe hollow, as just another headline in the news,” Fecteau said. In this case, however, it was a headline about someone I knew, someone I served with, and someone who I appreciated so much for her leadership, her tenacity, and just her general good spirit.”
Fecteau got to know Hortman, who previously served as Speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, while serving on the board of the Democratic Leadership Campaign Committee, a national group focused on electing Democrats to state government. 
The comments came shortly after the chamber held an intense debate over the state budget proposal, and followed months of fighting and acrimony between some members over several contentious issues, including Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn)’s censure for sharing personal details about a transgender teen on her legislative Facebook page.
Minutes before, Rep. Laurie Osher (D-Orono) presented a seperate resolution in recognition of Pride Month and shared how she had received death threats for her work on issues related to LGBTQ+ rights. 
Since the shooting in Minnesota, Maine has removed lawmakers’ home addresses from the Legislature’s website.
Rumors have spread online about the motive of Hortman’s alleged killer, Vance Boelter, though interviews with people who knew him as well as reporting reveal a record of anti-abortion and LGBTQ+ sermons and beliefs. 
Fecteau went on to say that he “can’t help but think about the division that continues to worsen here in our nation, the inflamed rhetoric, which is less and less about the issues we debate in this chamber every day, and more and more about how certain leaders are inherently evil, because of their party affiliation, policy position, or both.” 
He said hopes that what people take from this tragedy is “that we cannot continue to normalize this contempt we have for each other. This contempt that we have for another party, and that we will not normalize political violence in this nation.”
The resolution was adopted in the Senate without discussion and in the House after several members of both parties expressed similar sentiments and, in a few cases, other personal experiences with Hortman.
Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) explained that she is originally from Minnesota and when she was weighing whether to run for speaker, was told to reach out to Hortman, who she said took the time to talk to her and give her advice.
“I think the greatest thing I’ve learned from being in this House is how easy it is to reach across the aisle, how easy it is to make friends, and I’m very appreciative for that,” Roeder added.
House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor), who did not know Hortman, said that we as a nation must “dial down the political rhetoric.” 
“Political disagreements are part of democracy, but hatred, violence and dehumanization have no place in public life,” Faulkingham said. “It’s time to do better for the memory of Speaker Hortman and all victims of political violence.”

Last year, 12% of respondents in Quebec told the Canadian Automobile Association that they intend to visit the U.S. this summer. This year, it’s just 4%.

Hill Farmstead has always had a hardcore contingent of Canadian fans. But even the award-winning brewery is facing boycotts from Quebecers frustrated with the Trump Administration. 
Nestled in the hills of the Northeast Kingdom in Greensboro, just a few dozen miles from the northern border, Hill Farmstead has proved a must-stop destination for cross-border beer lovers passing through the area.
“For our 15 years, we’ve had a huge, huge Canadian following, particularly with our friends from Montreal,” said Bob Montgomery, Hill Farmstead’s director of brand quality. 
In recent months, though, as President Donald Trump has inflamed tensions between the U.S. and Canada with his volatile tariff policies and threatening rhetoric, a mass movement to avoid the U.S. has taken hold in Canada, and the steady flow of visitors from up north has noticeably slowed. 
Since March, Canadians have accounted for 25-30% less traffic on the brewery’s website than they usually do, Montgomery said. And some Canadians who had purchased tickets for the brewery’s sold out 15th Anniversary Celebration have said that they won’t be coming and are even attempting to resell their tickets en masse. 
“Given the current circumstances, they’ve been choosing not to visit the United States and to spend their money at home instead,” Montgomery said.
President Donald Trump first sparked outrage among Canadians in February, when he imposed tariffs on most Canadian imports, a plan he has since adjusted and paused a handful of times. At the same time, he has made repeated rhetorical jabs at Canada, including threats to turn it into “the 51st state.” 
Canada responded by hitting U.S. imports with retaliatory tariffs, and a number of Canadian provinces have pulled American products from their shelves. 
But even as the tariff tit-for-tat has largely burned itself out, with both countries having repealed or delayed many of the levies they initially declared, a grassroots movement to boycott American goods and avoid travel to the U.S. has persisted in Canada, more inspired by Trump’s rhetoric and personality than his policies.

By the numbers
According to a recent survey from the Canadian Automobile Association—the Canadian equivalent of AAA—only 4% of Quebecers intend to visit the U.S. this summer, compared with 12% of survey respondents who said they planned to do so in 2024.
“Some Quebecers are just boycotting the United States while Trump is president,” said Shanny Hallé, a spokesperson for Tourism Eastern Townships. “There’s a message they’re sending that they want to keep their money here.”
The impacts of the boycott have been especially stark in Vermont, particularly in the northernmost parts of the state, where many towns and businesses that hug the northern border rely on Canadian tourism for much of their revenue.

About 750,000 Canadians visit Vermont each year, contributing about $150 million to the state’s economy, according to data from the Vermont Department of Tourism and Marketing. And although Canadians account for about 5% of tourists statewide, visitors from up north account for over 30% of visitors to the northernmost counties. 
As peak summer season approaches, the loss is already being felt. 
Canadian reservations at hotels and inns across the state have decreased by up to 45% since February, said Kim Donahue, president of the Vermont Lodging Association. And according to data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, border crossings from Canada into Vermont have plummeted in recent months. In March and April, roughly 30% fewer people crossed over into the U.S. by car than did at the same time last year.
Canadians usually represent roughly half of yearly visitors at Jay Peak Resort, according to president and general manager Steve Wright. In recent months, however, Wright said that the resort has seen a sharp decline in visitors from Canada, a trend he projects to continue through the year.

Located just south of the border, the Northeast Kingdom ski resort has for decades accepted Canadian currency at par with the U.S. dollar, a strong lure for Canadians, who can buy ski lift passes and waterpark admission tickets at a one-to-one exchange rate.
But according to Wright, ski season pass sales to Canadians for the upcoming winter are down about 35% from previous years.
Jay Peak is also home to an indoor ice rink, the venue for year-round youth hockey tournaments and camps that take place on an almost weekly basis. Of the 300 Canadian teams that usually participate in total, though, the resort is projecting that about half as many will show up this year.
“The amount of Canadian business that is on the books this year is about 50% off from where it should be,” Wright said.  
Jay Peak has also seen widespread cancellations from Canadians who had bookings at its golf course, he said.
In recent weeks, Wright has personally spoken to dozens of Canadian customers who have chosen to steer clear of the resort this year, most of whom cited Trump’s rhetoric in explaining their decision.

“I think that, in combination with everything else, is giving Canadians pause as they plan their summer and fall and winter vacations,” Wright said.
Abby Long, executive director of Kingdom Trails, said that she’s had similar conversations with longtime patrons who have decided to boycott the fabled mountain bike trail network this year.
“Earlier this year, we were definitely getting daily emails and Facebook messages from our Canadian friends who said, ‘We’ve come for years to Kingdom Trails. Please know we love the trails, but we won’t be visiting this summer,’” Long said. 
Currently, she said, just 12% of visitors to Kingdom Trails are Canadians, who represented about 24% of patrons at the same time last year. 
“We love our Canadian friends,” she said. “It’s really disheartening.”

Rebuilding bridges
As Canadian tourism continues to decline heading into the peak summer season, Vermont businesses and state officials have started extending olive branches to their counterparts in the north with the hopes of enticing Canadians to return to the Green Mountains.
On Monday, Gov. Phil Scott met with the leaders of other New England states and the premiers of five Canadian provinces in Massachusetts to discuss ways of thawing tensions, although it’s unclear what concrete steps, if any, were agreed upon. A few hours later, the Burlington City Council voted to temporarily rename Church Street “Canada Street” for the summer. 
Last week meanwhile, tourism leaders from northern Vermont traveled to Quebec for the inaugural meeting of the Cross Border Tourism Alliance, which was held at Léon Courville Vigneron, a winery in Fulford.
“We realize it’s a tricky time to be in tourism and hospitality right now, but Quebec and Vermont have always been close,” said Jeff Lawson, vice president of tourism for Hello Burlington, which put together the event. “It was sort of an opportunity to commiserate over the situation a bit.”
The new group hopes to hold meetings twice a year, a practice that Lawson hopes will foster longer term relationships, even if Canadians continue to boycott the U.S. for the foreseeable future.  
“Very few of us on either side of the border knew each other even though we’re miles apart,” Lawson said. “We’re trying to do our best to establish and maintain new connections.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A retired Douglas County District Court judge will be the next member of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission and jointly serve on the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission.
Gov. Jim Pillen on Wednesday announced the six-year appointment of former District Judge J. Michael Coffey of Omaha to the Liquor Commission. Coffey retired in June 2023 after nearly 25 years on the 4th Judicial District bench, currently only Douglas County. Coffey must be confirmed by the Legislature in 2026 to stay in his role.

Commissioners must draft licensing criteria for medical cannabis establishments by July 1 and begin awarding licenses by Oct. 1. The medical cannabis board’s next meeting is tentatively June 26. No agenda has yet been released.
Coffey, prior to former Gov. Ben Nelson appointing him to the district court in 1998, was a private attorney in Omaha. He earned his law degree from the Creighton University School of Law in 1974. 
He is a Vietnam War veteran, having served in the U.S. Army from 1969-1971.
A judicial oversight board in 2013 cleared Coffey of unethical behavior over a complaint from an ex-wife about how he had handled his daughter receiving a DUI conviction. The commission, in its report, wrote that a judge shouldn’t “lose his or her rights and responsibilities as a parent simply because he or she holds judicial office.”
The Nebraska State Bar Association, which Coffey served in leadership roles for, consistently recommended Coffey be retained in each of his local elections, in 2002, 2008, 2014 and 2020.
The Governor’s Office had no immediate answer about how many Nebraskans applied for the 2nd Congressional District vacancy on the Liquor Control Commission.
Pillen chose not to reappoint former Liquor Commissioner Harry Hoch, Jr., after Hoch’s term expired May 24. Pillen told the Nebraska Examiner it was “just time.” 
Hoch, who had 40 years of liquor industry knowledge, said Pillen’s chief of staff told him the governor wanted someone with more “cannabis experience.” 
Pillen’s announcement of Coffey did not mention the Medical Cannabis Commission. Coffey has presided over felony drug conviction cases or other cases involving marijuana, in addition to other legal experience.
Pointing to a phrase from former UCLA basketball Coach John Wooden, Pillen has said regulators must “be quick, but don’t hurry,” stating: “This is important we get it right.”
“We’re not going to become recreational [marijuana] as long as I’m your governor, like our state to the west,” Pillen said during his monthly call-in show Monday.

Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, listens to debate on the South Dakota Senate floor on Feb. 10, 2025. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight) Over 100 state and local officials from the Midwest and West, including South Dakota, are asking the U.S. Senate to eliminate tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration as part of a federal budget reconciliation bill.
Established by Congress and then-President George W. Bush in 2008, the 45Q tax credits incentivize companies to capture carbon dioxide from processes such as ethanol production and sequester it underground, so it won’t contribute to climate change by acting as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The carbon can also be sequestered as part of enhanced oil recovery, in which pressurized gas is used to push more oil to the surface.
Opponents say the credits don’t work as intended.
“The 45Q tax credits really only make sense to the industries that are poised to make billions of dollars from them,” said North Dakota state Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo. “They are supposedly intended to reduce carbon emissions, but in fact, 45Q tax credits pay polluters for polluting and subsidize private oil production at the expense of the taxpayer.”
South Dakota regulators deny carbon pipeline permit again, but company vows to reapply

Companies receive up to $85 per metric ton for regular sequestration and up to $60 per metric ton for sequestration via enhanced oil recovery — though there is a provision in a draft portion of the Senate reconciliation bill that would raise the maximum oil recovery credit to $85.
The repeal effort includes officials from Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. A few of those officials held a virtual press conference Wednesday. 
South Dakota state Sen. Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, described the tax credits as wasteful spending.
“We are concerned about preserving taxpayer dollars, and I guess that’s the main gist of our conference today,” Hohn said.
Mathern said repealing the tax credits would put projects like Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed five-state carbon dioxide pipeline “in dire danger.”
“And that’s really positive,” he said. 
Summit’s project alone could qualify for more than $1 billion annually from 45Q credits. It aims to capture some of the CO2 emitted by dozens of ethanol plants and ship the carbon via pipeline to a sequestration area southeast of the oilfields in western North Dakota.
Earlier this year, South Dakota’s legislators and governor adopted a law banning the use of a legal process known as eminent domain to acquire land access for carbon dioxide pipelines. South Dakota regulators also rejected Summit’s project application, saying there was no path forward for the project under the eminent domain ban.
Those moves came after several years of anti-pipeline activism by landowners focused on property rights and the danger from potential leaks of toxic carbon dioxide plumes. The project has permits in other states, but some of those are being challenged in court.

Congressional Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move a budget package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. The House recently passed its version of the bill without a repeal of the 45Q tax credits. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, voted for the bill.
A spokesperson for Johnson sent a statement when asked via email if the congressman supports repealing the tax credits: “While Dusty wished the reconciliation bill was more conservative, he voted in favor of it when it passed the House. We’ll see what the Senate passes.”
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, said Rounds met with a group of South Dakota lawmakers when they traveled to D.C. to voice opposition to the 45Q tax credits.
“Senator Rounds has long held the belief that many industry specific tax credits should not be perpetual, a belief which this group of landowners shares,” the statement said. “However, he has not had a chance to hear details of President Trump’s interest in this program. While many in South Dakota may oppose 45Q, it has been a popular proposal for other states for almost two decades and was included in the House-passed reconciliation bill.”

When Kimberly Terrell, a widely respected Tulane researcher and director of community engagement at the Environmental Law Clinic, recently resigned citing a “complete gag order,” it sent shockwaves through Louisiana and universities across the nation.
Emails and internal communications obtained by the Associated Press reveal a disturbing pattern: political and donor pressure — reportedly incited by powerful politicians — has led university leaders to mute research exposing racial and economic disparities in the petrochemical industry.










When universities permit political or financial interests to muzzle scholars, they betray their core mission: the free pursuit of knowledge.


Terrell’s work is data-driven, peer-reviewed, and courageous. Her study, published in Ecological Economics, showed what many communities have long suspected: in the heart of Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley,” Black residents shoulder the burden of pollution but are systematically excluded from the high-paying jobs that industrial development promises.
In parishes like St. John the Baptist, where 69% of the population is Black and education levels between Black and white residents are nearly equal, people of color remain vastly underrepresented in top-tier jobs. And yet, these same communities suffer the most from toxic emissions, high cancer rates, and declining air quality. It’s a lose-lose reality: no economic inclusion, and no environmental protection.
This isn’t conjecture; it’s rigorous empirical evidence. Good scholarship demands response, not repression.
Yet the response from some corners, which includes threats to Tulane’s state funding and warnings that her work threatens redevelopment projects, reframes academic research as a political liability. According to AP‐reported emails, the law clinic’s work “had become an impediment” to a downtown redevelopment project. Her research, in other words, was not faulty; it just could have stood in the way of more money.
Before resigning, Terrell had been barred from speaking to media, a stark example of institutional censorship. This is outrageous. When universities permit political or financial interests to muzzle scholars, they betray their core mission: the free pursuit of knowledge. Academic freedom is not a luxury — it is the very bedrock of institutional integrity.
Tulane’s reputation and independence now hinge upon its response. It must unequivocally affirm that the Environmental Law Clinic has the full support of university leadership. That includes restoring researchers’ and professors’ ability to speak, release peer-reviewed studies, and contribute meaningfully to public debate. If the university fails to do so, it risks signaling to current and future faculty that inconvenient facts can be smothered if they cross powerful interests. It risks becoming a research-by-permit institution where only politically palatable findings see the light of day.
This is not an isolated event in Louisiana. Earlier this year, LSU’s Professor Ken Levy, a tenured constitutional law scholar, was suspended after making pointed—and vulgar—remarks critical of top elected officials. His removal triggered fierce backlash, court battles, and a prolonged debate over whether political pressure now overrides academic norms.
Meanwhile, even LSU’s flagship research centers have faced scrutiny for allowing oil companies to appoint seats on research boards, raising concerns about corporate influence on academic inquiry.
Together, these cases form an alarming pattern: politicized pressure from state officials aimed at shaping curriculum, constraining speech and influencing university behavior. In Terrell’s case, the university has acted pre-emptively to shield itself from criticism — effectively punishing academic rigor.
The moral and academic cost? Communities in Cancer Alley remain underrepresented, unheard, and polluted — while the researchers working to shine a light on their plight are silenced. That outcome dishonors both Tulane and Louisiana’s promise to provide environmental justice.
Civic leaders, alumni, faculty, students, and citizens concerned with justice must stand with the Environmental Law Clinic — and call on Tulane’s leadership to do the same. If we fail to defend those who expose inconvenient truths, we invite a future where the only “research” that thrives is the kind approved by political paymasters.
Terrell’s resignation is more than a personal protest; it is a red flag. Her rigorous, peer-reviewed findings must not be buried. Tulane must act now to safeguard academic freedom and the university’s independence, lest it trade its values for its position in the power structure.
The stakes are higher than a single study or appointment. They touch the core of what it means to pursue knowledge in a free society. Louisiana’s future depends on its ability to confront the realities of environmental and economic injustice — not by silencing the scientists who illuminate them, but by amplifying their findings and committing to change.
Academic institutions exist to challenge the status quo, not protect it. Tulane has the opportunity to reaffirm that mission. It must not squander it.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1599px-Tulane_University_4666851315-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-18 19:05:50.249212

As he prepares to leave his role next month, Vermont Progressive Party Executive Director John Wronski is reflecting on nearly a decade spent growing the state’s third-largest party — the work, the wins and the challenges that defined his tenure. 
Wronski announced last month he would leave his position on July 4 and join the staff of the Vermont State Employees’ Association, “one of the most impactful unions in our state,” he said. 
“I have a 2-year-old at home and am hoping to have another kid fairly soon, and it felt like a good time to make that switch,” Wronski told VTDigger this week. “It’s been a really good ride, but it was time to change things up a little bit. I’ve accomplished most of what I set out to do, I believe.”Wronski said he got his start in the Progressive Party while studying at Saint Michael’s College in Burlington, where he received a grant to do research on the party.“I was really fascinated by the work that the party was doing in Vermont,” he said.Wronski did several stints at larger unions across the country before returning to Vermont to take a position with the party, which would later turn into the executive director role.“I was, like, living out of a suitcase, traveling all over the state and the country … and I really wanted to kind of settle down permanently in Vermont. I was looking for work, and the elections director position opened up with the Vermont Progressive Party.”That role soon turned into an executive director position, making Wronski the only staff member for the Vermont Progressive Party until two years ago, when fundraising allowed for the hiring of a second.Wronski said his successes during his tenure included the election of Progressives into notable roles like former Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman and Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, building a Progressive presence in Barre and making notable fundraising gains.
But he noted that every win was part of a larger, shared effort.“Our movement is very much a collective effort, and anything that I’ve done has been with a huge team of people supporting that work,” he said.Reaching across the aisle is key for the party’s success, according to Wronski. He cited the death of a bill pushed by Vermont Democrats to end “fusion” candidates — candidates nominated by two parties — as an example, as Progressives worked with Republicans to stop it.
Wronski also spoke about the party’s failures during his time as director, the largest one being fundraising. The Progressives pride themselves on their grassroots fundraising, he said, but that can make larger monetary windfalls difficult.
“It’s perpetually a struggle, never figuring out how to grow our finances to the level where we could even compete on a two-to-one level with Democrats in most races,” Wronski said. “Our annual budget that was approved for this year is $120,000, which is like a pittance for a statewide organization.”
Long term, the party needs an annual budget of $200,000 or $300,000 to be sustainable, he said.
Wronski declined to say who would take over his position once he’s gone, but he did comment on who had the potential to be larger political players.“We have a few people on the city council level who are in their first terms in Burlington. Carter Newbezer, Marek Broderick … there’s a lot of potential for them to run for higher office in the near future,” he said. “Tanya Vyhovsky, who’s in the State Senate, is obviously a known entity at this point. But I could definitely see her making a jump for statewide office. We have people like Jane Stromberg, who was a city councilor at one point and had to step back. I could see her either running again or taking on a leadership position within the party.”Wronski also had advice for the party’s next director.“You have to surrender your ego,” he said. “That’s the best way I can say it. … You have to be willing and even excited to talk to folks both internally within the party and externally, like in the broader political sphere, who have different views on the way things should be.”

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A new spate of undercover seafood testing at restaurants in the Alexandria area found more than half of the sampled eateries serving imported shrimp. 
SeaD Consulting, a food testing company that has been making headlines for uncovering foreign-sourced shrimp sold as local catch at restaurants and festivals across the Gulf Coast, announced Wednesday that 54% of the Central Louisiana restaurants it sampled were serving imported shrimp – and several were lying to their customers about it.  
The company’s use of genetic testing found that 11 of the 24 restaurants sampled offered authentic Gulf of Mexico-caught shrimp, while the remaining 13 sold farm-raised shrimp to dinters. Six of those 13 restaurants, roughly 25% of the total, were serving imported fare in an “explicitly fraudulent” manner, meaning they claimed the shrimp was domestic when it wasn’t. 
SeaD collected the samples June 3-4 from restaurants across Alexandria and nearby Pineville. The findings are relatively on par with testing the company has conducted in other Louisiana cities. Its testing in the Shreveport area from March uncovered a 58% fraud rate. 
“This is about trust,” said Rodney Olander, chairman of the Louisiana Shrimp Task Force. “Alexandria is a proud river city with deep Louisiana roots, and its people deserve to know when they’re getting wild-caught Gulf shrimp — or when they’re being served imported farm-raised substitutes passed off as local. Having one in four restaurants being explicitly fraudulent is not right.”
In December, the Louisiana Shrimp Task Force, an advisory panel for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, asked SeaD Consulting to analyze shrimp from restaurants across the state in an effort to eliminate consumer seafood fraud. Its analysis includes sampling batches of 24 randomly selected restaurants in different cities across the state.
It is illegal under federal and state law to mislabel imported seafood as local and can result in fines or other penalties.
Local seafood was once easy to find in Louisiana, but an influx of cheap foreign catch – particularly shrimp and crawfish – has flooded the market over the past two decades. 
For more than a decade, Louisiana law has specifically required restaurants and other food establishments to state on their menus the country of origin of any shrimp and crawfish being served. The same requirement applies to food vendors at fairs and festivals. 
A 2023 review of state enforcement records revealed many restaurants had not complied with the law. State health inspectors issued thousands of citations to restaurants but levied no fines against them, drawing criticism from state lawmakers and local fishermen.
SeaD Consulting launched its testing efforts last year using undercover inspectors to purchase shrimp dishes from restaurants and festival vendors. The inspectors run the shrimp through a rapid field testing kit that examines seafood tissue genetics. 
SeaD’s investigation of the Louisiana Shrimp and Petroleum Festival in Morgan City led to public outrage when 4 out of 5 vendors there were found to have fraudulently served foreign shrimp. 
Dave Williams, a commercial fisheries scientist and founder of SeaD Consulting, said consumers can play an important role in combating seafood fraud. They should always ask restaurant staff where their seafood comes from, look for clear menu labeling indicating the country of origin and report suspicions of seafood fraud to local or state health officials, Williams said.
The company does not publicly disclose the names of the restaurants that fraudulently serve imported shrimp, opting instead to highlight businesses that are following the law and serve domestic shrimp. 
The Central Louisiana restaurants tested that offer locally caught seafood were:

Brocato’s Breakfast, Alexandria
Bucket’s Crawfish & Seafood, Pineville
Crawfish Port Inc., Alexandria
Crazy Cajun, Pineville
Deborge’s Crawfish, Alexandria, LA 71301
Koal’s Bar-B-Que, Alexandria
Pit Grill Diner, Alexandria
Red River Seafood & Sushi, Alexandria
Rosie Jo’s, Alexandria
Rotolo’s Craft & Crust, Alexandria
Swamp Daddy’s Crawfish, Alexandria

“These restaurants are doing it right,” Williams said. “They’re supporting the local economy and giving customers what they’re paying for — the flavor of Louisiana, from the docks to the table.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Senate Committee on Judiciary wasted no time Wednesday in advancing controversial legislation calling for a ban on the manufacture and sale of assault-style weapons for a floor vote.
In less than five minutes, the committee voted 8-6 to advance the amended legislation sponsored by Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, for consideration by the full chamber Friday, just in time for the tentative end of the 2025 legislative session.
DiPalma’s bill would prohibit the sale and manufacturing — but not the possession —  of assault-style shotguns, handguns, and rifles beginning July 1, 2026. Violators would face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and would have to forfeit their weapons.
That mostly mirrors the companion legislation that passed the House June 5 by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat. DiPalma’s new bill does away with a voluntary weapon certification program, which itself was amended from a mandate that grandfathered weapons be registered with law enforcement — a provision that drew the ire of pro-Second Amendment advocates.
Joining the committee to ensure the bill’s passage were new Senate President Valarie Lawson and Majority Leader Frank Ciccone — who used their ex-officio roles to vote. Senate Republican leaders Jessica de la Cruz and Gordon Rogers voted against the measure.
“The bill prevents further sales, and I think that’s the most important piece here,” Lawson said in an interview on the Senate floor.
 



How the committee voted on the proposed assault weapons ban
YES: 
Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat; Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat; Chairman Matthew LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat; Jacob Bissaillon; a Providence Democrat; John Burke, a West Warwick Democrat; Dawn Euer, a Newport Democrat; Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat; and Ana Quezada, a Providence Democrat
NO: 
Andrew Dimitri, a Johnston Democrat; Leonidas Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat; Thomas Paolino, a Lincoln Republican; Todd Patalano, a Cranston Democrat; Minority Whip Gordon Rogers, a Foster Republican; and Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, a North Smithfield Republican
NOT PRESENT FOR THE VOTE: 
Majority Whip David Tikoian, a Smithfield Democrat 



The historic advancement to the floor drew dozens of gun safety and Second Amendment advocates into the third-floor committee room. But if they were hoping to hear any lively debate on the legislation, it didn’t happen — save for Sen. Leonaidas Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat who spoke in opposition to the bill.
“No form of a firearms ban is acceptable under the guise of making us safer, it’s ridiculous,” Raptakis said. “If anything, we are less safe because law-abiding citizens will not be able to buy weapons to keep themselves next year.”

Companion legislation that passed the House June 5 by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, was held by the committee for further study. 
That means the fate of one of Gov. Dan McKee’s top legislative priorities lies squarely on whether the House plans to accept the revisions made across the rotunda. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi opted to withhold comment until the entire Senate considers the bill.
“The final bill is subject to change on the Senate floor, so it would be premature to comment at this time,” Shekarchi said in a statement.
Knight also declined to comment on the Senate’s Judiciary Committee’s action, but indicated he remains optimistic about his amended proposal.
“The session’s not over until it’s over,” Knight said in a phone call.
Questions remain on Senate proposal
Ciccone, a Providence Democrat and federally licensed firearms dealer who had opposed DiPalma’s original bill, said he was swayed to give his support following the changes made — namely the decision to no longer outlaw the possession of assault-style weapons.
“This has the ability to help our citizens and protects everyone,” Ciccone told reporters.
But in effect, that could allow someone to purchase a weapon in another state where such sales are legal. At least that’s the interpretation of Frank Saccoccio, president of the Rhode Island Second Amendment Coalition.
“That bill only covers Rhode Island purchases, not out-of-state,” Saccoccio said in an interview. “I still say it’s terrible — it will lead to a lot of confusion, a lot of people will not know how to comply.”
However, committee chairman Matthew LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat, told Rhode Island Current that federal law is clear in prohibiting firearm purchases across state lines.
“This is about reducing the number of available prohibited firearms in the current population,” he said. “Both bills would have done that, but this has a different spin on it.”
Gun safety advocates are split on whether the Senate’s proposal will achieve that goal.
Monisha Henley, senior vice president of government affairs for Everytown for Gun Safety, called the Senate’s rework “a massive step forward” in limiting access to assault-style firearms.
But the head of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence believes the legislation is just a weakened version of what was passed in the House.
“The bill that passed in the House was supported by advocates and organizations representing so many different constituencies, all five of our general officers, and local leaders across the state,” Executive Director Melissa Carden said in a statement Wednesday. “We also know that we must always be willing to compromise to make progress and the bill that passed the House is the result of that compromise – it also has majority support in the Senate.”
Sen. Dawn Euer, a Newport Democrat who voted to advance the bill, said she hopes the chamber will revise DiPalma’s bill on the floor to match its counterpart in the House.
“If they don’t, I am happy to bring up that amendment,” she said. “I think that is more reflective of the bill 24 senators sponsored.”
DiPalma said he understands advocates’ calls for stricter language, but “you can’t let the enemy of better be good enough.”
“And this bill maintains the nucleus of the bills that we had,” DiPalma said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Marva Johnson was approved Wednesday by the Board of Governors as the next president of Florida A&M University, the last confirmation needed on a search that’s been accompanied loudly by protests. 
Johnson is set to start Aug. 1 and will take the reins from Timothy Beard, who has served as interim president for the past year. 
“I want to acknowledge the significance of this moment and the responsibility that I will carry to preserve the legacy while carving a path forward for this institution,” Johnson said in her confirmation hearing during the Board of Governors meeting at Florida Atlantic University. 
  Marva Johnson via FAMU
FAMU alumni appeared at the meeting in Boca Raton, strongly opposing Johnson’s candidacy during an open forum that was limited to 15 minutes, turning away some members of the public. 
“I believe the dedicated 15-member search committee reflected our commitment to identifying candidates who possess the requisite qualities to advance Florida A&M University’s objectives,” FAMU Board of Trustees Vice Chair Deveron Gibbons said, to which the FAMU attendees groaned, causing BOG Chair Brian Lamb to tell them to stop. 
Johnson was appointed to boards by former Gov. Rick Scott and Gov. Ron DeSantis, prompting protesters’ concerns that she may prove a political president.
Those political fears were paired with a perceived lack of higher education experience and resulted in petitions and community events opposing her presidency and prolonged FAMU Board of Trustee meetings.
Johnson is a group vice president for Charter Communications and previously served as chair of the Florida Board of Education, which oversees K-12 education and the Florida College System.
Lamb advised Johnson to commit to keeping her door open. “The voices aren’t going to go away,” he said. 
He went on to ask FAMU Board of Trustees Chair Harper and Gibbons to commit to supporting Johnson during her presidency. 
“To the Rattler community, students, faculty, alumni, stakeholders, I am listening and I hear your hope and I hear your dreams and I hear your concerns, and my door will always be open, and I’m looking forward to full engagement on campus and in our communities,” Johnson said while looking at the FAMU community in the room. 
FAMU community members stood with their back turned to Johnson.

BOG members pointed to Johnson’s sticking with the process through the turmoil as a measure of resiliency. 
“This is a new era, not for retreat, but for bold leadership and advancement. This moment is not about dismantling, it is about building, it is about advancing excellence, and together we can take FAMU to a top 50 public university in America,” Johnson said. 
Johnson’s contract will provide total compensation of about $840,000 in the first year and rises to about $981,000 in the final year.
The Florida Legislature this week approved a one-year rule change to allow the FAMU board to use otherwise restricted funds to pay for Johnson’s contract after the FAMU Foundation expressed a hesitancy to fund her full contract.
Two more presidents
The Board of Governors also approved former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez as Florida International University president after she served as the school’s interim president. She was the sole finalist in a search that began when former President Kenneth Jessell stepped down.
Her contract will pay her a base salary of $925,000 and up to $400,000 in performance incentives. She will get a $245,000 annual retirement supplement, too, among other stipends.
The board approved Manny Diaz Jr. as the University of West Florida’s interim president. He will leave his job as the education commissioner of the state. 
His salary and benefits will pay him about $750,000, doubling his salary as education commissioner. 
Board member Eric Silagy said he thinks the search for a permanent president at UWF will be “undermined” by his contract. Silagy’s concern involved the lack of performance incentives and the ability for the university and Diaz to negotiate an interim extension if the search fails. 
“I think we’re going to end up with a failed search and we’re going to end up with Commissioner Diaz by default,” Silagy said. 
At FAU two years ago, the search was called off after now-U.S. Rep. Randy Fine was not named a finalist after DeSantis positioned him for the job. 
“I look forward to great things at UWF coming soon,” Diaz said.

In response, the department will hold vaccination clinics across the state.
The super-contagious disease is nearing a six-year record as outbreaks spread across the United States. According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 13, there are 1,197 confirmed cases affecting 34 states.
Measles cases are in 34 states with North Dakota now the focus

North Dakota reports the highest rate of any state at 34 cases. Reports of new cases in Texas, where the outbreak originated, may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more willing to vaccinate, experts say. 
The measles vaccine offers the best protection against infection, according to the South Dakota Health Department. 
“We encourage everyone to check their vaccination status and take advantage of these clinics, especially if they’re unsure of their immunity,” said Dr. Joshua Clayton, state epidemiologist, in a news release. 
The release did not say whether the clinics will charge for the vaccinations, or how much, and the department did not immediately respond to questions from South Dakota Searchlight.
South Dakota had a 91% vaccination rate among kindergarteners during the 2024-25 school year, according to state data, which was down from 96% before the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination coverage of 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission, according to medical professionals. 
The state has experienced lower vaccination rates in recent years as more parents claim religious exemptions allowed in state law. The counties with the worst measles, mumps and rubella vaccination rates among kindergarteners include Faulk (56%), Jones (60%), Hutchinson (64%) and Sanborn (66%). Fifteen counties report a vaccination rate at or above 95%.
One of the patients in the latest measles report visited the Rapid City Medical Center Urgent Care waiting room at 2820 Mount Rushmore Road from 9 to 11:30 a.m. on June 10 while infected. A press release from the Health Department did not say whether the new cases are among children or adults.
Measles symptoms appear in two stages, first with a runny nose, cough and slight fever. Second, occurring on the third to seventh day of the illness, a red blotchy rash appears and lasts for up to a week. The rash usually begins on the face. The person’s temperature also rises to 103-105 degrees Fahrenheit.

Smoke from two wildfires is worsening air quality across southern New Mexico. (Courtesy of Pinos Altos Volunteer Fire and Rescue)New Mexico health officials issued warnings Wednesday that wildfire smoke is worsening air quality across much of the southern part of the state.
Smoke from the Trout Fire near Silver City pushed more than 100 miles into the Rio Grande Valley across Las Cruces and El Paso on Tuesday night into Wednesday, worsening air quality, the New Mexico Department of Health said in a press release Wednesday. The Trout Fire has prompted evacuations as it has burned more than 38,000 acres in the Gila National Forest. It is  0% contained.
Pollution from wildfire smoke includes extremely small particulates that can be inhaled and worsen lung and heart conditions, even over short periods, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
How you can protect your community from wildfire smoke

While everyone’s health is affected, unhealthy air quality can have the greatest impacts on young children, adults over 65, pregnant women and people with heart or lung conditions, including asthma. The health department recommended reducing outdoor activity in areas with moderate to unhealthy air quality, shutting windows and doors and avoiding using swamp coolers, since they pull the air from outside directly into the house.
The Seven Springs Fire, which has burned an estimated 350 acres on Mescalero Apache Tribal land, is also worsening air quality in Mescalero, High Rolls, Cloudcroft and Alamogordo, health officials said.
The village of La Luz, south of the fire, is forecast to experience unhealthy air quality though Wednesday evening.

RUTLAND — A Vermont man who prosecutors say was behind a hacking operation used to steal personal information from tens of thousands of people has pleaded guilty to a federal criminal charge in Vermont.
Nicholas Moses, 34, of Newport, who also uses the online alias “scrublord,” entered his guilty plea Wednesday in federal court in Rutland to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud through the use of computers.
Judge Mary Kay Lanthier released Moses on conditions pending a sentencing hearing in October. The conditions prohibit him from leaving Vermont. 
Under a plea deal, Moses faces a maximum prison term of up to five years.
Moses operated a computer malware program known as SmokeLoader and used it “to harvest” data from victims, according to court filings. 
“Thousands of computers around the world have been infected with the SmokeLoader malware by Moses and over 65,000 victims have had their personal information and passwords stolen by Moses,” court records stated. 
The scheme played out between January 2022 and May 2023, according to court documents.
Moses maintained a server in the Netherlands to deploy the SmokeLoader data-stealing malware program on the computers of unsuspecting victims, including banks, the documents stated. One of the financial institutions, court filings stated, was based in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The stolen information from the malware program would be sold in a “dark-web marketplace” and other cybercrime forums “to be exploited by others” or by Moses, according to court records.
In one instance on Nov. 30, 2022, the court documents stated, Moses took part in an online chat where he provided the usernames and passwords for victim accounts with several video streaming services he had obtained through the SmokeLoader malware.
In a separate online chat session a short time later, Moses stated he had sold the credentials and password of victims for $1 to $5 each, court records stated.
Moses had sent a screenshot to another person of his SmokeLoader interface from his server in the Netherlands showing a database of 619,763 files containing victims’ stolen data, according to the court documents.
“The amount of loss that was known to or reasonably foreseeable by the defendant was in excess of $40,000 but less than $95,000,” the plea agreement stated. 
During the hearing Wednesday, the judge explained to Moses the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty to a felony charge. Moses told Lanthier he wanted to plead guilty to the charge and waive his right to his trial.

June 19, 1865, marks the day the Emancipation Proclamation was finally enforced by Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger in Texas at the end of the Civil War. For slaves in Texas, their unshackling came more than two years after their freedom was ordered by President Lincoln. 
While only recently being recognized as a federal holiday in 2021, early Juneteenth celebrations date back as early as 1866. What started as a small community gathering in Galveston, Texas, quickly spread across the South where it was then brought all across the country during the Great Migration, beginning in 1910.

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Travel on a Washington state ferry will cost more this fall and even more next spring.
How much became a little clearer Tuesday when a state transportation panel settled on a course to increase fares by 3% on Oct. 1 and another 3% on May 1, 2026.
The Washington State Transportation Commission also recommended hiking the summer season surcharge to 35% on all routes and, on a trial basis, extending the life of multi-ride passes to 120 days starting next May. They now expire after 90 days.
Public comment on the approach will be accepted online through Aug. 5. A virtual public hearing will be held Aug. 6, with the commission then voting on a final fare hike proposal.
Those increases would be in addition to actions taken earlier this year by state lawmakers and Gov. Bob Ferguson.
They agreed to hike the capital surcharge tacked onto each ticket to $1 starting Oct. 1. It is now 50 cents. The money is used to fund construction of new state ferries. 
And they put a provision in the 2025-27 state transportation budget directing Washington State Ferries to levy a new 3% fee on credit card transactions beginning March 1, 2026. Fares paid by credit cards are an estimated 82% of farebox revenue, commission staff said.
State ferries’ staff said they worked to calibrate these changes with the various options they presented to the commission Tuesday.
“This is going to feel like a higher cost to the customer. We were very aware of that. When the customer feels like there is an increase to them, there is a drop in ridership,” Siri Olson, senior manager of financial planning for Washington State Ferries, told commissioners.
Under the transportation budget, Washington State Ferries is required to generate $408.8 million from fares in the next two years to help cover the agency’s day-to-day operating costs.
Fares differ by route as well as vehicle size, number of passengers and the time of year one travels. A surcharge is assessed on the base fare of a single vehicle between May 1 and  Sept. 30, which is the peak season for ridership. 
Under the current commission proposal, the standard passenger fare on the Mukilteo-Clinton route is expected to increase by 70 cents in October and an additional 15 cents in May 2026. For a standard-sized vehicle, the cost is expected to rise 85 cents in October 2025, and an additional 30 cents next May.
On the Seattle-Bremerton route, the passenger fare is expected to go up by 80 cents in October 2025 and an additional 30 cents next May. For standard vehicles, the increases are expected to be $1.05 in October and another 55 cents in May 2026.
Those estimates, provided by transportation commission staff, include this year’s boost to the vessel replacement surcharge.
Not included are the higher summer season surcharge or the credit card fee, both of which take effect next year. The surcharge will climb by 10% to the new level of 35% for all routes, except San Juan routes, which already have a 35% peak season levy.
“This has been an extremely complex fare-setting process,” said Aaron Halbert, financial analyst for the commission.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/samish-ferry-boat-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-18 18:04:54.043658

After many years of advocacy, state and local leaders celebrate the improvement of access to methadone treatment.

After years of groundwork, a treatment center for opioid use disorder is set to open on Depot Street in downtown Bennington this week. 
The opening will be a “real game changer for Bennington,” expanding access to methadone treatment and opioid use disorder recovery services in the region, said Kelly Dougherty, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Health.
The department has sought to open an opioid treatment program in Bennington for many years, but the Covid-19 pandemic and challenges finding a provider and location stalled progress, Dougherty said. The department is grateful to work with the Bay Area Addiction Research Treatment program as the operator of the Bennington-based center offering medication-assisted recovery treatments, counseling and other support services, she said. 
The Bay Area Addiction Treatment program runs similar centers in Berlin, St. Albans, St. Johnsbury and Newport.
The Vermont Department of Health provided a $3.9 million grant to help cover startup and operational costs of the program’s Bennington center. The grant will also help cover the cost of treatment for those without insurance through July 2026. The department does not want health insurance to be a barrier to access recovery resources, Dougherty said. 
The center plans to open for clients starting Thursday, assuming its first shipment of medication arrives Wednesday as planned, she said. 
Opioid treatment centers like this one must meet specific federal guidelines and safety measures, such as Drug Enforcement Agency regulations, so the department is glad the team has made it through “all those hurdles” and that the project is “going to be opening very soon,”  Dougherty said. 
Placing the center in downtown Bennington is intended to make  the path to recovery easier and  prevent further loss of lives to opioid use disorder in the region, Dougherty said. According to Department of Health data, rates of opioid-related death of Bennington County residents have fluctuated over the past decade, “but certainly there is a high need in the Bennington area,” she said. 
Vermont’s model for opioid use disorder treatment follows the design of a “hub and spokes,” Dougherty said. Hubs are where people can regularly access methadone to treat opioid use disorder. Spokes are primary care providers, where people can be prescribed buprenorphine and transition to longer-term treatment, she said. 
While Bennington has several spokes or primary care providers, Bennington Town Manager Stuart Hurd said residents have had to travel long distances to Brattleboro, Rutland or North Adams, Massachusetts, to receive methadone treatment. Now, locals can stay in their community while on the path to recovery, he said.  
Lorna Mattern, chief executive officer of Bennington’s United Counseling Service, said health service providers and advocates in the region have been asking for a hub location in Bennington for more than five years. Mattern said the United Counseling Service is glad the community has access to methadone treatment locally.
“With access to treatment in their own community, individuals in recovery can lead fuller, more stable lives — free from the burden of daily out-of-town travel,” Mattern wrote in an email statement to VTDigger. “This means they can stay close to home, maintain employment, and spend more meaningful time with their families, all while receiving the support they need on their recovery journey.”
Bennington Select Board Chair Tom Haley said the new treatment center was a long time coming and can help break down roadblocks to residents receiving necessary medicine. 
“We — like every other town in the country — are struggling with ways to help people with substance use disorder, and this is just one more way that we’re going to be able to do that,” Haley said.

(Courtesy of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission)The Supreme Court’s ruling Wednesday in favor of a company seeking to store nuclear waste in Texas has implications for neighboring New Mexico’s fight to prevent a similar facility being built here.
But the ruling does not mean New Mexicans should expect truckloads of radioactive material to arrive anytime soon, advocates and experts say.
The court ruled 6-3 that Texas and other parties did not have standing to challenge the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s decision to provide a permit to Interim Storage Partners. 
Camilla Feibelman, spokesperson for Rio Grande Sierra Club, said the ruling puts organizations like hers “in a fix” because it effectively removes the ability of any outside group or government body to intervene with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s permitting process. 
Florida-based company Holtec International is seeking to build a similar nuclear waste storage facility for 40 years in New Mexico in a rural site between Hobbs and Carlsbad, about 40 miles east of Interim Storage Partners’ proposed site in Texas.
In May 2023, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission awarded Holtec a license in New Mexico to “receive, possess, transfer and store 500 canisters holding approximately 8,680 metric tons of commercial spent nuclear fuel for 40 years.”
NM leaders decry federal license for nuclear storage facility

The Sierra Club sued the regulatory commission in federal court in a lawsuit still pending today. 
But Wednesday’s ruling in the Texas case sets a precedent that the organization cannot challenge the license in court, Feibelman said. 
“There’s basically never an opportunity to argue the merits of the licensure, and there’s no avenue for us to do that,” she said of the ruling. 
In a statement provided to Axios, a Holtec spokesperson said the ruling is a “significant win for the nuclear industry.” A spokesperson for Holtec did not respond to a request for comment from Source NM. 
Despite the ruling, Feibelman and Don Hancock, a decades-long anti-nuclear advocate in New Mexico with the Southwest Research and Information Center, said state and other protections remain that will provide a meaningful barrier to Holtec getting to build the facility in New Mexico. 
In the 2023 legislative session, New Mexico passed Senate Bill 53. The law bans state agencies from granting permits, contracts or leases for building a high-level nuclear waste storage facility. This would include New Mexico Department of Transportation and New Mexico Environment permits needed for construction and operations.
Trump’s push for Southwest uranium will face stiff state review

Hancock said that state is not affected by the Supreme Court ruling, and so it remains an effective way to stop Holtec. That was underscored in how Holtec responded to the ruling, he said.
“The press statement from Holtec did not say, ‘We’re going to proceed with our site in New Mexico,’” he said. “They didn’t say that because, I think they know they cannot proceed with the site in New Mexico.”
Hancock also described what he saw as unfavorable market conditions for Holtec, which he said cannot find customers to provide nuclear waste for it to store. 
Between the bad economics and the state’s opposition, Hancock said, “people in New Mexico are in the same place as we’ve been for several years,” even with the ruling. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told Axios Wednesday that the state would continue to fight against more nuclear waste storage in New Mexico. 
“Holtec is not welcome in New Mexico, but we’ve been preparing for this, and I’ll do everything I can to prevent them from storing even more radioactive waste here,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement.
The Supreme Court ruling comes as President Donald Trump seeks to quickly increase domestic energy supply, including nuclear energy, by fast-tracking uranium mine sites. Several long-standing mines in New Mexico are now priority projects at the United States Forest Service or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, though state regulators have told Source New Mexico their permitting structure is robust and a necessary step before any new mines can break ground.

“I prefer negotiation over military action,” Grassley said. “I would prefer military action only if there’s an immediate threat to the United States.” 
Grassley, asked about his opinions toward potential U.S. involvement in the conflict, said he is “not in the situation room” as the president is, but said Iran is “an enemy of the United States” when it says “death to Israel and death to America.” 
President Donald Trump has hinted at American involvement in the conflict but has not said publicly how he plans to intervene.
Grassley also spoke about updates from the Senate to the “one big, beautiful bill” which would set federal spending and debt limits. He said it would prevent the “largest tax increase in American history.”

Senate Republicans announced Monday their plan to raise the U.S. debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than what the House approved in its version of the bill. 
Grassley, who is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, said contrary to what he hears from Democrats, the bill does not cut taxes for billionaires. Grassley said the tax rates in the bill are the same rates that were set in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
In a letter from the Congressional Budget Office to the U.S. House Budget Committee ranking member and House minority leader about analysis of the bill, the CBO said “in general, resources would decrease for households toward the bottom of the income distribution, whereas resources would increase for households in the middle and top of the income distribution.” 
Grassley also defended the massive bill’s provisions around the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid. Grassley said the U.S. Senate is not asking states to “pick up a big share of the cost” of the SNAP program, but is leaving it up to the states to cover administrative costs. 
According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, the bill increases the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75% and would require states with more than 6% error rates to initiate higher cost-sharing rates. It would also significantly reduce federal spending on Medicaid, which offers health care to low-income families. 
The bill has faced criticism for its work requirements for both Medicaid and SNAP recipients, which critics say would add red tape to the programs that would hurt vulnerable populations. 
Grassley said the work requirements “seem to me as good policy.” Grassley said there are numerous exemptions for folks who are unable to work or who have children. The bill also allows for volunteer work, or time spent in school to meet the requirements. 
“Medicaid benefits will not be cut for our most vulnerable, that’s very clear,” Grassley said citing various exemptions. 
Senate leadership has indicated the budget reconciliation bill will be finalized in the Senate before the Fourth of July break.

Carol McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat and sponsor of a comprehensive bottle bill, was disappointed by the revisions reducing the legislation to a state-commissioned study. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Upon first mention of the phrase “bottle bill” at the State House Tuesday night, Rep. Carol McEntee’s face dropped.
“I am not happy,” the South Kingstown Democrat said.
That’s because 24 hours earlier, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson unveiled amended legislation gutting McEntee’s 57-page bill. Gone is the proposed 10-cent fee on recyclable bottles redeemed upon return to designated redemption sites. 
In its place, another study, this time, by a third-party consultant hired by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM). The compromise aims to find middle ground for environmental advocates and beverage makers and retailers, who failed to reach consensus on a deposit-refund program.
Meanwhile, a separate environmental priority to overhaul the troubled Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) also appears dead in the water amid hesitation at the corresponding price tag, with a less extreme alternative in its place.
“It does appear as though this has not really been a great year for the environment,” Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, said in an interview. “A lot of the big, high-profile bills are either not moving or being substantially reduced.”
The amended bottle bill and CRMC membership bill both advanced out of House committees Wednesday afternoon. The Senate Committee on Environment and Agriculture is slated to take up the companions for each Wednesday night. 
But the end-of-session whirlwind leaves open the possibility for lawmakers to resurrect more environmentally friendly bills during final floor sessions slated for Friday.
Bottled frustration over ‘compromise’
Despite initial disappointment, McEntee was warming to the weakened version, which preserves a small section of her original bill.
“This is what DEM would have to do anyway in the first six to nine months if we passed the bill,” McEntee said during the committee discussion. 
McEntee’s original proposal laid out the specifics of a deposit-refund program, simultaneously requiring statewide assessments on recycling and redemption.
But a standalone needs assessment lacks the details needed for a successful review, Thorp said. 
“I know the speaker had questions about how the bill would work, and some of those are valid concerns,” Thorp said. “But unless you’re looking at an actual proposal for a specific type of bottle bill program, you can’t really answer those questions.”
Shekarchi said a statewide assessment was needed because of “conflicting data” regarding best practices for improving state recycling rates. But considering best practices and models from the 10 other states with similar programs was the intent behind the 18-month legislative study commission that McEntee co-chaired, which issued its final recommendations in April.
“I think the data is absolutely clear,” Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat and commission co-chair, said in an interview Monday. “There’s nothing that compares to a bottle bill in terms of effectiveness.” 
McKenney, who sponsored the Senate counterpart to McEntee’s bottle bill, faulted retailers and manufacturers, who despite promising to work toward compromise, continue to decry the various iterations of a bottle bill presented to them.
“The reality is, they are interested in profits,” McKenney said. “I don’t think they are concerned about what’s going into our bay, what’s going into our seafood, what we’re ingesting when we take a swim.”
Chris Hunter, a spokesperson for the Stop the Rhode Island Bottle Tax Coalition, suggested the industry was still open to future legislation.
“Rhode Islanders deserve an innovative recycling system, like those adopted recently by other states, that raises recycling rates without raising the costs on hundreds of everyday beverages,” Hunter said.
McEntee confirmed Tuesday she’s pushing to make a few more tweaks to the already amended bottle bill, including moving up the Dec. 28, 2026, deadline to complete the statewide needs assessment.

CRMC reform? Add a coastal biologist  
A three-year push to reform the troubled state coastal agency by getting rid of the appointed council and empowering administrators to make decisions remains stuck in legislative purgatory.
Instead, legislative leaders are backing an alternative that reduces the council’s membership from 10 to seven people and adds professional qualification requirements. 
Existing state law sets membership requirements for the coastal panel based on where they live. Legislation sponsored by Rep. Alex Finkelman, a Jamestown Democrat, and Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski, a South Kingstown Democrat, reduces the size of the council from 10 to seven seats — in acknowledgment of the council’s vacancies, which have created quorum problems and canceled meetings. Four of seven members would have to attend a meeting to reach a quorum under the legislation, compared with the six-person minimum now.
The new group of seven members would all have some “background, qualifications and expertise in environmental matters.” There are also reserved seats for an engineer, a coastal biologist and an environmental organization representative. The new members would serve three-year terms, like their predecessors. 
“It’s a step in the right direction,” Finkelman said in an interview. “To me, this lays the groundwork for the future.”
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who pushed for the more sweeping reform bill, indicated his support for the reshaping of council membership and qualifications, too.
“We welcome this reform as a first step and look forward to continuing to advocate for the best possible management of our coastal resources,” Neronha said in a statement Wednesday. 
But Save the Bay urged state lawmakers to vote against the watered down council membership legislation in a statement on Tuesday.
Thorp noted that unlike the more sweeping reform proposals, which received widespread support, only one group — the Rhode Island Builders Association — spoke in favor of Finkelman’s bill during a prior committee vetting.
“I don’t understand why they chose to move the least popular bill,” Thorp said.
Thorp anticipated problems in populating the reshaped council, especially with strict criteria around professional expertise. 
“Good luck finding a representative from an environmental nonprofit that’s going to want to spend its limited resources going to two council meetings at night a month,” Thorp said. 
Save the Bay is not interested, he said.
Finkelman said he hoped “public outcry” over unpopular decisions by the existing council might spur interest from prospective council members.
The bill does not preclude existing or prior members from being reappointed if they meet the new criteria. And it allows the existing council members to continue to serve until replacements are named.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision:
“We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

SPRINGFIELD — A group of Republican lawmakers filed a lawsuit this week that seeks to nullify legislation they say would indelibly alter both the business and legal landscape of Illinois.

Senate Bill 328 would amend a key provision of Illinois civil law by allowing, in certain kinds of cases, any company authorized to do business in the state to be sued in Illinois courts, even if the underlying claims and the parties have no connection to the state.

As written, the bill would apply only in cases filed under the Uniform Hazardous Substances Act in which the plaintiff claims an injury or illness resulting from exposure to a toxic substance.

What is unique about the GOP lawsuit, however, is that it doesn’t just seek to nullify the legislation before Gov. JB Pritzker signs it. It also asks the court to bar the legislature from using a procedure that has become common in the General Assembly known as “gut-and-replace.” This effectively allows lawmakers to sidestep the Illinois Constitution’s requirement that every bill be read, by title, three times on three different days in each chamber before it is passed because amendments are not required to be read on three different days in each chamber.

That procedure is used frequently for major legislation passed in the final days of a legislative session, including budget bills.

“Illinois’ reputation as one of the most corrupt states in the nation and one of the worst states in the nation for business go hand in hand,” Senate Republican Leader John Curran, R-Downers Grove, said during a virtual news conference Wednesday. “Allowing legislators to disregard the Constitution and good government transparency processes to make laws that are bad for our state is the root cause of both narratives.”

The proposal stems from a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court case, Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., in which the court upheld a Pennsylvania law that requires out-of-state corporations to agree to allow Pennsylvania courts to exercise “general personal jurisdiction” over them, just as those courts exercise over domestic corporations.

“This is legalized litigation tourism,” said Sen. Jason Plummer, R-Edwardsville. “And it further damages Illinois’ reputation as a state that's hostile to businesses and job creators.”

SB 328 began as what’s known in the General Assembly as a “shell bill” — one that has a title and a bill number but no substantive content. In this case, the original language called for making a technical change in one sentence in the Code of Civil Procedure, deleting the word “and” and replacing it with the word “and.”

Each session, lawmakers in both chambers introduce hundreds of such bills, most of which are never acted upon. But they are often amended into substantive legislation later in the session, especially after deadlines for introducing new bills or passing bills out of committees have passed.

That is what happened with SB 328, which began as a shell bill but was amended in the Senate to make a technical change to the way court clerks handle electronically filed documents. It passed out of the Senate on April 10 by a vote of 56-0 and was sent to the House.

In the House, it was read for the first time on April 11 and was assigned to a committee, which voted April 30 to recommend it be passed. It was read a second time on May 13.

On May 30, the next-to-last day of the session, Rep. Jay Hoffman, D-Swansea, introduced a “gut-and-replace” amendment that removed the language about electronic court filings and replaced it with the new language allowing out-of-state corporations to be sued in Illinois courts over acts that may have occurred elsewhere.

That amendment was never sent to a substantive committee but instead was debated on the floor of the House where it passed the night of May 31 by a partisan vote of 77-40. That vote also counted as the third reading of the bill in the House, meaning the bill number had now been read on three different days in each chamber. It was then sent back to the Senate, which voted 37-19 shortly after midnight on June 1 to concur in the House amendment.

“We have long discussed with our partners, members and constituents filing suit on this issue, even prior to me being in leadership this year,” House Republican Leader Tony McCombie, of Savanna, said during the news conference. “The caucus members brought forward this egregious example of SB 328, and said let's move forward.”

The lawsuit was filed in circuit court in Sangamon County. It lists 47 Republican lawmakers as plaintiffs. House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch and Senate President Don Harmon are named as defendants.

Harmon, D-Oak Park, who sponsored the amended bill in the Senate, did not immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment.

Separately, the Illinois Freedom Caucus has also filed a lawsuit in Sangamon County alleging the state’s budget bill did not satisfy the three readings requirement for similar reasons. A hearing in the case is scheduled for July 3.

Tate Reeves announced Wednesday.
The memorandum of understanding, a nonbinding agreement, between Mississippi and the California-based company will introduce AI programs across the state’s community colleges, universities and technical institutions. The initiative will aim to train at least 10,000 Mississippians using a curriculum designed around AI skills, machine learning and data science. 
Mississippi now joins Utah, California and Oregon, which have signed on to similar programs with Nvidia. 
“This collaboration with Nvidia is monumental for Mississippi. By expanding AI education, investing in workforce development and encouraging innovation, we, along with Nvidia, are creating a pathway to dynamic careers in AI and cybersecurity for Mississippians,” Reeves said. “These are the in-demand jobs of the future — jobs that will change the landscape of our economy for generations to come. AI is here now, and it is here to stay.”
The agreement does not award any tax incentives to Nvidia, but Reeves said the state would provide funding for the initiative. Still, he did not foresee having to call a special legislative session in order to pay for it. Reeves said officials and Nvidia were still determining the exact dollar figure the project would require, but the state would spend as much as it took to reach its goal of training at least 10,000 Mississippians. 
Some of the funding may come from $9.1 million in grants to state institutions of higher learning through the Mississippi AI Talent Accelerator Program, which Reeves announced last week. 
Nvidia designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), and the Mississippi program will focus on teaching people to work with GPUs. The company has seen growing demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power AI applications.
Now the world’s most valuable chipmaker, Nvidia announced in April that it will produce its AI supercomputers in the United States for the first time.
Louis Stewart, head of strategic initiatives for Nvidia’s global developer ecosystem, said the Mississippi program is part of a larger effort to bolster the United States’ position as the global leader in artificial intelligence.
“Together, we will enhance economic growth through an AI-skilled workforce, advanced research, and industry engagement, positioning Mississippi as a hub for AI-driven transformation to the benefit of its communities.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/29192623/State-of-the-State-1.jpg,,,2025-06-18 18:04:54.043658

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado could face a budget crunch totaling in the billions of dollars if a sweeping tax and spending bill proposed by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress becomes law, analysts warned state lawmakers on Wednesday.
The so-called budget reconciliation bill has passed the House and is now being considered in the Senate, which has offered its own version with slightly different policy points. State economists from the governor’s Office of State Planning and Budget relied on the House-passed version for their analysis.
Colorado be on the hook for up to $650 million per year to offset the bill’s deep cuts to federally-funded social programs. State costs for Medicaid could increase by up to $350 million, and costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could increase by up to $300 million if the federal bill passes and state policy does not change, OSPB Director Mark Ferrandino told lawmakers on Wednesday.

That is due to the provisions considered in the federal bill that reduce federal funding and create more administrative burden for the state agencies in charge of running Medicaid and SNAP, including new mandatory work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, cuts to federal matching for states that have coverage for immigrants without legal status and increased dollar matching for SNAP.
In addition to those new costs, the tax changes considered in the reconciliation bill could add up to a roughly $600 million hit to Colorado’s state tax revenue. An economic recession, the odds of which the governor’s office now estimates at 50%, could cause another $1.6 billion budget hole.
“We do have a potential of a recession and potential of reconciliation… that could really wreak havoc in where we are from a budget perspective,” Ferrandino told members of the Joint Budget Committee, who use quarterly economic forecasts like the one presented Wednesday to craft the state budget.
Both the OSPB and the nonpartisan Legislative Council Staff downgraded their economic growth predictions and General Fund revenue from March.
“Trump’s disastrous tariff taxes continue to wreak havoc on our economy and the erratic trade policy is projected to continue hurting our economy, slowing job growth, and increasing chances of a recession,” Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said in a statement. “These national circumstances present a difficult economic environment for the state.”
The JBC is fresh off a legislative session where they had to balance a state budget with a $1.2 billion starting deficit. They wrote a $43.9 billion spending plan that cut state funding for transportation projects and social programs created through legislation that were barely implemented.
There will be another economic forecast before budget writers start work on the 2026–27 fiscal year plan.
“In a tight budget year, we protected the key services and programs Coloradans and their families rely on, but Colorado can simply not absorb the proposed federal cuts to Medicaid and SNAP,” Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, said in a statement after the forecast.
Both sets of economists predict that state tax revenue will exceed the limit set by the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights over the next few years, but that surplus will be small. Colorado is required to refund excess revenue back to taxpayers through a variety of mechanisms, and the anticipated surpluses may not cover required property tax reimbursements to local governments. The Legislature may need to spend $72 million in the upcoming fiscal year and $154 million in the following fiscal year to make up the difference, according to the LCS. The small TABOR surplus also means there probably will not be an income tax reduction or Family Affordability Tax Credit for the 2026 tax year. OSPB does predict those tax credits will be triggered for the 2025 tax year.
Due to lower income tax revenue and several pieces of recent state legislation, Colorado is anticipated to have $313 million less in its general fund during the 2025–26 fiscal year than what was previously projected, according to LCS.
Much of the projected excess costs to the general fund come from a ballot measure funding law enforcement recruitment and training that voters passed last year. The General Fund will also have about $230 million less in the 2026–27 fiscal year to implement a new school funding plan by moving that money to the State Education Fund.

The Vermont-based outdoor gear and apparel company Orvis plans to lay off 4% of its workforce by the end of the year, the company said Wednesday. 
The decision requires the Manchester-based brand to let go of at least 50 employees. In a statement to VTDigger, Orvis President Simon Perkins said the layoffs were part of a broader reorganization the company would be undertaking in the coming months.
“Tariffs disrupted our business model in ways we haven’t faced before and have exposed a clear path to solidifying our long-term future,” Perkins said. “Moving forward, Orvis will be returning to our roots and shifting our entire focus to the core strengths of our business—the fly fishing and wingshooting pursuits that have guided our company for nearly 170 years and inspire our customers in unique and powerful ways.”

It was not immediately clear which categories of employees are being affected by the layoffs or how many people had already been let go as of Wednesday afternoon. Brian Holcomb, a spokesperson for Orvis, said the reorganization effort had just been announced internally Wednesday and “meetings are ongoing.”
The latest reductions follow more than 110 job cuts the company made in 2024 while closing some retail locations and discontinuing its catalogue sales service. Last year, Orvis also moved its headquarters from Sunderland to Manchester, saying at the time it was moving to a smaller building to shrink its footprint after it had taken on more remote workers. 
Founded in 1856 in Manchester, Orvis claims to be the oldest mail-order retailer in the United States and sells fishing equipment, hunting gear and outdoor apparel, much of which is manufactured in Asian countries.  
In the statement, Perkins said he would be “detailing our vision of the future soon” but did not specify whether the current reorganization effort would require any further store closures or which products, if any, the company plans to discontinue as it limits its scope.
“These decisions deeply impact the lives of our associates and our communities, and we do not take them lightly,” Perkins said. “We are leaning on our values and handling this process with both care and regard for our team.”

Labor Commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo told Assembly lawmakers in April the fund was healthy but still recovering. (Photo courtesy of N.J. governor's office)Unemployment insurance taxes paid by New Jersey businesses will decline in July, years after a surge on pandemic jobless claims drained the state fund that pays unemployment benefits and triggered a tax hike.
Rates under the unemployment insurance tax will fall to between 0.5% and 5.8% when the new fiscal year begins in July, down from between 0.6% and 6.4%, the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development announced Wednesday.
“The unemployment insurance tax reduction demonstrates a major milestone in New Jersey’s economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic,” Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement. “We are now able to ease employers’ burdens while continuing to strengthen our workforce. This progress reflects our ongoing commitment to create a robust economy that supports our employees.”
In New Jersey, unemployment insurance tax rates are set by the health of the state’s unemployment insurance fund and individual businesses’ use of unemployment benefits.
The Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund’s balance sets the range for rates. Rates are higher when fund balances are low, as they were following record unemployment claims during the pandemic, and rates fall as heightened contributions refill state coffers and joblessness recedes.
Individual businesses’ use of unemployment benefits and their payments into the fund determine their tax rate within the range. Businesses that see many jobless claims will typically have higher rates than those that see few.
The department said the lower rates, which will kick in July 1, are expected to save New Jersey businesses about $300 million annually.
Tom Bracken, president and CEO of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, called it welcome news for the state’s businesses.
“The estimated $300 million in savings will give many businesses a critical opportunity to reinvest in their operations, support their workforce, and strengthen their communities. At a time of continued economic uncertainty, this relief couldn’t come at a better moment for employers who are already facing significant financial pressures,” he said.
Chris Emigholz, chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, welcomed lower rates but cautioned lawmakers against increasing other business taxes in the coming fiscal year.
“This is great news for New Jersey job creators, and it’s important that this savings that employers desperately need right now is not offset by further business tax increases,” he said.
Murphy’s proposed budget for fiscal 2026 includes higher taxes on casinos’ gambling winnings, a $2-per-truck fee on warehouses, and higher tax rates on certain property transactions above $1 million.
The decline in unemployment tax rates was unexpected. In April, Labor Commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo told Assembly lawmakers the fund was healthy but still recovering. In responses to lawmakers, his agency said it expected unemployment insurance rates to remain static through fiscal 2027, which runs from July 1, 2026, to June 30, 2027.
At the time, the unemployment fund had a balance of $1.6 billion, and that balance was expected to rise to roughly $2 billion after tax payments from the first quarter of 2025 were collected, Asaro-Angelo said in April. Rates could be lowered because collections exceeded expectations, the agency said. The current fund balance was not immediately clear.

The proposal in Maine, which would have created a state-level recognition process there, was one of several bills related to tribal identity that lawmakers across northern New England considered in recent months.

State legislators in Maine rejected a bill last month that would have created a state-level process, similar to one on the books in Vermont, for recognizing local groups as Native American tribes. Opponents of the bill pointed to the sharp criticism Vermont’s process has faced in recent years as one of the reasons to vote the legislation down.
“Take a look at what’s happened in Vermont,” said Rep. Adam Lee, a Democrat from  Auburn, Maine, on the House floor in early May. The “contentious issue” in Vermont, he continued, has “harmed” Vermont’s relationship with tribes that are recognized at the federal level, suggesting that by passing the bill, Maine would be doing the same.
Debate over the proposal came as legislators in Vermont and New Hampshire were also considering — and also did not advance — other bills related to tribal identity. 
Vermont’s recognition process has been criticized by two Abenaki nations centered in Quebec, as well as researchers at the University of Vermont and in Canada. They maintain that many members of the four groups Vermont recognized as Abenaki in 2011 and 2012 are not Indigenous and, instead, have been appropriating Abenaki culture. 
The Vermont groups assert that they can, in fact, claim Abenaki identities and have repeatedly urged the First Nations to stay out of their affairs.
Odanak and W8linak First Nations have federal-level recognition from the Canadian government. That’s a different standard — and, the First Nations’ leaders say, a far more rigorous one — than the Vermont groups had to meet. With federal recognition, Odanak and W8linak can access greater government resources than the Vermont groups can in the U.S., and they can claim pieces of land as sovereign territory. (According to the First Nations’ tribal government, the symbol “8” used in “W8linak” represents a specific “o” sound, which is pronounced as it is in the word “on.”)
The state recognition proposal in Maine also faced opposition from the leaders of four Wabanaki nations located within the modern-day borders of that state — and which have federal-level recognition from the U.S. government. Those are the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Mi’kmaq Nation, Penobscot Nation and the Passamaquoddy Tribe.
Federal, state recognition
The Wabanaki Nations have longstanding ties to Abenaki people, including through a shared language. At the heart of disagreements over Vermont’s recognition process are contested narratives of who can claim legitimate descendency from historic Abenaki communities that were largely stripped of their homeland by European colonizers.
In a statement posted to Facebook in March, the Wabanaki Alliance — a nonprofit organization that advocates for the Wabanaki Nations’ sovereignty — pointed to Vermont’s process in urging Maine lawmakers to reject the bill proposed in that state.
“The creation of state recognition processes in other states has caused problems and frustrations, as in the notable example of Abenaki tribes in Vermont who could not meet the criteria for federal recognition, but who were still recognized by the State of Vermont,” the alliance wrote in the post. 
The statement also highlighted “years of objections and testimony from the recognized existing Abenaki Nations in Quebec” about the Vermont-based groups’ “legitimacy.”
Vermont lawmakers set up a state recognition process under a law, Act 107, passed in 2010. While not a carbon copy of the Vermont legislation, the bill considered in Maine this year would have, like in Vermont, given power to review applications for recognition to a commission appointed by the state’s governor. The commission, like in Vermont, could then advance a recommendation to the Legislature for further consideration. 
It did include identical language, in some areas, to Vermont’s existing law, including a requirement that “a substantial number” of the members of a group seeking state recognition are related to one another “by kinship and trace their ancestry to a kinship group through genealogy or other methods.” 
That’s a different — and less stringent — standard than the U.S. federal government’s recognition requirements, which demand, among other stipulations, that an applicant must have been identified as Native American “on a substantially continuous basis since 1900.” One of the groups in Vermont — the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi — applied for federal recognition in the 1980s, but its application was rejected.

The Maine proposal was closely linked to a yearslong push by another group called the Kineo St. John Tribe to get formal recognition from the state’s government. The Kineo St. John Tribe does not have federal-level tribal recognition, either.
(While the Wabanaki Nations have federal recognition, they receive fewer benefits and protections than other federally recognized tribes in the U.S. due to their unique status under existing state and federal law, according to the Wabanaki Alliance’s website.)
In May, Maine legislators also rejected a bill that would have granted the Kineo St. John Tribe state-level recognition without establishing a process that other groups could use in the future. Supporters of the bill, including Maine Rep. Jennifer Poirier, a Republican from Skowhegan, said acknowledgment of the group’s legitimacy was long overdue.
Leaders from the Wabanaki Nations were opposed to that legislation too. The Wabanaki Alliance’s executive director, Maulian Bryant, emphasized that the nations took issue more with establishing a state-level process than with the identity of the group seeking recognition. 
“The concerns within the Wabanaki Alliance are, you know, appropriating tribal identity and validity,” Bryant said during a Maine legislative committee hearing in March. “Maybe not the group in question right now. But, it could lead to groups down the road, basically, meeting a much lower threshold set by state government — and not having a whole lot of validity as tribal people.”
Efforts in Vermont, New Hampshire
Maine legislators’ consideration of the bills came as their counterparts in Vermont heard two sharply contrasting presentations at the Statehouse in Montpelier this year. One, hosted by Vermont Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, featured Odanak leaders and urged lawmakers to reconsider, if not undo, Vermont’s state recognition process. 
Headrick also introduced a Vermont House bill that would establish a task force to “review the validity” of the state’s past tribal recognitions — and determine whether any should be rescinded. The legislation, H.362, had a brief hearing in the House General & Housing Committee in early April but did not advance past the panel this year.
Odanak and W8linak leaders have backed Headrick’s effort, calling it “a significant step toward recognizing the true history and rights of the Abenaki people” in a press release.

Later in April, the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs, which is the panel tasked with reviewing state recognition applications, held a presentation of its own at the Statehouse featuring leaders from Vermont’s state-recognized tribes. Those groups are the Missisquoi, the Elnu Abenaki, Nulhegan Abenaki, and Koasek Band of the Koas Abenaki Nation. 
The Vermont leaders — along with several researchers — urged legislators to reject Odanak and W8linak’s push to revisit the recognition process and, instead, spend time advocating for the members of the state-recognized tribes’ own needs and interests. 
Following that presentation, several Vermont House members, led by Georgia Republican Rep. Carolyn Branagan, introduced a resolution stating that the Legislature “reaffirms its support” for the state’s existing recognition process as well as for the “legitimacy” of the four groups that have already been recognized. 
The measure, J.R.H.4, had a hearing in the general and housing committee in May but didn’t make it past that point, either, before Vermont lawmakers adjourned for the year.
One of the speakers at the April panel was Don Stevens, chief of the Nulhegan group.  Just a month prior, Stevens was in New Hampshire speaking to legislators about a bill under consideration in that state’s House — and that Stevens was keen to see pass.
The proposal, which also did not make it over the finish line this year, would have allowed only enrolled members of state- or federally-recognized tribes with “historic and contemporary” ties to New Hampshire to serve on the state’s existing Commission on Native American Affairs. That would include Stevens’ group, per the bill, as well as the three other Vermont-recognized tribes. 
The legislation would also have given the leaders of recognized tribes power to nominate people to serve on the commission, with the speaker of the New Hampshire House confirming appointments. Currently, the state’s governor appoints applicants to the majority of the seats on the panel, who hail “from the Native American communities throughout the state,” according to the commission’s procedures.
There are no groups, however, with state- or federal-level recognition based in New Hampshire today. The bill would have also called for a report back on whether New Hampshire should develop its own state tribal recognition process, like Vermont’s.
Stevens said he supported the new proposed nomination process because it would allow the Nulhegan group to better advocate for its hundreds of members who live in New Hampshire, even though the group is based in Vermont. He said the border is, in some ways, arbitrary for those people because ancestral Abenaki territory spans both states.
“I’m just saying, you know, recognize the fact that that’s our homeland,” Stevens said in an interview. “We need to be on the commission to represent our own people.”

Currently, some members of New Hampshire’s commission are part of groups that say they are Abenaki but aren’t recognized by a state or federal government, according to New Hampshire Public Radio. Several members of the commission spoke at the March hearing, too, and said they opposed the proposal because it would, in their view, cede authority over a New Hampshire panel to people who live in a different state.
Asked about that argument in an interview, Stevens said his goal was not to “go against” anyone in a neighboring state, because his and the other Vermont groups already have the legitimacy they need from Vermont’s state government. 
“We’re already protected,” he said of Vermont’s groups. “We’re already recognized.”
Headrick, the Burlington representative, sent an email in March to the sponsors of the New Hampshire bill suggesting they reconsider it, pointing to Odanak and W8linak’s assertions that the Vermont-based groups have not sufficiently demonstrated Abenaki ancestry.
“I strongly urge careful consideration to avoid repeating the mistakes made here in Vermont,” Headrick wrote in the message, which he shared with VTDigger.
The New Hampshire bill also drew opposition from the Quebec-based First Nations themselves. In a press release issued after state legislators decided not to advance the measure, the First Nations’ leaders framed that fact as a win.
‘’This decision demonstrates a growing awareness of Indigenous and identity-related issues as well as an understanding of the repercussions that actions such as those proposed in this bill can have on our rights, identity, and heritage,” Rick O’Bomsawin, the Odanak chief, said in the statement. “We hope that this stance will help protect our Nation and discourage acts of usurpation that affect our people.”

Trash has long spelled trouble for wildlife. Now, Teton County is taking a “sterner” approach with people, issuing 330 violations for homeowners and businesses failing to lock it up.
The post In Jackson Hole, people aren’t fortifying their garbage, luring bears and leading to conflicts appeared first on WyoFile .","In the middle of the night last fall, Calico restaurant-area resident Hannah Navarro heard a bear just outside her window.
The bruin had sniffed out Navarro’s trash and was wrestling with her chain-and-carabiner-latched garbage can. She jumped into action, knocking on the glass, thinking she could scare the bear off. But the bruin wasn’t deterred. Instead, it just sat there, eating her garbage.
“So I went and got my bear spray, and I opened up the window, and I just sprayed him in the face close-range,” Navarro said. “And he ran off.”
Navarro now knows that her trash can was not bear-resistant, and thus noncompliant with Teton County rules. Last fall, she received a notice of violation from Teton County telling her as much and imploring her to get a new trash can. The notice was one of hundreds that Olivia Graykowski, a county code compliance officer, has posted on trash cans around Jackson Hole. It’s mundane, not-often-appreciated work. But Graykowski’s work puts her on the front lines of protecting Jackson Hole’s beloved bears.
Without enforcement, problems with bears will just get worse, she said. In places like Lake Tahoe, California, some neighborhoods require metal bear boxes in front of almost every house and homeowners string electric wires across windows to keep bruins from breaking and entering. In Aspen, Colorado, some 30 bears have taken up residence around the Pitkin County landfill, and pillage nearby neighborhoods.
“I don’t know if people really understand where it could get to, because it hasn’t gotten there yet,” Graykowski said. “The work we’re doing is trying to prevent that.”
In 2024, a commuter struck and killed Grizzly 399, a world-famous bear whose 2021 journey through southern Jackson Hole inspired Teton County and the Town of Jackson to beef up their bear-proofing efforts.


After the grizzly matriarch died in the Snake River Canyon in October, the News&Guide used the Wyoming Public Records Act to request every notice of bear-resistant container violations Teton County sent in 2024, which totaled 330 violations issued to 284 different property owners. Violations were clustered near Wilson, Rafter J and Highway 390. The violators list included acclaimed mountaineer Jimmy Chin, the News&Guide’s own multimedia sales manager Chad Repinski and businesses like the Blue Collar Restaurant Group’s Sidewinders American Grill on the West Bank, as well as the Bodega gas station at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort.
Blue Collar CEO Nicole Davis said that, because most of the group’s restaurants are in Jackson, she didn’t know about the county requirements until receiving the notice. Sidewinders bought a compliant dumpster shortly afterward. Repinski also came into compliance. Chin and Jackson Hole Mountain Resort did not respond to requests for comment.
In 2024, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department recorded 148 black bear conflicts in Teton County — situations where bears endanger people’s safety, their property or bear conservation — which was about twice the annual average. Most of the issues were in the neighborhoods where county officials issued violations: neighborhoods along Highway 390, the town of Wilson and the neighborhoods along Fall Creek Road south of Wilson.
Of the conflicts, 127, or 85%, involved unsecured garbage, Game and Fish large carnivore biologist Mike Boyce said. State officials relocated 10 blacks bears and killed six.
On his morning patrols, Boyce regularly sees trash cans that bears have “nuked,” leaving “garbage strewn about.” But he still thinks the Jackson Hole community is making progress in locking up its trash more securely.
“Lack of enforcement has been the missing link,” Boyce said. “And we just continue to have conflicts in the same places.”
Stern warnings
On a warm spring Thursday in May — trash day — Graykowski shifted Teton County’s Chevrolet Equinox into gear and drove straight from town to the West Bank of the Snake River. She meandered through the trash can-lined streets of neighborhoods near Wilson and off Wyoming Highway 390 with her eyes peeled. She scanned trash cans, evaluating whether they fit county regulations requiring homeowners to dispose of their garbage in self-locking, bear-resistant cans.
When she spotted older carabiner-latched cans similar to the one Navarro had replaced, or trash bags strewn about, Graykowski stopped and got out of the car to take photos on a county iPad. Graykowski attaches those photos to formal notices of violation for disobeying county land-use regulations and feeding wildlife. But even sending the notice of violations marks a change of approach for the Teton County Planning and Building Department, which enforces county regulations.
Rather than educating offenders, officials are now pursuing enforcement, Planning Director Chris Neubecker said.
Regulations requiring bear-resistant trash cans around Wilson have been in place since about 2009. But after the new county code passed in 2022, the department started attaching orange tags to cans, attempting to educate homeowners about the new requirements. Code compliance officers would then write outreach letters. In 2024, the county started taking a “sterner” approach and issuing the notices of violation.

But Teton County officials can’t issue fines directly. Doing so requires going through a lengthy process known as “abatement,” which requires hearings before county commissioners and, ultimately, court enforcement.
That judicial-like process hasn’t happened yet during Neubecker’s tenure — but it could soon.
If a property owner receives numerous notices of violation and fails to lock up their trash, the county will issue them a notice to abate, Neubecker said. The county has a few property owners on its radar who have been notified about non-compliant bear cans numerous times. Depending on whether those property owners comply, the county could have an abatement hearing soon, Neubecker said. The proceedings would closely resemble a property tax dispute.

“Teton County would present its evidence,” Neubecker said. “And then the property owner would have an opportunity to present their evidence about why they feel that they are in compliance, or they can rebut our evidence.”
One Wilson resident received four notices of violation last year, but was was out of town receiving medical treatment. Five other county property owners received three notices in 2024.
The Town of Jackson, which passed new bear-proofing regulations later, only requires the cans on its periphery in a “bear conflict zone” that skirts the Bridger-Teton National Forest and Tribal Trail Road. Town data was not included in the News&Guide’s request.
Getting canned
After receiving a county violation letter last fall, Navarro enthusiastically got a new can.

John Hebberger Jr. submitted this photo of a black bear in Jackson to the Jackson Hole News&Guide’s “Field Notes” section in September 2024. Last year was a deadly year for Teton County black bears, which get much less attention than their cousins, the grizzly bears. (John Hebberger Jr./Jackson Hole News&Guide)
“It’s just making smart choices so that we can coexist with the wildlife in our neighborhood,” Navarro said. “They were here first.”
Lea Fine, who also lives along Highway 390, concedes she didn’t always latch her older trash can properly. When Fine knew the bears were afoot, particularly in the fall, she latched her can. But she wasn’t so ardent about it when the bears weren’t as top-of-mind.
Fine knows she lives in bear country and her relationship with the animals is nuanced. She likes bears but also wants to let her dogs out. Sometimes, even that can feel risky, she said, talking with the News&Guide in her front yard.
“It’s pretty cool that you get to see these animals up close,” she said. “But it’s a little scary.”
After receiving one violation, Fine updated her can. She rented a can from her trash hauler.
For the planning department, Fine and Navarro’s decision to get new cans — not to mention Sidewinders’ and Repinski’s — represent progress, shrinking the county’s known list of violators.
“The list used to be bigger, and now it’s smaller,” Graykowski said.
People and bears
Bears and people are better and safer apart from each other, said Boyce, the bear biologist.
Bruins that do regularly get into garbage develop a taste for human food. “That’s something that they never forget,” Boyce said. The bears become more persistent and spend more time searching for garbage around people. That leads to conflicts, which can be “destructive and potentially dangerous,” Boyce said. Sometimes it can lead Game and Fish to euthanize bears.
In some areas, like Teton Village, Game and Fish has begun to see progress. The wildlife management agency recorded only one conflict last year in the village even though the area used to be a hotspot for conflicts, Boyce said.
“We made some serious progress up there with the garbage storage,” he added.
Teton County’s enforcement is promising, Boyce said.
“I fully support it,” he added.

Joe Wilson in the 2nd District. (Photo courtesy of Pruitt4Congress)COLUMBIA — A bankruptcy attorney and part-time professor at South Carolina State University announced a bid to oust U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, promising to work across party lines should he be successful.
Democrat Roger Pruitt of Columbia, who filed his candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on May 19, said in a release Tuesday that he genuinely believes “in putting our country first.”
“I’m more than willing to collaborate with anyone — whether Democrat, Republican, or Independent — who genuinely wants to tackle the fundamental issues we face together,” he said in the release.
Like any Democrat challenging a Republican incumbent in South Carolina, Pruitt is facing long odds.
Wilson spent 17 years in the state Senate before his 2001 election to Congress to fill the vacancy created by the death of his political mentor, U.S. Rep. Floyd Spence, who represented the 2nd District for 30 years. He is the father of state Attorney General Alan Wilson.
Joe Wilson’s last two challengers each lost by about 20 points in the district that includes all of Lexington, Aiken and Barnwell counties, as well as parts of Richland and Orangeburg counties.

David Robinson II, Wilson’s 2024 opponent, is the only other Democrat to file with the FEC. No Republican has filed.
Wilson’s last competitive race was in 2020 against Democrat Adair Ford Boroughs, who lost by 13 points despite a well-financed campaign. Boroughs went on to be U.S. attorney for South Carolina during the Biden administration.
Pruitt is branding himself as a “commonsense Democrat” with a platform that emphasizes balancing the federal budget, repairing rural infrastructure, improving health care in underserved communities, overhauling the Department of Veterans Affairs and reaching across the aisle.
“I’ve seen how bad policy decisions affect real people — families losing their homes, veterans navigating broken systems, and rural communities left behind,” he said. “South Carolinians are tired of politics as usual. We want leaders who show up, listen, and get things done.”
His father spent 22 years in the Air Force, and Pruitt eventually joined the Air Force himself in 1987. He served four years, leaving in 1991 with the rank of senior airman.
After spending two decades as a paralegal, Pruitt got his law degree from the Charleston School of Law and now runs his own bankruptcy law firm. He’s taught business law classes at South Carolina State University since August 2023.
“Washington has lost touch with the people it’s supposed to serve,” said the father of five. “I’m not a career politician. I’m a veteran, an attorney, and the proud son of working-class parents who taught me the values of service, sacrifice, and personal responsibility.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Roger-Pruitt-Headshot-1024x682.png,,,2025-06-18 17:07:33.620289

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia MercuryAfter Tuesday’s primary election cemented state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, her opponent Republican lieutenant governor candidate John Reid on Wednesday laid out his goals if elected to the state’s second-highest office. He also announced plans to assemble work groups to study key issues and pledged that if Democrat-led efforts to enshrine reproductive rights, voting rights and same-sex marriage rights into Virginia’s constitution met a tie in the Senate chamber, he would break it by voting them all down.
With official results pending, Hashmi is apparent victor in Democratic lieutenant governor primary

“It doesn’t provide protection for people who sincerely don’t agree with gay marriage,” he said of the proposed amendment to protect same-sex marriage at a press conference outside Falling Creek Middle School in Chesterfield. “I mean, you know, I’m running to be the lieutenant governor, not to be somebody’s pastor, but I’ve got to protect everybody’s rights.”
Reid’s comments highlighted the weight the amendments will carry among candidates and voters in the legislative races this fall. All 100 House of Delegates seats are up for election, as well as the state’s full slate of executive branch roles.
Having passed the legislature once already, the amendments must pass again next year before appearing on statewide ballots for voters to finally approve or reject. The reproductive rights amendment has only advanced so far because of Democrats’ majorities in both the House and Senate chamber, while the amendment to restore voting rights to former felons who’ve completed prison sentences and to remove a defunct 2006 ban on gay marriage have advanced with bipartisan support. 
While the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled to protect gay marriage, after it reversed its decision on reproductive rights, Justice Clarence Thomas expressed interest in revisiting its 2015 same-sex marriage decision. If the conservative-leaning high court struck down federal same-sex marriage protections, Virginia’s ban on gay marriage would still be embedded in its own constitution. 
Reid explained that he thinks the proposal could be a burden or moral issue for religious people who might be in positions to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples or be asked to officiate gay wedding ceremonies.

He added that he thinks ex-felons should continue to petition governors for a possibility to vote again, rather than automatically have that right restored. Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration broke with the precedent of former governors, which granted automatic eligibility for voting rights restoration to felons who completed their sentences, by requiring ex-offenders to petition to be granted the right to vote;  grantee totals  have fallen under Youngkin’s tenure.
Reid said he believes the reproductive rights amendment could allow for “day-of-birth” abortions. In Virginia law, abortions are only allowed after the second trimester if three physicians certify it would threaten the parents’ life or mental health “irremediably” and infanticide is already illegal at the state and federal level. 
Meanwhile Reid’s stance on the amendments is in alignment with Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, the state’s current lieutenant governor, who has left notes on both the marriage equality and reproductive rights amendments signaling her moral opposition to the measures. She has distanced herself from Reid, dropping out of a rally planned for late April, where they would have shared the stage with Youngkin. Earle-Sears and Youngkin canceled their appearances but Reid held the event anyway. 
Reid said Wednesday that Earle-Sears has still not reached out to him. 
“I’m disappointed in that. But what am I supposed to do?” he asked.

At a Richmond rally Tuesday night to hype up the back half of this year’s campaigns, Earle-Sears mentioned running mate Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking a second term, but did not mention Reid. 
In April, Youngkin had asked Reid to withdraw from the race after a Tumblr account with the same name as Reid’s other online profiles shared graphic sexual images. Reid balked at the suggestion and stayed in the race. He has remained supportive of Miyares and Earle-Sears’ candidacies. 
While Earle-Sears has yet to appear at events with Reid, it could happen in the months ahead, if the three Republican executive branch candidates want to campaign together as the Democratic ticket plans to do. 
DPVA chair Lamont Bagby announced the party’s slate of candidates Tuesday night, after primary polls closed. With Hashmi as their pick for lieutenant governor, Jay Jones will battle Miyares for the attorney general title and Abigail Spanberger will represent Democrats in her historic race for governor against Earle-Sears. 
In a press call Wednesday morning, House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, drew a bright line between how he believes each camp is functioning in the tense months before November elections. He said Virginia’s Republican top-of-ticket candidates haven’t yet campaigned together because they have different views on certain issues.
“We have diversity with unity, and they have diversity with disunity,” Scott said. “So I think it says a lot about how they accept their diversity.” 
He also acknowledged that both the Democratic and Republican tickets are the most diverse Virginia has seen, representing a range of genders, sexualities, ethnicities and religions. Scott, the state’s first Black House Speaker, said politics in Virginia are reflective of the state’s diversity.
Both Earle-Sears and Spanberger stand to be the first woman governor of Virginia while Reid is the first openly gay candidate to run for statewide office in Virginia. Attorney General Jason Miyares is already the first Hispanic person elected to statewide office and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, would be the second woman lieutenant governor and first Muslim person in a statewide office in Virginia if she wins.

Reid said he hopes his party’s policy priorities will carry them across the finish line in November, touting its efforts to give parents more input on public education choices. He noted his support of previous Republican efforts to create school choice vouchers or savings accounts parents could access if they wish to send their children to schools outside of their districts. 
When asked how else he thinks the state could support schools that are struggling with student-to-teacher ratios or infrastructure and funding, he said that helping students switch schools could ultimately help the ratios at overcrowded ones. 
He took aim at his opponent, Hashmi, for her views on education. As chair of the Senate’s education committee, she has been a bottleneck for GOP efforts like the voucher and savings account proposals. 
Calling her “radical,” Reid opposed Hashmi’s goals of increased funding for public schools. During her time as senator she has pressed for funding to boost the number of teachers and specialists, and had advocated for infrastructure and technology upgrades to under-funded schools. 
Over the course of the summer, Reid will be taking himself to policy school by assembling roundtables of various experts and potential constituents with different lived experiences that can share insights on different topics.
“I’m putting together a series of meetings with policy experts, parents, and business people who have a stake in the results of the problems that we’re dealing with in Virginia — and it’s not going to all be Republicans at the table,” he said. 
Details on when those will happen should be announced in the near future, his campaign said. 
It’s unclear exactly what Reid thinks of the massive federal funding cuts the Trump administration is pursuing, which could affect Virginians on Medicaid and have already resulted in thousands of federal worker layoffs.
“Donald Trump’s in Washington. I got to fix what’s happening in Richmond, and I got to make this a better state for Virginia,” he said in response to questions about his view on the administration’s actions. “It doesn’t do us any good to constantly scream about Donald Trump when we have problems that we can address ourselves here.”
Reid did say he thinks the “tone” of the administration’s messaging about the plan to slash funds was wrong, citing former Trump advisor Elon Musk brandishing a chainsaw on stage in a symbolic demonstration of the cuts. 
As a former communications director for former U.S. Senator George Allen (who was also governor at one point), and as a former journalist and radio talk show host, Reid emphasized his experience questioning systems and fostering debate. As a first-time politician he also said constituents won’t have to worry he is beholden to special interest groups or fellow lawmakers. 
“I’m going to come into the Capitol with a fresh set of eyes,” he said. “I don’t owe anybody anything.”

While the $4 million adds an extra 10% to the line’s appropriated budget over the current year, and will add some additional trains to the line, advocates are concerned it won’t go far enough. Gov. Ned Lamont and the state Department of Transportation say funding for Shore Line East must be balanced with other rail service priorities, and they want to monitor ridership on the coastal route before committing to further increases.
The funding boost came after Senate Bill 714, which would have restored service on the line to pre-pandemic levels, failed to come up for a vote in either chamber during the waning days of the General Assembly’s 2025 session. Annual state funding for Shore Line East currently stands at roughly half where it was before the pandemic, and estimates for restoring full service to the line vary from $25 million to over $80 million. 
According to the state Department of Transportation, nearly $40 million is authorized in the current state budget for Shore Line East in 2026 and $41 million for 2027. By comparison, the Hartford Line received roughly $60 million per year in the current budget.
The additional $4 million, secured for the second year of the biennial 2026-27 budget, comes on top of a $5 million boost Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, pushed to include in the current biennium budget. That funding came out of remaining federal COVID emergency funds. 
The added funding will only expand service by a few trips a day between the shoreline’s nine communities. But Cohen, who co-chairs the legislature’s Transportation Committee, said it’s a start.
“We still have more work to do to restore service to pre-pandemic levels, but I am proud that we were able to secure an additional $4 million this year on top of the $5 million I secured in the last budget,” said Cohen, on whose request the sum was added as a line item in this year’s budget. 
Shore Line East is the smallest of Connecticut’s six commuter rail lines, and it currently runs 20 daily trains, according to the DOT. It faced struggles beginning in 2018, when Amtrak’s seasonal track work reduced services significantly, advocates say. Then several incidents of trains malfunctioning further set back ridership. 
“We kind of limped our way through, and then we got to COVID,” said Susan Feaster, founder of SLE Riders Advocacy Group. “So even before COVID, our numbers were starting to go down.” 
In 2019, Shore Line East ran 36 daily trains, but COVID-19 led to further service reductions across all of the state’s commuter rail lines. In 2023, after budget cuts reduced the route’s service by another seven trains, the line was then running only 16 trains. 
At the same time, other routes were seeing ridership rebound. The Hartford and the Waterbury lines, which have received millions in state investments to upgrade infrastructure and service, have exceeded pre-pandemic ridership levels. But those lines also serve some of the more densely-populated cities in Connecticut. 

Last year, with the $5 million in American Rescue Plan funding, Shore Line East was able to add four weekday trains, along with round-trip direct service between Stamford and New London. While the ARPA funds were temporary, the $4 million secured in the next budget should help sustain that additional service.
For the last year, the line saw ridership just over a quarter of its pre-pandemic level. And last July, the line only carried only 18,559 riders as compared to over 60,000 in July of 2019. November was the line’s single best month since March 2020, with a total of 20,840 trips. 
While the full impact of the four reinstated trains is still unclear — and DOT officials say they need more data — advocates estimate ridership has increased by 50%. 
Rob Blanchard, a spokesman for Gov. Ned Lamont, said the governor’s administration wants to improve rail service by encouraging more housing development near transit, adding express trains to New York, and establishing a new bridge between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme — all of which is expected to speed up and improve service. 
Shore Line East, Blanchard said, would cost more to restore to full service than any other rail line. “The current per-passenger-trip subsidy for Shore Line East is significantly more than any other mass transit option in the state,” Blanchard said. “We must balance the overall fiscal health of the [state’s transportation fund] with services that deliver value for Connecticut residents and businesses.”
The current subsidy per ride for Shore Line East is $183, as compared to the Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line’s $6.48 subsidy per ride. Comparably,  in 2021 when ridership for Shore Line East began to drop, its subsidy per rider was $55.28.
Advocates maintain the line must be reinstated to full service. 
Jim Gildea, Chairman of the Connecticut Public Transportation Council said, “Restoring Shore Line East to full service will not only improve accessibility but also strengthen our public transportation network, ensuring that it meets the needs of all Connecticut residents.”
Feaster said Shore Line East has received less support than other lines.  “It seems like every time our numbers are good, they keep changing the target for us,” she said. “Lamont said one of the problems was that we didn’t have enough housing down here, which was not a criteria for any other branch line– Danbury [or] Waterbury.”  
Feaster and Gildea both argue that restoring more trains to the line is what helps build ridership, and not the other way around.
“With last year’s funding of $5 million, we are witnessing a dedicated effort to enhance our rail services, which is vital for attracting riders back to the line,” Gildea said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/branford_train.jpg,,,2025-06-18 17:07:33.620289

Santiago/Getty Images)More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.

In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.

In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

(Screenshot from State House livestream)As negotiators with the New Hampshire House and Senate were preparing to call it a day after hours of debate on the state budget Tuesday, three protesters walked into the hearing room and pretended to fall dead.
Those demonstrators, opposed to the Republican-controlled Legislature’s proposed changes to Medicaid, were arrested over the incident by New Hampshire State Police troopers guarding the State House. The three arrested were Lisa Beaudoin, 54, of Concord; Sarah Chapman, 44, of Nottingham; and Juliana Good, 25, of Newmarket, according to court documents. They have each been charged with disorderly conduct.
The State Police wrote in court records that the three “knowingly refused to comply with a lawful order from a New Hampshire State Trooper to move out of Room 210 of the Legislative Office Building, a public place, in Concord, NH, so that the sensitive contents of the room could be secured at the end of business.”
Lawmakers are considering including a number of changes to Medicaid in this year’s budget legislation. A Senate proposal would add work requirements to the program. Gov. Kelly Ayotte has also proposed charging some Medicaid recipients premiums and increasing the amount Medicaid recipients must pay for their prescriptions. The House and Senate have both taken up Ayotte’s measures, but have been debating the details of how to implement the premiums.
Medicaid proponents have mounted a last-minute campaign urging lawmakers to reverse course on those changes.

While reporters have repeatedly asked Hall on whether he’d commit to finishing the budget on time, the Republican speaker continuously failed to offer any assurance that the chamber would meet the state’s July 1 budget deadline. 
Although lawmakers are required to pass a new state budget by the end of June each year, the deadline carries no legal penalties if lawmakers fail to come to an agreement on funding. 
With the new fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1, Hall asserted at a January press conference that the House’s constitutional responsibility was to deliver a budget by Sept. 30. While the House would work to have the budget complete by July 1, Hall told reporters at a press conference Wednesday that the budget may not be complete until the end of September. 
Hall’s comments have sparked concern from Democratic members of the Senate and some Republicans, alongside several education groups, who rely on lawmakers to finalize the budget before July 1, with the fiscal year for Michigan School districts ending on June 30.
On Tuesday, State Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton), who chairs the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on PreK-12, criticized Hall and several other lawmakers for traveling to Washington, D.C. to meet with members of the Trump administration rather than negotiating a spending plan.

“We’re here on the floor working hard, not only still figuring out budget priorities and discussions, but we’ve been working on legislation while House Republicans are in D.C. kissing the ring of the president,” Camilleri said. “We have very different priorities, and that’s very clear from the contrast this week.”
At the beginning of Wednesday’s press conference, Hall said the trip was “perfectly timed” with Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer departing on a weeklong trip to build up trade ties with Australia.
“If you’re going to pick a day to go to Washington, D.C. and meet with the cabinet and a lot of the departments and meet with the Domestic Policy Council, picking a day when Whitmer is in Australia is actually a pretty well coordinated day, because you can’t get a budget done without Gretchen Whitmer, we all know that,” Hall said. 
With the House passing its K-12 and its higher education budget through the chamber last week, Hall said they’d given Democrats ample time to negotiate. 
Tracy Wimmer, a spokesperson for Michigan House Democrats, said that was “a very interesting take,” calling attention to the limited days remaining and noting that passing a budget by July 1 is a vital responsibility of the Legislature.

Camilleri contended that if it were up to him and his House counterpart Rep. Tim Kelly (R-Saginaw Township) they could likely have a deal on the education budget by the deadline, pointing to Hall as the hitch in the conversation. 
However, Hall argued Democrats were to blame and that the opposing party never intended to pass the budget on time, pointing to comments from State Sen. Mallory McMorrow in November that Hall could trigger a government shutdown. 
“I’ve always preferred to get this done by July 1. I just am dealing with a group of people that are not serious about getting it done,” Hall said. 
Camilleri said the goal was for both chambers to have their spending plans ready to go by July 1, with the Senate meeting its obligation by passing spending plans for both education and the general government months ago. 
With lawmakers off Thursday in recognition of Juneteenth, the Senate only has three session days on the calendar to come to an agreement on a budget by the deadline, while the House has four. 
While Hall said he’d work to have the K-12 budget finalized by July 1, he argued it makes more sense for the remainder of the budget to be finalized by September 30 as House Republicans examine the general government budget for items to cut. 
“When you’re really digging into the programs, you don’t want unintended consequences to cuts. You want to ensure that you’re getting the most value for your dollars,” Hall said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3510-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 17:07:33.620289

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Students entering Florida for higher education may want to keep an eye on the price tag now that universities have permission to increase tuition on out-of-state students.
Out-of-state tuition has not been changed at any public institution in Florida since 2012, when University of South Florida raised it to $491 per credit hour. At Florida State University, out-of-state tuition for graduate students has not increased since 2004. 
The State University System Board of Governors handed authority to university trustees to increase out-of-state tuition by up to 15%, if they so choose. 
The policy passed has two phases, permitting an increase of out-of-state tuition up to 10% for students enrolled in fall 2025 and up to 15% for students enrolled in 2026. 
“We really are thrilled” that the schools will have the option to raise tutition, University of North Florida President Moez Limayem said.
Limayem said he is interested in having more than two years to increase tuition to avoid a sharp increase in a two-year span.
Florida out-of-state tuition is the third lowest in the country at $21,690, ranking behind North Dakota and South Dakota. The average nationwide is $30,780.
If every institution increased out-of-state tuition by 15%, the board estimates revenue could increase by $105 million. 
The opportunity to raise tuition was approved unanimously. 
The board voted, too, to require institutions to maintain the same ratio of in-state and out-of-state students as they had enrolled in fall of 2024. 
In-state tuition has not been raised since 2013.

What do Nazis, fascists, incels, skinheads, misogynists, insurrectionists and Proud Boys all have in common? Many  of them confide in reporter Elle Reeve.
It was around 2015 and Reeve was reporting for Vice News about the rise of the “alt right,” a term coined by its leader, Richard Spencer. She spent time on internet message boards like 4chan and 8chan where far right activists communicated, trolled liberals, and began to coalesce as a movement. These were often ordinary people who increasingly embraced conspiracy theories and violence.
This was during the presidency of Barack Obama, when many people were imagining that the U.S. was in the glow of a “post-racial” era. Reeve knew better. 
“Racism wasn’t dying off with an older generation,” she told the Vermont Conversation. “There was a strong beating heart right there on the internet.”
In 2017, Reeve was there when the alt right burst out of obscure Internet chat rooms and into public consciousness in a violent attack in Charlottesville, Virginia. Her documentary account, “Charlottesville: Race and Terror,” earned her and Vice News Tonight a Peabody Award, four Emmys and a George Polk Award.
In 2019, Reeve became a correspondent for CNN, where she works today. She was at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 reporting on the attack on Congress by Trump supporters, many of whom she knew well.
Why do they talk to her? “They want to tell their story, they want to confess, they want to unburden themselves,” she said.
Reeve’s recent book is “Black Pill: How I Witnessed the Darkest Corners of the Internet Come to Life, Poison Society, and Capture American Politics.” The title refers to how far right activists speak of taking the “black pill” of nihilism to justify their cruelty and violence. “It’s this dark nihilism that the world is doomed. There’s nothing you can do to change it, and you at best, can hope for it to collapse.”
Reeve traces how far-right rhetoric has moved from the fringes to the mainstream, with Donald Trump and J.D. Vance channeling extremist ideas and language.
Vance has denounced the “woke ideology” of “white women who are miserable about their own lives, enforcing codes about racial justice, gay rights on other people to make other people miserable, to account for how miserable they are in their own lives,” Reeve explained.
Vance’s use of the term “childless cat ladies” is another far right meme. “I’ve read that on 4chan six or seven years ago,” said Reeve. “It has trickled upward.”
Another far right notion that is now embraced by mainstream Republicans is that diversity is bad. “They think that racial and ethnic and gender diversity makes us weaker. It makes us fools. This is just something that they ridiculed all the time.”
Reeve explained the far right context of Trump’s attacks on people of color. “If a white person commits a crime in their world, it’s because they’re a bad guy. But if a Black person commits a crime in their world, it’s because they’re Black.”
Reeve warned that many people “are vulnerable to those ideas. I just interviewed a ton of people who were so nice to me at a Trump boat parade. They were so nice to me, and then they started talking to me about how it’s not right to eat people’s cats, and these people do animal sacrifice, and they’re dirty and they bring disease.”
“It’s not all crazy people who believe this stuff. It’s regular people and your neighbors,” said Reeve. “You have an obligation to push back against that, whether or not they’ll listen to you.”
Reeve said about the future, “There has been an escalating radicalization among the Republican elite and a softening among the voters. … People speak freely about civil war. That is dangerous.”
“I don’t like it but I don’t know where that balance ends up after the election. You can’t do something like Jan. 6 without a feeling that there’s an army behind you of supporters who will back you up.”

Meet Kate and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
After three years and 1.3 million texts and phone calls, the national LGBTQ+ suicide prevention hotline is shutting down. The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it was ending LGBTQ+ services for 988, the crisis hotline for queer youth that launched in 2022. 
“Everyone who contacts the 988 Lifeline will continue to receive access to skilled, caring, culturally competent crisis counselors who can help with suicidal, substance misuse, or mental health crises, or any other kind of emotional distress,” the administration said in an announcement. “Anyone who calls the Lifeline will continue to receive compassion and help.” 
The statement does not specify why services specific to LGBTQ+ callers are ending. 
LGBTQ+ rights organizations decried the news as a crushing blow to young queer Americans, many of whom are already suffering through increasingly hostile laws and policies. 
“This is devastating, to say the least,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of the queer youth suicide prevention organization Trevor Project, in a statement. “Suicide prevention is about people, not politics. The administration’s decision to remove a bipartisan, evidence-based service that has effectively supported a high-risk group of young people through their darkest moments is incomprehensible.”
The announcement came on the eve of the Supreme Court’s ruling in the United States vs. Skrmetti, in which the court upheld a Tennessee law barring gender-affirming care for transgender minors. The ruling is expected to bolster anti-transgender medical bans for youth in 25 states and risks undercutting constitutional protections for all transgender people. 
Over the last five years, LGBTQ+ people have increasingly been the target of hostile policy and political attacks. Against that backdrop, the 988 hotline was praised as a lifeline for young people in desperate need of support. But the Trump administration’s moves to unravel diversity, equity and inclusion policies have undercut services for LGBTQ+ people broadly. 
The Trevor Project, which staffs its own crisis line, worked with the federal government to field approximately 50 percent of the 988 calls. Six other providers also do that work. According to the Trevor Project, it served 231,000 crisis contacts last year alone.The organization reports that LGBTQ+ youth are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide as their straight cisgender peers. According to their 2023 survey, roughly half of transgender and nonbinary youth had seriously considered suicide, and 41 percent of queer youth overall had.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP23284551126899-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 17:07:33.620289

His bill — called the Stop Unlawful Detention and End Mistreatment Act — would require all ICE-operated and affiliated facilities to publicly list all individuals who are being detained, where they are being detained, when they’ve been detained, and why.
The legislation would also require ICE facilities to provide information regarding the age, nationality, and legal status of those detained, as well as data on any use of force when they were being detained, along with information if they were transferred to another facility or deported out of the country.
The provisions would also cover local jails contracting with ICE.
“We’re talking about mothers, fathers, grandparents, taxpayers, even folks showing up for their immigration hearings,” Frost said at a press conference held at his district office in Orlando about those being taken in by ICE agents. “It’s a culture of fear and chaos.”
The representative went on to say that even U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained under Florida’s recently passed immigration law (enforcement of which has been suspended by a federal judge).
While congressional Democrats have expressed outrage regarding ICE’s actions for months, a Pew Research Center survey of more than 5,000 U.S. adults published on Tuesday showed that Americans have more mixed views of the Trump administration’s immigration actions this year, with opinions about specific policies largely split along partisan lines, with Republicans supportive and Democrats opposed.
On the specific issue of ICE raids on workplaces where undocumented migrants may be working, 54% said they disapproved of those actions, with 45% supporting the raids (the survey was conducted before the recent high-profile ICE raid on workplaces in Los Angeles).
Confrontations
In the past month, ICE agents have had physical confrontations with Democratic party lawmakers in incidents across the country.

New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested on Tuesday by federal agents at an immigration court after he linked arms with a person authorities were attempting to detain.
California U.S. Senator Alex Padilla was shoved to the ground and handcuffed by federal agents at a Homeland Security press conference in Los Angeles  last week.
New Jersey Democratic U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver was indicted last week by a grand jury following charges of assaulting two federal agents during a confrontation outside an ICE detention facility in Newark.

Joining Frost at his press conference were immigration advocates who said the legislation is badly needed.
“The Number One problem that we’re having in the community, especially in Orange County, is the fact that our people are disappearing. Immigrants are disappearing from the county jail,” said Ericka Tejeda-Gomez of the Immigrants are Welcome Here Coalition.
There are two reasons for that, she said, the first being the 287(g) agreements that 292 local law enforcement agencies in Florida have signed with the federal government to assist in immigration enforcement. The second reason are the additional agreements between Florida law enforcement and ICE regarding the delivery of those detainees.
“The moment that that person bonds out, they disappear from the jail system and there is no way of knowing if they’re still there, [or] if they have been sent to Krome [a detention center in Miami], if they’ve been sent to Texas, if they’ve been sent to New Mexico,” Tejeda-Gomez said.
“This is why it’s most imperative that bills like this ensure that, at the local levels, we have a way of keeping people tracked so that they can have representation and due process.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
Conservative justices lean toward allowing Tennessee’s ban on gender affirming care

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
How to stay or when to move? Transgender laws force tough choices on Tennessee families

The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities on Wednesday approved a raft of affordability measures meant to blunt the impact of a surge in electricity prices that took effect at the start of June.
In unanimous votes, the utility regulator backed orders that would defer a total of $60 from summer electricity bills, extend $175 in bill credits to low-income ratepayers, waive reconnection fees, and extend winter shutoff protections through July, August, and September.
“Sometimes, we don’t have the opportunity to thank our utilities enough. They really stepped up to the plate very quickly,” said BPU Commissioner Zenon Christodoulou. “It wasn’t their doing, that these prices went up, but they really are taking a lot of the brunt of this and we really appreciate their efforts. They came to us and they came up with plans as quickly as we could imagine.”
The deferred bill program would cut $30 from monthly bills for all ratepayers in July and August, when summer heat pushes electricity usage to its peak.
Customers would repay those balances, which would not increase due to interest or carrying costs, over the following six months, said BPU Executive Director Bob Brabston.
“No customer will pay a penny more as a result of this, and all customers will benefit by having their typically high summer bills eased somewhat as part of this proposal,” Brabston told the board.
Qualifications for summer shutoff protections are identical to those in the Winter Termination Program. Residents who are enrolled in certain assistance programs — like the federally funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, among others — or receive state or local utility assistance are eligible for winter shutoff protections.
The deferred bill program, which would require submissions from the state’s four regulated utilities by July 1, also would bar summer shutoffs for ratepayers protected by Linda’s Law, which requires utilities to wait 90 days before discontinuing services over nonpayment for customers who use life-sustaining medical equipment powered by electricity.
They also call for utilities to offer deferred payment agreements lasting up to 24 months, compared to the 12 now required under state law. Those agreements are separate to the bill deferral program for July and August.
The actions are regulators’ latest effort to defray the impact of a steep rise in electricity supply costs that pushed rates up by roughly 20% at the start of June.
Democratic officials have blamed the cost hikes on PJM Interconnection, the state’s grid operator, for delays in connecting renewable projects to the grid.
“It is not perfect. There is no silver bullet here,” BPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy said Wednesday. “These generation cost increases are outside of the (regulated utilities). They’re outside of the control of this agency, but it doesn’t mean that we don’t all share some responsibility to help to reduce costs, particularly in these very, very high-usage months.”
Republicans have charged Gov. Phil Murphy’s renewables-heavy energy agenda stalled new generation in the state, leading to the supply-demand imbalance that’s driving up costs.
On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Tony Bucco (R-Morris) called the board’s latest moves a politically motivated election-year effort.
“The problem is it doesn’t fix the problem. It’s just an election-year gimmick to get them past another election,” Bucco said. “This is something we have to address: How are we going to fix this? And really, the only way to fix it is to increase supply here in New Jersey.”
He said officials could instead take up Republican proposals that would, among other things, suspend the imposition of sales tax on energy.
The BPU on Wednesday approved the first phase of the Garden State Energy Storage Program. That program aims to award contracts for between 350 megawatts and 700 megawatts by Oct. 31.
A different order approved by the board will extend $48.7 million in Residential Energy Assistance Program credits to ratepayers eligible for winter-shutoff protections.
Those credits would be applied to seven monthly bills beginning in August and ending February 2026 in equal installments of $25, for a total benefit of $175. The benefit was first paid last year, but it was applied as a one-time $175 credit to August utility bills.
Credits under the Residential Energy Assistance Program are separate from a $430 million plan Murphy, lawmakers, and regulators announced earlier in June.
That program, which the BPU has not yet approved, promises a $100 benefit to all New Jersey ratepayers with an additional $150 for those who qualify for the Winter Termination Program.
In a separate vote, the board approved higher award levels under the Universal Service Fund, a utility assistance program administered by the Department of Community Affairs that applies monthly credits to low- and moderate-income households.
The floor for monthly utility credits under the Universal Service Fund will rise to $20, from $5, in October, while maximum monthly credit would increase from $180 to $200.
Of the roughly 226,000 who received benefits from the Universal Service Fund last year, about 136,000 received the smallest possible credits, while approximately 8,000 got the maximum allowed amount.

Joe Pittman told reporters Wednesday.","Sen. Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) discusses ongoing budget negotiations with reporters (Capital-Star photo by Ian Karbal)State lawmakers have been scrambling to finalize next year’s state budget by the statutory deadline of June 30. But Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana), one of the most important figures in negotiations, says there’s little chance they’ll make it.
“I see no practical way that a budget will be completed on June 30,” he told reporters Wednesday. “We are engaged in conversations, but those conversations have not gone as quickly as we would prefer.”
Pittman added most Pennsylvanians won’t feel any pain.
“On July 1, the sun will come up and I don’t think the good people of Pennsylvania will see any notable difference in their daily lives,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
It wouldn’t be the first time lawmakers have blown a deadline on a spending plan in recent years. That’s in part because of the partisan power divide in state government. Democrats have the governor’s mansion and a narrow majority in the House, while Republicans control the  Senate. 
The dynamic has led to both clashes and compromises.
Pittman expressed some optimism about a deal being reached reasonably close to the deadline, noting some broad agreements exist between Democrats and Republicans. Most importantly, he said, is the consensus that the budget, which currently operates on a deficit, needs balancing.
“I’m encouraged that it seems that all of the parties in the building understand that we do have a structural deficit, and understand that we must figure out a way to deal with that,” he said.
But how to address that could be an issue.
Pittman said there are “two fundamental pillars” that he believes need to be addressed. One is what to do about Medicaid spending, which Gov. Josh Shapiro has proposed increasing by $2 billion
“If that number really is a $2 billion increase, I can tell you there’s not going to be a lot to talk about otherwise,” Pittman said. “If we have to carry that kind of increase, which then parlays into an even greater increase the following year, we have no capacity to do anything in this budget.”
Pittman said potential solutions could include limiting coverage of GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Ozempic, and requiring greater “cost sharing” for more Medicaid enrollees.
Negotiations are happening as members in the U.S. Congress weigh large cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs like SNAP that could increase the state share of responsibility for the programs.
The other priority for Pittman and Senate Republicans is regulation of skill games, which resemble video gambling machines.
They have proliferated around Pennsylvania corner stores, gas stations and smoke shops and are currently unregulated, which Pittman said has led to both public safety issues and the loss of potential revenue.
What that regulation looks like, however, is still up in the air. But taxing the machines could net the state some money to fill their deficit.
Asked at a separate press conference about Pittman’s assessment, Shapiro provided few details.
“I think we understand the issues that need to be addressed,” he said. “I’m not suggesting we’ve agreed on the answers on how to address them.”
Shapiro added this year’s lift could be lighter than last year’s, when a Commonwealth Court ruling forced lawmakers to reassess the state’s public education funding formula.

Pittman said if a deal could not be reached within a reasonable timeframe after the statutory budget deadline, he’s open to passing a short-term budget that would fund the government and allow lawmakers more time to negotiate.
A spokesperson for House Democrats did not respond to a specific question about the likelihood of the June 30 deadline being blown, but instead pointed to a provided a statement highlighting work Democrats have already done.
“The House Democratic majority is a pragmatic group that has passed numerous budget-related bills to provide for adult use cannabis, to provide working families a raise through an increase to the minimum wage, and to invest in the stability of our energy sector and increase production in the future,” Beth Rementer, a spokesperson for the caucus said in an email.
“We stand ready to send the governor’s proposed budget to the Senate. But we also acknowledge in divided government, we must work together to pass a final compromise,” she added. “We have been waiting patiently to see what the Senate can pass — preferably before or not long after June 30.”
In February, Shapiro unveiled a proposed budget that would have had the state dip into its surplus funds to cover a roughly $1.6 billion deficit. It also included revenue from legal cannabis, which would require the legislature to pass a bill establishing a regulatory framework.
Pittman said that Democratic efforts to legalize cannabis are unlikely to pass this year. Senators in both parties were critical of a proposal that emerged from the House that would have allowed cannabis sold in state-owned stores like liquor.
Funding of public transit has also been a source of contention between Senate Republicans and House Democrats. Advocates have warned that public transit services, especially SEPTA, which serves the Philadelphia area, will likely cut services and raise fares without help from the state. Republicans have generally objected, saying the funding primarily helps those in urban areas, and would have to be paired with funding for roads and bridges throughout the state.
A bill to increase mass transit funding by roughly $300 million passed the House this week. Similar legislation has been passed in the Democratic-controlled chamber before, with no action in the Senate. The bill would also provide $500 million for road and bridge repair.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Pittman-on-budget-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-06-18 16:06:34.623713

(Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Department of Correctional Services on Wednesday selected which construction company will build the state’s next prison: Hausmann Construction of Lincoln.
Correctional Services said the Lincoln-headquartered company was the lowest base bidder for the project, at $313.3 million, compared to the joint ventures of Sampson Construction/Caddell Construction ($344.3 million) and Clark Construction/MCL Construction ($341 million). One partner in each of the joint ventures was Nebraska-based.

The Nebraska Legislature appropriated $350 million for building a replacement prison, but some lawmakers worried rising construction costs could push the project over.
Correctional Services Director Rob Jeffreys said Wednesday that the bids came “well below” similar construction projects in other states, and he reaffirmed that the project would stay on budget. The three construction ventures were publicly named Monday, but bid totals were not released until Wednesday. 
The department said other costs adjacent to construction, such as land and dirt work, would stay within the state appropriation or other department funding.
“As with any NDCS construction project, there will be ongoing evaluation for efficiencies,” a news release states.

The 1,512-bed facility, once built, will be located north of Interstate 80, adjacent to North 70th Street, close to Lincoln.
Hausmann’s recent construction projects include the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Osborne Legacy Complex, Bob Devaney Sports Center renovation and Westbrook Music Hall replacement; expansions for the Lincoln Children’s Zoo and Pillen Family Farms; the Douglas County Treasurer and 911 Operations Center; the Joint Forces Headquarters Building for the Nebraska National Guard; Central Nebraska Veterans Home; multiple Lincoln Fire and Rescue stations and many elementary, middle and high schools.
Jeffreys said the procedural “intent to award” signing with Hausmann “marks an important step forward in our mission to create a safer, more effective correctional system.”
“Hausmann Construction is a local company who understands our commitment to fiscal responsibility, completing this project the Nebraska way,” Jeffreys said. “Their sub-contractors are high-performing and many are local — keeping business in Nebraska. We are ready to work side by side to bring this vision to life for our staff, our state and those we serve.”
The department will continue finalizing the contract with Husmann. The state expects construction to begin in early fall.

A group of activists stood outside the store entrance hoisting signs and voicing chants. They talked to shoppers and asked them to support other stores that stand for “fairness and equality.”
Sam’s Club is a chain of membership-only warehouse club retail stores in the United States owned by Walmart. The Associated Press reported last November that Walmart was “rolling back its diversity, equity and inclusion policies.”
“Now, we will see if Walmart is equally committed to racism,” Erik Shelley, a Michigan United spokesperson, said. He added that the effort is part of the social action group’s “Week of Resistance for Juneteenth.”
Juneteenth is a holiday that celebrates the end of slavery in a section of the United States. It recognizes June 19, 1865 when enslaved people in Texas were told they were free, more than two years after then-President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation that sought to end slavery. Former U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in 2021 that made Juneteenth a federal holiday. It was first celebrated last year as an official state holiday in Michigan.
Michigan United worked with groups like Oakland Forward, Black Women’s Roundtable, and the Detroit Council of Baptist Pastors. Together, they have planned a week of action to stand up for civil rights.
During the week, Michigan United lifted up what it calls  “Buycott,” which means asking people to shop at Black-owned businesses instead of big companies like Walmart that are not supporting DEI. Protestors gave out lists and QR codes to help people find new places to shop.
The “Week of Resistance” will end with a cookout on Saturday, June 21 at Inkster Park, beginning at 11 a.m. There will be music from DJ Too Cool Thomas, games, dancing, and food offerings including barbecue, greens, and Jollof rice. Organizers say it’s a way to celebrate Juneteenth and bring the community together.

(Photo courtesy of Homeland Security Investigations)Federal and state authorities apprehended 84 unauthorized migrants during a raid Tuesday at a horse racing track in Calcasieu Parish, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The operation at Delta Downs near Vinton focused on businesses that own and race horses at the facility and their employees, according to an ICE news release issued Wednesday. The people arrested were processed for administrative immigration violations and taken to the U.S. Border Patrol station in Lake Charles.
Those arrested included Enrique Gonzalez Moreno, 36, from Mexico, who ICE said has illegally entered the U.S. four times. He has reportedly been convicted twice for driving under the influence, once for cocaine possession and once for illegal reentry. 
ICE also took an unnamed 40-year-old man from Mexico into custody who the agency said has previously been arrested for criminal conspiracy, aggravated battery with a dangerous weapon, sexual battery and video voyeurism.
ICE said it planned to have an update on the disposition of these criminal cases once they are verified.
Eric DeLaune, special agent in charge of ICE’s New Orleans Homeland Security Investigations office, said each case of unauthorized employment is being reviewed to determine if any other criminal activities were taking place, including labor exploitation.
“Oftentimes, when we’re conducting these worksite enforcement operations, we uncover other forms of criminal conduct such as document and benefit fraud, money laundering and human trafficking,” DeLaune said in the ICE statement.
Authorities received a tip indicating businesses at the racetrack’s stables were employing unauthorized workers, according to ICE. The information was confirmed during a subsequent on-site visit. 
Agencies that took part in the Delta Downs operation included U.S. Border Patrol, Louisiana State Police, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the FBI, the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff’s Office and the Lake Charles Police Department.

State House Speaker Javier Martinez and Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller were among speakers at the office of El Centro de Igualdad y Derechos, each denouncing the federal immigration operations occurring throughout the state but also outlining long-standing protections Albuquerque and New Mexico residents have, regardless of immigration status. 
ICE offers Albuquerque immigrant reprieve — for now

“I will not allow a wannabe dictator in Washington, DC, to let my parents’ sacrifices and the sacrifices of all these good people behind me go to waste,” said Martinez (D-Albuquerque), referring to members of various immigration advocacy groups like El Centro joining him at the lectern.  “If they want to come after you all, they need to come through me first.”
Martinez and Keller pointed to protections against local police coordinating with federal immigration agencies, along with a recent state law that prohibits state agencies from sharing resident data, including motor vehicle data, with the federal government. 
Keller noted that the city has coordinated the distribution of 10,000 “red cards” that lay out immigrant rights, including in city schools, where the school board recently affirmed its policy prohibiting coordination with ICE. 
The news conference comes amid an increase of federal immigration operations in the state, according to the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center and other groups that represent immigrants. 
ICE arrested an Albuquerque man. He ended up in the hospital. Now no one knows where he is.

“Over the past several weeks, NMILC and our partners have observed a significant uptick in ICE arrests against community members,” said managing attorney Sophia Genovese. “Common tactics include ICE officers pulling over vehicles and detaining people, going to people’s homes and workplaces, detaining people at their immigration court hearings and appointments, and a number of other tips or tricks and bruising to effectuate the Trump administration’s mass deportation promise.”
ICE is also growing more violent, she said, “with at least one recent account of physical brutality” during an arrest. She was referring to the case of Jesus Jose Carrero-Marquez, a husband and father who was recently deported to Venezuela after living in Albuquerque with his family for at least two years. His wife told Source New Mexico last week that ICE agents threw him to the ground and put him in a chokehold, and he was hospitalized before being returned to ICE custody and ultimately deported.
According to Genovese, ICE agents conducted a mass arrest in a Walmart parking lot in Rio Rancho two weeks ago, along with “I-9 audits” where federal immigration law enforcement goes to restaurants and other businesses and asking owners for paperwork on all their employees.
“There’s a lot of ICE activity all throughout Albuquerque,” she said. 
But it’s hard to pin down when and where raids are occurring, speakers said, given the fly-by-night nature of the arrests and because city employees, including the police department, are prohibited by law from coordinating with ICE. 
NM group condemns federal raid on Lovington dairy farm

In addition to the ICE activity in New Mexico’s biggest city, the speakers noted a raid at a dairy farm by federal immigration agents recently in Lovington,, where at least 11 people were arrested. The dairy farm has since shut down, Martinez said.
“Now if the argument is that we’re a bunch of freeloaders,” Martinez said, “ask yourself, ‘why are they raiding places of work?’ They’re not catching us at the welfare line while we commit fraud to get welfare.”
According to Keller, there are 20,000 mixed-status families in Albuquerque. Across New Mexico, 63,000 immigrants are homeowners, and immigrants across the state contribute $1.4 billion in federal state and local taxes, according to data El Centro presented. 
The group also shared several anonymous quotes from families dealing with deportation, including from people whose relatives that have occurred here since Trump’s second term began. 
“There are terrible things happening in our communities,” one of them reads. “Poor, defenseless people are being dragged out of their homes. Families are being torn apart. Men, women and children are being separated.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9807-scaled-e1750275464916-1024x741.jpg,,,2025-06-18 16:06:34.623713

“I obviously appreciate that we're a little behind…the schedule that we laid out last December, but I still think we're making great progress,” said Bruce Stebbins, acting chair of the cannabis commission, about a delay on social consumption regulations.  
The post Cannabis commission plans to launch social consumption in October  appeared first on CommonWe[...]","THE CANNABIS CONTROL COMMISSION said on Tuesday that the agency is aiming to release final social consumption regulations by October of this year – later than the “mid-2025” goal that the agency had previously indicated.
The commission plans to vote on a version of the social consumption regulations in July before sending them to the Secretary of State to create an official record. Then, the agency will take public comment and hold a public hearing. The testimony will be incorporated into another draft by late August or early September, at which point the regulations would be resubmitted to the secretary and become enforceable in October.
“I obviously appreciate that we’re a little behind … the schedule that we laid out last December, but I still think we’re making great progress,” Acting Chair Bruce Stebbins told CommonWealth Beacon following the public meeting. “It’s a process [that] include[s] all of the commissioners and all of the staff input as we get further closer to the end.”
The framework in the new social consumption regulation – which was first unveiled in December 2024 – is currently set to create three proposed types of licenses. A new “supplemental” license will allow existing marijuana businesses to add a social consumption area — such as a “tasting room” — where customers can consume cannabis purchased on-site. A “hospitality” license will permit on-site cannabis consumption at both new and existing non-cannabis businesses, including lounges, yoga studios, cafes, and theaters. Finally, an “event organizer” license will enable cannabis consumption at events like festivals, provided they last no longer than five days.
The commission is still working to update the details of the regulations before it votes on them in July.
Stebbins said that even after the regulations are finalized, there will be more steps in implementing social consumption. Communities across the state will have to “opt-in” to allow social consumption, and the commission will have to approve licenses before people in Massachusetts will be able to walk into an establishment, buy a weed gummy or cannabis drink, and consume it at the location. 
Social consumption – the ability to consume cannabis products in designated public spaces – has been legal in the state since the ballot question legalizing marijuana was approved by voters in 2016, but the commission has been slow to roll out regulations to create the framework to support it.
The commission’s last major changes to the regulations – which removed the two-driver requirement for cannabis delivery – took a long time to come to fruition. Even after the commission voted to make a long-awaited change to the two-driver rule, it took nearly a year for the agency to publish the final regulations. There has been frustration in the cannabis industry around how slow the commission has been to update its regulations and write new ones to support social consumption.
The commission has been enmeshed in controversy ever since Treasurer Deborah Goldberg suspended Shannon O’Brien from her position as chair of the commission for allegedly making racially insensitive comments. There have been allegations of bullying at the agency, and the commission has failed to collect over $500,000 in licensing fees. Last June, the Inspector General called the commission a “rudderless ship” and urged lawmakers to put it under a receivership.
Currently, the five-member commission is down to three and is at risk of being deadlocked because three commissioners must all agree for the commission to take any action. The House passed a cannabis reform bill on June 4 that would restructure the commission to a three-member body appointed solely by the governor as a way of addressing some of the leadership issues. It is unclear if the Senate will take up the cannabis legislation. 
“There’s general excitement from the community and the stakeholders that have wanted [social consumption], and I think we’re getting to a point where we’re going to have regulations that will prioritize public health and safety and at the same time will [bring] exciting, new opportunities for potential licensees,” said Stebbins.

(Photo courtesy Bryce Mitchell/University of Florida)Money universities make with dorms, dining plans, bookstores, and more will partially be redirected to Florida collegiate athletes under an emergency rule approved amid the ever-changing athletics landscape. 
The State University System (SUS) Board of Governors voted Wednesday to adopt an emergency rule to allow more flexibility in paying college athletes. 
Each university is now able to use up to $22.5 million in what are known as auxiliary funds to meet their athletic budgets. 
The House v. NCAA settlement this month starts revenue sharing July 1, allowing institutions to spend up to about $20.5 million to pay athletes in the coming year with the cap rising in years following, putting an increasing financial strain on institutions that hope to remain competitive. 
The board called it a “substantial fiscal burden.”
Universities are required to contribute to back-paying former athletes who competed as long ago as 2016 over a coming 10-year period. 
Previously, auxiliary money could not be used for athletics. 
“The universities are not proposing this as a permanent solution. The universities are proposing this as a bridge,” board Vice Chair Alan Levine said. 
Schools will be required to develop plans for how to replace that funding when the temporary rule ends in 2028.
“If we don’t act, there’s a really good chance that our institutions will be severely disadvantaged and I don’t think anybody wants that,” Levine said. 
Student athletes may be drawn to an institution based on how much money the school is able to pay them, ultimately boosting schools that are able to pay for higher-profile athletes.

The rule requires that moving funds around does “not have a material impact on the university’s current credit rating or negatively impact any non-athletic auxiliary enterprise.”
Levine called for a group within the Board of Governors to convene on the topic to further guide rulemaking as the athletic environment evolves. 
The Florida House of Representatives convened a special workgroup earlier this year on name, image, and likeness legislation, but reached no major conclusion. That was before the settlement was agreed to in June. House leaders said the group will continue into the next session. 
“Athletic programs have a major impact on universities. Competitive programs can lead to brand recognition, student involvement, and increased applications from prospective students. Florida universities are competing on a national level, against other states that have more flexibility regarding funding and expenditures. Delaying the implementation date of this regulatory amendment would put SUS institutions at a distinct competitive disadvantage,” the Board of Governors said. 
The University of Florida men’s basketball took home a national title in April, Florida Atlantic University men’s basketball made the Final Four in 2023, and Florida State University women’s soccer won a national championship in 2023.

Sabrina Cervantes’ attorney says she was targeted for DUI without cause because she’s a Latina member of the LGBTQ caucus. Authorities are refusing to release records that could show who is telling the truth.,"In summary
Sen. Sabrina Cervantes’ attorney says she was targeted for DUI without cause because she’s a Latina member of the LGBTQ caucus. Authorities are refusing to release records that could show who is telling the truth. 


A Democratic California senator is now considering suing Sacramento police for what she alleges was a “politically motivated” false DUI arrest intended to “silence” an LGBTQ Latina lawmaker, her attorney tells CalMatters.Officers have insisted that they acted professionally, and they say they had evidence to believe Sen. Sabrina Cervantes was driving under the influence of drugs even though a blood test reportedly later proved otherwise.
Meanwhile, a Democratic district attorney insists that politics had nothing to do with his decision not to file charges.
Who’s telling the truth? At this point, the public has no way of corroborating anyone’s account. 
That’s because authorities are refusing to release records such as body camera footage, police reports and search warrants that would shed light on what happened on May 19 when Sacramento police accused Cervantes, of Riverside, of driving under the influence following a crash a few blocks from the Capitol. She was exonerated nearly two weeks later, after prosecutors said no intoxicating substances were found in Cervantes’ blood.
It’s troubling that officials have refused to release records pertaining to a criminal investigation of an elected public official, said David Snyder, the executive director of the First Amendment Coalition. He said the records authorities are withholding could “shed light on whether she was being harassed or whether she was being treated deferentially.”“There are a lot of different narratives flying around,” he said. “And in order to sort out those narratives, the public is entitled to see what the police know and what they believed at the time.” 
Instead, the public is left with conflicting accounts of what happened after a driver allegedly ran through a stop sign and smashed into Cervantes’ state-owned car that Monday afternoon. Police cited the other driver for running the stop sign.
Conflicting accounts of Cervantes’ treatment
After the crash, a Sacramento Police Department spokesperson told CalMatters that Cervantes was cited for suspicion of “driving a motor vehicle under the influence of a central nervous system depressant.”
When the Sacramento County district attorney announced last month that no charges would be filed, police released a second statement. In it, police claimed that when officers met Cervantes at a Sacramento hospital, they “observed objective signs that led them to believe she may have been impaired while operating a motor vehicle.” 
“The officers remained professional throughout, taking time to explain the process and answer all of the senator’s questions,” the statement said.
Officers said Cervantes initially declined to participate with officers’ sobriety tests. So they asked a judge for a warrant for Cervantes to submit to a blood test and told Cervantes they had requested one.
“While the warrant was being written and processed, the senator agreed to voluntarily provide a blood sample,” police said. Officers opted to wait for a judge to sign the warrant before conducting the blood draw, police said. 
The district attorney said prosecutors reviewed “all the submitted evidence, including police reports, witness statements, and laboratory results.”“Based on our ethical duty and the burden of proof in a criminal trial, the Sacramento County DA’s Office declines to file any charges in this case,” Shelly Orio, a spokeswoman for the office, said in a May 30 email.
Cervantes maintained her innocence from the start and claimed police treated her harshly.
In a statement to reporters after police announced the DUI arrest, she said officers “accosted” her while she was being checked out at a hospital and that drug and alcohol tests would prove her sobriety. 
Cervantes released heavily redacted records she said were from her hospital visit, in which a test showed a blood alcohol content of near zero. A separate urine test taken the day after the crash showed a clean drug screen.
Was senator targeted for race, sexual orientation?
Was Cervantes targeted for race, sexual orientation? 
On Tuesday, Cervantes’ San Francisco attorney, James Quadra, told CalMatters his client is considering filing a lawsuit alleging police violated her “state and federal rights, constitutional rights, civil rights, and to address defamatory statements made against her.”
Quadra said he and his client believe the Sacramento officers targeted Cervantes because of who she is. 
“We believe they (police) were politically motivated because of how the information was disseminated (to the press), and the whole sort of picture of her being under the influence,” he said. “To our view, it’s to try to silence an active member of the Latino Democratic Caucus, of the LGBTQ+ caucus. They want to silence her voice.”
Quadra said officers at the hospital refused to let her call her attorney or her wife, and then after citing her for DUI, “leaked” the information about the case to reporters to smear her.
“It’s like a police state,” Quadra said. “It’s what we’re seeing across the country, especially with Latinos, and she’s a member of that community.”
Sacramento police spokesperson Sgt. Dan Wiseman said he couldn’t comment on Quadra’s allegations. The department declined to make Chief Katherine Lester available for an interview.
Officials reject CalMatters’ record requests
The day after the crash, CalMatters reviewed footage from a nearby office building’s security camera that appears to show Cervantes wasn’t at fault.
The footage showed a white SUV rolling through a stop sign and careening into Cervantes’ black sedan at the intersection in midtown Sacramento. Cervantes appeared to have had the right-of-way.
CalMatters also filed requests under the California Public Records Act seeking body camera footage, police reports and the search warrant. A warrant would include investigators’ affidavits detailing to a judge why they believe they had probable cause to draw Cervantes’ blood.
A month later, the police department hasn’t released any of the records, saying the traffic collision remains under investigation, despite the district attorney clearing Cervantes and police citing the other driver. California police have broad discretion to withhold investigative records indefinitely and regardless of whether the investigation has concluded.

CalMatters also sought copies of the search warrant from Sacramento County Superior Court and the Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office. The district attorney’s office cited the same exemption to the public records act that allows agencies to indefinitely withhold investigative records.
Wiseman said officers had returned the search warrant to the court, but when CalMatters asked for it at the courthouse Tuesday a Sacramento County Superior Court clerk said it wasn’t available.
Quadra, Cervantes’ attorney, said his client is “100% behind any and all records being released.”
“She is unafraid of that, because the records will clearly establish that she wasn’t under the influence of anything,” he said. “She was a victim of an accident. She was T-boned and taken to the hospital.”
DA denies ‘partisanship’ played a role
CalMatters also sought under the public records act correspondence between the District Attorney’s Office and California lawmakers that might show whether Cervantes or other influential political figures sought to influence the decision of District Attorney Thien Ho, who is also a Democrat.
The district attorney’s office replied that it had no relevant records. But the agency refused to release Ho’s appointment calendar for the month of May, saying it was confidential and that “the public interest served by not disclosing these outweighs the public interest served by disclosing them.” Other agencies routinely release appointment calendars of top officials. 
Ho didn’t respond to an interview request through his spokesperson, replying instead with a brief emailed statement.
“Regarding your allegation of partisanship, we stand by our decision that no charges be filed since the lab results found no evidence of alcohol or drugs,” the statement said.
Snyder, of the First Amendment Coalition, said the public should be troubled by the secrecy surrounding the case.
“The public,” he said, “is entitled to know whether the police are applying the law even-handedly, or whether they’re creating exceptions based on who the person at issue is.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/012325-Capitol-Session-FG-CM-36.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-18 16:06:34.623713

Democrat Aleita Timmons was sworn in to represent House District 97. Timmons was elected to replace former Rep. Jason Lowe, D-Oklahoma City, who was elected to serve on the Oklahoma County Commission. 
Timmons, a retired judge, said the House will have a colleague who will “seek consensus where necessary” and “fight all the way to the end” to get the best Oklahoma that can be provided. 
Republican Kevin Norwood, a pastor, represents House District 74. Norwood was elected to replace former Rep. Mark Vancuren, R-Owasso, who resigned to serve as Tulsa County Deputy Commissioner.
“I feel encouraged today for the state of Oklahoma,” Norwood said. “I feel encouraged by the people I’ve met on this journey, the words of wisdom, the words of insight. I do appreciate those, and I look forward to our upcoming year and our upcoming session.”
Democrat Amanda Clinton, a small business owner, was elected to serve House District 71. Clinton replaced former Rep. Amanda Swope, D-Tulsa, who is serving as the city of Tulsa’s Director of Tribal Policy & Partnerships.
“I look forward to making a difference in this building with all of you,” Clinton said.
Oklahoma Supreme Court Chief Justice Dustin Rowe administered the oath of office. 
The House of Representatives has 81 Republicans and 20 Democrats.
“It is great to have our full 101 House members seated, ready to do the people’s business throughout the interim and into the 2026 legislative session,” said House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
These anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced in 2025 Idaho legislative session. Where does each stand?

The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
 Politicians, advocacy groups respond to SCOTUS ruling

The Tennessee House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
 Roberts: Tennessee law doesn’t violate equal protection clause of 14th Amendment

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
Federal court rejects longer block on Idaho’s transgender bathroom restriction law

The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have health care options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota utility regulators on Wednesday denied a request to reconsider a vote on a controversial power line but explained that opponents still have time to weigh in before a final decision is made. 
The Public Service Commission in November approved a certificate of need for a large power line between Jamestown and Ellendale, known as the JETx project. However, the project still needs a route permit from the agency. 
A permit application for the approximately 95-mile, 345-kilovolt transmission line has not yet been submitted. Otter Tail Power and Montana-Dakota Utilities are partnering on the project. 
A petition to reconsider the November vote was filed in May, outside the timeframe specified in state law for such an appeal. 
Commission Chair Randy Christmann voted against the project in November but joined the other two commissioners in voting to reject the petition Wednesday.
“Although it was not the decision I wanted, the commission made a decision, and now we need to stick by it,” Christmann said. 
Commissioner Sheri Haugen-Hoffart said when an application is received, opponents can intervene in the case and state their concerns. There also will be a public hearing on the project.
The power line was part of a debate during the North Dakota legislative session this year. The Legislature approved a bill that says electrical transmission line projects must follow state zoning rules, taking away local government authority.
In another vote, the PSC approved the large Flickertail Solar Project in Richland County in southeast North Dakota. Construction on the $375 million project is expected to start next year. 
Otter Tail Power is a partner on the project.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Lawmakers declared “the power is on in South Carolina” as Gov. Henry McMaster ceremoniously signed a law aimed at meeting the growing state’s future energy needs.
Legislators and utility executives gathered in front of the Governor’s Mansion on Wednesday to celebrate passage of the law granting permission for Dominion Energy and state-owned utility Santee Cooper to partner on a proposed 2,000-megawatt natural gas plant along the Edisto River in Colleton County.
The massive piece of legislation — which McMaster actually signed into law last month — also included measures meant to speed up the permitting process for power plants and pipelines, which at times have dragged out in the court system for years.
It also makes it easier for utilities to raise power bills on an annual basis, a request that power executives said would result in smaller, though more frequent, increases that customers can adjust to more easily.
Sen. Tom Davis, who was heavily involved in the state’s power-related debate, also highlighted what he saw as environmental wins.
The Beaufort Republican pointed to a measure that empowers utility regulators to demand more from public utility companies when it comes to energy-efficient home programs. The bill also doubled down on previous requirements that utilities seek out the lowest-cost option when it comes to solar power and batteries for storing it.
Nuclear reboot?
But the energy effort that garnered the most praise from politicians Wednesday — the potential reboot of a pair of partially built nuclear reactors in the state — isn’t actually included in the law they were there to celebrate.
“South Carolina is in the lead in the country for a renaissance of nuclear power,” McMaster declared outside the Governor’s Mansion.
Santee Cooper is still sorting through a pool of potential buyers for the two units, located at the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station, that were mothballed almost eight years ago as part of a failed nuclear power expansion project. The Legislature encouraged the effort in a resolution signed by the governor last month.
“I am hopeful that something, which in 2017 became something of shame and embarrassment, is going to turn out to be something of opportunity for all South Carolinians,” Davis said.

Nearly 80 interested parties responded to Santee Cooper’s callout issued in January, more than 50 of which ultimately submitted a bid, said CEO Jimmy Stanton. Those involved include large utility companies, investment banks and technology giants.
“We’ve seen some very attractive proposals,” Stanton told the SC Daily Gazette.
Now, those applicants are partnering off and submitting more detailed, joint bids in a second round of vetting that Stanton said will last through the summer.
“No one entity is going to be able to do this,” Stanton said.
The project will need buyers for the power the plant produces, companies that can design, engineer and build it, and those that bring the financial wherewithal.
“We just want someone that we believe can finish the project,” Stanton said. “Show us that you can capitalize it. Show us you can build it.”
If a deal does get done, Santee Cooper customers still shouldn’t expect to see the cost of the plant come off their power bills, Stanton said. Instead, they’ll benefit from the electrons produced by a finished facility.
“For my customers, right now, they’re paying for something that isn’t generating electricity,” Stanton said. “If I can leverage what they are paying into something that generates electricity for them, that’s a win, win.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3274-1024x732.jpg,,,2025-06-18 16:06:34.623713

The agency also manages more than 300 ports of entry at borders, airports and seaports. During his Senate confirmation hearing in April, the Senate Finance Committee’s top Democrat, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, raised concerns about the 2010 death of an immigrant at a CBP station in San Diego that Scott ran.Anastasio Hernández Rojas was detained by CBP officers, and was beaten and later died from his injuries, Wyden said.“Rather than following the agency’s own policy and immediately referring the incident to outside investigators, the San Diego CBP office began its own investigation,” Wyden said. “In the course of that investigation, the CBP officers taped over the only video copy of Hernández Rojas’s death and tampered with physical evidence, according to court documents.”The United States paid $1 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Hernández Rojas’ widow and in 2015 the Justice Department declined to pursue federal charges against any of the officers or leaders involved in the case.Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent a letter to the committee before Scott’s confirmation hearing, and informed senators that the agency reviewed the 2010 incident and that Scott’s work “was in accordance with his duties, the law and professional standards.”",,,,2025-06-18 16:06:34.623713

A longstanding open meetings battle between Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador and the State Board of Education came to a close Wednesday.
Labrador moved to dismiss his lawsuit challenging the State Board’s closed-door meetings on the University of Idaho’s bid to acquire the University of Phoenix.
Phoenix, University of Idaho pull the plug on purchase

The lawsuit, filed two years ago this week, contended that the State Board had essentially approved the U of I’s plans in a series of three closed executive sessions — before finally giving the $685 million purchase the green light in open session in May 2023.
“This case was never about the merits of any particular transaction, but about ensuring government remains open and transparent for all Idahoans,” Labrador said Wednesday. “The (open meeting) law reflects the principle that government accountability depends on public access to decision-making processes, particularly for transactions of significant scope and financial impact.”
The State Board declined comment on the dismissal.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Open meetings lawsuit and bid for University of Phoenix have been intertwined since 2023

The open meetings lawsuit — and the U of I’s aborted Phoenix bid — have been intertwined since June 2023, in a series of twists and turns.
The lawsuit started in Ada County District Court, with a decisive ruling in the State Board’s favor. In January 2024, District Judge Jason Scott threw out Labrador’s lawsuit and said the State Board’s closed meetings were permitted under the law. State Board members “reasonably believed” the U of I was in competition with other Phoenix suitors, Scott ruled, and this justified the closed meetings.
Labrador prevailed on appeal. In December, the state Supreme Court said the lower court had “erred in several ways,” and kicked the case backed to Scott’s court. The Supreme Court did not determine whether the State Board had broken open meetings law: Instead, the court ordered Scott to revisit his earlier ruling.
Until Wednesday, the case was still on Scott’s docket. A “status conference,” a discussion between the two legal teams, had been scheduled for next week.
While the protracted lawsuit focused on open meetings law, it had a tangible impact on the U of I’s bid for Phoenix, a for-profit university serving more than 80,000 students nationally.
With the purchase mired in court, the U of I was unable to line up financing. This essentially stopped the transaction in its tracks.
The legal questions also resonated with legislators, who had felt blindsided by the State Board and the U of I. The 2024 Legislature pushed back against the purchase, forcing the U of I and Phoenix to start over. The State Board gave the universities another year ­ — an extension to allow them to bring a new plan to lawmakers — but nothing materialized.
In early June, with another State Board deadline looming, the U of I and Phoenix agreed to break off all talks. This joint decision closed the books on a purchase, but not the lawsuit.
With the dismissal, the two sides have agreed to cover their own legal bills. In March 2024, Scott had ordered Labrador’s office to pay more than $240,000 in State Board legal fees — but the Supreme Court’s subsequent ruling left the issue of legal fees in question.
Both parties have agreed to cover their costs, according to a court filing Wednesday.

While on her way home from a coworking space in Denver last year, Colorado state Rep. Jenny Willford says she was sexually assaulted by her Lyft driver.
In her lawsuit filed against Lyft in January, Willford alleges she was “subjected to unwelcome, nonconsensual sexual contact, touching” and lewd comments during the ride.
Willford was picked up by a different driver than the person identified in the Lyft app, according to the suit.
Her experience — and those that other survivors shared with her after hearing her story — prompted Willford, a Democrat, to introduce legislation this year that aimed to require safety measures for both riders and drivers using ridesharing apps.
“In my mind, all of these things are very basic when it comes to safety,” Willford said. “They’re just so common sense that it’s been really disheartening and frustrating to me that Uber … threatened to leave the state if the bill becomes law.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Her bill would have required rideshare companies to conduct more regular background checks for drivers, to create a program for passengers or drivers who want to audio or video record their rides and to develop other safety policies.
But following Uber’s threats to leave the state if the measure passed, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis vetoed it in late May. The bill would jeopardize rideshare services in Colorado “to an untenable degree, and could very well lead to companies that Coloradans rely on exiting the market, raising prices, or reducing the number of drivers,” his veto letter said.
Colorado isn’t alone. State and city leaders across the country are looking for ways to make rideshares safer. But lobbying campaigns from Uber and Lyft in many cases are blocking legislation meant to strengthen protections for both drivers and passengers.

Uber and Lyft, the two companies that dominate the U.S. rideshare industry, argue they have sufficient safety features within their apps.
“At Uber, we put safety at the heart of our operations, using technology, transparency, and accountability to help protect riders, drivers, and the broader community, with robust background checks and safety features like Audio and Video Recording, the Emergency Button, PIN verification, and RideCheck,” Uber wrote in a statement to Stateline.
“We remain committed to this work, and to dialogue with bill sponsors on sensible policies that keep people safe while protecting privacy and access.”
But there’s still a gap in regulations for rideshare companies because of their evolving technologies, said Lorena Roque, the interim director of education, labor and worker justice at The Center for Law and Social Policy, a left-leaning anti-poverty advocacy organization.
“Working on an app-based platform — like with delivery workers and rideshare workers —that sort of work is relatively new, so there’s not a clear standard,” Roque said.
Uber and Lyft are employing lobbyists at the state and local levels. In Rhode Island, another state where legislators are pushing rideshare safety bills that the companies have objected to, Uber is on pace to spend $50,000 this year on lobbyists, according to the state’s lobbying database. Lyft has been spending $5,000 monthly on lobbyists in Rhode Island.

Across the country, Uber and Lyft have testified against measures in state legislative hearings and city council meetings. In Colorado’s case, a number of officials representing Uber spoke out against Willford’s legislation at committee hearings, while Lyft sent a letter to Gov. Polis urging him to veto it. Jerry Golden, Lyft’s chief policy officer, wrote in the letter that the legislation’s requirements “ignore and ultimately will not improve conditions for riders and drivers.”
Uber told the state Senate it would be “impossible” for rideshare companies to comply with the bill’s requirements immediately upon approval and that the  audio and video requirement is “not possible to enforce.”
“The intention of my legislation was never to drive out Uber or Lyft,” Willford said. “The intention was always to require a higher level of accountability and safety from them. But we can’t do that if they’re going to throw tantrums and pick up their toys and go home every time somebody asks them to do better.”
 Safety for passengers

As a part of Lyft’s safety measures, drivers must complete annual background checks and mandatory driver safety education. The app is also programmed to check in with riders when drivers take long stops or deviate from the route they were assigned.
Uber conducts periodic criminal screenings for all active drivers and requires drivers to regularly verify their identity by sharing a selfie with Uber using the app. Both companies offer live emergency assistance to riders.
Between 2020 and 2022, Lyft reported 23 fatal physical assaults of people using the Lyft platform and 2,651 instances of the five most serious categories of sexual assault, according to its 2024 Safety Transparency Report. While incidents of sexual assault had decreased 21% since the last report, which covered 2017-2019, fatal physical assaults jumped by 185%.
Uber saw 36 physical assault fatalities in 2021 and 2022 and 2,717 incidents of the most serious categories of sexual assault, according to the company’s most recent safety report. Despite a 22% decline in sexual assault and misconduct, there was an increase in fatal physical assaults since its 2019-2020 report.
State lawmakers in several states have tried to address rideshare safety concerns with varying degrees of success.
Pending legislation in New Jersey and Massachusetts aims to prevent sexual assault and misconduct against passengers.
The New Jersey measure would require rideshare companies to share information concerning sexual misconduct investigations into a driver and would allow companies to ban drivers during an investigation. It remains in committee.
The bill in Massachusetts, introduced by Democratic state Sen. Rebecca Rausch, would create a specific criminal penalty for the sexual assault of a passenger by a rideshare driver. The bill also would deem any rideshare passenger incapable of consenting to any sexual contact during a ride.  A hearing on the bill took place yesterday.
“We need to be able to make sure that people are safe and that people can trust those kinds of spaces to be safe,” Rausch said.

In May, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation that creates criminal penalties for impersonating a rideshare driver. Starting July 1, the crime counts as a second-degree misdemeanor. Uber supported the legislation.
But in Rhode Island, Lyft is pushing against legislation that would require fingerprinting as part of criminal background check. Brendan Joyce, the Lyft public policy manager, testified against the measure in April, saying the fingerprinting requirement relies on the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information System, which Joyce said has incomplete data. He also asserted that fingerprint checks “disproportionately impact and have potential discriminatory effects on communities of color.” Uber also testified against the proposal.
Rhode Island legislators introduced another measure that would prevent people under the age of 16 from using a rideshare service alone. Both bills are being held for further study.
 Driver protections

JC Muhammad, 57, has been a rideshare driver in and around Chicago since about 2016.
Now, he works full-time as an organizer for faith-based organizations and groups that support rideshare drivers, including The People’s Union, a membership-driven organization aimed at supporting workers in the city.
Muhammad was attacked by a passenger during a Lyft ride in 2022, he said. The passenger asked to borrow Muhammad’s phone and opened its Cash App. The passenger also hit him over the head twice, he said, and threw a brick at his car, denting the side.
“I was angry as hell,” Muhammad said. “I really wanted to engage the kid, but I said, ‘No, let me get back in my car.’”

After sharing the incident with Lyft, the company responded by saying it would not match him with that passenger again. But the person who rode with Muhammad did not match the profile of the person who originally requested the ride, he said.
Muhammad also said he couldn’t go to the police because he did not know the identity of the person who was in his car — and Lyft would not share the identity of the account holder who ordered the Lyft.
Uber and Lyft customers have the option to verify their account, but not everyone does, Muhammad said.
“That gives us some measure of comfort, but it really doesn’t do enough, especially when it comes to calling rides for other people,” Muhammad said. “The account holder may not be the actual passenger.”
Rideshare drivers across the country — especially those of color — are frequently harassed, according to a 2023 report from the Strategic Organizing Center. The center is a coalition of labor unions representing more than 2.5 million workers across the country.
The survey of over 900 app-based rideshare drivers found the majority had been verbally abused and more than a quarter of respondents were threatened with physical harm. Nearly 15% of the drivers were grabbed, groped or hit, according to the report.
There have been several incidents in Chicago where drivers are lured by a false account to a location where they are then robbed or attacked, said Deana Rutherford, the communications manager at the Chicago Gig Alliance, a subset of The People’s Lobby.
“These drivers just show up and they have no idea who’s about to get into their car,” Rutherford said. “And Uber doesn’t know who they are either.”
To address some of the safety and labor issues drivers were facing, the Chicago City Council began considering an ordinance backed by The People’s Lobby that would require passenger verification.
If passed, the ordinance would have also set a minimum wage for drivers, require companies to be more transparent about fares, have them disclose the details of driver account deactivations and more. Both Uber and Lyft initially opposed the ordinance. Uber warned the measure’s sponsor that the changes in pay rates would drive up costs for customers and force the company to cut 10,000 drivers, according to a letter Uber sent to a city alderman that was obtained by Stateline.
But Uber this week agreed to a deal that scraps Chicago’s ordinance in exchange for the company’s support for state legislation that would allow rideshare drivers to unionize, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

Those who have been exposed and are not immune from vaccinations or previous infections should isolate for 21 days from the date of exposure, according to the Health Department’s website. 
Oklahoma has reported 20 measles this year, as of Wednesday, including 17 cases confirmed by a test and three probable cases with a symptomatic patient. 
Of the cases, 17 were in unvaccinated people and two had an unknown vaccination status. One person had received two doses of the measles vaccine.
Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are 97% effective against measles and 86% effective against mumps, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

James Robert Peterson’s prior convictions prevented him from having guns. But the 38-year-old Prosperity man was carrying a shotgun when law enforcement officers attempted to arrest him at his mother’s home June 11, 2024, on burglary charges. He fatally shot Coba, a K-9 with the State Law Enforcement Division, who was between Peterson and three officers in the doorway, according to prosecutors.

Peterson pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. Judge Jacquelyn Austin sentenced him to 150 months in federal prison, the state’s U.S. Attorney’s Office announced Wednesday.
There is no parole in the federal system.
That’s in addition to his 33-year sentence in March on state charges of first-degree burglary, attempted murder, cruelty to a police dog and resisting arrest with a deadly weapon.
David Stumbo, the solicitor who prosecuted the state case in Newberry County, told legislators in April that only five of those 33 years were for killing Coba, one of five police dogs killed in duty last year.
“We didn’t believe that five years was nearly enough time,” Stumbo told senators.
In addition to Stumbo, sheriffs from Greenville and Richland County also testified in support of a bill that would increase the prison time and fines for anyone killing or injuring a police dog or horse in the state.

Rhode Island’s antiquated campaign finance software system is poised for a refresh under a $140,000, one-year contract approved by the Board of Elections Tuesday.
The panel’s unanimous vote sets in motion the long-awaited upgrade to the electronic system used to report and share information about campaign donations and spending.  
Elections board prepares to revamp R.I.’s aging campaign finance software. It just needs the money.

Rhode Island’s campaign finance software hasn’t been updated since its 2002 debut. The need to bring it into the modern era was never in dispute: The outdated system can’t accommodate certain, state-mandated reports including disclosure of independent expenditures and donations by political action committees and affidavits from vendors awarded high-dollar state contracts. And, it risks major disruptions when problems arise — most of the software engineers who designed the legacy system have retired, or are approaching retirement age.
But the extra money needed to pay for the refresh proved a problem, initially. The Rhode Island Board of Elections asked for an extra $250,000 in its fiscal 2026 budget request for software upgrades. Gov. Dan McKee did not include any of that money in his budget proposal.
But an unexpected $500,000 surplus in the elections agency’s current year budget solved the funding problem. The revised fiscal 2026 budget approved by the Rhode Island House Tuesday repurposes the fiscal 2025 surplus to the upcoming year, designating the money for the campaign finance software upgrade and new electronic poll books.
Pending approval by the state Department of Administration and Division of Purchasing, Florida-based software vendor Civix will begin the technical side of the software upgrade in July, with plans to start training candidates and campaign committees in January, Miguel Nunez, elections board director, said during the meeting. The proposed timeline ensures the upgraded software will be ready to use for the 2026 election cycle.
Once the switch to the new system occurs, historic data, from 2002 to 2022, will be archived as PDFs, available on the elections board website for download as searchable CSV files, Ric Thornton, campaign finance director told the board Tuesday.
“It’s a very robust feature that will provide both internal users at the agency and the public with the information they’re seeking on a historical basis,” Thornton said.
Some technology experts were critical of the board’s decision not to incorporate all of its existing campaign finance information into the new system. But Thornton told the board on Tuesday that transferring 23 years of data would cost $300,000 more, and take an extra six months — risking inability to complete the transition and candidate training for the 2026 election cycle.
A copy of the contract was not immediately available.
A previous work order submitted to the board by Civix projects the cost for software upgrades and ongoing maintenance to be $815,000 over the next five years. By comparison, it would cost $377,000 over the next five years to maintain the existing system.

Tammy Baldwin speaks on the Senate floor on Jan. 6, 2022 | Screenshot of video provided by Baldwin's office Wisconsin ExaminerU.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said she’ll “fight tooth and nail” to protect LGBTQ children after the administration of President Donald Trump proposed Wednesday that the national suicide and crisis lifeline would no longer support programs aimed at LGBTQ youth. 
On Wednesday, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) proposed defunding the program within the 988 suicide hotline aimed at LGBTQ children and cutting ties with the Trevor Project, a non-profit LGBTQ mental health organization. 
While the 988 number would still be available, LGBTQ children would no longer be able to request that they be directed to someone specifically trained in the area and with shared experiences. 
A survey conducted last year by the Trevor Project found that 40% of LGBTQ young people considered attempting suicide in the previous year and 12% of LGBTQ young people attempted suicide — both rates are higher than those among non-LGBTQ youth. 
Baldwin wrote the legislation to create the 988 hotline and worked to create an LGBTQ youth pilot program, which was expanded by Congress in 2023. 
Since the hotline’s creation, it has received 1.3 million contacts from LGBTQ people, according to SAMHSA data. 
“I worked hard to stand up a special line for LGBTQ+ youth because we are losing too many of our kids to suicide, and it’s well past time we did something about it,” Baldwin said. “Children facing dark times and even contemplating taking their life often have nowhere else to turn besides this 988 Lifeline, and the Trump Administration is cruelly and needlessly taking that away.” 
The proposal to cut funds for the LGBTQ program comes as the Trump administration has become increasingly hostile to LGBTQ people and as, on Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law that prohibits transgender children from receiving gender-affirming treatments. Republicans in Wisconsin and across the country have passed or attempted to pass laws preventing transgender children from participating in sports.
“During Pride Month, a time to celebrate the progress we’ve made, the Trump Administration is taking us a step back and telling LGBTQ+ kids that they don’t matter and don’t deserve help when they are in crisis,” Baldwin said. “This is not the final chapter of this story, and I’ll fight tooth and nail to protect these children. Suicide prevention has been and should continue to be a nonpartisan issue, and I call on my Republican colleagues who have long supported this program to fight for these kids, too. The children and teens who rely on 988 need our help, and it’s our duty to protect this literal lifeline for hundreds of thousands before it’s too late.”

The state Early Childhood Education and Care Department last week launched its statewide Summer Food Service Program, which offers free, nutritious meals to children while on break from school and to adults who are enrolled in school programs for people with disabilities.
Through August, more than 500 meal sites are providing food on a first-come, first-served basis. Sites and hours can be found on this map, or by calling 1-800-EAT-COOL (1-800-328-2665).
In a statement, department Secretary Elizabeth Groginsky invited every New Mexico family to take advantage of the program.
“Nutritious meals are essential for children to thrive, and no child should go without food just because school is out,” Groginsky said. “This program is one simple, effective way families can support their children’s health this summer — in a fun and social environment too.” 
The agency said in a news release it expects to serve approximately 17,000 children and 750,000 meals this summer. Last year, it served 16,565 children and 720,603 meals, according to the release.
Hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans, including one in four children, are food insecure, according to data from 2022 compiled by the nonprofit food bank network Feeding America. Counties with the highest rates of food insecurity include McKinley, Luna, Sierra, Socorro and Catron.
The state Public Education Department also runs an alternative summer food program called the Seamless Summer Option, whose meal sites are also shown on the map linked above. PED also oversees SUN Bucks, for which some families are automatically eligible to receive $120 in food benefits per child.
Starting next month, some Summer Food Service Program meal sites will make food using locally grown ingredients under a pilot based on the department’s New Mexico Grown grant program.
These programs are funded by the country’s major federal food assistance program called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. A proposal going through the U.S. Congress could result in states shouldering some SNAP costs starting in 2028.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Farm Bureau’s latest food and farm index found that among concerns of the high cost of groceries, the overwhelming majority of Iowa grocery shoppers surveyed are concerned about increases to food prices caused by government regulations. 
The annual survey, conducted by the Harris Poll, also found that more consumers are seeking locally grown and produced products. 
“At a time when trust in national institutions—from government to media—is at historic lows, the sustained confidence in local farmers speaks volumes about their authenticity and transparency, underscoring the strong bond and mutual respect between Iowa’s farmers and the communities they serve,” said Latoya Guishard Welch, vice president of research for public release at the Harris Poll.

According to the food and farm index, 80% of shoppers are concerned, and 47% are very concerned, about government regulations that increase consumer food prices. The percentage of folks very concerned has more than doubled since 2021, when just 21% were more than just concerned about the role of government in increased food costs. 
U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics show direct imports, or finished products ready for sale, accounted for 15% of U.S. spending on food and beverages. Foreign ingredients and supplies comprised 4% of domestic food production. 
Forbes reported tariffs could have a significant impact on the cost of food and beverages at the grocery store, if imposed at their highest proposed levels.  
Study: Iowa importers paid 300% more in tariffs
A recent study from Farmers for Free Trade, a non-profit advocacy group, found that tariff costs for Iowa importers increased by $68 million, or 304% from April 2024 to April 2025. According to the Iowa “tarifflation” report, 90% of this increase came from tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, as opposed to legislative tariffs.
These tariffs primarily impacted imported unwrought aluminum, machinery parts, insecticides and fungicides, and engines. According to the study, imports from China had the highest tariffs, but imports from Mexico, Canada and South Korea faced dramatic increases in tariffs. 
Goods imported from Mexico to Iowa in April 2024 had tariffs of 0.2%, compared to a 4.4% tariff in April 2025. 
Reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China, which are currently on a 90-day reduction agreement, would put Iowa industries at a “significant” risk. In particular, Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports would hurt Iowa pork and soybean producers especially hard.
The Farmers for Free Trade study concluded the presidential tariffs, if they took effect and stayed in place, would “have major consequences” on Iowa. 
“Already, Iowa companies are paying tens of millions of dollars per day – money that could be better spent investing in companies and workers or lowering prices for their customers.” 
Consumers look at price first, but also value local goods
Recent consumer price index data from U.S. Department of Agriculture shows a 23.6% increase in grocery prices from 2020 to 2024, which likely explains why price continues to be the most important factor for Iowa grocery shoppers when making decisions on which types of food to buy. 
Three-fourths of Iowans said meat, poultry or dairy products are part of their daily diets, and a higher proportion of Iowans say they prefer “real” meat and dairy over plant-based alternatives. 
More and more, consumers are choosing to purchase these items directly from the farm. Sixty-nine percent said they have purchased groceries directly from farmers, through their online websites, farm stores or at farmers markets, and 40% of Iowa consumers look for locally made or grown labels when buying at the store. This is an increase from 2024 survey results which found around 30% of consumers sought local labels.
Iowa Farm Bureau President Brent Johnson said these statistics mean a lot to farmers. 
“Iowans are definitely paying attention to food prices, but they’re also looking for food that makes them feel connected to local farmers,” Johnson said. “We take pride in growing safe, high-quality food for our neighbors and knowing they trust us to do that really hits home.” 
The survey results also show that more than 90% of shoppers said they trust farmers and 49% said they place a “great deal of trust” in Iowa farmers in general. The survey also asked consumers if they felt confident farmers were caring for animals and the environment, which the vast majority, around 80% for each category, did.
Johnson said flexibility in farming is “crucial” for farmers to provide a variety of consumer options. Consumers agree, with 86% responding that farmers should have the flexibility to explore different farming techniques. 
“Year after year, farmers and consumers have been feeling the pinch of high costs and that is only exacerbated when individual states enact restrictions on production practices that ultimately impact prices at the grocery store,” Johnson said.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Leaders in the Louisiana Legislature are advising members to be hyperaware in the wake of what’s been labeled a political assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband last weekend. 
Democratic Rep. Melissa Hortman, Minnesota House speaker emeritus, and her husband, Doug, were killed at their home overnight Friday. Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot multiple times and seriously wounded earlier in the evening. The suspect, Vance Boelter, had written manifestos in which he listed other political figures he had marked for death, according to police.
Louisiana Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, told our news partners at WVUE-TV Fox 8 he has been in touch with State Police and Capitol security after the attacks in Minnesota.  
“All members take threats seriously whether it’s through email, text message, social media – all those threats are taken seriously by members,” Henry said. “The incidents in Minnesota just furthered the need for members to stay vigilant; all elected officials stay vigilant about their surroundings and report all text messages, emails, anything threatening no matter the source.”
Louisiana House Speaker Phillip DeVillier has also reached out to members about safety precautions, said Meg Casper Sunstrom, the legislature’s chief communications officer. 
Security measures have been heightened at the State Capitol in recent years. The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol inspired the creation of a new police force for the State Capitol and Pentagon Apartments, where many legislators stay during the lawmaking sessions and some weekends. Lawmakers have hired a police chief for the new department, but its staffing has not been fleshed out yet.
Just ahead of this year’s legislative session, new security screening technology was installed at the entrances to the State Capitol.

Melton announced the suspension on social media Tuesday, saying it was one of the “toughest decisions” he’s ever made.
“It was an honor to fight the good fight on your behalf, and I will continue to, just in different ways,” Melton said in his post. “It’s the biggest sacrifice I’ve ever made for the greater good, but I don’t regret a single minute, and am proud of the fact that the party out here in the 4th is in a much better place now than it was when I first began running.”

Reasons he gave for stepping out of the race included recently losing his job at Nationwide Insurance due to company reorganization and the need to find a new job to support his family, as well as dealing with a health concern. He added he wants to stay home for his wife and 6-year-old son.
Incumbent U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who won elections against Melton for the district in 2022 and 2024, has launched an exploratory committee for a possible gubernatorial run in Iowa. Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, has made a similar move for the 4th Congressional District. The district spans much of northwest Iowa and includes Ames, Council Bluffs and Sioux City.
Between his two campaigns, Melton said in his post his vote shares across the district’s 36 counties either stayed steady or grew, a fact he is proud of achieving as someone with a full-time job, family and no funding from political action committees representing corporate interests.
Melton said in his post he’s been happy to hear from first-time political candidates from across the state who have reached out, and said he’ll be rooting for them. He also encouraged everyday people to run for office, even if they don’t know how everything works or don’t have the funds or industry support to get their name out there right away.
“We need more working people that struggle every day along with most Americans to run for every office, and I’ll always make time for you if you want to call me to inquire,” Melton said in his post. “Also, even if you are in a district that may seem unwinnable on Election Day, run anyway, because if you tell the truth and run as a sacrifice for the greater good, you’ll find so many wins out there.”
Travis Terrell, a Democrat running in Iowa’s 1st Congressional District, said in a social media post Melton was one of the first people he called — and one of the few who responded — when launching his campaign. Melton made “an extremely powerful point” in his announcement that more working people need to get out and run for office.
“We need working class voices to fight, let’s be honest, the rich and powerful are not going to save us when they’re the one’s holding us down,” Terrell said in his post. “It takes real people to power real change. Thank you Ryan.”

Tony Evers announced Wednesday that he’s awarding $1.8 million to the city of Green Bay to cover the public safety costs associated with hosting the NFL draft in April. 
The event drew more than 600,000 visitors to the city which, with a population of about 105,000, is the smallest NFL city in the country. Initial estimates say the draft generated $94 million in economic activity across the state and $20 million for the Green Bay area specifically. 
Prior to the draft, a pair of Republican lawmakers had requested that the Republicans in control of the budget writing Joint Finance Committee include $1.25 million in the next state budget to help cover public safety costs. That request has not yet been addressed as Republicans continue to work on delivering a state budget to Evers. 
The money Evers awarded is being disbursed from the Opportunity Attraction and Promotion Fund, a program proposed by Evers in his last state budget proposal to help the state recruit and host large-scale events. The 2023-25 budget included $10 million for the program and Evers had proposed an additional $5 million in his latest budget proposal. 
“The 2025 NFL Draft was a booming success, and I’ve said all along that nobody could have pulled it off other than the Green Bay Packers and the good folks in Green Bay and across the region,” Evers said in a statement. “So, it was critically important to me that Green Bay and our local partners received the support they need to cover public safety costs, and I’m glad we were able to get this done.” 
According to a news release, the grant will also help the village of Ashwaubenon and Brown County cover their costs associated with the event. Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich said the money will keep the burden of the event off city taxpayers. 
“We’re incredibly grateful to Gov. Evers and WEDC for their critical support in covering public safety expenses related to the NFL Draft,” Genrich said. “This was a historic event that brought enormous economic benefits to our community and the entire state of Wisconsin. The allocation of this funding recognizes that positive statewide economic effect and protects our local taxpayers from bearing the costs—a win-win for our state’s and our city’s residents.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States vs. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
 

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.

The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)In his second tenure leading Indiana’s most expensive state agency, Family and Social Services Administration Secretary Mitch Roob wants to significantly change Indiana’s insurance program for low- to middle-income Hoosiers. But ongoing negotiations in Washington D.C. could undermine or fundamentally alter the third iteration of the Healthy Indiana Plan, otherwise known as HIP. 
Some congressional changes could be prohibitively expensive for the state, coming on the heels of a bleak revenue forecast projecting $2 billion less in Indiana’s coffers over the next two years.
“This is a five-alarm fire for us,” said Roob, who introduced the first version of HIP while he was the FSSA secretary under former Gov. Mitch Daniels. 
In a sit-down with the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Roob previewed a Wednesday presentation before the State Budget Committee introducing HIP 3.0, including work requirements, provider taxes and wellness incentives. But the final details can’t be determined until Congress agrees on President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which could be approved in the coming weeks. 
GOP senators warn mega-bill’s new Medicaid cuts will hurt rural hospitals

Work requirements for able-bodied adults on HIP were fiercely debated in the legislative session earlier this year, ultimately advancing with the support of the Republican supermajority. But the process would take months, requiring Indiana to submit a modified waiver for federal approval before it could be enacted. 
That timeline could be shortened under the latest version of the bill, which would force all states to adopt such regulations.
“Once the big, beautiful bill passes, we will move forward as quickly as we can with that,” Roob said about work requirements.
Other states have stumbled in their rollout of such conditions, including Arkansas and Georgia. Roob said details of Indiana’s plan would largely hinge on Congress’ actions and pointed to support from Indiana Gov. Mike Braun.
“He believes in work requirements; he doesn’t believe in work requirements to kick people off of the program,” said Roob. “He believes that Medicaid ought to be a program that incentivizes individuals to work — not disincentivizes them to do so.”
While Indiana’s work requirements would have allowed an exception for parents in general, Congress now proposes limiting that exemption to parents of children who aren’t teens. More than 712,000 Hoosiers rely on HIP for their health coverage, according to a May enrollment report.
 Ongoing discussions in Washington D.C.

Other portions of the bill threaten to undo Indiana’s program, particularly its cap on state provider taxes, according to Roob. The Senate has proposed a cap of 3.5% on the levy, which applies to hospitals and managed care entities. A higher tax means the state can leverage more federal dollars.
But Indiana uses the maximum allowed tax of 6% on hospitals, known as a hospital assessment fee, to fund its obligation for HIP. Those taxes — along with a portion of the cigarette tax — pay for the entire program, meaning that no general fund dollars need to be dedicated to HIP. 
“That’s how we pay for the Healthy Indiana Plan,” Roob said. “If (Congress’ proposal is) signed into law, this would require the state of Indiana to significantly roll back eligibility in the Healthy Indiana Plan.
“Not because we want to — because we have no match.”
  Pins urge people to “Protect Medicaid” at an April 1, 2025 rally. In particular, attendees opposed Senate Bill 2, which would impose work requirements on certain Medicaid enrollees. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Indiana is responsible for 10% of the costs while the federal government picks up the tab for the remainder. However, under its current waiver, Indiana could be on the hook if the hospital assessment fee is cut and would need to come up with the difference. Roob said he was working with Indiana’s congressional delegation to provide states explicit authority to change their plans in a later version of the bill. 
This rate cap would also apply to any provider tax levies on managed care entities, which oversee several of Indiana’s Medicaid programs, including services offered under the divisive PathWays for Aging waiver. Indiana submitted a plan to tax managed care entities earlier this month based on the plans of other states, such as Ohio and Illinois, which could net the state $865.8 million. 
But Congress could invalidate that proposal by prohibiting that type of tax, which isn’t uniform and varies by provider type, in favor of something more equal across the board. 
“It is not law yet, so we are racing to try to get this approved,” said Roob. “I view our prospects of getting this done as not quite as good as the Pacers winning the series.”
Portions of the proposal in Congress would require copays and premiums for certain Medicaid enrollees, something that was halted in Indiana by a federal judge last year. If allowed, Roob said the state would “likely” bring that back — though he said the state was seeking more “explicit authority” to implement cost-sharing requirements in the final version of the bill.
Undoubtedly, such a move would be challenged in the courts. 
But Roob said Hoosiers on HIP could reduce such charges by meeting certain wellness guidelines, such as preventative care check-ups. Women getting regular pap smears, for example, would lower their cost-sharing obligations.
“And while we recognize that that won’t save Indiana much money in that particular year, it may save that woman from having cervical cancer,” Roob said. “So it is the governor’s desire to ‘Make Indiana Healthy Again,’ and part of that is to incentivize changes in behavior.”

The chambers of the Maine Legislature are in disagreement over a roughly $320 million budget addition to the $11.3 billion biennial budget passed in March.
With some Democrats joining Republicans in opposition, the Maine House of Representatives failed to advance the plan Wednesday morning, while the Senate cast a party-line vote in favor. 
The initial conflicting votes come after the Democratic majority on the Legislature’s Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee set the budget proposal early Saturday morning without Republican support. 
While added appropriations in the plan total about $320 million, the bill has a lower fiscal note — $117 million —  due to a range of cost cutting measures — taxes, some cuts, and transferring unexpected surpluses. The net cost is also lower than the roughly $127 million that remained after the initial budget passed in March. 
The plan rejects some of Gov. Janet Mills’ proposed cuts, such as to childcare programs and low-income food assistance, as well as proposed taxes on ambulances and pharmacies. However, the plan includes Mills’ proposed tax additions on streaming services, cannabis, pensions and cigarettes — the latter at an even higher amount than the governor requested.
“Republicans had started from a position of no new taxes and we remain in that posture,” Republican budget lead Rep. Jack Ducharme of Madison said on the House floor.
On the Senate floor, Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) also criticized the majority party for not taking “a serious look back about our state’s financial disrepair,” nodding to the state budget audit he called for before session began.
Committee sets budget plan with party-line vote

But Republicans were not the only members of the House to have objections, as the budget bill failed 71-77 on the first vote before the chamber then voted against its passage without a roll call. Following the Senate’s vote 19-15 in favor, the bill now heads back to see if the House will change its stance. 
Through tears, Rep. Nina Milliken (D-Blue Hill), who voted against the budget, urged her colleagues to reject regressive taxes, which have a greater impact on people with lower incomes, and instead push for a model that taxes the wealthy more — even if the governor, who has opposed any income-based tax reform, ultimately vetoes it. 
“Democrats across this country right now are calling for Republican members of Congress to stand up to the executive branch, because they are a separate co-equal branch of government and they should be asserting their power as such,” Milliken said, referring to push back against President Donald Trump. 
“We are a separate co-equal branch of government,” she added. “We owe it to our constituents to do better, to tax people who are super wealthy, so that the poorest people in our communities see some relief.”
After both chambers narrowly rejected a “millionaire’s tax” in initial votes, the Senate reversed its stance Monday night, sending the measure back to the House to reconsider. The proposal would place a tax surcharge of 2% on the portion of a resident’s taxable income beyond $1 million for single filers to be used to fund public K-12 education.
As the Legislature continues to debate the budget bill Wednesday, lawmakers are expected to propose a number of floor amendments. One proposal, filed by Rep. Sally Cluchey (D-Bowdoinham), would tack on this “millionaire’s tax.”
The budget plan being considered also effectively stops the state’s free community college program for future graduating classes, against the governor’s request to make it permanent. Several bills currently pending were also worked into the budget plan, including proposals to alter the child tax credit and real estate transfer tax. Read about more of the details of the plan here. 
Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln), an appropriations committee member, said in a floor speech that the budget is as much about avoiding harm as it is about providing for Mainers, a sentiment both of the committee chairs also shared.
“This is not a flashy budget,” co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said. “It’s a workhorse — steady, thoughtful and grounded in real need.” 
Rotundo asked her colleagues to vote for the budget “not because it gives everyone everything they want” but because “it reflects who we are, a state that cares deeply, spends responsibly and plans wisely for the future.” 
Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook) made a similar plea in the House earlier Wednesday. 
“This budget meets the moment,” Gattine said. “It addresses the biggest issues that Maine people are facing, and protects critical investments that we’ve made in the past in health care, food security, education, housing and child care.”

Meanwhile, Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata (R-New Gloucester), another member of the appropriations committee, argued the budget plan was built on a “house of cards,” pointing out that it was balanced, in part, by an unexpected $24 million estate tax after two recent deaths and that it doesn’t provide the full expected cost-of-living increase for direct care workers. 
Also, projections for the following biennium present an approximately $246 million increase based on the ongoing spending in the budget plan. 
Republicans have filed several floor amendments to the budget, including to increase MaineCare funding for veterans homes, hire more state troopers, remove the proposed increase to the cigarette tax and ensure timely payments to service providers. 
Arata and Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport), who is also on the committee, argued that the state’s budgetary needs for the next fiscal year have already been met.
“This is a tax and spend supplemental budget,” Fredette said. 
In March, the Democratic majority pushed through a two-year budget plan without Republican support and formally adjourned in order to start the clock for those funds to become available in 90 days, which will be on Friday. 
Senate Republicans refused to back an alternative short-term plan that would have immediately filled the current deficit for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, because it did not include structural reform to the program.
That budget continued funding for state services at the same level while also providing one-time funding for MaineCare and other urgent needs. But it didn’t include any of the policy changes Mills proposed to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
Some Republican legislators tried to collect signatures to allow Maine voters to overturn the budget passed in March but failed to reach the needed threshold, the leader of the people’s veto effort, Rep. Gary Drinkwater of Milford, announced on Tuesday.

Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.

The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s office last month told state agency directors to make internal plans for budget “holdbacks,” midyear cuts in spending. Little also placed limits on budget requests.
The two directives come as state revenue lags behind projections and major tax cuts take effect. 
Little’s Division of Financial Management on May 29 sent agency directors a memo outlining the governor’s expectations, as agencies prepare their budget requests ahead of next year’s legislative session. 
The division issues similar guidance memos around this time every year. But the state is facing “a different scenario than we have seen in the past several years,” Division of Financial Management administrator Lori Wolff wrote in the latest memo, which Idaho Education News obtained through a public records request. 
The Idaho Capital Sun reported last week that state tax revenue is $141.5 million below projections, while policymakers enacted $453 million in tax cuts this year. This means the state will have less revenue than projected in fiscal year 2027 and in future years, Wolff wrote in the memo. 
Wolff told agency directors that budgets relying on state general fund dollars will be limited to “maintenance” spending. Directors must get pre-approval from the governor’s office before making new spending requests that use federal or dedicated funds. She also told directors to “internally prepare” for 2%, 4% or 6% budget holdbacks “as we continue to watch economic trends at the national level.”
“Although we understand that there are still many initiatives and challenges that impact your agency and operations, we must submit a balanced budget,” Wolff wrote, “and Idaho’s current revenue projections only allow for slight growth in appropriations for FY 2027.”

 Idaho Department of Education, State Board and higher ed will have to identify spending cuts

It’s too early to say what the budget restrictions could mean for public education funding. But the Idaho Department of Education, State Board of Education and colleges and universities will have to identify spending cuts up to 6%. 
State revenue changes always impact education spending, whether tax collections are lower or higher than expected, state superintendent Debbie Critchfield said Monday. 
“We are in budget discussions now and examining all types of scenarios,” she said. 
In a statement to EdNews Tuesday, Wolff sought to ease concerns. The state is still seeing year-over-year revenue growth, “signaling a strong Idaho economy.” Lawmakers and Little left a $400 million cushion in the current year’s budget. They also put 22% of general fund revenues in rainy-day funds, Wolff said. 
“That said, as a responsible manager of taxpayer resources, Gov. Little is preparing for a number of scenarios as we get closer to the end of the fiscal year. While we continue to watch revenue closely, we feel good about the strength of the state budget and our economy.”

Budget schedule 
Agency directors must send the governor’s office their budget requests by Aug. 29.
These include spending requests for fiscal year 2027 as well as supplemental spending requests for fiscal year 2026.

Fiscal year 2026 runs from July 1 to June 30, 2026. The Legislature set these budgets during the 2025 session.
Fiscal year 2027 runs from July 1, 2026, to June 30, 2027. The Legislature will set these budgets during the 2026 session. 

Little’s office will consider agency requests in the months leading up to next year’s session, and the governor will present his budget recommendations to lawmakers in January. 

 Why is state revenue lagging? 

In her memo, Wolff noted two reasons for the “conservative” budget guidance: Lagging sales tax revenue and tax cuts.
In April, state tax revenue was $55 million short of the Legislature’s projection, and May revenues came in $98 million short, the Capital Sun reported last week. 
Altogether, state revenue was $141.5 million below the Legislature’s projections heading into June, the last month of the 2025 fiscal year. The current shortfall would leave $278.2 million on the state’s ending balance for fiscal year 2025, down from $420 million. 
Wolff told agency directors that Idaho is “seeing slower growth in sales tax revenue, so our revenue projections for future years have been adjusted downward. This will have a direct impact on budget planning for agencies (in the 2026 legislative) session.” 
She also noted that the Legislature and Little this year made tax cuts worth $453 million. While this “historic tax relief” will eventually result in economic growth, she wrote, it means the state will collect less revenue than projected.
Lawmakers passed and Little signed these tax relief bills:

House Bill 40 cut income taxes by $253 million by reducing the individual and corporate income tax rate from 5.695% to 5.3%, expanding exemptions for military pensions and eliminating capital gains taxes on gold bullion.
House Bill 93 created a $50 million refundable tax credit program covering private school and home-school expenses.
House Bill 231 increased the grocery tax credit to $155 per person, altogether providing $50 million in sales tax relief.
House Bill 304 added $100 million to property tax relief funds that benefit homeowners and help school districts pay down bonds and levies.

These cuts were more than three times what Little proposed at the start of this year’s legislative session — he proposed in $100 million and $50 million for private school choice. While Little raised concerns about the scale of tax relief pitched by the Legislature’s Republican leadership, he has since touted the tax cuts in post-session appearances.

 What does the budget guidance mean for public education? 

The governor’s office on Tuesday did not address the likelihood of holdbacks in the coming months. But Wolff said that “public education and teacher pay will remain the governor’s top priorities.” 
In her memo, Wolff wrote that planning for holdbacks “helps us be prepared for uncertainty” and “allows agencies to look internally at priorities and operations and ensure critical operations are prioritized.”
The Idaho Constitution directs the state government to maintain a balanced budget. And state law allows the governor to rescind spending authority if budgeted expenses exceed revenue in a given year.
Little last ordered budget holdbacks in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when he cut public school spending by 5%. Most of the cuts focused on discretionary and salary spending. Before that, former Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter ordered holdbacks in 2010, following the Great Recession.
Critchfield said local school leaders are “paying close attention” to state revenues this month as districts and charter schools set their 2025-26 budgets. Some districts are facing budget strains already this year, after lawmakers and the Education department required minimum salary increases. 
Looking ahead, schools’ operations costs and special education costs “won’t be going down,” Critchfield said, “so we are looking at ways to ease those pressures without new or ongoing dollars.”
The “maintenance” budget limitations essentially mean that agencies can only request funding for bills they have to pay — expenses that keep the lights on, satisfy contractual obligations and pay employees. 
The Division of Financial Management sent out estimates of what these budgets should look like for most agencies. Colleges and universities, for instance, are limited to $398.1 million, and the Office of the State Board of Education can request up to $47.3 million. The Idaho Department of Education is not included in the list of estimates. 
According to the memo, a maintenance budget includes: 

A 1% placeholder for state employee raises. 
An 18% increase in health insurance costs.
Inflationary adjustments that are contractually obligated. 
Replacement item costs, calculated using a three-year average. 
Non-discretionary changes to population forecast adjustments.

If an agency plans to ask for a line-item “enhancement” from federal or dedicated funding sources, the agency must meet with the governor’s office “to discuss its necessity for inclusion,” Wolff wrote. Additionally, supplemental spending requests for FY 26 should be “used as a tool of last resort.”
The Division of Financial Management will later assess whether revenue projections support state employee raises — including for K-12 teachers — Wolff wrote. “Agencies should not submit line-item requests for additional personnel funds outside of” change in employee compensation, the state’s employee raise structure.

Patrick Morrisey held a news conference in Wheeling, W.Va. to give an update on the state's flood response on Wednesday, June 18, 2025. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey video screenshot)One more person has been confirmed to have died in flash flooding in Ohio County, West Virginia over the weekend, bringing the death toll to eight. One other person is still unaccounted for, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Wednesday.  
The male victim’s name is being withheld until his family has been told, Morrisey said. Officials did not say where the body was located.
“This is a very challenging time for the residents of Ohio County,” the governor said during a briefing from Wheeling. 
Recovery efforts are underway in Ohio and Marion counties in northern West Virginia, where several inches of rain fell in a short time period Saturday and Sunday, causing flooding. 
The body of a 71-year-old woman was found at the Wetzel County dam earlier this week. A 3-year-old child and her mother were also among those who died in the flooding.
In Marion County, where a 28-unit apartment building in Fairmont collapsed during the flooding Sunday, there are no reports of death, Morrisey said Wednesday. 
Morrisey said he had spoken with White House officials and the Federal Emergency Management Agency about the flooding and the need for federal assistance. He encouraged affected residents to fill out a survey that will help the state tally how much damage the storms have caused. The surveys are very important to the state’s request for FEMA help, he said. 
“We’re going to proceed diligently the same way the state always has,” he said. “We’re going to go through the process. We’re working locally with people to make sure that those survey instruments are filled out and that they’re returned. That’s the key to success in situations like this. 
“We have to have people that are affected on the ground return that survey instrument in order to ensure that we are counting the numbers properly,” he said. 
Morrisey called for volunteers to help with cleanup efforts.
“I ask people in West Virginia and across the country if people want to come in and help, we need to get those homes cleared and mucked up,” Morrisey said. 
In Marion County, people can call the Tygart Valley United Way at 304-366-4550 if they’d like to volunteer. People who’d like to volunteer in Ohio County can call the Wheeling-Ohio Emergency Emergency Management Agency at 304-234-7109.

Delaware has been ranked the 10th best state in the country for pickleball players, according to a new national report by PodPlay Pickleball Business Guide.
The ranking is based on the number of pickleball venues per capita, with Delaware offering 3.52 facilities per 100,000 residents. The report analyzed the availability of indoor and outdoor pickleball courts across the U.S., identifying states and cities with the highest number of courts relative to population size. Vermont topped the list with nearly 11 venues per 100,000 residents, followed by Maine, Hawaii, South Dakota, and Idaho rounding out the top five.
Wilmington ranked as the fifth-best city in the country for pickleball access, with 13.97 courts per 100,000 residents. The city offers 10 venues with a combined total of 16 indoor and 29 outdoor courts, providing year-round options for local players.

“These findings reveal which areas have embraced the pickleball trend and how different regions adapt based on their weather patterns,” said Ben Borton, co-founder of PodPlay.  
Florida dominated the city-level rankings, with Sarasota, Bradenton, and Boynton Beach claiming the top three spots due to their abundance of outdoor courts and favorable climate. Wilmington was the highest-ranked city outside the Southeast to make the top five.
“Florida cities make the most of endless sunshine with plenty of outdoor courts, while northern states like Vermont and Maine ensure year-round play through a significant number of indoor courts,” said Borton. 
The report used data from Places2Play and the U.S. Census Bureau, considering cities with at least 10 venues. Rankings were based on the number of locations per 100,000 residents, as well as the balance of indoor and outdoor courts.
The results highlight growing national interest in pickleball and the expanding infrastructure supporting the sport across diverse regions.

Aug. 5, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The long-time sheriff of Nebraska’s second-most populous county announced Wednesday he will not seek a ninth term, endorsing his chief deputy to take his spot in the 2026 elections.
Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner, a Republican serving in one of the state’s “bluest” counties, announced he would step down after 32 years in the position in 2027. He was first elected in 1994 and ran unopposed for reelection until 2022, winning with 53% of the vote. He is the longest-serving sheriff in Lancaster County history. Wagner started as a dispatcher for the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office in 1976 at 22.

Wagner has endorsed Lancaster County Chief Deputy Ben Houchin, who has worked alongside Wagner since Houchin joined the Sheriff’s Office in 1993, shortly after graduating from college.
In a statement, Wagner said Houchin “has my full support.”
“I’ve seen firsthand his commitment and dedication to serve our county and put our residents’ safety first above all else,” Wagner said. “Chief Deputy Houchin will be a sheriff that listens and collaborates to address challenges our county faces.”
Houchin has spent 25 years as a team leader and commander in the Tactical Response Unit, rising to sergeant in 2000, captain in 2005 and as chief deputy in 2020. He participated in the 229th session of the FBI National Academy, where he graduated in 2007. 
The Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office describes Houchin as “instrumental” in establishing its Electronic Evidence Unit, Fugitive Task Force and Criminal Interdiction Task Force.

Wagner has stepped up marijuana enforcement in Lancaster County, including outside his office in 2020 when he sued to stop a statewide ballot measure related to medical cannabis, arguing that it was too broad to fit under the Nebraska Constitution’s “single-subject clause.” The Supreme Court agreed with Wagner, and it wasn’t until 2024 that supporters successfully got on the ballot. Both proposals passed with overwhelming public support.
This spring, Wagner was one of 50-plus sheriffs to join Attorney General Mike Hilgers in fighting a legislative bill to help clarify how the state should implement medical cannabis. The bill failed to advance.
Lancaster County leaders endorsing Houchin include: State Sens. Beau Ballard and Carolyn Bosn, Lancaster County Attorney Pat Condon, former Nebraska State Patrol Superintendent John Bolduc and former Lincoln Police Department Chiefs Jeff Bliemeister and Jim Peschong.

Hilgers, Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly (former Lancaster County attorney and U.S. attorney for Nebraska) and Sarpy County Sheriff Greg London also endorsed Houchin.
Houchin said he has been honored to work alongside Wagner to keep his home county safe.
“My top priorities are being responsive to public safety needs, collaborating with the public and other law enforcement agencies and listening to the community we serve,” Houchin said in a statement. “I look forward to working together to solve the toughest issues facing our county.”
Any candidates for sheriff will compete in partisan primaries in May 2026, and the top candidate for each will advance to November 2026. No Democrats or third-party candidates have yet announced.

Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.

We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”

Free.,Judge grills Trump DOJ on order tying transportation funding to immigration enforcement,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-grills-trump-doj-order-tying-transportation-funding-immigration-enforcement,,"A Rhode Island federal judge seemed likely Wednesday to block the U.S. Department of Transportation’s move to yank billions in congressional funding for bridges, roads and airport projects if Democrat-led states do not partake in federal immigration enforcement.U.S. District Judge John James McConnell Jr.during a hearing pressed acting U.S. Attorney Sara Miron Bloom on how the Transportation Department could have power over funding that was approved by Congress, saying federal agencies “only have appropriations power given by Congress.”“That's how the Constitution works,” he said. “Where does the secretary get the power and authority to impose immigration conditions on transportation funding?”The suit brought by 20 Democratic state attorneys general challenges an April directive from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, a former House member from Wisconsin, that requires states to cooperate in federal immigration enforcement in order to receive federal grants already approved by Congress.“Defendents seek to hold hostage tens of billions of dollars of critical transportation funding in order to force the plaintiff states to become mere arms of the federal government's immigration enforcement policies,” Delbert Tran of the California Department of Justice, who argued on behalf of the states, said.Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Bloom said that Duffy’s letter simply directs the states to follow federal immigration law.McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011, said that while the states could interpret it that way, the Trump administration has gone after so-called sanctuary cities and targeted them for not taking the same aggressive immigration enforcement as the administration.The judge said Bloom’s argument expressed a “very different” interpretation of the directive than how the administration has described it publicly. He also noted President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have “railed on … the issues that arise from sanctuary cities.”Trump this week directed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to target Chicago, Los Angeles and New York — three major Democrat-led cities that have policies to not aid in immigration enforcement.McConnell said he would make a decision whether to issue a preliminary injunction before Friday. The preliminary injunction would be tailored to the states that brought the suit and would not have a nationwide effect.The states that brought the suit are California, Illinois, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.Undermines CongressTran said the Department of Transportation’s directive is not only arbitrary and capricious, but undermines congressional authority because Congress appropriated more than $100 billion for transportation projects to the states.Cutting off funding would have disastrous consequences, the states have argued.“More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States,” according to the brief from the states.Transportation security and immigrationBloom defended Duffy’s letter, saying it listed actions that would impede federal law enforcement and justified withholding of funds because “such actions compromise the safety and security of the transportation systems supported by DOT financial assistance.”McConnell said that didn’t answer his question about the secretary’s authority to withhold congressionally appropriated funding.“It seems to me that the secretary is saying that a failure to comply with immigration conditions is relevant to the safety and security of the transportation system,” Bloom said.McConnell seemed skeptical of that argument.“Under that rationale, does the secretary of the Department of Transportation have the authority to impose a condition on federal highway funds that prohibit a state that has legalized abortion from seeking a federal grant?” he asked. Bloom said that question was beyond her directive from the Department of Transportation to address in her arguments to the court.“I understand your question,” she said. “All I think I can say is that here the secretary has, in his statement, set out a rationale for why this is relevant to DOT funding.”Tran said that the “crux of this case is” that the Trump administration is trying “to enforce other laws that do not apply to these grants,” by requiring states to partake in immigration enforcement.“It's beyond their statutory authority,” he argued.",,,,2025-06-18 14:09:39.664426

Deandra Buchanan, convicted in Boone County of three counts of first-degree in 2002, was originally sentenced to death. The Missouri Supreme Court reduced the sentence to life without parole in 2003.
The statute allowing the court to directly resentence people sentenced to death violates another law, and federal court precedent, requiring defendants to be present when their sentence is pronounced, Buchanan argued through public defender Tyler Coyle.
When the Supreme Court found the death sentence to be unconstitutional in Buchanan’s case, the trial court should have brought him in for in-person resentencing.
But Boone County Circuit Judge Jeff Harris disagreed, deciding that the high court was within its authority when it changed Buchanan’s sentence. Harris didn’t address the constitutional questions raised by Buchanan.
“Because the Supreme Court exercised its authority to resentence defendant, there was no need and basis for the circuit court to take any further action or hold a resentencing hearing,” Harris wrote.
The ruling isn’t a setback, Coyle said, because he and Buchanan had expected a definitive ruling would come from an appeals court.
“The state argued at our in-person hearing that if we have a problem with what the Supreme Court did, we should be asking the Supreme Court,” Coyle said. “That’s what the prosecutor argued to Judge Harris. It kind of sounds like by not addressing that part of it, that’s what is left for us to do now.”
In his final brief in the case, Coyle wrote that the question is analogous to the issue decided by the Missouri Supreme Court in 2022 when defendants challenged the outcome of hearings held online with witnesses or defendants not physically present.
The hearing formats were intended to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.
In those cases, the court ruled unanimously that there are no “sick days” for constitutional rights.
“There’s a fundamental right to be present for all critical stages,” Coyle said. “The U.S. Supreme Court has said this, and the U.S. Supreme Court has also said that sentencing is a critical stage.”
Assistant Boone County prosecutor Yao Li, who argued that Buchanan should be pursuing his claims at the Missouri Supreme Court, also argued that the time for the challenge had long passed.
“The law of the case and lapse of jurisdiction prohibits him from raising the claim here,” Li wrote in his final brief to Harris.
Along with arguing that the 2003 resentencing was legal under state statute and rule, 
Buchanan contends he was never legally sentenced and that has prevented him from seeking post-conviction relief.
Buchanan doesn’t deny his guilt. He spoke at length about his case in an episode of the Netflix series “I am a Killer.”
“We can never change the fact that my family members lost their lives, my girl, my friend, was shot,” Buchanan said in an April interview at Jefferson City Correctional Center. “You can’t put time on that.”
But he claims he has no memory of the crime. He said he believes marijuana he smoked that night was laced with PCP and tests of sweat residue in the shirt he wore shows that.
He cannot pursue those arguments without a final sentence, Buchanan said Wednesday in a telephone interview. That is why he needs an in-person sentencing.
“Any court in Missouri is obligated to honor my federal rights, because I’m dealing with a constitutional right,” Buchanan said. “I have a constitutional right to be present.”

Young Library at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. (Mark Cornelison | UK Photo)The U.S. Department of Justice is suing Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and Kentucky education officials to stop the state from granting in-state college tuition rates to immigrants who lack permanent legal status.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the lawsuit stems from a similar challenge in Texas. The Kentucky lawsuit also follows Republican President Donald Trump signing two executive orders earlier this year to “ensure illegal aliens are not obtaining taxpayer benefits or preferential treatment,” the DOJ said. 
The Justice Department filed the lawsuit Tuesday in the Eastern District of Kentucky, arguing the administrative regulation discriminates against U.S. citizens. The complaint says federal law prohibits “aliens not lawfully present” in the country from getting a benefit denied to out-of-state citizens. 
Named in the complaint are Beshear, Kentucky Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher and the Council on Postsecondary Education. 
“No state can be allowed to treat Americans like second-class citizens in their own country by offering financial benefits to illegal aliens,” said Bondi in a press release. “The Department of Justice just won on this exact issue in Texas, and we look forward to fighting in Kentucky to protect the rights of American citizens.”
Texas was the first state to offer some immigrants without permanent legal status in-state tuition 24 years ago, but it recently abruptly ended the policy after the Justice Department challenged it in court. 
According to the National Immigration Law Center, 25 states and Washington, D.C. have had “tuition equity” laws or policies that permit certain students who have attended and graduated from secondary schools in their state to pay in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities regardless of their immigrations status.
Crystal Staley, a spokesperson for Beshear told the Lantern in an email that the governor’s office has not been served with the lawsuit as of Wednesday morning “and had no advance notice, nor any prior discussion with the Department of Justice about it.” She added that the state regulation in question was issued by the Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE) before 2010. Beshear was elected as governor in 2019. 
“Under Kentucky law, CPE is independent, has sole authority to determine student residency requirements for the purposes of in-state tuition, and controls its own regulations,” Staley said. “The Governor has no authority to alter CPE’s regulations and should not be a party to the lawsuit.”
CPE spokesperson Melissa Young said that its staff was reviewing the lawsuit and regulation as of Wednesday morning. 
Jennifer Ginn, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Department of Education, said Fletcher “is the chief state school officer for elementary and secondary education in Kentucky.” 
“He is not charged with oversight or management of Kentucky’s postsecondary education system,” she said. 
According to the National Immigration Law Center, 25 states and Washington, D.C. have had “tuition equity” laws or policies that permit certain students who have attended and graduated from secondary schools in their state to pay in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities regardless of their immigrations status.
Earlier this year, Republican state Rep. T.J Roberts, of Burlington, filed a bill to undo the Kentucky policy. However, it didn’t get a committee hearing in the GOP-controlled state legislature. In a Wednesday statement, Roberts praised the DOJ’s lawsuit and said the regulation discriminates against U.S. citizens “both those born here and those who have followed the lawful path to citizenship.”

Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesThe U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

(Courtesy of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency / David Esparza) Attorneys for state regulators and a Southern New Mexico water utility facing $250,000 in fines for arsenic level violations have agreed to push back hearings about the penalties.
The hearings scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday will now be held sometime in the fall, according to a joint motion filed last week by attorneys for Camino Real Regional Utility Authority and the New Mexico Environment Department.
The utility supplies water for more than 19,000 people in Sunland Park, Santa Teresa and southern Doña Ana County, an area with high levels of naturally-occurring arsenic in the groundwater.
State regulators first issued fines of more than $251,000 in March 2024, after findings that the utility’s arsenic treatment plants were “offline and bypassed” for more than a year, sending drinking water with “high levels of arsenic” to residents.
Drinking water with high levels of arsenic is associated with diseases such as diabetes, increased risk of cancers, and can contribute to heart and lung diseases and skin problems, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Utility leadership has said in statements that they take the concerns seriously and have worked to lower arsenic levels, achieving compliance with federal standards.
However, after a series of failed tests in May public officials and the state’s top environment officials said they’ve lost confidence in the utility’s leadership to address the chronic issues.
In late May, the New Mexico Environment Department filed an amended complaint, claiming that the utility delayed reporting elevated arsenic levels for multiple days and failed to specifically report them to the state.
“The continuing cycle of non-compliance by Respondent which compromises the public’s access to safe and reliable drinking water requires the application of a bad faith enhancement for each of the violations which are the subject of this enforcement action,” the amended complaint stated
Regulators raised the total fine to $252,000. Attorneys for the utility objected to the addition of new allegations for the upcoming June hearing, and requested more time to address them.
Both the utility  and the environment department agreed to a calendar extending witness and discovery deadlines into August, with a final date for the new hearing to follow.
The utility faces additional court dates beyond the administrative hearing later this year.
A 3rd Judicial District Judge ordered parties to submit a further schedule in the civil lawsuit the state  brought earlier this month against the utility, requesting the judge appoint a third party to take over the utility’s operations.
A hearing is scheduled for July in the civil lawsuit brought last year, which alleges the utility violated residents’ civil rights.

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Miami’s city commissioners voted Tuesday to enter into an agreement with the federal government authorizing local police to act as immigration enforcement officials.
The 3-2 vote followed that of other major Democratic cities in the state, such as Orlando and Jacksonville, which have already agreed to collaborate with federal officials in street-level immigration enforcement operations.
However, the decision came with heavy scrutiny from the public, with hundreds lining up outside under the scorching sun to get a chance to express their disapproval during the several hours of public comment.
“I feel the pain of our country; I feel the pain of my residents afraid to leave their homes, afraid to get medical attention for their children, and I don’t want to be a part of that,” said Christine King, chairwoman of the Miami Board of Commissioners. “I think we are on the wrong side if we enter into this agreement.”
The enactment of the 287(g) Task Force Model agreement, as the partnership is officially known, has been a significant aspect of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ push to promote the state as a leader in immigration enforcement. The governor persistently touts the hundreds of agreements that cities, state agencies, and even universities have signed up for.
But participation hasn’t all been voluntary. Attorney General James Uthmeier warned the Fort Myers commission and the Broward County sheriff that they could be removed from office after pushing back against the agreements.
City Attorney George Wysong and Miami Police Chief Manuel Morales brought up Uthmeier’s warnings during the meeting on Tuesday, saying that the city could face a suit from the state’s chief legal officer for rejecting the agreement.
Even the commissioners who voted in favor of the agreement with ICE didn’t do so gleefully. District 3 Commissioner Joe Carrollo, who represents Little Havana, said the city had to take the issue head-on.
“This is not an easy decision for me at all, but I’ve also heard what our police chief, what our attorney have said, and each of us is going to have to vote our conscience,” he said.
An outstanding lawsuit from the City of South Miami could provide clarity on whether state law requires cities to enter into the agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The overwhelming majority of the people speaking about the 287(g) agreement opposed it because they said it eroded trust in police in a city built by immigrants escaping dictatorships.
Karla De Anda, a community advocate who witnessed how a Cuban man tried to strangle himself after federal officials arrested him in Miami’s immigration court, said victims of crimes are too afraid to call the police for help.
“Every day we have received calls from domestic workers that have suffered mistreatment, sexual harassment, and even labor trafficking,” she said.
Others trying to sway commissioners against the agreement used their own experiences as immigrants or children of immigrants to make their points. Nick Mayor said the city had once welcomed his family with open arms.
“We need to have trust in our community, and this is eroding that right now before a single vote has been cast,” he said.

New York attorney Neil Barofsky came to that conclusion in a report released Tuesday, which called for the UAW’s executive board to reinstate the responsibilities that had been reassigned away from Secretary-Treasurer Margaret Mock after she refused to authorize certain expenditures for Fain’s office.
Barofsky was appointed to the independent oversight role in 2021 after an embezzlement and bribery scandal rocked the UAW, culminating with several top union leaders and auto executives going to prison. 
The dispute between Fain, who won election to head the union in March 2023, and Mock, became public last year, prompting Barofsky’s investigation. 
Among the allegations made by Fain and the union’s executive board against Mock were that she “weaponized” financial policies, obstructed operations, and sought to improperly influence votes by the board.
However, Barofsky concluded that the allegations “were either unsupported or outright unfounded,” and that the removal of Mock’s authority “was not the result of dereliction of duty or dishonesty, but rather a consequence of her refusal to grant exceptions to the strict policy restrictions governing the expenditure of Union resources, including to those within Fain’s inner circle.”
Barofsky also cited the testimony of multiple  witnesses, including at least one regional director, to an October 2023 staff meeting in which Fain said he would “cut the f—–g throats” of anyone who “messed with his people.” The director said Fain’s comment “speaks to retribution” as Fain is the union’s  “most powerful person.”
The report stands as a blemish against Fain’s reputation as having led a resurgence in the union’s power, including leading its successful 2023 “Stand Up Strike” against all three domestic automakers, which resulted in a 25% wage increase and an end to the two-tiered compensation system.

The union’s pull on politics in Michigan has been undeniable through the decades, with approximately 60% of UAW members and retirees historically voting for Democratic Party candidates. However, the union’s endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 failed to deliver the state to the Democratic column.
Mock, through her attorney, issued a statement following the report’s release calling for the union’s leadership to set aside past disputes and move forward in representing their members. 
“In unity and solidarity, let’s work together to confront employers and uncaring politicians who choose to wage war on the working class,” Mock said. 
However, Fain and 10 other UAW executive board members issued their own statement late Tuesday refuting the report’s conclusions and reiterating their view that Mock had obstructed “critical bargaining and organizing activities.”
“The UAW International Executive Board has taken multiple corrective steps to address these serious issues in a productive and proactive manner. We stand by our decisions,” the board members wrote.
Barofsky’s report did not provide for any sanctions against Fain or the union’s executive board, but did call for the reinstatement of those duties that had been  stripped from Mock, including authority over purchasing, benefits and pensions.

During a two-day status conference this week where the utility proposed to raise rates for the second time in as many years, residents and city officials told Wingate that JXN Water should first have to raise its collections rate — which is around 70%, far below the national average — before charging more to those who do pay. 
“To inflict another rate increase on the people who are playing by the rules is onerous to the city and its economic development,” Jackson Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote said. 
Henifin emphasized repeatedly that even with 100% collection, the current rates would leave the utility about $33 million short of its annual budget needs when accounting for paying off debts and building reserves.

The utility announced the proposal earlier this year after realizing it would soon run out of the $150 million in federal funding it received for operations. Henifin said he’s hoping to tap into some of the $450 million Jackson received for project spending, but added that will only cover operations for the short term. Wingate has the final say over the rate proposal, and said he would make a decision as early as next week.
JXN Water initially said the average single-family residence would see a roughly 12% increase, or about $9 a month, although it came out during the status conference that renters in apartment complexes may see a steeper rate hike. 
In one exchange, Wingate asked Foote where else the money could come from. The recently reelected councilman shrugged, suggesting JXN Water look for other sources. 
“That sounds really good,” the judge replied sarcastically. “What miracle do you have in mind?”
Hearing Foote’s and others’ concerns, though, Wingate asked Henifin how the utility plans to collect unpaid water bills from those who owe the most. There are 15 apartment complexes, largely run by out-of-state landlords, that owe a combined $5.7 million, JXN Water said. Henifin said he plans to sue them to force payment before considering shut offs. He estimated there are roughly 7,500 residents living on those properties, and said the landlords are “calling our bluff” as far as shutting off water to that many people.
In total, Henifin added, about 15,000 of the city’s water accounts — or about one in five — are still not paying.

An “affordable” combined water and sewer bill, according to Environmental Protection Agency’s recommendations, is no more than 4.5% of a person’s income. The proposed increase, Henifin said, would bring bills to 2.4% for the median Jackson household, but 5.7% for the city’s bottom quartile of earners. 
The utility’s SNAP recipient discount, which the utility hasn’t fully applied due to a legal roadblock, would bring that number down to 3.7%, he said, and he hopes to partner with the Mississippi Department of Human Services to boost enrollment in the benefit. 
Robert Ireland, an attorney with Jackson law firm Watkins & Eager PLLC who said he represents tenants in several apartment complexes, presented data during Monday’s status conference suggesting such customers would see a much steeper increase with the new rate hike than the average resident JXN Water described.
The utility uses a tiered rate structure that charges more per gallon for higher levels of water consumption. Because tenants in those complexes share a meter with the rest of their building, Ireland explained, their consumption is grouped together and is thus more expensive than it would be if they had separate meters. Ireland estimated for the 15,000 accounts at Jackson’s largest apartment complexes, they would see an average increase of $21, or more than double the increase JXN Water presented.
“I’m trying to push back on the notion that this is just going to be a small increase,” he told Wingate.
Aisha Carson, the utility’s communications officer, said JXN Water didn’t have an average for how much tenants of complexes would be paying under the new rates. Rates for complexes are calculated differently depending on the size and number of meters there, she explained.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06100112/3X0A3836-scaled.jpg,,,2025-06-18 13:09:30.025156

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
Ruling in North Dakota transgender health care case likely months out as trial wraps

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”

In its resolution, the council noted that a long list of presidents have praised Evers, who served as field secretary for the Mississippi NAACP until his 1963 assassination, including President Donald Trump.
In 2017, Trump attended the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and praised Evers, his widow, Myrlie Evers, and his brother, Charles Evers, who supported Trump in his campaign for president.
He noted that Medgar Evers “loved his family, his community, and his country.  And he knew it was long past time for his nation to fulfill its founding promise: to treat every citizen as an equal child of God.”
After his assassination, “Sergeant Evers was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors,” Trump said. “In Arlington, he lies beside men and women of all races, backgrounds, and walks of life who have served and sacrificed for our country. Their headstones do not mark the color of their skin, but immortalize the courage of their deeds.
“Their memories are carved in stone as American heroes. That is what Medgar Evers was. He was a great American hero. That is what the others honored in this museum were: true American heroes.”
Three years later, the Trump administration’s Interior Department established the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home as a national monument.
But after Trump started his second term in 2025, he signed an executive order to eliminate all Diversity, Equality and Inclusion programs.
In the wake of that order, Evers was erased from a section of the Arlington National Cemetery website that honored Black Americans who fought in the nation’s wars, although not from website itself.. 
A week after Pentagon leaders announced their intention to possibly rename the USNS Medgar Evers, christened for the World War II veteran and civil rights leader, his family urged the Department of Defense and the Navy to not do so.
The ship is one of eight vessels named after activists – among them Cesar Chavez, Harvey Milk, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Harriet Tubman – that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wants to rebrand in a large offensive against “wokeness” and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the military to reestablish the “warrior ethos.”
Jackson City Council member Aaron Banks said, “It’s unfortunate that our politics have gotten to a place where we are moving away from people like Medgar Evers. It was rough enough that they took his name out of Arlington Cemetery, but this is an even bigger blow.”
On Tuesday, Evers’ niece, Hinds County District 2 Supervisor Wanda Evers, told the council that this is heartbreaking to her.
“You do this for a man who fought for our country?” she asked. “It’s nothing but the devil working, and we’re going to let him play in his playground, and after that it’s over.”
She plans to meet personally with Trump regarding the matter, she said. “We are fighting this.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/11160220/AP111112134411.jpg,,,2025-06-18 13:09:30.025156

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A delayed legal fight over Indiana’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors can now move forward following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling Wednesday that upheld a similar law in Tennessee.
The high court’s 6-3 decision did not directly address Indiana’s law but affirmed that states can enforce bans on puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries for transgender youth. It agreed with an appellate court decision to reverse an injunction blocking the Tennessee law.
“This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. “The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound.”
Higher court strikes injunction on gender-affirming care, reinstating health care ban

But he said “our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita celebrated the ruling Wednesday morning, posting on X: “VICTORY! … This is a massive win for Hoosiers, protecting our kids from irreversible harm.” 
Rokita’s office co-led an amicus brief in support of Tennessee’s law.
Indiana lawmakers passed a similar ban in 2023, but a federal judge temporarily blocked parts of the law before it could take effect. That included halting enforcement of restrictions on hormone therapy and puberty blockers, though a ban on gender-affirming surgeries for minors remained untouched, given that such surgeries are rarely, if ever, performed on Hoosier youth.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit later allowed the full Indiana law to take effect, staying the lower court’s injunction. That decision meant transgender minors were no longer able to start new hormone treatments or receive puberty blockers after July 1, 2023.
The ongoing lawsuit over Indiana’s ban was paused while the U.S. Supreme Court weighed the Tennessee case. With Wednesday’s ruling, litigation in Indiana can resume — but under traditional judicial scrutiny, rather than the heightened review.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana, which represents the plaintiffs in case against Indiana’s law, did not immediately comment on the Supreme Court’s decision.

Reaction from Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill:
“Puberty blockers and surgery for transgender minors aren’t “gender-affirming care.” These procedures permanently mutilate a child and have life-long physical and mental consequences – they are illegal in Louisiana. The Supreme Court got this one right. Great job by my friend, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti.”

The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”

The justices’ 6-3 decision in a case from Tennessee effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by President Donald Trump’s Republican administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people. Another 26 states have laws similar to Tennessee’s.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for a conservative majority that the law does not violate the Constitution’s equal protection clause, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same.
“This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound,” Roberts wrote. “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best.”
In a dissent for the court’s three liberal justices that she summarized aloud in the courtroom, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims. In sadness, I dissent.”
The decision comes amid a range of other federal and state efforts to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use. In April, Trump’s administration sued Maine for not complying with the government’s push to ban transgender athletes in girls sports.
The Republican president also has sought to block federal spending on gender-affirming medical care for those under age 19 — instead promoting talk therapy only to treat young transgender people. In addition, the Supreme Court has allowed him to kick transgender service members out of the military, even as court fights continue. The president also signed another order to define the sexes as only male and female.Trump’s administration has also called for using only therapy, not broader health measures, to treat transgender youths.
Several of the states where gender-affirming care has not been banned for minors have adopted laws or state executive orders seeking to protect it. But since Trump’s executive order calling for blocking federal funding for the treatment for those under 19, some providers have ceased some treatments. For instance, Penn Medicine in Philadelphia announced last month that it would not provide surgeries for patients under 19.
The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr. Susan Kressly, said in a statement the organization is “unwavering” in its support of gender-affirming care and “stands with pediatricians and families making health care decisions together and free from political interference.” Kressly said the Supreme Court’s decision “sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship.”
The justices acted a month after the United Kingdom’s top court delivered a setback to transgender rights, ruling unanimously that the U.K. Equality Act means trans women can be excluded from some groups and single-sex spaces, like changing rooms, homeless shelters, swimming areas and medical or counseling services provided only to women.
Five years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that transgender people, as well as gay and lesbian people, are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace. That decision is unaffected by Wednesday’s ruling.
But the justices Wednesday declined to apply the same sort of analysis the court used in 2020 when it found “sex plays an unmistakable role” in employers’ decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate. Roberts joined that opinion written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was part of Wednesday’s majority.
Justice Amy Coney Barrett also fully joined the majority but wrote separately to emphasize that laws classifying people based on transgender status should not receive any special review by courts. Barrett, also writing for justice Clarence Thomas, wrote that “courts must give legislatures flexibility to make policy in this area.”
Chase Strangio, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued the case for transgender minors and their families, said in a statement that the ruling “is a devastating loss for transgender people, our families, and everyone who cares about the Constitution.”
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti on social media called the ruling a “Landmark VICTORY for Tennessee at SCOTUS in defense of America’s children!”
There are about 300,000 people between the ages of 13 and 17 and 1.3 million adults who identify as transgender in the United States, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. The Williams Institute is a think tank that researches sexual orientation and gender identity demographics to inform laws and public policy decisions.
When the case was argued in December, then-President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration and families of transgender adolescents called on the high court to strike down the Tennessee ban as unlawful sex discrimination and protect the constitutional rights of vulnerable Americans.
They argued the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.
Tennessee’s law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors but allows the same drugs to be used for other purposes.
Soon after Trump took office, the Justice Department told the court its position had changed.
A major issue in the case was the appropriate level of scrutiny courts should apply to such laws.
The lowest level is known as rational basis review, and almost every law looked at that way is upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures, within their authority.
The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, which applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show the law helps accomplish it.
Roberts’ 24-page majority opinion was devoted almost entirely to explaining why the Tennessee law, known as SB1, should be evaluated under the lower standard of review. The law’s restrictions on treating minors for gender dysphoria turn on age and medical use, not sex, Roberts wrote.
Doctors may prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapy to minors of any sex to treat some disorders, but not those relating to transgender status, he wrote.
But in her courtroom statement, Sotomayor asserted that similar arguments were made to defend the Virginia law prohibiting interracial marriage that the Supreme Court struck down in 1967.
“A ban on interracial marriage could be described in the same way as the majority described SB1,” she said.
Roberts rejected the comparison in his opinion.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SCOTUS-TRANS-CARE-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 13:09:30.025156

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

The Tennessee House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field.

Thom Tillis to preserve tax credits and jobs in the massive budget reconciliation bill making its way through Congress.
The advocates gathered outside of Tillis’ Greensboro office to deliver the message.
Fueled in part by tax credits from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, speakers said, North Carolina has become a leader in the clean energy economy. The state has more than 20,000 clean energy jobs and $2 billion in clean energy investments.
These gains would be jeopardized by the House version of the reconciliation bill that would remove clean energy provisions and stop clean energy progress, speakers said.
“It can even cause North Carolina tens of thousands of jobs by 2030, along with billions of clean energy investments, sparred by clean energy and manufacturing tax credits,” Dan Crawford, governmental relations director at the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, said. “We simply can’t afford to lose these jobs right now in North Carolina.”
Crawford said North Carolina is “well positioned” to continue success from the Inflation Reduction Act — clean energy projects make up a quarter of economic development initiatives across the state last year, according to the Chambers for Innovation and Clean Energy.
Repealing tax credits in the reconciliation bill could also raise electricity costs for North Carolina families by more than $200 each year, Crawford said.
“Congress could choose a commonsense approach that protects local jobs and doesn’t raise costs,” he said.
Thom Kay is the energy transition policy manager at BlueGreen Alliance, a nonprofit that unifies labor unions and environmental organizations to fight climate change.
The group also works towards protecting the health of people in the environment, standing against economic and racial inequality, and developing union jobs across the country.
“By our best estimates, North Carolina has benefitted from more than $30 billion of private investment related to these federal investments and tax credits,” Kay said. “These are already working to strengthen our state’s position as a leader in energy and manufacturing.”
Tillis, who will seek reelection next year, has previously hinted that he could be receptive to some of the advocates’ arguments. Elizabeth Ouzts of Canary Media reported earlier this month that “Tillis is among four Senate Republicans who signed an April letter urging a targeted approach to reforming renewable energy tax incentives rather than a wholesale repeal.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Solar-array-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-18 12:17:55.945819

My parents came to this country from Mexico at a young age with nothing but a dream for a better life. They spoke very little English but their accomplishments are far from that. As a family, we didn’t have much financially, but my parents always made it a priority to provide us the best education they could afford. My story may be one in thousands that are similar, but it’s still just as important as any other. 
When I decided to pursue an education after high school, I knew it would be an uphill battle. With fear and uncertainty about how I would afford a college tuition, an answer to my prayers came to my door. I received a letter from Gateway Community College (now CT State) informing me that I qualify for the PACT (Pledge to Advance Connecticut) program. 
Suddenly all the anxiety and fear I had disappeared. Having the privilege of receiving PACT during community college was truly a blessing. PACT allowed me to participate fully in my education without worrying about how I would afford it. When I graduated from community college and enrolled at Southern Connecticut State University, it felt like a rude awakening. Even with an outstanding GPA and financial aid, my tuition skyrocketed from $0 a year to a daunting $7,000 a semester. All the anxiety and fear that had once been relieved came rushing back. 
Like many students from families with limited financial means, I worked two part-time jobs while balancing a full academic load. I could no longer fully participate in my education the way I once could, forced to work long hours just to afford it. According to research from the Nation Center on Education Statistics (NCES), students who work 25 hours or more per week are less likely than those who don’t work at all, or only work less than 20 hours per week, to complete their bachelor’s degrees within six years. It’s a vicious cycle. Students overwork themselves and take on multiple jobs to pursue a higher education. Even worse, some take a break or withdraw from school entirely because they can not afford it.
Connecticut has ensured access to affordable tuition in community colleges, but why should those who choose to continue their education at four-year state colleges be left behind, overworked and forced to prioritize jobs over education? The current PACT program, now called the Mary Ann Handley Award, only applies to community colleges, and I firmly believe it’s time to extend the program to all Connecticut state colleges. 
The cost of tuition keeps rising and students are burdened with debt more than ever before. According to NBC Connecticut, the Board of Regents approved a 5% increase in tuition and fees for state university and college students, with an average increase of $334 a year in tuition. These rising costs make it increasingly difficult for students, especially those from low-income families, to stay enrolled and focus on their education. 
Expanding the Mary Ann Handley Award makes the statement that a quality, affordable education should not be a privilege– it should be a right. It would give all students the chance to graduate without the crushing weight of loans and empower them to reach their fullest potential.
There’s no denying that public higher education is a powerful tool for social mobility. It unlocks new opportunities, breaks generational cycles of poverty, and helps build a better future for the state of Connecticut. When more students graduate without debt, they are better positioned to give back to their communities and contribute to the economy. For example, CTPost states that more Connecticut born college graduates are staying in state, helping to bolster the state’s workforce. This reinforces the importance of making higher education more accessible and affordable, investing in education is investing in Connecticut’s future. Furthermore, the PACT program simply cannot stand for a “pledge to advance Connecticut” if it fails to aid a great portion of Connecticut that would help advance the state. 
As a first-generation Mexican American student, I am living proof that with the right support, higher education can change lives. I was fortunate to have had access to the PACT program during my time at community college, but too many students are still missing out on this life-changing opportunity. Higher education has improved every aspect of my life. It has opened many doors and inspired me to dream bigger than I ever thought possible.

After the screening, there will be a panel discussion exploring Hamer’s enduring legacy with the film’s producer and Hamer’s niece, Monica Land, and activist and Humanities Council Board Chair Leslie Burl McLemore. Stuart Rockoff, executive director of the MHC, will moderate the discussion. 
“I am really excited to be a part of the screening on the life of Fannie Lou Hamer,” McLemore said. “She was a personal friend of mine, and I remember when I first met Mrs. Hamer back in 1963. We were riding a bus from Cleveland, Mississippi, to Dorchester County, Georgia, to participate in a Citizenship Education Workshop.
“We were talking about our background and what we had been doing in the movement, and Mrs. Hamer, in less than a year,” he continued, “had been evicted from the W.D. Marlow III plantation in Sunflower County. And as she told her story about that eviction, the history of Sunflower County and the history of her family, there were about 25 to 30 of us in the room, and there was not a dry eye in the room. Mrs. Hamer really impacted my life profoundly.” 
Organizers said the event is also a call to action. The Department of Government Efficiency eliminated National Endowment for the Humanities grants. The Humanities Council is turning to the community to help sustain the programming that federal support once made possible. DOGE’s cuts jeopardizes more than 35 grants that the Humanities Council already had awarded for programs like an oral history of former Gov. Kirk Fordice’s time in office, a museum exhibit on Mississippians who fought and died in the Vietnam War, and lectures about the work and legacy of artist Walter Anderson.
Proceeds from Saturday’s screening will directly support the Mississippi Humanities Council’s ongoing work to bring public programs, educational opportunities and cultural initiatives to communities across the state.  
“The Mississippi Humanities Council gave us our first grant and several grants after that to fund our mission to preserve and amplify Aunt Fannie Lou’s voice,” Land, the film’s producer, said. “Without their support, there would be no Fannie Lou Hamer’s America.” 
Premiering on PBS and WORLD Channel in February 2022, “Fannie Lou Hamer’s America” allows the late activist and humanitarian to tell her own story in her own words – spoken and sung – through archival audio and video footage. In December 2022, the film was named “Best TV Feature Documentary Or Mini-Series” by the International Documentary Association and in 2023, it won the “Best Documentary” award by The National Association for Multi-ethnicity in Communications.  
The goal of the film and its website, www.fannielouhamersamerica.com is to teach others about Hamer’s work, accomplishments and legacy, and to serve as a clearinghouse of all things Fannie Lou Hamer. Its K-12 Educational Curriculum, Find Your Voice, features original lesson plans written by educators in the Mississippi Delta, a children’s book, an animated BrainPOP movie and a free STEM program, the Sunflower County Film Academy for high school students in Hamer’s native Mississippi Delta. 
The MHC has funded each element of the curriculum and in March 2022 awarded the project the Preserver of Mississippi Culture Award at their 25th annual gala. 
“Participating in this event is so important to me because of the work the MHC has done to continually support our vision,” Land said. 
Hamer’s educational website will soon feature a digital library and museum.  Doors open at 6:30 p.m. at the Strand Theatre, 717 Clay St., Vicksburg, with the screening at 7 p.m. followed by the panel discussion.

Más de seis docenas de leyes de Connecticut, incluyendo el próximo presupuesto estatal y el paquete de bonos, entrarán en vigor total o parcialmente el 1 de julio.
Las leyes de Connecticut son aprobadas por la Asamblea General durante el periodo de sesiones legislativas de cada año (este año se extendió del 8 de enero al 4 de junio) o en un periodo extraordinario de sesiones. Suelen entrar en vigor el 1 de enero, el 1 de julio o el 1 de octubre.
A continuación, un vistazo a algunas de las docenas de leyes que se implementarán el próximo mes.
Nuevo presupuesto estatal bienal
Sujeto a la firma del Gobernador Ned Lamont, el próximo presupuesto estatal bienal de Connecticut entrará en vigor al comienzo del próximo año fiscal, que es el 1 de julio.
El presupuesto prioriza a la infancia, aumentaría los fondos para agencias de servicios sociales sin fines de lucro dentro de dos años y aumentaría los impuestos a las corporaciones. También reduce drásticamente el apoyo prometido a los proveedores de atención médica que atienden a personas de bajos recursos y se basa en maniobras contables para cumplir con el límite de gasto constitucional del estado.
Lamont elogió el proyecto de ley tras su aprobación.
En los años impares, la Asamblea General aprueba un presupuesto para los dos años fiscales siguientes. En los años pares, los legisladores pueden optar por ajustarlo.
Paquete de bonos de $9.7 mil millones
También pendiente de la firma de Lamont, un paquete de bonos de $9.7 mil millones para financiar la construcción de escuelas, mejoras en el transporte y otros proyectos de capital para los dos próximos años fiscales entrará en vigor el 1 de julio.
El plan de endeudamiento ampliaría la ayuda no educativa para ciudades y pueblos, aumentaría la vivienda asequible y combatiría la falta de vivienda, reforzaría la seguridad en los lugares de culto y apoyaría la construcción y renovación de guarderías.
Recomienda nuevas inversiones de capital en educación superior, incluyendo $5 millones para impulsar la renovación planificada del ‘Gampel Pavilion’ en la Universidad de Connecticut, y un nuevo programa de $60 millones para ayudar a los distritos escolares de primaria y secundaria a financiar proyectos de renovación a pequeña escala.
Requisitos educativos en las escuelas públicas
A partir del año escolar 2025-26, las escuelas públicas de Connecticut deberán añadir dos unidades a su currículo de estudios sociales: historia de los asiático-americanos e isleños del Pacífico, y educación cívica y alfabetización mediática.
La disposición sobre los Estudios Asiático-Americanos e Isleños del Pacífico (AAPI), parte de un proyecto de ley aprobado por los legisladores en 2022, exige que las escuelas enseñen la historia de los asiático-americanos e isleños del Pacífico en el estado, la región y el país, incluyendo las contribuciones de las personas y comunidades AAPI a los avances en las artes, las ciencias, el gobierno, la economía y los derechos civiles de Estados Unidos.
Una ley independiente, aprobada en 2023, exige las clases de educación cívica y alfabetización mediática. La educación cívica se define en el proyecto de ley como “el estudio de los derechos y obligaciones de los ciudadanos”, y la alfabetización mediática abarcará el papel de todos los medios de comunicación en la sociedad y cómo utilizar, evaluar y analizar los medios que una persona consume o crea.
Grabaciones en las urnas de voto en ausencia
A partir del 1 de julio, los municipios deben haber implementado tecnología de grabación de video, con comprobante de fecha y hora, en cada una de sus urnas de voto en ausencia. Se les exigirá que comiencen a registrar las urnas el primer día que se emitan las papeletas de voto en ausencia para una elección o primaria y que continúen haciéndolo hasta que el secretario municipal retire las últimas papeletas.
La ley también exige que las grabaciones se pongan a disposición del público lo antes posible, y a más tardar cinco días después de la última retirada de papeletas por parte del secretario municipal, y que las conserven durante al menos un año.
Los legisladores aprobaron este requisito tras un escándalo de abuso de papeletas de voto en ausencia en Bridgeport, donde un tribunal ordenó la repetición de las primarias demócratas de la ciudad de 2023, tras la aparición de un video de la vicepresidenta del Comité Municipal Demócrata, Wanda Geter-Pataky, en el que aparentemente depositaba múltiples papeletas de voto en ausencia en una urna de Bridgeport.
Cinco personas, entre ellas Geter-Pataky y tres concejales de Bridgeport, han sido acusadas de delitos electorales como parte de una extensa investigación sobre dichas primarias.
Límites a los contratos de libros electrónicos en bibliotecas
Este año, los legisladores aprobaron un proyecto de ley diseñado para abordar los altos costos que las bibliotecas incurren al comprar libros electrónicos y audiolibros, prohibiéndoles firmar contratos con editoriales de libros electrónicos que contengan términos que algunos legisladores consideran restrictivos.
Los contratos de libros electrónicos para bibliotecas suelen incluir cláusulas que obligan a la biblioteca a volver a comprar el libro después de haberlo prestado 26 veces o cada dos años. La ley prohíbe a las bibliotecas contratar con editoriales que impongan restricciones simultáneas al período de préstamo de un libro electrónico y al número de veces que las personas pueden pedirlo prestado.
Aunque la ley entra en vigor el 1 de julio, solo se implementará si uno o más estados con una población total o combinada de 7 millones de habitantes promulgan leyes similares, y exige que el bibliotecario estatal verifique trimestralmente si otros estados han aprobado una ley similar.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children. Tennessee House Republicans are pleased by the court’s courage to stand firm against ideology that denies biological reality. The sterilization and disfigurement of children will no longer be normalized. As we celebrate the precedent set by this decision, we remain committed to leading the nation in safeguarding the health, safety and future of all children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Tomorrow, communities across the country observe Juneteenth — a federal holiday celebrating freedom for all. 
On June 19, 1865, troops arrived in Galveston Texas and announced the end of slavery – more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. It was declared a federal holiday in 2021 by then President Joe Biden. 
State Rep. Earl Harris Jr. and chair of the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus commemorated the holiday while calling on the state for inclusive American education. 
During the 2025 General Assembly lawmakers crafted Senate Enrolled Act 289, banning diversity, equity and inclusion practices in government agencies, including universities. Harris also called out Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith on “shameful whitewashing” of slavery. 
Beckwith posted a statement on X, defending the Three-Fifths Compromise after a debate over the bill on April 24. 
Harris said the IBLC will continue to work to remove blockages and create equal opportunities for all Hoosiers. 
“This starts in the classroom. Teaching our children true American history – the good, the bad and the ugly – will help us ensure that the achievements of African Americans, the horrors we faced and contributions we’re making today will not be forgotten,” he said. “Some of the steps our Republican supermajority took in the most recent session of the Indiana General Assembly actively work against this goal. We should never shy away from our history – the strength of our democracy depends on us confronting our past and working to create a future where all people are extended the promise of America.”
While Juneteenth is a federal holiday, the state does not recognize it. State offices remain open, including the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Most private businesses operate at their own discretion. 
The Federal Reserve will close, meaning most major banks will also close. Online banking and ATMs will remain available. The New York Stock Exchange will close as well. 
The U.S. Postal Service will not deliver mail. However, UPS and FedEx will continue pickup and delivery services. 
Despite a lack of state acknowledgement, communities across Indiana are hosting celebrations to honor Juneteenth including the Indiana State Fairgrounds and Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_2557-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-18 12:17:55.945819

Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, who stepped down from her position in April citing President Donald Trump’s priority of Russia over Ukraine in peace talks after Russia’s invasion, announced Wednesday she’s running for Congress in Michigan.
Brinks, a Michigan native, is running as a Democrat for the state’s 7th Congressional District, which Democrats and Republicans will both be focused on as partisan control of the area has fluctuated in recent years in battleground state Michigan. Currently, Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett of Charlotte is serving his first term in the district. The seat was previously held by Democrat Elissa Slotkin before she won election to the U.S. Senate in 2024.
In an op-ed published by the the Detroit Free Press in May, Brink said despite serving under five presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, in various roles in national security and foreign policy for three decades, it became clear to her from the beginning of the Trump administration that it would pressure Ukraine to work towards peace instead of the “aggressor”, Russia.
“Peace at any price is not peace at all ― it is appeasement. And history has taught us time and again that appeasement does not lead to safety, security or prosperity. It leads to more war and suffering,” Brink said in her op-ed.
In her campaign announcement video, Brink painted a picture of the situation in Ukraine, where more than 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed during Russia’s full-scale invasion, which began in 2022. Brink said her work as ambassador to Ukraine for three years was an exercise in America’s commitment to democracy, and allies like her had the shrapnel lodged in their homes from Russian missiles to prove it.

Brink is the first Democrat to officially throw their hat in the ring for what has the potential to be a competitive race, though there are other key Democrats who could announce a bid, including former House Minority Leader Donna Lasinski (D-Scio Township) and Matt Maasdam, a retired Navy SEAL who once served as a military aide for former President Barack Obama.
In her campaign announcement Brink touted her work in foreign policy, but also expressed pride in her family’s history in Michigan, spanning six generations. 
Brink said in the announcement that both domestically and abroad, Democracy is under attack, from the Trump administration’s approach to Russia to restrictions on abortion rights.
“Appeasing a dictator never has and never will achieve a lasting peace. And it’s just not who we are,” Brink said. “ Because of this after nearly thirty years of service I felt it was my duty to step down so I could speak out. We must stand strong against aggressors, protect democracy, fight for freedom at home and abroad and be on the right side of history.”

About a third of the state’s child deaths and near-deaths were because a youngster accessed dangerous substances, the annual Child Fatality and Near Fatality External Review Panel report showed. 
Despite that, “less than one in four caregivers report using safe storage practices for medication at home,” Kosair for Kids said Wednesday in announcing its education campaign. 
KY urged to do more to protect children from accidental shootings, drug ingestion

To address that, Kosair and its Face It initiative, which works to end child abuse, has a website, video public service announcements and a printable flyer featuring safe storage tips. Those tips include: 

Keep prescriptions and over-the-counter medications up and away, in a locked container or medication safe.  
Ask family and guests if they have medication in their purse or luggage so you can put it away safely while at your home.     
Keep track of the number of pills/strips you have in your medication bottle so you can know how many a child may have ingested.  
Program the Poison Control Center number in your phone and keep it posted on your refrigerator. It is 800-222-1222. 

Dr. Christina Howard, child abuse pediatrician and chief of the Division of Pediatric Forensic Medicine at Kentucky Children’s Hospital, said in a statement that “any opioid that is not taken as directed can have dangerous side effects including overdose.” Overdoses should be treated with Narcan and a 911 call, she said. 
“These tragedies are easily preventable,” Barry Dunn, the president and CEO of Kosair for Kids, said in a statement. “Kosair for Kids is committed to ensuring families have what they need for their children to grow up healthy and safe from harm. That is why we prioritize parent and caregiver education, free tools like lockboxes available to families, and changing simple, everyday habits. We can and must keep harmful substances out of the hands of young children.”

Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman applauded the decision, saying it will “protect our young people from irreparable damage.” Coleman, a Republican, said the Supreme Court’s reasoning also applies to a similar Kentucky law. 
Chris Hartman, executive director of the Fairness Campaign, called the decision “unconscionable” and said the court’s majority had ruled “in favor of discrimination and against best practice medical care for transgender youth.”
“There remain more than two-dozen states and territories where families can access the medical care they need,” Hartman said. “Today’s ruling won’t change that, and it won’t stop families from seeking out this crucial care for their children. Shame on the Supreme Court and state lawmakers, who work to keep transgender kids in their crosshairs for nothing more than political gain.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature enacted the ban on gender affirming care for minors in 2023, over Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld both states’ laws in a combined decision in September 2023. The Supreme Court granted review in only Tennessee’s case. Coleman and 21 other attorneys general filed a brief with the Supreme Court supporting the Tennessee law.  
After Wednesday’s Supreme Court ruling, Coleman issued a statement, saying, “As parents and public officials, we have a responsibility to protect our children from harm. That’s exactly what Kentucky’s General Assembly did with the passage of SB 150, creating a commonsense measure to safeguard minors from life-altering medical procedures.”. 


Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.

By 69 percent to 31 percent, the 239 representative voters at Milton's special Town Meeting passed zoning language that would lay the groundwork for potentially 2,461 new units in the town, complying with the controversial state multi-family housing law.
The post Milton Town Meeting decides to comply with MBTA Communities law  appeared first on CommonWealth[...]","AFTER TWO NIGHTS and nearly six hours of impassioned and sometimes pointed debate, Milton Town Meeting members voted to pass new zoning that would open the door to more multi-family housing and make it compliant with the MBTA Communities housing law. 
By 69 percent to 31 percent, the 239 representative voters passed zoning language through a citizen’s petition that would lay the groundwork for potentially 2,461 new units – 25 percent of the town’s current total – though similar zoning around the country and the broader housing market suggest the final number will be far less over a significant period of time. 
The vote will bring the town into compliance with the law requiring municipalities served by the MBTA system to zone for a district of reasonable size that allows a certain number of multi-family housing units, depending on the town’s size and proximity to different modes of transit. But it hardly puts a button on a zoning fight that Town Meeting members note has “pitted neighbor against neighbor” and spawned several expensive legal disputes. 
Some members attempted to toss, without a full vote, a less dense zoning plan – supported by the planning board and warrant committee – that treats the town as “adjacent” to public transit and zone for 10 percent of total units, despite the state housing office’s assertion that the affluent Boston suburb is a “rapid transit” community served by the quaint and occasionally shambolic Mattapan High-Speed Trolley that extends from the end of the Red Line subway.  
Planning board, select board, and warrant committee members ultimately agreed, to enthusiastic applause, to support a motion to send the 10 percent option back to the planning board for study. Some 93 percent of Town Meeting members voted to do so. 
Town Meeting – a form of local governance used for over 300 years in New England – in Milton involves a group of elected members that vote on behalf of the town’s residents on a wide array of matters including zoning. A gathering of Town Meeting in 2023 approved an MBTA Communities compliant plan for Milton, only for it to be tossed 54 to 46 percent in a referendum in 2024.  
Both Monday and Tuesday nights included familiar airing of grievances against the compliance process, with meeting members decrying the housing office’s rezoning rules as “backward,” “unfair,” “unreasonable,” an edict to just “jam it in” on the potential new units, and a “fast-track for developers” to reshape several areas of the town. 
Proponents of the higher density plan also offered familiar notes of support. Some said it was a responsible move and that increasing housing is “essential” to public health and safety, while others warned “if we don’t do it, the state will do it for us, so let’s do it.” 
“All I’m asking us to do tonight is to support [the 25 percent plan] so that we can comply with the law,” urged Board of Appeals chair Kathleen O’Donnell. “And if in some random fashion we get reclassified in some way or some manner, we can come back to Town Meeting, and do our job, and do a different zoning plan. But let’s comply with the law; let’s do our best to support the common good of the people in our Commonwealth.” 
The Supreme Judicial Court in February determined, after considering a suit brought to force Milton into compliance, that the multi-family housing law is constitutional and enforceable by the broad powers of the attorney general. But the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities had promulgated its regulations incorrectly and must re-do them, the court concluded. Under new emergency regulations, the housing office gave communities that had delayed compliance until mid-July to submit compliant plans. 
Several Milton residents warned that the 25 percent rezoning, which sets out specific rules for requiring up to 10 percent of the rezoned units be affordable, would result in more 40B projects. These are developments that receive a streamlined approval process if at least 20 to 25 percent of the units have affordable housing restrictions. 
Opponents of the higher density plan consistently urged other Town Meeting members to approve the lower density option, await a ruling from a Superior Court judge considering whether the town is truly rapid transit, and reserve the option to rezone with higher density later. 
“Residents of Milton came to Milton, and bought homes in Milton, because they like Milton as it exists, not because they hoped Milton would evolve to become something different,” said planning board member Sean Fahy. “It’s our responsibility to preserve Milton as it exists, to the greatest extent possible. By doing so, we’re honoring the commitment of the many residents that have invested in Milton and that are annually relied upon to support Milton financially by paying their taxes.” 
And that old-timey trolley – the only line of 1930s-era Presidents’ Conference Committee streetcars still in service across the country apart from the system in Philadelphia – remains a point of contention.  
Th trolley is fundamentally different from the subway lines across the MBTA and is therefore not rapid transit, argued Town Meeting member Mark Christo. Only a few hundred board the single-car trolleys at a handful of small stops each day and the entire length is above ground, he said. 
“It has not the ability to support [the housing office’s] most ambitious 25 percent zoning demand,” he said. 
To 25 percent plan proponents, this objection is missing the point.  
“Just as the sun rises in the east and one plus one equals two, the Mattapan line is rapid transit,” said Matthew Morong, who works in transit systems and supports the 25 percent plan. The line’s service “should be better than it is,” he agreed, and “the people of Mattapan, Milton, and Dorchester all deserve better.” But that should not be an impediment to doing what the state asks in terms of rezoning, he said, while also fiercely advocating for the state to support the area by making long-promised improvements to the line. 
Town Meeting member Karen Friedman-Hanna, who championed the citizen’s petition, said that the 25 percent zoning plan she and her fellow residents put forward was the very same one that the planning board agreed in May to send to Town Meeting and later revoked in favor of only submitting the 10 percent plan. Planning board members remain divided. 
The 25 percent plan that the citizens used is information that “the planning board studied, without a doubt,” said planning board chair Meredith Hall. But when the board looked at the impact to Milton Village and along the Eliot Street corridor, she said, “those impacts were what caused us to say ‘You know what, we find this to be too much density,’ and why we reverted and went back to the 10 percent plan.” 
The housing office reiterated this week that the 10 percent plan was not compliant, Friedman-Hanna noted, and elected officials including Town Meeting and the town’s boards are obligated to “comply with the law.” All attempts to modify the classification have failed, she said, and it only has until July 14 to become compliant. 
“This has already cost the town hundreds of thousands of dollars – money which we do not have,” Friedman-Hanna said. “Ongoing frivolous costs because of our noncompliance will wipe out a portion of the benefit that we just received from a huge override that was needed just for basic level funded services. That’s not okay.” 
Town Administrator Nicholas Milano said that the town applied for just over $800,000 in grants and was told it would have received the money if not for its noncompliance. The town’s legal arrangement with Goodwin Procter, for the case that went before the Supreme Judicial Court and ended with a ruling that the law is constitutional if the regulations are put out correctly, cost $275,000. The town attorney has incurred about another $45,000 in MBTA Communities related exposes since then, Milano said.  
On Monday, the Select Board accepted a $250,000 grant from the Municipal Fiber Grant Program that is contingent on being compliant with MBTA Communities law, Milano said. Other recently applied-for state grants targeting infrastructure improvement in East Milton and housing production would also presumably depend on compliance, he said. Milton public school officials also listed an array of grants, from computer science to reading programs, that they are not able to apply for because of noncompliance. 
Even as 10 percent proponents – including most of the planning board and the warrant committee tasked with approving articles for the Town Meetings – argued that the best move is to wait and see if the courts weigh in on classification, the majority of Town Meeting cast a vote to move forward with compliance as the state defines it. 
Town meeting member Douglas Hyne, as the body debated on Tuesday whether to consider the 10 percent plan at all, expressed befuddlement. Since 25 is more than 10, he said, by definition they would be in compliance even if the classification were changed. The voting body could always come back to reconsider a lower density option if a court or the Legislature reclassified Milton, he noted. But this vote would temporarily ensure their compliance, he said. 
“We’re not deciding whether we like this law, we’re not deciding whether or not we’re scared of the ramifications of this law, we’re not deciding whether or not it’s fair. That’s not how this can be decided,” Hyne said during remarks on Monday night. “Because when I decide whether or not to follow the law, I generally ask, ‘Is it the law?’ ‘Yes.’ That’s the end of my inquiry.”

State and city leaders across the country are looking for ways to make rideshares safer but Uber and Lyft have opposed some of the proposals. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)While on her way home from a coworking space in Denver last year, Colorado state Rep. Jenny Willford says she was sexually assaulted by her Lyft driver.
In her lawsuit filed against Lyft in January, Willford alleges she was “subjected to unwelcome, nonconsensual sexual contact, touching” and lewd comments during the ride.
Willford was picked up by a different driver than the person identified in the Lyft app, according to the suit.
Her experience — and those that other survivors shared with her after hearing her story — prompted Willford, a Democrat, to introduce legislation this year that aimed to require safety measures for both riders and drivers using ridesharing apps.
“In my mind, all of these things are very basic when it comes to safety,” Willford said. “They’re just so common sense that it’s been really disheartening and frustrating to me that Uber … threatened to leave the state if the bill becomes law.”
Her bill would have required rideshare companies to conduct more regular background checks for drivers, to create a program for passengers or drivers who want to audio or video record their rides and to develop other safety policies.
But following Uber’s threats to leave the state if the measure passed, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis vetoed it in late May. The bill would jeopardize rideshare services in Colorado “to an untenable degree, and could very well lead to companies that Coloradans rely on exiting the market, raising prices, or reducing the number of drivers,” his veto letter said.
Colorado isn’t alone. State and city leaders across the country are looking for ways to make rideshares safer. But lobbying campaigns from Uber and Lyft in many cases are blocking legislation meant to strengthen protections for both drivers and passengers.
Uber and Lyft, the two companies that dominate the U.S. rideshare industry, argue they have sufficient safety features within their apps.
“At Uber, we put safety at the heart of our operations, using technology, transparency, and accountability to help protect riders, drivers, and the broader community, with robust background checks and safety features like Audio and Video Recording, the Emergency Button, PIN verification, and RideCheck,” Uber wrote in a statement to Stateline.
“We remain committed to this work, and to dialogue with bill sponsors on sensible policies that keep people safe while protecting privacy and access.”
But there’s still a gap in regulations for rideshare companies because of their evolving technologies, said Lorena Roque, the interim director of education, labor and worker justice at The Center for Law and Social Policy, a left-leaning anti-poverty advocacy organization.
“Working on an app-based platform — like with delivery workers and rideshare workers —that sort of work is relatively new, so there’s not a clear standard,” Roque said.
Uber and Lyft are employing lobbyists at the state and local levels. In Rhode Island, another state where legislators are pushing rideshare safety bills that the companies have objected to, Uber is on pace to spend $50,000 this year on lobbyists, according to the state’s lobbying database. Lyft has been spending $5,000 monthly on lobbyists in Rhode Island.
Across the country, Uber and Lyft have testified against measures in state legislative hearings and city council meetings. In Colorado’s case, a number of officials representing Uber spoke out against Willford’s legislation at committee hearings, while Lyft sent a letter to Gov. Polis urging him to veto it. Jerry Golden, Lyft’s chief policy officer, wrote in the letter that the legislation’s requirements “ignore and ultimately will not improve conditions for riders and drivers.”
Uber told the state Senate it would be “impossible” for rideshare companies to comply with the bill’s requirements immediately upon approval and that the  audio and video requirement is “not possible to enforce.”
“The intention of my legislation was never to drive out Uber or Lyft,” Willford said. “The intention was always to require a higher level of accountability and safety from them. But we can’t do that if they’re going to throw tantrums and pick up their toys and go home every time somebody asks them to do better.”
 
Safety for passengers
 


As a part of Lyft’s safety measures, drivers must complete annual background checks and mandatory driver safety education. The app is also programmed to check in with riders when drivers take long stops or deviate from the route they were assigned.
Uber conducts periodic criminal screenings for all active drivers and requires drivers to regularly verify their identity by sharing a selfie with Uber using the app. Both companies offer live emergency assistance to riders.
Between 2020 and 2022, Lyft reported 23 fatal physical assaults of people using the Lyft platform and 2,651 instances of the five most serious categories of sexual assault, according to its 2024 Safety Transparency Report. While incidents of sexual assault had decreased 21% since the last report, which covered 2017-2019, fatal physical assaults jumped by 185%.
Uber saw 36 physical assault fatalities in 2021 and 2022 and 2,717 incidents of the most serious categories of sexual assault, according to the company’s most recent safety report. Despite a 22% decline in sexual assault and misconduct, there was an increase in fatal physical assaults since its 2019-2020 report.
State lawmakers in several states have tried to address rideshare safety concerns with varying degrees of success.
Pending legislation in New Jersey and Massachusetts aims to prevent sexual assault and misconduct against passengers.
The New Jersey measure would require rideshare companies to share information concerning sexual misconduct investigations into a driver and would allow companies to ban drivers during an investigation. It remains in committee.
The bill in Massachusetts, introduced by Democratic state Sen. Rebecca Rausch, would create a specific criminal penalty for the sexual assault of a passenger by a rideshare driver. The bill also would deem any rideshare passenger incapable of consenting to any sexual contact during a ride.  A hearing on the bill took place yesterday.
“We need to be able to make sure that people are safe and that people can trust those kinds of spaces to be safe,” Rausch said.
In May, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation that creates criminal penalties for impersonating a rideshare driver. Starting July 1, the crime counts as a second-degree misdemeanor. Uber supported the legislation.
But in Rhode Island, Lyft is pushing against legislation that would require fingerprinting as part of criminal background check. Brendan Joyce, the Lyft public policy manager, testified against the measure in April, saying the fingerprinting requirement relies on the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information System, which Joyce said has incomplete data. He also asserted that fingerprint checks “disproportionately impact and have potential discriminatory effects on communities of color.” Uber also testified against the proposal.
Rhode Island legislators introduced another measure that would prevent people under the age of 16 from using a rideshare service alone. Both bills are being held for further study.
 Driver protections

JC Muhammad, 57, has been a rideshare driver in and around Chicago since about 2016.
Now, he works full-time as an organizer for faith-based organizations and groups that support rideshare drivers, including The People’s Union, a membership-driven organization aimed at supporting workers in the city.
Muhammad was attacked by a passenger during a Lyft ride in 2022, he said. The passenger asked to borrow Muhammad’s phone and opened its Cash App. The passenger also hit him over the head twice, he said, and threw a brick at his car, denting the side.
“I was angry as hell,” Muhammad said. “I really wanted to engage the kid, but I said, ‘No, let me get back in my car.’”
After sharing the incident with Lyft, the company responded by saying it would not match him with that passenger again. But the person who rode with Muhammad did not match the profile of the person who originally requested the ride, he said.
Muhammad also said he couldn’t go to the police because he did not know the identity of the person who was in his car — and Lyft would not share the identity of the account holder who ordered the Lyft.
Uber and Lyft customers have the option to verify their account, but not everyone does, Muhammad said.
“That gives us some measure of comfort, but it really doesn’t do enough, especially when it comes to calling rides for other people,” Muhammad said. “The account holder may not be the actual passenger.”
Rideshare drivers across the country — especially those of color — are frequently harassed, according to a 2023 report from the Strategic Organizing Center. The center is a coalition of labor unions representing more than 2.5 million workers across the country.
The survey of over 900 app-based rideshare drivers found the majority had been verbally abused and more than a quarter of respondents were threatened with physical harm. Nearly 15% of the drivers were grabbed, groped or hit, according to the report.
There have been several incidents in Chicago where drivers are lured by a false account to a location where they are then robbed or attacked, said Deana Rutherford, the communications manager at the Chicago Gig Alliance, a subset of The People’s Lobby.
“These drivers just show up and they have no idea who’s about to get into their car,” Rutherford said. “And Uber doesn’t know who they are either.”
To address some of the safety and labor issues drivers were facing, the Chicago City Council began considering an ordinance backed by The People’s Lobby that would require passenger verification.
If passed, the ordinance would have also set a minimum wage for drivers, require companies to be more transparent about fares, have them disclose the details of driver account deactivations and more. Both Uber and Lyft initially opposed the ordinance. Uber warned the measure’s sponsor that the changes in pay rates would drive up costs for customers and force the company to cut 10,000 drivers, according to a letter Uber sent to a city alderman that was obtained by Stateline.
But Uber this week agreed to a deal that scraps Chicago’s ordinance in exchange for the company’s support for state legislation that would allow rideshare drivers to unionize, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida International University was the highest performing public university in Florida in 2025 based on the state’s incentivized funding model. 
FIU scored a 96 out of 100 on the performance-based model, which scores on metrics like wages of its graduates, their employment, graduation, and retention rates, and degrees awarded in areas in need.
The school scored a 96 in 2024 and 95 the year before. 
The lowest-scoring school was Florida Gulf Coast University. That school scored a 67, up from 63 a year ago. 
The funding attached to performance was not finalized during the Board of Governors meeting in Boca Raton Wednesday, due to the delayed end of the legislative session. The pot approved by the Legislature provides $350 million to be divided between campuses. 
Last year’s pot contained more than $300 million, with shares ranging from $71 million for the University of Florida to $5.1 million at New College of Florida.


Overall rankings:
2025 score (change from 2024 score)
Florida International University: 96 (No change)
University of Florida: 94 (+2)
Florida State University: 91 (+2)
University of West Florida: 91 (+7)
University of South Florida: 89 (No change)
University of Central Florida: 87 (+2)
Florida A&M University: 83 (+11)
University of North Florida: 81 (+5)
New College of Florida: 80 (+9)
Florida Atlantic University: 76 (-8)
Florida Polytechnic University: 74 (No change)
Florida Gulf Coast University: 67 (+4)


FGCU in September will have to present a student success plan due to it score being below 70. The plan must detail activities taken to improve metrics. This happened last year, too, and makes the school eligible for only 50% of its allocation after it presents the plan. 
FGCU President Aysegul Timur said the school is “laser focused” and she has “a completely new team working on the initiatives.”
Florida Atlantic University is on the “watchlist,” which means its score dropped. 
New College finances
One of the performance-based funding metrics tracks the cost to the student by calculating tuition. 
Board member Eric Silagy suggested updating the metrics, saying some are “layups” and easily attainable. 
Earlier in the meeting, Silagy called for closer attention to how much it costs each university to educate students. 
He has raised concern several times about New College of Florida’s cost to graduate a student. 
According to data the Phoenix received in a public records request from the Board of Governors, based on 2025-2026 estimations, it will cost the institution $555,016 to graduate a student from New College of Florida. The system-wide average is $54,391. The next closest to New College is Florida Polytechnic University at $154,149.
Silagy questioned, without mentioning New College, whether it is justified for the state to pay $450,000 for a student to graduate with a degree that is “arguably lesser of a degree given the status of preeminence” at other universities. 
Since Richard Corcoran started his presidency in 2023, the cost to graduate a student at New College has increased by $165,513, while the system-wide average has increased by $11,656 in the same time, based on the 2025-2026 estimation provided by the BOG. 
The school with the lowest estimated cost-to-the-state per degree in the coming year is University of Central Florida at $31,764. 
New College of Florida has the lowest projected enrollment in the coming year while UCF has the highest.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
Conservative justices lean toward allowing Tennessee’s ban on gender affirming care

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,'” Johnson said in a statement.
How to stay or when to move? Transgender laws force tough choices on Tennessee families

The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.” 
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

(Photo by Tom Werner/Getty Images)North Carolina is one of states with the most improved health care systems, a national research and policy group concluded in a new report.  
North Carolina was the top state among a dozen of its neighbors in the southeast for people receiving the right health care at the right time and being able to avoid hospital stays and emergency department visits by receiving timely care, according to a Commonwealth Fund report released Wednesday. 
The report measured the differences in health and access to health care between low-income people and people with higher incomes. On that measure, North Carolina ranked 10th among the 12 southeastern states and 43rd in the nation. The state ranks slightly below the national average in overall performance, according to the report. 
The Commonwealth Fund releases a report each year ranking states’ health care systems and the health of their residents. This year, it ranked states on 50 measures such as rates of insurance coverage, out of pocket medical expenses, and premature deaths from preventable causes. Most of the data used for this year’s report is from 2023, before Medicaid expansion fully kicked in in North Carolina and provided more than 600,000 low-income adults with health insurance.  
The Affordable Care Act provided both subsidized health insurance and the chance for states to expand Medicaid by enrolling more low-income adults without dependent children in the government insurance plan. 
Since the ACA was enacted, fewer adults report that costs kept them from seeing a doctor. 
The percentage of North Carolina adults who reported that there was a time in the previous 12 months that they didn’t go to the doctor when they needed to because they couldn’t afford it dropped from 18.5% in 2013 to 10.8% in 2023. The national average in 2023, excluding Pennsylvania and Kentucky for which there is no data, was 11.7%.
“Every state saw a reduction in their number of uninsured adults in the last decade,” David Radley, senior scientist at the Commonwealth Fund, said in a video conference call with reporters Tuesday. 
“The coverage gains can largely be attributed to the Affordable Care Act that made Medicaid available to more people and that helped many low- and middle-income people afford the cost of health coverage purchased from federal and state-run health insurance marketplaces. Not only did these provisions help more people get coverage, fewer people skipped getting care that they needed because of its cost,” he said. 
These gains are threatened by proposed federal Medicaid cuts and coming increases to marketplace insurance costs, the report said.  
Congressional Republicans have plans to impose work requirements on Medicaid enrollees as a way to reduce costs. 
In their limited use in other states, Medicaid work requirements did not lead to increased employment. Rather, people who were working lost their health insurance because they had trouble documenting their work hours or because they didn’t know about the need to do it. 
Implementing work requirements will come with substantial administrative costs, said Sara Collins, senior scholar at the Commonwealth Fund. 
“The irony of these changes is that most people who will be impacted are already working,” she said. “The reporting requirements will be the thing that really does lead to people disenrolling and becoming uninsured.”
Additionally, federal measures enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic that reduced premiums for people who purchase insurance through an ACA marketplace are set to expire at the end of the year. Millions of people are expected to drop their insurance coverage because they won’t be able to afford it.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mammogram-Getty-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 11:07:49.610030

This incident is the latest to demonstrate how political and often hate-based violence is becoming a more common part of American politics.
“Let me be absolutely clear: this was an act of targeted political violence, and it was an attack on everything we stand for as a democracy,” U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a June 14 statement. 
The threat of domestic violence and terrorism is high in the United States – especially the danger posed by white power extremists, many of whom believe white people are being “replaced” by people of color.
I am a scholar of political violence and extremism and wrote about these beliefs in a 2021 book, “It Can Happen Here: White Power and the Rising Threat of Genocide in the US.” I think it’s important to understand the lessons that can be learned from events such as the recent Minnesota shootings.
After decades of research on numerous attacks that have left scores dead, we have learned that extremists are almost always part of a pack, not lone wolves. But the myth of the lone wolf shooter remains tenacious, reappearing in media coverage after almost every mass shooting or act of far-right extremist violence. Because this myth misdirects people from the actual causes of extremist violence, it impedes society’s ability to prevent attacks.
 The lone wolf extremist myth is dangerous

FBI Director Christopher Wray said in August 2022 that the nation’s top threat comes from far-right extremist “lone actors” – who, he explained, work alone, instead of “as part of a large group.”
Wray is wrong, and the myth of the lone wolf extremist – the mistaken idea that violent extremists largely act alone – continues to directly inform research, law enforcement and the popular imagination.
I think that Wray’s focus on extremism is much needed and long overdue. However, his line of thinking is dangerous and misleading. By focusing on individuals or small groups, it overlooks broader networks and long-term dangers and so can impede efforts to combat far-right extremist violence – which Wray has singled out as the country’s most lethal domestic threat.
 Not a new trend

Far-right extremists may physically carry out an attack alone or as part of a small group of people, but they are almost always networked and identify with larger groups and causes.
This was true long before the social media age. Take Timothy McVeigh. He is often depicted as the archetypal lone wolf madman who blew up the Oklahoma City Federal Building in 1995.
In fact, McVeigh was part of a pack. He had accomplices and was connected across the far-right extremist landscape.
The same is true of Payton Gendron, who shot and killed 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York, grocery store in 2022, and Patrick Crusius, who killed 23 people in a racist attack targeting Latino shoppers at a Walmart in Texas in 2019.
These two shooters were also characterized in media coverage as lone wolves following their deadly attacks.
“He talked about how he didn’t like school because he didn’t have friends. He would say he was lonely,” a classmate of Gendron said shortly after Gendron carried out the mass shooting.
Both were active on far-right extremist social media platforms and posted manifestos before their attacks. Gendron’s manifesto discusses how he was radicalized on the dark web and inspired to attack after watching videos of Brenton Tarrant’s 2019 massacre of 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.
Almost a quarter of Gendron’s manifesto is directly taken from Tarrant’s, which was titled “The Great Replacement.” This fear of white replacement, centered around perceived white demographic decline, was also a motive for Crusius. His manifesto pays homage to Tarrant, before explaining his attack was “a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”
The lone wolf myth also suggests that extremists are abnormal deviants with anti-social personalities.
After Gendron’s rampage, for example, New York Attorney General Letitia James called him a “sick, demented individual.” Crusius, in turn, was described by the White House and news articles as “evil,” “psychotic” and an “anti-social loner.”
The vast majority of far-right extremists are, in fact, otherwise ordinary men and women. They live in rural areas, suburbs and cities. They are students and working professionals. And they believe their extremist cause is justified. This point was illustrated by the spectrum of participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.
Boelter is a father of five who has worked various jobs in the food industry and with funeral service companies and a security service. While Boelter’s exact motivation and political affiliation are not clear, friends describe him as very religious and conservative. Boelter reportedly told a roommate and friend that he strongly opposes abortion. He has also criticized gay and transgender people during sermons he delivered at a church in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
 Tracing the lone wolf mythology

How did the lone-wolf metaphor come to misinform the public’s view of extremists, and why is it so tenacious?
Part of the answer is linked to white supremacist Louis Beam, who wrote the essay “Leaderless Resistance” in 1983. In it, he called for far-right extremists to act individually or in small groups that couldn’t be traced up a chain of command. According to his lawyer, McVeigh was one of those influenced by Beam’s call.
After Beam formulated this idea, both far-right extremists and law enforcement increasingly used the lone wolf term. In 1998, the FBI even mounted an “Operation Lone Wolf” to investigate a West Coast white supremacist cell.
The 9/11 terrorist attacks further turned U.S. attention to Islamic militant “lone wolves.” A decade later, the term became mainstream.
And so it was not a surprise when, after the Buffalo shooting, New York State Senator James Sanders said, “Although this is probably a lone-wolf incident, this is not the first mass shooting we have seen, and sadly it will not be the last.”
The tenacity of the lone wolf myth has several sources. It’s convenient – evocative and powerful enough to draw and keep people’s attention.
By using this term, which individualizes extremism, law enforcement officials may also depoliticize their work. Instead of focusing on movements like white nationalism that have sympathizers in the various levels of government, from sheriffs to senators, they focus on individuals.
The lone wolf extremist myth diverts from what should be the focus of deterrence efforts: understanding how far-right extremists network, organize and, as the Jan. 6 insurrection showed, build coalitions across diverse groups, especially through the use of social media.
Such understanding provides a basis for developing long-term strategies to prevent extremists like Boelter from carrying out more violent attacks.

(Photo by Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)The brain-dead pregnant woman who became a flashpoint in the national debate over reproductive rights and Georgia’s six-week abortion ban has delivered her baby, her family has announced.
Doctors told the family of 30-year-old mother and nurse Adriana Smith she had no chance of recovery after a series of blood clots in her brain left her brain dead in mid February, when she was about two months pregnant. Smith has been kept on life support since then to support the pregnancy.
The baby, Chance, was delivered Friday by emergency cesarean section and taken to the neonatal intensive care unit. Smith’s mother, April Newkirk, told 11Alive News the child was born prematurely weighing one pound 13 ounces.
Newkirk said she is calling for prayers for her grandson’s safety and health.
“Right now, we don’t know everything, because it’s so early. So they can’t tell everything,” she said. “Prayer changes things. And we just hope and pray that he’s OK.”
Newkirk told 11Alive that her daughter would be taken off life support Tuesday afternoon.
Smith became a flashpoint in the debate over reproductive rights and Georgia’s six-week abortion ban after family told news outlets that doctors told them that while she had no chance of recovery, Smith’s organs would be kept functioning so as not to violate Georgia law.
Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr has said the law does not require such action.
“There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” he said in an earlier statement. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy.’”
Newkirk said she is frustrated that Smith sought care for the blood clots that would go on to take her life. She said her daughter was released from the hospital without proper testing.
“All women should have a choice about their bodies. And I think I want people to know that [Adriana] was a nurse, an RN. The same field that she worked in is the same people who failed her. Can you understand what I’m saying? They didn’t go that extra mile, Not even that extra mile. They didn’t even do a CT scan on her. That would have detected it.”
Newkirk was on hand Sunday along with other family members and supporters gathered for a somber celebration of Smith’s 31st birthday at Park Avenue Baptist Church in Atlanta.
Several dozen people sang happy birthday and released white balloons into the sky. Smith’s mother helped serve slices of pink strawberry cake in the sanctuary as children laughed and shrieked in play behind the pews.
Smith’s family did not speak to the press and did not mention Chance’s birth at the time, but organizers invited members of the media to a rally in the church sanctuary following the private event.
Well-wishers and activists warded away the Georgia heat with “Black Lives Matter” fans as health care and abortion rights advocates spoke in front of an altar stacked with sunflowers and yellow and white roses between pillars of blue and pink birthday balloons.
Among them was Allison Coffman, executive director of the Amplify Georgia Collaborative, a reproductive rights group.
“Adriana Smith did not mean to die. She knew something was wrong, and she went to the hospital, and she was denied care,” Coffman said. “Unfortunately, this is not a unique story. Pregnant people across Georgia are receiving denied, delayed, and distorted care.”

(Kevin Hardy/Stateline)TOPEKA — Kansas farm income in 2025 is expected to be among the strongest in the last 20 years, bolstered by $2 billion in government payments for depressed crop prices and weather conditions, an agricultural economics expert said Tuesday.
“If you look at the inflation-adjusted farm income for 2025, it’s by far the largest we’ve seen in several years,” said Jennifer Ifft, professor and extension specialist in agricultural policy at Kansas State University. “What drove that sharp increase that we see from 2024 to 2025? The answer is government payments.”
Ifft spoke at a webinar about the outlook for farm income in Kansas and nationally, based on a report from the Rural and Farm Finance Policy Analysis Center at the University of Missouri and Kansas State University’s Department of Agricultural Economics.
Crop and livestock farmers face opposite market conditions, as livestock farmers are thriving amid strong demand while crop farmers face lower prices and high input costs, Ifft said. 
“We’ve seen an increase of over $5 billion in livestock receipts since 2020,” she said. “On the crop side, you have seen a decline in crop receipts since 2020. These numbers are very much moving in opposite directions, even though crops have leveled off a little bit.”
Crop receipts fell about $1.6 billion from 2020 to 2025, according to a chart Ifft shared. Data in 2025 is projected. 
“Somebody recently reminded me that there’s never been a year when all farms are doing well, and I think that’s especially true this year, and it’s especially important to look under the hood to understand what’s happening with these numbers,” Ifft said.
Although crop farm expenses have decreased, they are still high compared to previous years, she said.
“In 2015, fertilizer expenses have come down, but they’re still 28% higher than the long-run average,” Ifft said. “Pesticides … have come down in 2025, and they’re still 30% higher than that long-run average.”
The long-run average was determined from fertilizer and pesticide expenses from 2006 to 2024. 
Ifft highlighted government payments made in recent years, including during the first Trump administration after trade tariffs affected sales; in 2020-2021 related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and those approved at the end of 2024 that will be paid this year related to economic losses for some crop farms and disaster payments.

Gregg Ibendahl, K-State associate professor of agricultural economics, shared data that narrowed Kansas numbers down to a farm level, using information collected from farmers who are part of the Kansas Farm Management Association. 
He noted that in 2024, without government payments, about half of Kansas farms in his data would have lost money. 
Ibendahl said the current global situation affects farm income projections. 
“Some other issues to maybe think about or worry about, is what’s going to happen with the oil supply,” he said, adding that there are wars involving two of the biggest areas in the world where oil is produced, Russia and Ukraine, and now the Middle East conflict between Israel and Iran. 
“Surprisingly, though, with the fact that we have two major conflicts going on in two of the major oil-producing areas of the world, oil is still in the $70 range,” Ibendahl said. “I don’t know if the traders are being a little optimistic. They kind of got burned a little bit when the Ukraine war first started, because they had jacked up oil prices into about the $130 range. Turns out that it really didn’t affect Russia’s ability to produce oil.”
If oil prices would escalate quickly, it would affect diesel and fertilizer prices, he said.
 
National outlook
Kansas parallels what is happening across the country. 
“The bottom line at the national level is that we are seeing short- and medium-term pain for field crops because of lower prices, sticky costs,” said Alejandro Plastina, director of the Rural and Farm Finance Policy Analysis Center. “In the cattle sector, I would say the picture is better. There are limited supplies, mostly on beef and cattle production, high prices and lower feed costs than in the past, still high, but lower than the past.”
Plastina said government payments, specifically ad hoc payments made based on need to address situations such as weather events, were important in 2023 and 2024. 
“At the aggregate level, we are projecting higher net farm income in 2025,” he said. “But there’s a lot of uncertainty regarding the impact of tariffs and trades, whether we will have a farm bill this year, reconciliation and what it will look like, and then what’s next? That’s a big question for us.”
Like Ifft, Plastina said government support from 2023 and 2024 being paid out this year will increase net farm income. 
“In the absence of another round of big ad hoc, direct government payments in 2026, which there’s no sign or signal at this point that they might occur —  without those payments, net farm income would decline by 20% in 2026 to be barely above what we have as an estimate for 2024,” he said. 
Of the $41 billion in net farm increase predicted in 2025, $33 billion of it is in government payments, Plastina said. 
“Net farm income is up for one time in 2025 for those who will receive the payments, but managing that cash flow generated in 2025 to cushion the drop in margins going forward, I think will be critical for the ag sector,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-P5200090-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-18 11:07:49.610030

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa House of Representatives Tuesday secured the necessary two-thirds majority on a petition calling for a special session to override the governor’s veto of a bill pertaining to eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines.
Seventy representatives signed the petition in favor of returning to the state Capitol to override the veto on House File 639, but two-thirds of the Senate will also have to sign on for a special session to be called.
House Speaker Pat Grassley called for the petition immediately following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ veto of HF 639, which would have restricted the use of eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines and added a slew of additional requirements for pipelines and the regulator.
South Dakota regulators deny carbon pipeline permit again, but company vows to reapply

“This veto was a major setback for Iowa landowners and the tireless efforts of the House to safeguard property rights,” Grassley said in a press release Tuesday. “With 70 members of the House standing united, we’ve met the constitutional threshold to move forward. We now call on our colleagues in the Senate to join us by securing the necessary signatures so we can convene a special session, override this veto, and deliver the protections Iowa landowners deserve against eminent domain for private gain.”
Members of the House have pushed forward similar bills over the past several years. The 2025 session was the first time the Senate took up the issue, but only after a group of 12 Republican senators said they would not vote on budget bills until HF 639 was debated.
The bill is tied to opposition of the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline which was granted a permit, and the right of eminent domain, by the Iowa Utilities Commission in June 2024. Landowners opposed to the pipeline feel the privately owned project should not have the power of condemnation and fear the impact of the pipeline on their land. The five-state pipeline would also pass through South Dakota, which has twice denied a permit for the project and has passed a law banning eminent domain for carbon pipelines.
The pipeline would connect to biorefineries and transport captured carbon dioxide to underground storage in North Dakota. This would give ethanol facilities and corn farmers access to the ultra-low carbon fuel market, which industry leaders say is needed to fuel the agricultural economy in the state.
The debate on the issue, and HF 639 in particular, has created rifts within the  Republican Party of Iowa, with those in favor of the bill alleging their colleagues, including Reynolds, abandoned GOP values.
Those against the bill said it reached beyond its intended targets and would have caused unintended consequences to agricultural and energy infrastructure in Iowa.
A press release from Iowa House Republicans about the petition said Reynolds’ veto denied “critical protections” against eminent domain, was an “undermining” of years of legislative efforts and represented a “significant setback” for those who have fought for “fair treatment” in carbon capture projects.
House Republicans also urged the Senate to “act swiftly” to meet the petition requirements to call a special session.
Senate Republican leadership did not respond to requests for comment on the latest news, but Sen. Jack Whitver, R-Grimes, said last week the majority of his caucus would “not be interested” in pursuing a special session override.
Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, who was one of the 12 holdouts on the Senate floor for debate on the bill, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Of the 30 representatives who did not sign the petition, 10 were Republicans and 20 were Democrats.

Joseph Gallant—a talented actor, musician, and standout student at Hartford High School—was both humbled and amazed to receive a generous college scholarship. Grateful for his family and the opportunities high school has brought him, he now looks ahead to his next “casting call”: college, nursing school, and a future dedicated to caring for others.
Read the[...]","When Joseph Gallant, a senior at Hartford High School, passed his Licensed Nursing Assistant exam this spring, his LNA course and exam fee were covered by a scholarship from the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation. The foundation also offered a college scholarship, and when some of his teachers and counselors suggested he apply, Joseph decided to go for it. But he wasn’t prepared for the response he received a month later. 
“I was just shocked,” Joseph says. “I didn’t think it was real.”
Joseph received a substantial scholarship that will cover most of his four-year tuition at Colby-Sawyer College, where he’ll enroll this fall to study nursing. The award means that he will have zero debt coming out of college.  
Beth Clay, who has advised Joseph on the college process for the last three years through VSAC’s Talent Search, a program that helps students explore and enroll in career and postsecondary education options, remembers that day well. “When Joseph sent me the screen shot about his scholarship award and asked if it was real, I responded immediately with ‘Of course it is! You’ve worked hard to make this a reality!’ But he was stunned. He actually called the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation to follow up and make sure it wasn’t a typo.”  
“I was sure they had put in an extra zero, or that it was supposed to go to another person. I didn’t believe that it could be mine,” Joseph recalls. “I was just blown away.”
Inspired by his grandparents
Growing up, Joseph always imagined he would go to college—a goal inspired by his maternal grandfather. “My Papa’s biggest thing is education,” says Joseph. “He wasn’t able to go to college himself, but he always believed that college helps you grow as a person and sets you up for a richer life experience, even if you don’t get a job in the field you go for. I also believe that education can carry us forward, whether that’s college or trade school. But having that traditional college experience—I just really wanted that, and I think that started with him.”
While family is the first thing Joseph talks about when he introduces himself—beginning his story with his gratitude for his entire family, from his mom and dad to his two younger siblings to his cousins—his grandparents have been his guiding force. 
“While I always had my mom and dad, I have an especially strong connection with my grandparents. They taught me how to hold myself accountable and how to be a good person, and that set the basis for my connection with others throughout my life.”
Joseph and his siblings lived with their Mimi and Papa in Quechee until Joseph was seven, when they moved to their house in White River Junction. His family still has dinner with Mimi and Papa once a week, and he’s also very close with his paternal grandparents. “Grandpa was a state forester for a long time, and I love spending time in the woods with him. And Grandma, who passed away last year, sparked my passion for music and theater. She was such a big part of my life.”
Joseph’s grandmother took him to frequent performances at Northern Stage in Hartford and made an introduction that kept him going during COVID, when school performances were put on hold. She introduced Joseph to Eric Love, a now-New York City-based actor who was the Associate Artistic Director for Northern Stage. Love and his directorial team had written a play, Stories of White River Junction, based on caricatures of people in town. Joseph and other young actors went out into the community to research their parts and perform the play at several local schools when the worst of the pandemic started to subside. 
Joseph has been in every school play offered at Hartford. He has also acted in local productions of Heathers and Hello Dolly with Trumbull Hall Troupe (a teen and tween theater group), and North Country Community Theatre. 
So many ways to help people
When asked how he became interested in nursing, Joseph explains that also started with family. “I have two aunts who work in the field, and seeing the fulfillment they get from their work, and hearing the stories they tell, really inspired me. The fact that you can go into a situation where someone is having one of the worst days of their life, and bring up their spirits even a little bit, is wonderful.” 
When he was able to enroll in the health sciences program at Hartford Area Career Tech Center, his classes and co-op experiences at the hospital and a nearby nursing home solidified his interest. “I like the flexibility; there are so many avenues to take and so many ways to go. I could travel the country or the world, or stay in one place, and I can help so many different types of people,” he says. 
While Joseph is excited about his future nursing career, he also struggled a bit with the inherent uncertainty of planning one’s future at age 17. He says the advice he received in that area was one of the most helpful things he took away from his participation in the VSAC Talent Search program and his weekly meetings with his Outreach Counselor, Beth Clay. “She assured me that if I ever decide that I don’t want to do nursing, it’s okay to explore other possibilities,” says Joseph. 
Despite his understandable concerns, Joseph’s strong interest in biology—he signed up for AP Bio his sophomore year because he was so excited to take it, he recalls—gave Beth a lot to work with as she helped Joseph turn his interests into a penciled-in path for college and career. 
“Beth helped me figure out what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go, and what I needed to do to set myself up for that. I would have struggled without her.”
Beth recommended Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire, a school with a strong nursing program about 35 minutes away from Joseph’s home. “I actually hadn’t heard of it, but when Beth told me about it, I thought, ‘Wow, this sounds great.’ I don’t usually make decisions emotionally, but when I visited, it just felt right. I remember thinking, ‘This place is great. These people seem awesome. I’d love to be a part of whatever community I can find here.’” 
Winning—and losing—with grace
Joseph has experienced some big wins during his high school career, from the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation scholarship, to a statewide medical math competition at a HOSA Future Health Professionals conference this spring, to countless auditions for plays and musical groups. Joseph has been a part of school concert choirs since the fourth grade, has played the alto saxophone in the school band since the fifth grade, and, in the last year, he joined the high school jazz band for an additional challenge. He especially loved participating in the annual Tri-Town Jazz Night, where the high school bands from Hanover, Lebanon and Hartford all play together.
“I love it all. From festivals to competitions, music has given me opportunities to play and audition both individually and as part of a community. Music is such a great way to connect with others and with yourself. And while it’s exciting to win or get the part, the effort also teaches you how to lose with grace.”

Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, issued a statement Monday calling on people to honor their parents’ legacy by doing “something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.”
The Hortman children are grieving following the Saturday killing of their parents, in what has been called a political assassination. Rep. Melissa Hortman was a longtime Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislator beloved around the Capitol even as she scored major legislative victories.
“We are devastated and heartbroken at the loss of our parents, Melissa and Mark. They were the bright lights at the center of our lives, and we can’t believe they are gone. Their love for us was boundless. We miss them so much,” the release said. “We want everyone to know that we are both safe and with loved ones. We are grateful for the outpouring of love and support we have received, and we appreciate your respect for our family’s privacy as we grieve.”
The Hortman children thanked law enforcement for their efforts, which led to the arrest of suspect Vance Boelter on Sunday night. Boelter also wounded Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, though they are on a path to recovery.
The Hortman children emphasized the legacy that their parents will leave behind.
“Our parents touched so many lives, and they leave behind an incredible legacy of dedication to their community that will live on in us, their friends, their colleagues and co-workers, and every single person who knew and loved them,” the release said.
The Hortmans asked that people do an act of kindness in the memory of their parents’ commitment to service, sharing a list of suggestions.
“The best way to honor our parents’ memory is to do something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.”
They suggested planting a tree, telling a dad joke, and baking something to share — “bread for Mark or a cake for Melissa”.
“Pet a dog,” was on the list “A golden retriever is ideal but any will do.”
The Hortman family’s dog, a golden retriever named Gilbert, was euthanized after he was injured in the shooting. Hortman originally trained him as a service dog before he became a permanent member of the family.
Sophie and Colin Hortman ended the statement with a call to action.
“Hope and resilience are the enemy of fear. Our parents lived their lives with immense dedication to their fellow humans. This tragedy must become a moment for us to come together. Hold your loved ones a little closer. Love your neighbors. Treat each other with kindness and respect.”

Every summer, thousands of Vermonters and visitors gather on the lawn at Shelburne Museum to enjoy world-class music in one of the most iconic outdoor settings in the state.
Last year, for the first time, Waterbury, Vermont-based NOMAD powered the concert series entirely with clean battery energy storage, replacing diesel generators and helping to avoid nearly 4,500 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution.
This year, the Vermont Community Foundation is proud to step in as a key partner to make that impact possible once again. Thanks to philanthropic support from VCF, the 2025 Ben & Jerry’s Concerts on the Green at Shelburne Museum will continue as a fully net-zero event—powered entirely by NOMAD’s battery-based system.
“After two years of devastating flooding across the state, we know that climate resilience isn’t an abstract idea, it’s a daily reality for Vermont communities. Because of our fundholders’ partnership, VCF can step into the space between business, nonprofits, and government to accelerate Vermont-grown innovation and bring these solutions to a broader stage,” said Dan Smith, President & CEO of the Vermont Community Foundation. “NOMAD’s system—developed and deployed right here in Vermont—represents exactly the kind of local innovation the Community Foundation is proud to support.”
For concertgoers, that means the same incredible performances, without the noise, fumes, or carbon impact of traditional power sources. If you’ve been already, you know the scene. If you haven’t, picture families sprawled out on picnic blankets, kids dancing barefoot on the grass, and world-class music filling the air—all powered by silent, clean energy that lets the music take center stage.
“Live concerts require a lot of power and when you’re in a location without access to grid power, that historically required diesel generators,” said Alex Crothers, co-founder of Higher Ground. “Without the right resources, we’re often faced with difficult choices between what’s ideal and what’s feasible. Thanks to the support of the Vermont Community Foundation, we had the ability to choose a better path. This partnership is helping us cut emissions and demonstrate what outdoor concerts can look like.”
The VCF can support initiatives like the net-zero concert series thanks to the generosity and partnership of its fundholders. Each year, more than $70 million is put to work in communities across Vermont through grants, programs, and impact-focused investments—including over $20 million invested in Vermont businesses and organizations advancing renewable energy, affordable housing, and access to healthcare.
“Last year, when we realized we’d delivered 72 hours of clean power—from setup through encore—we wanted to understand the impact,” said Chris McKay, COO of NOMAD. “The numbers were eye-opening: avoiding nearly 4,500 pounds of CO₂, the equivalent of burning more than 2,000 pounds of coal. In just four concerts, we avoided the carbon sequestered by more than 2 acres of forest in a year. It showed us what’s possible when you replace diesel with real, local innovation.”
The 2025 Ben & Jerry’s Concerts on the Green at Shelburne Museum promises something special: world-class performances powered by local innovation and shared values. It’s a celebration of what we can do—together.
We hope to see you on the green.

(Overland Partners) Two Las Vegas residents are asking a Clark County District Court to halt the construction at Campus for Hope, a 20-acre campus backed by the gaming industry and expected to include 900 residential beds for the unhoused or those at risk of being homeless.
The lawsuit was filed Monday by James Root and Matthew Wambolt, who live less than a mile from the proposed development. They believe the campus will negatively affect their “quality of life, safety, and home values.”
“This isn’t about (being) anti-homeless,” Wambolt said during a press conference Tuesday. “This is simply about the state proving to the citizens and the taxpayers in this community that this is the right location for this proposed campus.”
Root and Wambolt are asking the court for an injunction on construction and to mandate “necessary and appropriate studies,” including looking at alternative locations.
The lawsuit was filed one week after Gov. Joe Lombardo signed a bill exempting the Campus for Hope from the oversight and involvement of the State Public Works Division. That bill, which was introduced during the last week of the legislative session, was pitched as a way to expedite the development of a much-needed project. But opponents see it as indicative of a troubling lack of transparency that has defined the project since day one.
Campus of Hope is expected to be located at 6161 W. Charleston Blvd, near Jones Boulevard, on what is currently known as the Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services campus. Expected to cost $200 million to stand up, the project will be funded by $100 million provided by the State of Nevada and $100 million privately fundraised by the Campus for Hope Foundation, a nonprofit that was established for this project and whose board is composed solely of gaming executives.
The lawsuit notes Campus for Hope will be located within two miles of 21 schools and numerous churches.
Along with the Campus for Hope nonprofit, the lawsuit names the State of Nevada, Clark County, the City of Las Vegas, and Las Vegas City Councilman Brian Knudsen as defendants. Knudsen represents the city ward where the campus is planned and participated in what Root described as a “contentious meeting” about the project earlier this year.
 Campus of Opacity

A lack of transparency has been a criticism of the Campus for Hope project from the start. The project’s first public pitch was on the third-to-last day of the 2023 Legislative Session, where a bill to greenlight and commit $100 million in public funds to the project was fast tracked by lawmakers. That bill was sponsored by Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a Democrat from Las Vegas.
Eighteen months later, in December 2024, Yeager and other lawmakers appeared to learn key details about the project for the first time during a meeting of the Interim Finance Committee, which handles money matters in between sessions. The issue only came up because the governor’s office needed IFC’s permission to reallocate funding for a project that was being canceled in favor of the Campus for Hope plan.
During that IFC meeting, several lawmakers raised concerns about the location.
The Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) approved Campus for Hope’s application to access the $100 million in public funds in January 2025.
Vaunted public-private partnership with resort industry has public footing 92% of ongoing costs

No public meeting or disclosure was required, but the Nevada Current reported the details of the application, which included plans for taxpayers to foot 92% of ongoing operational costs and plans to ask the state to deed them the land. (The latter plan appears to have been scrapped in favor of a long-term, $0 lease, which was approved by the state Board of Examiners last month and is up for approval by the IFC on Wednesday.)
The Current in February also reported that a youth behavioral health provider feared they would soon shutter because county and state officials had provided them no details on relocation.
In April, Campus for Hope President Kim Jefferies, Knudsen, and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill spoke with residents at a community meeting about the “transformational comment.” But the outreach, it appears, did not help.
 Campus of Hope responds

“Campus for Hope leadership has met all the state and local requirements for the construction of the facility,” reads an emailed statement provided to the Current by a spokesperson for the project. “We will continue to meet all those requirements, without exception.”
The nonprofit is “a partner to the community,” the statement continued. “We have held meetings, met with local businesses and nonprofits, and will continue to do so.”
Gov. Lombardo, who signed the 2023 bill greenlighting the campus and whose “chief innovation officer” is working on the project, has previously acknowledged the vocal group of residents opposed to the project. During an unrelated press conference last month, he referenced Campus for Hope and said he believed a lot of the “angst” from local residents comes down to “a lack of communication.”
Lombardo and the Campus for Hope spokesperson both noted that the existing mental health campus offers similar services as those planned for Campus for Hope, just not at the same scale.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-12.32.59 PM-1024x570.png,,,2025-06-18 10:02:54.038972

Southern New England, which includes Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, generally gets more total yearly precipitation than Seattle, even though Seattle is famous for its rainy days.
According to the National Weather Service, the mean annual precipitation in Seattle since 1970 was 38.01 inches, as recorded at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. By comparison, the Hartford area’s mean annual precipitation was 47.12 inches, the Boston area’s was 43.03 inches and the Providence area had a mean of 47.93 inches.
While Seattle experiences frequent light rain or drizzle spread out over many days, Connecticut gets heavier rainstorms, summer thunderstorms and winter snow that add to its total. This means that although Seattle has more rainy days, southern New England usually ends up with more overall moisture each year.
While Seattle had roughly 31 inches of precipitation in 2024, the Hartford area alone had nearly 46 inches.

(Photo courtesy WVUE-TV Fox 8)NEW ORLEANS – In the hours after a special investigations unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement led a raid on a construction site for a federally funded New Orleans drainage project, city officials began to sound the alarm that the worksite for one of its critical infrastructure projects had been hit.
On  May 27, agents raided the construction site for the Mirabeau Water Garden — a city stormwater management project in Gentilly, funded by a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that broke ground in late 2023 after years of delays. According to a release from ICE, agents arrested 15 workers at the site who were suspected of being in the country without proper documentation. Conflicting reports from a local immigrants’ rights group, Union Migrante, which monitors ICE actions around the city, placed the arrest count at about two dozen.
According to internal city of New Orleans emails obtained and reviewed by Verite News, shortly after the raid, LaNitrah Hasan, director of the city’s Project Delivery Unit, notified department heads managing major projects that federal immigration agents had arrested more than a dozen people at the site so they could “alert any contractors utilizing undocumented workers” about the raid.
At least one department director took heed. Michael Karam, head of the Department of Parks and Parkways, directed personnel in his department to let contractors know about the raid so that they could “take the appropriate precautions with their employees given that ICE is now actively working in the city and may be targeting other city sites.”
As President Donald Trump and his administration continue to fall short of a campaign promise to deport millions of undocumented immigrants during his second term, ICE has ramped up immigration enforcement efforts with raids at workplaces, a dramatic reversal from the Biden administration, which banned immigration authorities from conducting mass workplace arrests in 2021.
That includes construction sites, where workers of Hispanic and Latinx descent make up roughly 30% of the labor force nationally, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the same week that the drainage project was targeted, ICE agents raided the construction site of a large apartment complex in Tallahassee, Florida, arresting more than 100 workers. Construction experts say arrests that large essentially stall large scale projects.
The Trump administration has signalled that it will pull back — somewhat — on this approach to immigration enforcement. On Thursday, the Trump administration ordered a pause on work site raids for the farming, hospitality and food processing (like meat and seafood packing) industries, the New York Times reported. The order, however, did not mention construction sites. And on Sunday, Trump, speaking via social media, called on ICE to expand its efforts in large Democratically-run cities, though he did not mention New Orleans.
In an emailed statement sent to Verite News last week, city councilmember JP Morrell said he was “disturbed” by ICE’s raid at the Mirabeau Water Garden project.
“Arresting immigrant laborers who are working on crucial infrastructure projects to mitigate flooding is counterproductive, stupid and ridiculous,” Morrell said. “This [Trump Administration] seeks to breed fear in a community that is here to help and New Orleans will always be welcoming to anyone who chooses to call it home.”
The Water Garden, part of the $141 million Gentilly Resilience District, is just one of dozens of city construction projects in progress at the moment, including ongoing road and drainage work citywide through the Joint Infrastructure Recovery Request program — a  $2 billion project funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Contacted about concerns over major projects stalling due to potential future ICE raids, Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s communications staff referred Verite News to an official statement.
“The City of New Orleans is dedicated to keeping the Mirabeau Water Garden project on track and finishing on schedule by the end of this year,” the statement said. “The City will continue to work on projects that impact our community while addressing our changing climate and critical infrastructure needs.”
Hispanic residents of the city and surrounding areas, regardless of immigration status, remain concerned that they will be targeted, said Alejandra Vazquez, a local DJ who plays music and hosts karaoke parties in some of the area’s Latin American restaurants. She said before the start of Trump’s second term, the venues she played in were busy with dining customers, now only a few groups of people stay and eat.
“Every Spanish business here is going bad,” Vazquez said. “People [are] afraid to go to the stores. People [are] afraid to go and eat at the restaurants. They’re afraid to drive. They’re afraid to go and bring the kids to school.”
Vazquez, who is Mexican-American, provides alerts to the Latinx community in the New Orleans metro region through her Facebook page, Explosion Latina NOLA. She said she received calls about the raids minutes after federal immigration agents surrounded the Mirabeau Water Garden project.
ICE declined an interview request from Verite News and did not provide comment in response to questions.
A page on the ICE website about worksite raids says they are meant to reduce unlawful employment, hold employers accountable for hiring undocumented laborers and protect  “employment opportunities for the country’s lawful workforce.”
But, George Carillo, CEO of national think tank the Hispanic Construction Council, said immigrants in construction are adding to a workforce that is experiencing a shortage of roughly half a million workers.
“Across the country we are about 22% behind on [critical infrastructure] projects because we just don’t have the workforce,” Carrillo said in an interview with Verite News on Wednesday. “If we do this mass deportation of our undocumented immigrants, who’s gonna do the work? What happens to the way of life of the American people? … Where do we get our clean drinking water? How do we power our homes?”
Carrillo said targeting immigrant construction workers will cripple the construction industry.
“It doesn’t give the market confidence to want to develop more when it understands that it really does need its immigrant population in order to be able to continue to grow,” he said.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska has launched an online reporting tool to gather information around local and federal law enforcement agencies increasing immigration enforcement actions around the state.
The civil rights group is seeking to monitor Alaska immigration enforcement actions, as the Trump administration has ramped up arrest quotas for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to 3,000 arrests per day, and deployed military forces to Los Angeles earlier this month to quell protests of ICE tactics, arrests and deportations. 
Cindy Woods is a senior immigration law and policy fellow with the ACLU of Alaska, one of the staff members monitoring the report tool, and coordinating legal resources. 
“There’s a lot of really concerning trends in relation to traffic stops and workplace raids and things like that happening in the Lower 48,” Woods said. “And so we both want to make sure that here in Alaska, folks aren’t living in unnecessary fear. But that also we do understand what enforcement is looking like here in Alaska, so that we can provide the most up to date and helpful information about individuals rights.”
The online form is confidential and currently available in English and Spanish, “and we’re working on getting it in other languages as well,” she said. The form asks for details on immigration enforcement actions, where they occurred, what law enforcement agencies were involved and others.
Woods said the ACLU can assist in locating an individual who has been arrested, “for folks who might also have had a loved one picked up and not know where they are,” she said. 
The ACLU is not representing immigration cases, she said, but the organization can connect people to immigration attorneys and legal resources as needed. 
There have been several ICE arrests in Alaska, including in Anchorage and Soldotna, and the Alaska Department of Corrections announced earlier this month the state is holding ICE detainees from out of state. 
Woods said that regardless of immigration status, civil or criminal charges, or where people were arrested — whether in Alaska or out of state — everyone has equal rights to due process, as their cases move through the courts. 
“Noncitizens have equal due process rights to citizens,” she said. “So the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution applies to noncitizens as well, regardless of their immigration status.” 
ICE has not responded to repeated requests for comment about why ICE detainees were transferred to Alaska, or what charges — civil or criminal — are being brought against the men now held at the Anchorage Correctional Complex.
Woods said the ACLU has spoken with several ICE detainees in the custody of the Department of Corrections and their attorneys representing them, and learned that some have no criminal charges, and some have previously been granted asylum. “And so while it’s not clear the criminal histories of each of these individuals, I can say with certainty that some of them do not have criminal histories, and some of them actually have been granted immigration relief by our immigration courts, and yet are still being detained,” she said.
Woods said the ACLU has concerns around the state’s standards of detention for ICE detainees, access to communications with attorneys and family members, translation services, as well as medical care. The ACLU filed a class action lawsuit against the Department of Corrections in May challenging what they say is “inadequate, dangerous and inhumane” health care provided for incarcerated Alaskans, “for medical neglect and just the pretty abysmal medical treatment that folks in DOC custody receive,” Woods said. “And so we’re concerned about that.”
The Department of Law has not filed a response to the lawsuit yet.
The Alaska House Judiciary Committee is holding a fact-finding hearing on June 20 in Anchorage, to be streamed online on the Legislature’s website and on Gavel Alaska, to address many of these concerns. 
On Friday, a spokesperson with the Department of Corrections said DOC is using translation services, but on Monday declined to answer questions on conditions of detention, detainees’ access to communication with families and attorneys, as well as access to medical care, saying they would be addressed at the June 20 hearing.

(Photo provided by the SC Student Loan Corp.)Across the nation, headlines about federal student loan reforms are creating concern among families.
Recently, many parents and students have celebrated high school graduations and are thinking about attending colleges and universities this fall. Meanwhile, parents are worried about how their children will afford this education and repay loans.
While some welcome reform, others are asking: What does this mean for us?
We understand how unsettling these changes can be.
That’s why South Carolina Student Loan Corp.’s leadership has been actively engaging with elected representatives and government officials on Capitol Hill, as well as collaborating with industry experts and student loan lenders nationwide, to stay informed and effectively advocate for borrowers.
While we can’t predict what will happen, history shows that we’re ready to adapt.
For more than 50 years, South Carolina Student Loan Corp. has proudly served as the only lender of education loans based in the state.
In 2010, the U.S. Department of Education made changes to the federal loan program, which included taking the funding of certain loans back in-house. When that occurred, we adapted, and students and families were able to receive much-needed financial aid.
Today, we stand ready to adapt again to minimize disruption to students’ educational journeys.
What sets us apart as a student loan lender is our nonprofit mission and deep roots in South Carolina.
Created by the South Carolina General Assembly in 1973, we were intentionally designed from the start to serve students and families. We see educational lending as a long-term investment in our great state’s future.
Since our inception, we have provided more than 2 million loans to approximately 487,000 students and families, totaling $8.7 billion in student loan assistance. That averages to helping 9,500 South Carolinians each year pursue their education goals.
Because of our commitment to reinvesting our earnings into our products, not corporate profits, we can champion affordable, accessible education for all. That mission-driven difference continues to guide how we serve South Carolina families today in a time of potential federal student lending transition.
Recent challenges at the U.S. Department of Education have also shed light on the student loan system as a whole and present an opportunity for us to understand the system holistically.
Student lenders, like us, work alongside federal programs, stepping in to cover education expenses not fully met by federal aid, scholarships, or other funding sources.
However, we still encourage students to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and take advantage of federal grants and low-interest loan programs in the student’s name.
As lawmakers are considering changes to federal loan programs like Graduate PLUS or Parent PLUS loans, we are prepared to offer loans to help cover tuition, living costs, and other educational expenses to qualified borrowers.
Unlike the PLUS program, we do not charge any loan origination fees, resulting in additional savings to South Carolina families, which can be significant over the lifetime of the loan.
If local lenders become more heavily involved in financial aid processes, there could be a real benefit.
That’s because individual lenders have a deep understanding of their region’s unique educational and economic landscape, allowing them to guide students toward grants, scholarships, and affordable loan options aligned with local job markets.
And as a not-for-profit, South Carolina Student Loan can reinvest its dollars back into loan programs that support our students and strengthen our state with a strong workforce.
As always, our best advice for students is to start the application process in June. That way, no matter what happens, you have a plan.
Remember, loan amounts can always be reduced if needed. Qualifying unlocks your lending options; it’s not a binding commitment.
At South Carolina Student Loan Corp., we know that when we invest in our students, we invest in South Carolina’s future.
So, with so much uncertainty, we encourage our leaders and families to remember that supporting smart, state-driven solutions and investing in our students today builds a brighter, more prosperous South Carolina for generations to come.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SCSLC-Feature-Photo.jpg,,,2025-06-18 10:02:54.038972

However, Rice said those issues could remain on an upward trajectory if the Legislature prioritizes schools.
Only recently has the Legislature begun to address the years of underinvestment in Michigan schools, Rice told members of the state Senate Education Committee Tuesday. But the measures the legislature has enacted like new literacy and dyslexia testing and screening laws and the addition of 1,700 school health and safety professionals have already brought the state closer to the eight goals laid out in Michigan’s Top 10 Strategic Education Plan.
“In the last few years, Michigan has improved in a wide range of areas, some of which are at historic levels,” Rice said. “We certainly have quite a bit of room to continue to improve.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In 2024, Michigan saw a historic high in four-year high school graduation rates at 82.8%, which Rice said has been helped by rigorous secondary school program expansions that among other successes have resulted in the number of students enrolled in career and technical education, or CTE programs, going up 10% in the last three years.
As the state House and Senate will have to collaborate on marrying their separate proposals for K-12 school funding in the creation of the next state budget, Rice thanked the Senate for designating $85 million towards CTE programming in its proposal which he said will help bring programs that dramatically improve post-graduation employment opportunities to districts that need it the most.

The Senate plan also includes increasing the money schools receive per-pupil from $9,608 to $10,008, with half of that increase being mandated to increase teacher pay. 
Rice’s reception by lawmakers in the Democratic-led Senate Education committee Tuesday was far warmer than that of the Republican-led House Oversight Committee earlier this month, where lawmakers grilled Rice on the state’s bottom of the nation fourth grade reading scores.
In order to address the areas in need of improvement in schools, Rice asked senators to consider making Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling, or LETRS, training for reading mandatory for kindergarten through 5th grade teachers across the state. 
Rice is also calling for reducing class sizes in high-poverty areas during the first years of education in order to address learning gaps in communities in need of investment.
“I challenge any of you, and for that matter, any member of the Legislature, you go teach 33 young people in third grade,” Rice said. “Our class sizes are too high in early elementary.”
Addressing the mass flight from the education profession Michigan has seen in the last decade is a top priority in improving the health, safety and success of Michigan schools, Rice said.
A picture is worth a thousand words and the picture previous Governor Rick Snyder painted for the teaching profession shows how critical the state’s situation is, Rice said. In 2011, when Snyder, a Republican and staunch critic of public schools, came into office he signed a state budget that cut per-pupil spending by $470. 
Also, when Snyder came into office there were 23,000 young professionals in Michigan preparing for a career in teaching, Rice said. Five years later, as divestments in schools made teaching a less lucrative career, 9,500 students, less than half, were preparing for the teaching profession.
Chair for the Education Committee, Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia), said she remembers how bad things got in schools during the Snyder administration as a teacher in Southeast Michigan at the time who actually ended their teaching career during the administration to join the Legislature.
Reflecting on all the challenges schools have faced, including learning loss during the pandemic and the history of underinvestment in Michigan students, Rice noted that there is no one metric of struggle or success that defines public education, but rather the goals outlined in Michigan’s Top 10 Strategic Education Plan are working to slowly divert Michigan from the negative trajectory it has been on for too long.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DSC_0593-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 10:02:54.038972

(Getty Images)If the state budget reflects New Hampshire’s values and priorities, the children of our state are in trouble. The current proposed 2025-2026 budget not only does not support our children, it may indeed harm them.  
The proposed budget does more than neglect the needs of vulnerable youth — it actively undermines the very systems designed to protect them. Most troubling among these changes are deep cuts to the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA), a vital safeguard created in 2017 after the tragic deaths of two young children who had been involved with the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF).  
In 2017, through bipartisan legislation, New Hampshire established the OCA to serve as an independent agency responsible for ensuring that the best interests of children in our child-serving systems are protected. Since then, the OCA has served as a confidential, trusted resource for families, providers, legislators, DCYF staff, and citizens to report concerns and demand accountability. It was designed to identify systemic failures before they cost lives. This ensures that critical issues are not overlooked or ignored. 
Now, fewer than 10 years later, we appear to be forgetting the lessons learned, in the hardest possible way.  
The OCA was never meant to be politically expedient — it was meant to be effective. Its core function is to independently review child-serving systems and promote transparency even when that transparency brings difficult issues to light or prompts uncomfortable discussions. The purpose is not to assign blame, but to learn from gaps and drive meaningful, positive change for children. Although honest scrutiny may be difficult, it is essential. Children cannot wait for political comfort. 
In 2023, the OCA uncovered disturbing abuse of New Hampshire children placed by DCYF in a Tennessee residential facility. This should have been a wake-up call to strengthen, not weaken, our child protection infrastructure. One critical policy response was the long-overdue recognition of the right to legal counsel for children in abuse and neglect cases who are at risk of, or placed in, a residential facility.  
Shockingly, New Hampshire is also one of only 13 states that do not guarantee the right to counsel for all children throughout abuse and neglect proceedings; and one of only six states that do not guarantee the right to counsel for children in abuse and neglect proceedings under any circumstances. Children involved in juvenile justice proceedings are granted legal representation. Children in need of services are, too. But children who have been abused or neglected by their parents and then removed from their home and community to a residential facility? The current budget proposal delays their right to counsel — leaving these vulnerable children without the basic protection of legal advocacy at a time when they need it most. 
Worse still, the Legislature is proposing cuts that would cripple the OCA’s ability to do its job. It would lose key positions and face new limitations on access to the information it needs to fulfill its legal responsibilities. And while the Senate has added language requiring the OCA to remain nonpartisan, the appointment of the child advocate is now solely in the governor’s hands — with no requirement for bipartisanship in that decision. Advocating for the best interests of children should not be a partisan issue.  
In just a few short years, New Hampshire seems to have forgotten why the Office of the Child Advocate was established and has backtracked on providing greater protection to our state’s most vulnerable children. The headlines of 2017 weren’t distant history — they were a warning. And while 32 other states have moved toward more robust, independent oversight of child welfare systems, New Hampshire is stepping backward.  
We must ask: What does it say about us that children removed from unsafe homes, placed in out-of-state facilities, or left voiceless in court are deemed less worthy of care than the institutions that failed them? 
The Office of the Child Advocate was created to prevent tragedy. Gutting it now is a decision we will come to regret — because history, when ignored, has a cruel way of repeating itself. 
New Hampshire, we have seen this story before. The tragedies that led to the establishment of the OCA were not that long ago. We were there, we saw the news headlines. Let’s not live through it again.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/youthriskbehaviorsurvey-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 10:02:54.038972

From CalMatters Capitol reporter Jeanne Kuang:
The California Senate voted this week to reverse course on the state’s calls for a constitutional convention, one of which many Democrats supported just two years ago at Gov. Gavin Newsom’s urging. 
With the President Donald Trump administration at the helm and Republicans running Congress, Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, said the state should err on the side of caution by revoking its past seven calls for a session to rewrite the Constitution. 
Congress can convene such a session if 34 states call for one — though it’s never actually happened before. California is one of 28 states with pending calls for a convention on the books, according to the nonpartisan Common Cause, and some Republicans nationally have pushed for one. Constitutional amendments require 38 states to ratify.
As currently written, the Constitution guarantees such bedrock American rights as free speech, equal protection of the laws and birthright citizenship. 

Wiener: “I shudder to think what (the Trump administration) would do to Californians’ basic rights if given the chance to rewrite the Constitution itself. There are no guardrails once a constitutional convention has been triggered … California must do its part to prevent this chaos.”

His resolution to revoke California’s calls passed the Senate on Monday with 27 votes in favor, including one Republican and 15 of the Democrats who previously supported holding a convention. The resolution heads next to the Assembly. If passed, it would rescind the seven pending calls from California, dating back to 1911, to amend the constitution on issues ranging from labor laws to campaign finance.
But to actually rescind the calls, lawmakers will need the support of Newsom — who pushed for the last constitutional rewrite resolution in 2023 as he positioned himself as a national leader on gun control. In 2023 he proposed a constitutional amendment to require a federal minimum age of 21 for firearm purchases, universal background checks, a waiting period between purchasing and receiving a gun and a ban on selling assault weapons. As CalMatters reported last year, those efforts have gone nowhere, with not a single other state having joined the call. 
Newsom’s office did not respond when asked whether he still supports a convention under the current presidential administration and Congress.

Trump calls LA deployment ‘unreviewable’

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals began its hearing Tuesday to determine whether to allow California National Guard troops to stay in L.A. under Trump’s command. In court the federal administration argued that the president, under certain conditions, has the power to commandeer the troops, and that the court does not have the authority to overrule him. One of his lawyers called the president’s deployment “unreviewable” by courts.
Before the proceedings kicked off, Newsom spoke with independent journalist Aaron Parnas, and said that the hearing was essentially “about federalism,” and that if the state is successful in its lawsuit, it “will be a big day in the rule of law.” 

Newsom: “This is about our Constitution. … That’s what ultimately is being tested here, and that’s the theory that Donald Trump can unilaterally decide to militarize the streets of America. Happens to be in L.A. now, will be in your city next.”

This past week California Republican lawmakers made use of the situation in L.A. as an opportunity to slam Democrats on immigration and crime, writes CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu. Stella asked all 29 GOP lawmakers — who are typically opposed to government overreach — whether they supported Trump’s mobilization of troops. Only six replied, all in support of Trump.

Assemblymember Jeff Gonzalez of Coachella: “When you have leaders that don’t step up, someone needs to step up, and that’s what took place.”

Prison guard union makes $600M deal with Newsom

A month after Newsom said he wanted concessions from public employee unions to help balance the state budget, the union representing California prison guards struck a new labor agreement that gives the governor some relief in the short-term, in exchange for some perks down the road.
As CalMatters’ Nigel Duara explains, the labor deal for the California Correctional Peace Officers Association includes a combination of raises and bonuses, such as two, 3% raises that take effect next month and July 2027, and a $10,000 retention bonus for officers at three prisons.
But the contract also saves the state money in some ways. The raise next month will be offset by a personal leave program that is expected to reduce pay by 3% in the coming year. It also defers the state’s contribution toward the health care coverage used in retirement.
In total, the agreement — which still needs legislative approval — is anticipated to cost the state $600 million over the next three years.

But this policy change would place a unique burden on California’s community colleges, which say that fraud represents less than 1% of the billions in aid that go to its students each year.

As of Wednesday morning, Hashmi remained the frontrunner in the contest, with 27.49% of 477,845 votes total. Her closest competitors were former Richmond mayor Levar Stoney, with 26.65%, and Aaron Rouse, a state senator representing Virginia Beach who earned 26.16%.
Jones edges Taylor in Democratic attorney general primary

The election’s razor-thin margins set the stage for a possible recount, because Virginia law allows defeated candidates to request a recount if the margin of victory is 1% or less. Stoney has not conceded, while Rouse admitted the results of the race weren’t “what we’d hoped for” and congratulated Hashmi on her apparent win in a tweet.
“I’m honored to be our Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor,” Hashmi tweeted Tuesday evening. Shortly after, the Democratic Party of Virginia announced that its full slate of statewide candidates had been set, with former state delegate Jay Jones the party’s pick for attorney general and former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger running for governor. 
“With more than 480,000 ballots cast — including a record-breaking number during the early voting period — Virginians have made it clear: they are energized, engaged, and ready to elect Democrats up and down the ballot this November,” DPVA chair Lamont Bagby said in a statement Tuesday night. “With Abigail Spanberger, Ghazala Hashmi, and Jay Jones forming the statewide ticket, and a record-breaking slate of House of Delegates nominees, Democrats are united, focused, and ready to win.”
Hashmi has served in the state legislature for six years and is the Senate Education and Health committee chair and has advocated for progressive priorities including reproductive health care, k-12 public education and affordable housing. She is also a career educator, having served for 30 years as a professor at the University of Richmond and then Reynolds Community College. She immigrated to the United States from India with her mother and has lived in the Richmond area since 1991.

“I consider many of my colleagues across the aisle to be strong allies in the work to improve education outcomes and economic opportunities for the regions that they serve,” Hashmi said in an interview with the Mercury in the days leading up to the primary election, in which she framed herself as the most experienced legislator in the race and “uniquely qualified” to lead as lieutenant governor. 
“Although a few of the issues upon which the General Assembly focuses are partisan in nature, the majority are nonpartisan and impact the lives of families and communities.

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/06/california-glenn-county-hospital-critical-access-closure-medicaid/,"Glenn County's only hospital may be forced to close because a federal agency is removing its ""critical access"" designation. Patients would have longer waits for ambulances and longer drives for emergency care.","In summary
Glenn County’s only hospital may be forced to close because a federal agency is removing its “critical access” designation. Patients would have longer waits for ambulances and longer drives for emergency care.


A debate over roads may cost Glenn County its only emergency room. 
Glenn Medical Center, a 25-bed hospital in the rural agricultural town of Willows, north of Sacramento, is about to lose its “critical access” title. Without it, administrators say the hospital couldn’t afford to stay open because it would lose its increased Medicare reimbursements and regulatory flexibilities.
Glenn Medical Center received a letter in April from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services notifying the hospital that it was no longer in compliance with the distance requirement to qualify as “critical access.” That requirement states that hospitals must be more than a 35-mile drive on primary roads — or a 15-mile drive on mountainous or secondary roads — from the next nearest hospital.
The next closest hospital is Colusa Medical Center, which the federal Medicare and Medicaid agency places at 32 miles south of Glenn Medical Center. That makes Glenn County’s hospital three miles short of the qualifying distance for the critical access title. But local health officials and the Willows Fire Department say ambulances and most patients take the “more reliable” route of I-5 and Highway 20, which makes the distance between the hospitals 35.7 miles — far enough to qualify.
About 40% of Glenn County’s 30,000 residents rely on public health insurance programs — Medicaid and Medicare — and 12% live under the poverty line.
“We treat and see and care for a lot of people who are unseen in the community. A lot of behavioral health crises, a lot of justice-involved folks, a lot of elderly, a lot of people without transportation. And we are truly a lifeline for those folks,” said Lauren Still, chief administrative officer at Glenn Medical Center.

Closing the only hospital in this Sacramento Valley county would mean residents would have to travel farther for emergency care and ambulances would take longer responding to 911 calls.
Dr. Jared Garrison, Glenn County’s health officer, said losing the hospital would be a devastating blow to the community. Garrison worries about the elderly who may be afraid to drive at night and people who don’t have transportation to make it out of the county. Heart attacks, strokes, traumatic injuries and overdoses can become more deadly when hospital treatment is delayed.
“If Glenn Medical Center closes, it’s not just a health crisis — it’s an economic and social crisis,” Garrison said. “We’ll see longer emergency response times, job losses, declining local businesses, and worsening health outcomes for our most vulnerable neighbors.”
‘This is not the road people would take’
Both hospitals, Colusa and Glenn, have been at the same location since their construction decades ago. In 2001, Glenn Medical Center was first approved to participate in the federal Critical Access Hospital Program under the same distance rule. Hospital and county health officials say geographically nothing has changed. 
“We tried to send some emails back and forth and say, ‘Hey, this is not the road people would take. This is not the road the ambulance takes. This is just not accurate,’” Garrison said. The “shorter” route, he explained, actually takes longer because it includes a county road that often floods and is primarily used by farm equipment.
The hospital’s appeals to the federal agency have been unsuccessful. Still said she is clinging to one last hope that U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Richvale Republican, can make the hospital’s case.
Mark Spannagel, chief of staff at LaMalfa’s office, told CalMatters that no resolution has been reached yet, but that conversations with the federal agency continue and that the hospital’s situation is under “heightened review.”
The federal Medicare and Medicaid agency is supposed to review critical access hospitals’ eligibility periodically. This review started last year and the issue seems to be a reclassification of roads, Spannagel said.
The federal agency did not respond to a CalMatters request for comment about why it changed its decision on the roads.

Peggy Wheeler, vice president of policy at the California Hospital Association, said she is aware of four critical access hospitals in California that received a similar letter. Two of them, Bear Valley Community Hospital in Big Bear Lake and George L. Mee Memorial in Monterey County, have since resolved their cases and will be allowed to keep their “critical access” designation. 
A third, Santa Ynez Valley Cottage Hospital in Solvang is also working with the federal agency and considering its options, Wheeler said. The Cottage Health system declined an interview request from CalMatters. 
Wheeler explained that hospitals that lose their “critical access” designation may have to apply for other classifications, such as a “low volume provider” or “sole community hospital,” which also provide enhanced Medicare payments. 
In its letter, the federal agency told Glenn Medical Center that it has until April 23, 2026 to reclassify as another type of hospital to continue participating in the Medicare program.
A financial buffer for ‘critical access’ hospitals
The Clinton administration created the Critical Access Program in 1997 as a way to support rural hospitals. The goal of the program is to make sure that remote areas far from cities have adequate medical care.
“Our hospital was on the brink of closure back in 2001. We got this designation and have kept our doors open for the next 24 years,” said Still at Glenn Medical Center. The hospital is owned by American Advanced Management, the same group that recently purchased and reopened Madera Community Hospital. 
The program gives the hospital a bit of a financial buffer through higher-than-average Medicare reimbursement. Medicare pays critical access hospitals 101% of costs for most inpatient and outpatient services; for comparison, Medicare reimburses most other hospitals 82% of costs, according to the American Hospital Association. 
The designation also allows rural hospitals to stay open even if they don’t meet certain standards required of most other general acute hospitals. For example, Glenn Medical Center does not have a serviceable operating room, and bringing it up to required standards is financially prohibitive, Still said. 
The financial burden of losing its critical access designation would be such that the hospital would likely have to close its inpatient services by next spring, Still said. Outpatient services, such as clinics and labs, would remain open.
Like hospitals across the country, Glenn Medical Center is also bracing for a separate financial blow in the form of potential Medicaid cuts that are currently being debated in Congress. Hospitals could see decreased federal funding and increased costs because of uncompensated care from people who lose their Medicaid coverage. The American Hospital Association has estimated that rural hospitals across the country could lose about $50 billion altogether in federal Medicaid spending by 2034, if President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” were to pass as currently drafted.
Last month, all of California’s Republican House members voted in support of the budget bill, including La Malfa, who represents the area. The Senate is now deliberating on its own version of the bill. 
To raise awareness of the hospital’s looming loss of its critical access status, Glenn Medical Center recently launched a campaign urging residents to write testimonials and letters in support.
Without a local hospital, the county’s two ambulances would have to travel farther, to Enloe Medical Center in Chico, about 36 miles north. Garrison explained that ambulances would probably choose Enloe over Colusa Medical Center because it is the larger of the two and has a trauma center.
The vast central-north region between Mendocino and Plumas National Forests is already down a hospital after Adventist’s Feather River Hospital was damaged in the 2018 Camp Fire and did not reopen. 
If ambulances have to drive 45 minutes out of the county instead of the five to ten minutes to their local hospital, that will affect the ability of Emergency Medical Services to respond to 911 calls, Garrison said. 
“I was talking to an administrator at Enloe and they estimated that this could increase their wait times by up to two hours,” Garrison said.

California Republicans who agreed to speak with CalMatters endorse President Donald Trump’s military deployment in Los Angeles as necessary to save the state from its Democratic leadership. 


When is it OK for a president to use military forces on civilians in a state over the objections of their governor?
When that governor is Gavin Newsom, California Republican leaders say.
In a rare move, President Donald Trump overrode Newsom and local leaders in sending 4,000 National Guard members and 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against the president’s immigration enforcement. 
California is challenging Trump’s order in federal court. While the president argues that he has the sole authority to deploy the military, legal scholars and judges have warned that the move risks intruding upon state sovereignty and tilting the constitutional balance of power between the federal and state governments.
But most California Republican lawmakers, who have vehemently opposed “government overreach,” would not say where they stand on Trump’s military intervention in Los Angeles. 
CalMatters asked all 29 Republican lawmakers in the state Legislature whether they support Trump’s troop deployment. Only six answered, and all sided with Trump. 
The Democrats had it coming, those lawmakers argued, because their lenient immigration and crime policies — including a 2017 state “sanctuary” law that limits local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents — forced Trump’s hand. 
“It is the root cause of the rioting and violence that we are witnessing this year,” state Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil of Modesto said of the sanctuary law in a video last week.
State Republicans also seized on sporadic violent clashes, captured in viral videos on social media, as proof of Newsom and other Democrats’ failure to rein in violence. The GOP lawmakers argued that’s why Trump had to step in, even though local police had said they did not need help from federal troops.
“What do you do when you have a governor who’s not leading (and) is not doing anything about unrest and violence in his own state?” said Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher of Chico.

But would the Republican lawmakers say the same if a Democratic president descended the military upon a red state over the head of its governor? Some said yes as others bit their tongues, arguing it should be judged on a case-by-case basis and refusing to entertain hypotheticals.
“It depends on the situation,” Gallagher told CalMatters. “What are the times when you can and when you can’t? That’s what the court’s going to decide.”
It’s no surprise that state Republicans are using the opportunity to slam Democrats on immigration and crime: Those strategies have worked for the minority party in the past. It’s also a chance for them to demonstrate their loyalty to Trump, who wields a definitive influence over the party. 
But it is particularly worrisome when Republicans are aligned with Trump in a move to override state authority, which tears at the fabric of the U.S. Constitution, said Eric Schickler, political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
“If you think about what the framers were worried about when they created the Constitution, it’s exactly this kind of dynamic,” he said. “It’s not an exaggeration to say the nature of the U.S. political system has changed. And it’s changed not just because of Trump’s force of will as an individual, but it’s changed because members of his party, when he’s asserted authority, have sided with him consistently.”
That alignment could cost Republicans in 2026, said Mike Madrid, a longtime GOP strategist and a vocal critic of Trump. Polling in recent weeks has shown that Trump’s immigration policies and military deployment in Los Angeles are growingly unpopular among Americans. 
“I don’t think people are seeing this as an immigration issue anymore. They are seeing it the way the governor has framed this, which is a constitutional issue, a federal overreach issue, a due process issue,” Madrid said. “That puts Republicans on very troubling ground.”
California GOP lawmakers: Trump ‘stepped up’
While Trump’s executive order told the troops to guard federal personnel and properties, he and his administration have also repeatedly suggested that the troops are there to crack down. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem last week even said the military was there to “liberate the city from the socialists.” 
The military presence has stoked fear among legal experts and some law enforcement officials, who argue there is no legal standing for Trump’s use of authority. Unleashing military forces on domestic protesters can also have a chilling effect, risk escalating the situation further and create confusion among civilians, they said. 
CalMatters also reached out to U.S. Reps. David Valadao, Young Kim and Ken Calvert, three Republicans who will likely face fierce challenges from Democrats in 2026. None of them responded.
While acknowledging California’s sovereignty, some state Republican lawmakers told CalMatters Trump needed to intervene due to what they perceived as a lack of leadership from Newsom. They cited videos of brick-throwing, Molotov-cocktail-tossing protesters and made unsubstantiated claims that paid agitators stoked violence among protesters — a claim Trump has made.
Assemblymember Jeff Gonzalez, a Coachella Republican and the only incumbent lawmaker who is a retired Marine, initially would not say if the scale of the Los Angeles protests warranted federal intervention, stating he did not have the “confidential intelligence” to weigh in. He also did not commit to supporting the same actions if they came from another president, arguing each situation is different.

But when a CalMatters reporter pushed for comments, Gonzalez pointed to videos of violence as justification for Trump’s deployment.
“When you have leaders that don’t step up, someone needs to step up, and that’s what took place,” he said.
State Sen. Steven Choi of Irvine told CalMatters that while he supports states’ rights, when immigration agents face violence or interference, “it is appropriate for federal authorities to protect both those agents and federal properties.”
Sen. Tony Strickland, a former mayor of Huntington Beach, said there is precedent for federalizing the California National Guard to quell domestic riots, referencing the 1992 turmoil in Los Angeles over the acquittal of police officers who killed Black activist Rodney King.
But in that example, then-President George H.W. Bush deployed troops at the request of then-Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and then-Democratic Mayor Tom Bradley. The riots were also far more violent, resulting in 63 deaths. 
Strickland argued that deaths have been avoided in Los Angeles only because Trump sent in the military, echoing the president’s assertion that the city otherwise would have burned to the ground.
“Do you wait till 63 people die before you call them in?” Strickland said.
Blaming California’s sanctuary law
The Republicans argued that Trump’s use of military force was necessary because of California’s 2017 sanctuary state law, which has been upheld in federal court. 
Their logic goes like this: Had California police been more cooperative with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, federal agents wouldn’t have had to arrest immigrants in the streets, Californians wouldn’t have been so riled and Trump wouldn’t have had to deploy troops to protect those agents.
Under current law, local law enforcement can choose to alert federal immigration authorities about an upcoming release of an inmate if they are convicted of violent felonies. Senate Republican Leader Brian Jones, of San Diego, failed this year to push through a measure that would have made the cooperation mandatory.

It is California’s lack of cooperation that forced federal immigration agents to hunt down “violent criminals” in public, Jones argued. He dismissed arrests, such as that of a 4-year-old girl on life-saving medication in Bakersfield, as “collateral.”
“When the federal agents are having to go into neighborhoods and find these violent felons to capture and report and prosecute … there are going to be collateral arrests in that, and that’s the state that Gov. Newsom and the Democratic leadership have created,” Jones told CalMatters.
Assemblymember Tom Lackey, a Palmdale Republican who served in the California Highway Patrol for 28 years, said the sanctuary law “created all of this fear and chaos.”
“What we are seeing now is a situation where the supermajority has limited tools to manage immigration; creating a communication breakdown between local and federal law enforcement, and a vacuum that invites a heavier hand from Washington,” he said in a statement.
But Madrid said blaming the tension all on the state’s sanctuary law is an “extraordinarily weak” argument.
“If that were the case, this would have been a situation long before,” he said. “It is consciously deceptive in telling a very, very small part of the problem.”
While Madrid called the state’s sanctuary law a “patchwork” policy, he argued immigration is an issue entirely “on the doorstep of the federal government.” The Trump administration has missed opportunities to rein in the border, Madrid argued, noting Trump last year helped kill a bipartisan legislative deal over border security. 
“What California has decided to do is to say: ‘Fine, if you are not going to control border security and … leave us as the largest border state in the country to deal with it, we are going to accommodate it. We are going to ingratiate people into the fabric of our culture, our politics and our economy,’” he said.
Could support for troops cost Republicans?
Aligning with Trump has its perks. The president — the face of a growingly populist party — can galvanize Republican voters and help legislators cement their conservative base. Even as the president’s approval rating slips among Americans, Republican voters continue to show strong support for him. 
But Republicans could lose ground, especially among Latino voters, over Trump’s fierce crackdown on immigration and the protests, Madrid predicted. 
While Latinos flocked toward Trump in 2024 despite the president’s promise of mass deportation, that threat is no longer “abstract” but “existential,” Madrid said. Moreover, more Americans are alarmed by Trump’s use of the military on its own people, he said.
“He so overplayed his hand on immigration crackdowns that it’s now about overreach and not about border security,” Madrid said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061425-No-Kings-Trump-Marines-REUTERS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-18 09:00:06.178198
,California,2025-06-18 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Lawsuit says federal government discriminates by funding Hispanic-serving colleges,Denise Amos,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/06/hispanic-serving-institutions-inland-empire/,The group whose lawsuit resulted in the US Supreme Court striking down affirmative action in college admissions is behind this challenge which could affect dozens of California colleges.,"In summary
The group whose lawsuit resulted in the US Supreme Court striking down affirmative action in college admissions is behind this challenge which could affect dozens of California colleges.


A lawsuit recently filed in Tennessee could affect colleges that serve large numbers of Latino students in the Inland Empire and throughout California.
Students for Fair Admissions, the national group whose lawsuit resulted in the US Supreme Court striking down affirmative action in college admissions, has joined a lawsuit recently filed by Tennessee’s attorney general against the U.S Department of Education.
The lawsuit says the education department’s special funding for programs targeting “Hispanic-Serving Institutions” is discriminatory and unconstitutional.  
Hispanic-Serving Institutions are colleges and universities where 25% or more undergraduates are Latino and a large share of the students are low income. The program is designed to help colleges and universities attract and support Latinos and other disadvantaged students. 
National studies show Latinos are more likely than non-Hispanic white people to be first-generation college students and to face financial, linguistic, and cultural barriers to higher education.
The Hispanic serving program has grown exponentially since federal laws created it in 1992.  The education department in 2023 spent $418.8 million on grants and assistance to colleges that qualified. They used the money for labs, libraries, tutors, student service programs, scholarships, fellowships, remote learning and other things. Special grants also support Latino students majoring in science, technology, engineering and math fields.
California has the most Hispanic-serving colleges — 171 of the 615 in the United States — including most Cal State and University of California campuses. About nine in 10 Latino students in California attend Hispanic-serving institutions.
Most of the Inland Empire’s colleges and community colleges are Hispanic-serving, including Cal State San Bernardino, which reported 72% of its undergraduates are Latino, and Riverside Community College, where 68% of its students are Latino.
Taken together, Riverside’s three community college campuses are the largest Hispanic-serving institution, with more than 59,000 students, said Wolde-Ab Isaac, chancellor of the community college district. The federal government sends it $3 million to $4 million a year through the Hispanic-serving program, but that’s only about 1% of its more than $300 million budget. 
Without it, the district would find a way to still provide the same services, he said, because that is part of the college’s mission.
“We are serving the underserved. Our populations are educationally and economically underserved,” Isaac said. “This is a system failure … We have a category of our people that have been deprived over many years of neglect, creating generational gaps, both in terms of economic inequalities, social inequalities, health disparities.” 
Targeting funding to colleges that provide them with extra support and services is fair, he said. 
The Inland Empire is one of the few regions in California where high school enrollments and graduating classes are increasing, he added, but the region also has some of the lowest college-going and college graduation rates in the state.
“We have the most dynamic, the most diverse, the most vibrant population of any (college) and we have a much bigger share of poverty in our areas,” he said. “We have so many young kids compared to any place else and yet those opportunities are not there to help them unlock those talents.”
Hispanic-serving institutions operate in 30 states.  Tennessee is suing because none of its colleges has that designation. The lawsuit notes that Tennessee’s colleges have enrolled Latino students, but they fall beneath the 25% threshold. 
“To be sure, all Tennessee colleges and universities serve Hispanic students,” the suit states. “They also serve needy, low-income students of all ethnicities. But under the statute, they get no HSI money because they lack enough members of one particular ethnic group. So all students at these schools suffer.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/042224_Inland-Empire-JAH_CM_15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-18 09:00:06.178198

Previously, the proposal — spearheaded by Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee — would have allowed for about 1.9 million acres of land in the Beehive State to be sold. Now, an amended version of the bill would allow for nearly 18.7 million acres in Utah to be eligible for sale, according to an analysis from The Wilderness Society.  
A spokesperson for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources confirmed the amendments.

The bill still has a cap on how much can ultimately be sold. The U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management would each be required to select between 0.5% to 0.75% of the land they manage in 11 Western states — that totals out to roughly 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres. 
The bill states that the land would be used for housing, directing the secretaries to prioritize nominating parcels that have access to existing infrastructure, are next to developed areas, or are “suitable for residential housing.”
The initial version of the bill identified land that was off-limits, which included anything with a federal designation like national parks, national monuments, wilderness areas or national recreation areas. It also exempted land with a “valid existing right,” defined in the bill as a mining claim, oil and gas lease, or a grazing permit. 
But a grazing permit is not considered a “valid existing right,” experts say — so over the weekend, the definition was stripped from the bill, which opens up land used for grazing for potential sale. 
“It effectively doubled the acreage that could be on the table for sale. That has serious ramifications in Utah,” said Michael Carroll, who directs the Bureau of Land Management program for The Wilderness Society. “Ranchers and recreation communities are really going to be the big losers of this legislation.”

According to an analysis from The Wilderness Society, about 120 million acres in 11 states were eligible for disposal in the initial version — now, more than 258 million acres are eligible. 
Consider this Utah-specific breakdown: 

In the original bill, about 873,600 acres of U.S. Forest Service land and more than 1 million acres of Bureau of Land Management land was eligible. That’s roughly 1.9 million acres total. 
Now, about 6 million acres of U.S. Forest Service land and 12.6 million acres of Bureau of Land Management land are eligible. That’s about 18.7 million acres total.


Among the land in Utah that meets the definition in the bill are Forest Service parcels along the Wasatch Front in Big Cottonwood, Little Cottonwood, Millcreek, Parleys, American Fork, Emigration, City Creek and Provo canyons; swaths of land in the Uinta, Wasatch, Bear River, La Sal, Tushar and Henry mountains; large stretches of Bureau of Land Management land along the Colorado and Green rivers; a huge chunk of Dixie National Forest and the San Rafael Swell; and Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service land that borders all five of Utah’s national parks. 
Plus, if the Trump administration or Congress moves to rescind Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, that could make millions more acres eligible. 
Lee’s proposal is part of the 10 Senate bills that will make up Republicans’ reconciliation package nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill.” The senior Utah senator has long advocated for using federal land as a possible solution to the housing crisis. Nearly 63% of the state is owned and managed by the federal government and in a video address last week, Lee said his proposal would let communities surrounded by federal land manage growth.  
“We’re opening underused federal land to expand housing, support local development and get Washington, D.C. out of the way for communities that are just trying to grow,” Lee said in a video address. “We’re talking about isolated parcels that are difficult to manage, that are better suited for housing and infrastructure. To our hunters, anglers and sportsmen, you will not lose access to the lands you love. Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands.” 
Environmental advocates don’t buy that explanation. Laura Peterson, a staff attorney for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said that while the bill’s intention is housing, there’s really no mandate. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“That’s only what’s given priority consideration. That’s not a requirement for lands to be sold,” she said on Tuesday. “They’re talking about infrastructure to support local housing, but that’s undefined. One could interpret that to mean pretty much anything. Is that a shopping mall? Maybe. Why not?” 
Here’s a breakdown of what else is proposed in the bill, and some of the changes made over the weekend:

Eleven states — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming — are eligible. Montana is exempt. 
Before disposing of land, the secretary of either the U.S. Department of Interior, or Agriculture, should consult with state and local governments, and tribes. 
Each nomination would require a description of how the land will address housing needs or “infrastructure to support local housing needs.” 
Land that’s nominated by a local government, is next to existing developments, has access to infrastructure and is suitable for residential housing would be prioritized. The bill previously prioritized land that would reduce checkerboard land patterns or isolated tracts that are difficult to manage, but that was cut. 
The bill previously stated that the land would be sold for fair market value, but that was also axed over the weekend.

Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, will face Democratic candidate Ryan Cagle, a progressive faith leader and community organizer, in a special election on Tuesday to fill a seat vacated by former Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Reed, R-Jasper, who stepped down at the beginning of the year to join Gov. Kay Ivey’s administration as Senior Advisor to Workforce Transformation.

Woods in a phone interview Monday described his run for the Senate seat as a “natural progression of (his) public service,” pointing to his commitment to continuing the “strong conservative leadership” and “conservative values,” he said, that have defined the district for years. He cited the passage of the “Alabama Child Protection Act,” a bill he sponsored making it illegal for anyone to create, share, or possess child sexual abuse material, and carrying the “Parents Right to Know Act” in the House, which required schools to post classroom curricula online.
The representative also pointed to his votes in favor of grocery tax cuts and eliminating sales tax on feminine and baby products.
“I will continue to look for ways to provide tax relief for the people of the state while fighting for more jobs and more resources for rural Alabama,” he said.
Cagle said that the state’s policy should better support the community, saying that his decision to run stems from a desire for “proper representation in Montgomery of working-class and vulnerable people in District 5.” Cagle criticized current elected officials for not being “on the ground” and directly addressing issues like poverty and the opioid crisis. He also criticized the influence of lobbyists and big corporations on state leadership, saying that many have been “bought and sold.”
“The system’s not set up for working-class people to run. It privileges wealthy, affluent people in our communities to lead us,” he said, adding that he wants to bring a voice that “reflects the majority of the people’s lives and lived experiences in our district.”
Cagle said that dissatisfaction with the status quo goes beyond party lines, claiming that even Republicans in the district are considering voting for him due to his community work. He said that ongoing problems such as rising poverty, hunger and opioid overdoses stem from electing similar individuals, regardless of their political affiliation.
“I hope that my campaign, if anything else, can be a seed for us beginning to think more critically in District 5, beyond these party lines, and looking toward how we as a community, as a district, can come together and work together and put our people first,” Cagle said.
Woods said he would not “be sitting still (on) day one.” If elected, he plans to re-introduce bills to increase the criminal penalties for making violent threats, such as a bomb threat, to schools, and a bill aimed at expanding broadband internet resources in underserved areas. The legislation would remove state sales tax on broadband equipment funded by federal grants to allow more of the grant money to be used for infrastructure development.
Woods did not answer how he would propose handling federal budget cuts being floated by Congress, which could cut an estimated $5.54 billion in federal funding to Alabama for SNAP and Medicaid over 10 years in the House proposal, but said his priority is on rural health care and providing access to medical care in underserved areas. Regarding potential changes to the Department of Education, such as a proposal to eliminate it, Woods said he believes that the state would be able to provide a “common-sense Alabama-based education.”
Cagle called for “reprioritizing what we want for the state and what we want the community.” He said he opposes cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP, but also argued that the state can make up the difference with resources he said are often mismanaged, saying that a majority of the land in Alabama is owned by “a handful of people,” preventing potential tax revenue. He was also critical of the “CHOOSE Act,” which expands funding for private schools and homeschooling, arguing it’s a “poor stewardship of our money and resources” that primarily benefits “wealthy, affluent Alabamians” and underfunds public schools.
Considering Republicans’ supermajority in the Senate, Cagle said that if elected he would engage in “bridge building.” He said that he would draw from his experience organizing, saying that “the work of caring for our community has transcended those boundaries.”
“This is the first battle of many. It’s time for change,” Cagle said.

Emboldened by that display of fundraising prowess, the 40-year-old Orlando Democrat is now announcing his bid for the U.S. Senate in 2026, in a race that he surmises may require raising up to $100 million to compete against Republican Ashley Moody.
In addition to the challenge of raising that prodigious amount for his own candidacy, he is asserting that he intends to help Democratic congressional candidates financially throughout the state next year.
“We built what I believe is the strongest fundraising infrastructure in the country right now during our last campaign,” Weil told the Phoenix earlier this week in a video conference call. “I believe that we have the opportunity and the ability to raise a lot of money, and that’s what Florida needs. That’s what the Florida Democratic Party needs. Someone can take that money and invest across the state.”
Weil has been floating that idea recently. In an appearance in Clearwater last month, he said his team is poised to raise $10 million for voter registration efforts in Florida leading up to the 2026 election, with an emphasis on Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties.
Weil (as well as fellow special election Democratic candidate Gay Valimont, who ran and lost in the Panhandle in April) benefitted by being one of the few candidates running during the first months of Donald Trump’s second presidency.
Those contests gave Democratic voters across the nation an opportunity to voice their opposition to Trump by contributing to those two special elections — which would have allowed the Democrats to chip away at the then razor-thin GOP majority in Congress. Campaign finance records showed that the vast majority of financial contributions that Weil received came from outside of the Sunshine State.
Additional skepticism resides in the fact that previous Florida Democratic Senate candidates made bold assertions of fundraising for voter registration efforts that failed to occur.
Voters concerns
Weil is a single father of two boys who had been working as a public school teacher in Osceola County before he filed to run in Florida’s 6th Congressional District special election late last year. An election was necessary after President Trump tapped the GOP incumbent there, Mike Waltz, to serve as National Security Adviser. (Waltz left that position earlier this year, and was nominated by the president on May 1 to become the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, though he hasn’t come up for a Senate confirmation vote yet).
Weil previously had been a candidate for a brief time for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in 2022 before dropping out.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXWhen asked what he had learned in this spring’s congressional election, Weil said it was what the voters told him was what was on their minds. As a public school instructor, he said, he intended to make public education a central plank of his platform, but learned quickly that Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and veteran’s benefits  were top of mind of District 6 voters.
“They were far more concerned about how they’re going to continue to survive in a Florida that’s become increasingly unaffordable with housing challenges and insurance challenges,” he said.
Weil has been touring the state before Democratic voters even though he’s only now entering the Senate race. The issue of affordability is something he hears all the time from the public. “There’s people in every corner of Florida who are struggling to survive,” he said.
When asked where he stands on immigration, Weil calls it “an incredibly complicated issue” that touches on border security, law enforcement, agriculture, labor, and tourism.
“There are cascading effects to immigration which make it one of the most difficult to deal with — and it’s why, as you mentioned, we’ve seen people really struggle with this in the Senate, because there are so many variables to try to control for it to ensure that you’re not doing more damage in one area than you are relief in another,” he said, labeling the Trump administration’s goal for mass deportations “sheer recklessness.”
Weil blasted some of the actions from ICE that have been reported in recent month, “where people are being dragged out of schools and churches and workplaces. Where people are seeing their neighbors being dragged off by plain-clothed officers,” he said.
Democratic ‘messaging’ a problem?
When asked about the polling from last year’s general election that showed immigration and the economy as the two top issues that led voters to support the GOP, Weil blamed “messaging” more than the  policies of his party for that outcome.
“I’m not going to be the first person to say that the Democratic Party has struggled with its messaging in recent years,” he said. “Immigration and the economy are definitely areas that we struggle to get our message out in recent cycles.”
He quickly added that he thought President Joe Biden “did some amazing things,” specifically referring to the billions of dollars to expand access to clean drinking water — not a usual talking point you hear from Democrats in assessing the Biden presidency.
He did say that Biden “struggled to get his message out as a leader” in the latter part of his time in office, and that Democrats need to take heed of that. “We need to get out and meet voters where they are with a message that they can believe in.”
As the Democratic Party searches for new ways to break through with the electorate, party chair Nikki Fried has floated the possibility of opening the party’s primary election to non-party-affiliated voters, who comprise more than a quarter of the state’s voting population. Weil offers, “We’d love to see everybody with an opportunity to vote.”
While Weil’s strong fundraising is something he’s proud of, not all Democrats in the state seemed to be happy about it. Some consultants said the money could have been better spent on party infrastructure instead of contests in which the odds were nearly insurmountable, like both special elections held in red districts this spring.
Some questioned his own spending in that race. His campaign spent more than $600,000 for musical talent at campaign events (which on one occasion featured R&B icon Patti LaBelle). Weil insists the money was well spent as he looked for ways to attract voters who might not have been paying attention to a congressional race in the early spring.
“This was an April 1 election. Up until the final week, major news [organizations] weren’t covering this. We needed to find ways to attract people outside of just political realms,” he said.
“I think music is a great area to reach out to people away from the political realm. You know, attract them and be able to then deliver your message. So we set up a large number of concerts. We brought out a bunch of talent. It was all something that I wanted to do to District 6. We see these things happen all the time in Orlando and Miami and bigger areas. And I told the people of District 6 – you’re all worthy of investing in as well. Your vote is just as important as a congressional vote in Miami. And so I wanted to bring talent, I wanted to bring events that district doesn’t normally get.”
No barometer reflects how far the Republican Party has ascended and Democrats have receded in state elections more than what happened in last year’s race for the other Senate seat in Florida, held by Rick Scott. In his three previous statewide elections, Scott never won by more than a single percentage point. But last year, he defeated Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by 13 points.
So, how will Weil, if he wins the Democratic primary next summer, fare against newly appointed Republican Sen. Ashley Moody?
“We just went in to District 6 down by a loss of 32 points and we ran a strong economic message,” he said. “We knocked on over half-a-million doors. We were on the ground, meeting with voters where they were at. And we pushed it to 18 points. I believe that we can do the same thing, district-by-district, county-by-county across the state. We push an R-13 [district] by 18 points and we win by 5.”
Republican Party of Florida Chair Evan Power slammed the news of Weil announcing his candidacy for U.S. Senate.
“Unhinged Josh Weil wants to bring his failed congressional campaign statewide? Despite spending 10s of millions of dollars, the residents of Congressional District six saw through the ads and learned the truth about radical leftist Josh Weil,” Power told the Phoenix in a text message. “The people of Florida will come to the same verdict and realize he’s just too dangerous to represent Florida.”
A request for comment from Ashley Moody’s Senate campaign was not immediately returned.
Weil’s announcement of his candidacy comes just days before state Democrats convene in Broward County this weekend for the Florida Democratic Party’s Leadership Blue event. By becoming a top sponsor to the event, he’s been awarded a speaking spot. That upset Tamika Lyles, who has already declared her candidacy for the Senate seat. Weil says he doesn’t understand the concern.
“The opportunity is there for every candidate to be able to give back to the party and have an opportunity to speak back to them as a result of it,” he says. “It’s an open, fair board. Anyone can purchase those sponsorships.”

Three other cruise ships are seen moored to the Juneau docks. (Video screenshot)The U.S. Coast Guard is investigating a near-collision between two cruise ships in the Port of Juneau that occurred Monday, when one of the two ships broke loose from its moorings and drifted toward the other.
“Our investigations division, they’re running with a standard investigation, just like we would do with any similar such incident, just to investigate if there’s anything that could have gone better or not,” said Lt. Matt Naylor, public affairs officer for the Coast Guard sector covering Southeast Alaska.
“Thankfully, nobody appeared to be injured. There didn’t appear to be any significant damage, so they’re going to be proceeding forward with that investigation, and we’ve gotten some videos from the public already, which have been super helpful,” he said.
On Monday, a sudden storm prompted the National Weather Service to issue the first-ever severe thunderstorm warning for Alaska’s capital city. 
High winds and heavy rain hit Juneau’s port, where the cruise ship Celebrity Edge was moored at the AJ Dock, a privately owned facility.
Videos taken by local residents and shared on social media appear to show the ship breaking its moorings and being blown toward the Carnival Luminosa, another cruise ship moored in the middle of the port.
The Edge’s drift stops only when it drops anchor in the middle of the port, halting it short of the Luminosa, which later maneuvers further away and leaves the port. 
The Edge later returned to shore without incident.
After the near-miss, the Coast Guard put out a call on local social media, asking for additional videos. Thanks to local residents, it no longer needs videos, Lt. Naylor said.
“At this point, we’ve gotten tons of submissions,” he said.
Naylor was unable to say on Tuesday how long the Coast Guard’s investigation will take.
“We’re grateful for everybody who has submitted videos to us, and we are especially grateful that this did not end up being anything bigger than it was, with no injuries and no significant damage,” he said.
“That’s what we’re the most grateful for, and we’re grateful to the crews of all the ships that were involved for their fast action.”

,California,2025-06-18 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Bay Area transit systems want more money. But their payrolls soared as ridership declined,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/bay-area-transit-budget/,"As Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislators negotiate a final version of the budget, their differences on transit financing will be a key issue.","When the COVID-19 pandemic hit five years ago, the state forced countless businesses to shut down and told millions of California workers to stay home.
The abrupt interference with normalcy had many financial, social and political impacts. One was to slash ridership and fare revenues of public transit systems, particularly in the transit-dependent San Francisco Bay Area.
The 27 Bay Area transit systems received $4.5 billion in federal funds, $5.1 billion in a one-time state appropriation and some ongoing state aid to cope with pandemic impacts. However, they say they are still hurting, with accumulated operating losses of several hundred million dollars since 2020, and they will face what they call a “fiscal cliff” in 2026 that would spark service reductions.
A strenuous campaign has been mounted to get more state aid and persuade Bay Area voters to pay more taxes. If anything, however, state support may be decreasing.
The California Transit Association, in a letter to legislative leaders, asked for $1.1 billion in one-time funds and an additional $1.6 billion a year in continuous funding.
However, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s revised state budget cuts transit support from the state’s “cap-and-trade” program of auctioning off greenhouse gas emission permits.
Newsom’s omission angered transit supporters and they persuaded legislative leaders, in their version of the budget, to maintain transit’s $1.1 billion in annual cap-and-trade money and include a $750 million loan to Bay Area transit systems.
As Newsom and legislative leaders negotiate a more-or-less final version of the budget over the next few weeks, their huge differences on transit financing will be one of the key issues.
Meanwhile, Bay Area legislators and civic groups are sponsoring legislation that would allow transit systems to seek higher taxes.
The state Senate has passed Senate Bill 63, which would authorize a regional sales tax, at least a half percent and possibly a full percent, to be placed on the 2026 ballot.
If the legislation wins final approval and voters pass the sales tax, it would generate about $500 million a year for the Bay Area systems, according to a Senate analysis of the measure. Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and the lead author of the bill, describes it as “a much-needed ray of hope.”
However, the sales tax bill has its critics because the region’s transit systems, particularly Bay Area Regional Transit, often appear to be controlled by their unions.
David Crane, who heads Govern for California and describes himself as “a proud Clipper Card carrier who rides BART and SF Muni,” fired off a sharp critique of BART to legislators, citing its much-expanded workforce, from 3,985 employees in 2019 to 4,292 in 2024, even as ridership declined.
“Between 2019 and 2024, BART’s boardings fell 57 percent yet staffing grew and annual payments to employees rose an astounding 32 percent,” Crane wrote. “That’s a big problem because payments to employees now amount to $171,000 per employee, up from $140,000 in 2019, and constitute 54 percent of BART’s net operating expenses.
”Employee productivity at BART is poor and moving in the wrong direction. Before you ask taxpayers for more money for transit agencies, you must require transit agencies to dramatically improve employee productivity. I know that frightens you because of the political power of public employee unions but public transit is a public good that must be run for the benefit of the public. If you stand tall and together, you can prevail.”
Crane’s critique didn’t prevent the Senate from passing SB 63 by a 28-10 vote, but it raises some valid issues about productivity that could be applied to many public services and could affect a transit sales tax election next year.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/060723_BART_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-18 09:00:06.178198

Ada Sipuel Fisher became the first Black woman to attend an all-white law school in the South when she entered the University of Oklahoma Law School. 
Her parents had survived the 1921 Tulsa massacre, and her family moved to Chickasha, where she was born and grew up. She became valedictorian of her local high school and decided to become a lawyer after hearing Thurgood Marshall speak. 
With the backing of both her family and the NAACP, she applied to the University of Oklahoma Law School, which rejected her strictly on the basis of race. When Marshall began to represent her in her battle for admission, the Oklahoma Legislature decided to step in and create a brand-new law school in five days that was nothing more than a room inside the state Capitol, and the Oklahoma courts agreed these two law schools were “equal.” 
Her journey to law school began in 1946 with her law school application. A half-dozen Black students joined her in the fight. Two years later, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in their favor, ending segregation for Black students in graduate programs. 
After the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that the law school could not bar students based on race, Oklahoma officials decided to admit her. Although she recalled white classmates welcoming her, she was forced to sit in the back of the room behind a sign that read “colored” and had to eat in a separate part of the cafeteria. 
In 1952, Fisher graduated and began practicing law. In 1992, Oklahoma Gov. David Walters appointed her to the University of Oklahoma’s Board of Regents. She vowed to bring enlightenment to the position, noting that she had “suffered severely from bigotry and racial discrimination as a student.” 
After her 1995 death, the law named a garden to honor her, and a bronze plaque talked of “how the stone that the builders once rejected becomes the cornerstone.” The law school has since received more than $1 million to endow the Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher Chair in Civil Rights, Race and Justice in Law to teach, research and empower future lawyers.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06104048/June18-update-Ada-Sipuel-Fisher.jpg,,,2025-06-18 09:00:06.178198

The Legislature turned away a couple bills to change the state's campaign finance laws. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Two bills that would have altered the state’s campaign finance laws on political parties and donations died in the Alabama Legislature this year.
HB 6, sponsored by Rep. Phillip Pettus, R-Killen, would have prohibited political parties from disqualifying candidates who accept campaign contributions from specific organizations.
“They should not have a say in where you take your money from,” Pettus said in a phone interview Monday. “What it boils down to, they want to control the money. That is the political party. They want all the money to come from them, and they divvy it out.”
The Alabama Republican Party in 2023 adopted a rule prohibiting the party’s candidates for superintendent or school board from accepting campaign contributions from the Alabama Education Association, an organization representing educators in the state.
According to Pettus, the Republican Party had planned to extend the rule to disqualify people who accept campaign contributions from the teachers’ union to legislators but has since changed its position.
“I still have the bill,” Pettus said. “I am waiting to see if they try to extend it to legislators. If they do, then the bill will be ready to go again.”
“The state party is glad that the Legislature did not take action on HB 6,” said John Wahl, chair of the Alabama Republican Party. “There have been multiple court rulings over the years that have said the parties have the authority to associate with who them want under the First Amendment. I believe this bill would have violated the Party’s First Amendment rights and constitutional rights, and we are pleased the bill did not make it out of committee.”
The Alabama Democratic Party has no rule or regulation similar to what the Alabama Republican Party has imposed.
“It sounds like the Alabama Republican Party has some internal divisions they need to deal with,” said Tabitha Isner, vice chair of the Alabama Democratic Party. “I don’t see why the state legislature should be making laws about how parties decide who can and cannot represent them on the ballot.”
Pettus received $56,500 in direct contributions and $5,000 from in-kind donations from Alabama Voice of Teachers for Education (A-VOTE) since 2018, the political action committee for the state’s educators.
Pettus said prior to the start of the 2025 session that his constituents should decide whether a candidate should accept money from a political party, adding that he represents his constituents and not the Alabama GOP.
The bill was assigned to the House Constitution, Campaigns and Elections Committee but was not considered for the session. The same committee also did not consider the bill in 2024 when it was filed then.
The Alabama Legislature also failed to pass SB 291 into law, sponsored by Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville, which would have allowed a political party to transfer funds to local or other affiliated party organizations currently prohibited by law.
The state has banned political action committees from transferring money to each other since 2010. Givhan’s bill would have added language allowing political parties to transfer money to local county organizations and affiliated entities.
“Those of us who support the bill, while we don’t want to unwind the PAC to PAC transfer ban, we didn’t feel like that was the intention of where a state party couldn’t share with a county party of a group that was affiliated with its bylaws,” Givhan said in an interview Monday.
Political parties are closely related to political action committees in the state, entities that are not required to disclose their donors, who can then use the proceeds to fund campaigns to support candidates or causes.
“This year, I got with Sen. (Bobby) Singleton, (D-Greensboro), and he co sponsored it with me,” Givhan said. “It went through committee very quickly and just never went anywhere.”
One benefit of the legislation is that it would allow a political party to have a joint program with another political party.
“If a county party and a state party want to partner, if you will, on a project, the current law makes it difficult to do that,” Givhan said.
The Alabama Democratic Party supports the bill.
“The point of the prohibition on PAC to PAC transfers is to increase transparency and reduce the shell game that hides who is really funding what,” Isner said. “The unintended consequence of that law was that it doesn’t allow local party groups to collaborate with each other or with the state party. Cleaning up this law so that it does only what it intended to do is a smart move that both parties should support.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vote-reflection-in-pillar-May-7-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 09:00:06.178198

Green Health Laboratories was the sole applicant in this offering after the commission reopened an application window for state testing labs.
The lab will be the only medical cannabis testing lab in the state until AMCC reopens the application process. There are no limits on how many testing laboratory licenses the commission may award.
The AMCC opened a one-month window in February for parties to request an application for state testing laboratory licenses. Of the five requests the commission received, only Green Health Laboratories completed an application. There was a 30-day public comment period that closed on June 15, without receiving any public comments.
Tuesday’s vote to award the license came after Green Health Laboratories president Brandon Biles and laboratory director Natalie Siracusa presented their Foley-based testing laboratory to commission members at a June 12 meeting, where they said the company prioritizes patient safety and compliance.
“That was an interesting presentation. I thought they did a great job. So, we’re glad to have Green Health Laboratories present for us,” said AMCC Chair Rex Vaughn Tuesday. 
At a June 12 meeting, Vaughn said that they would be “the firewall for safe dispensing of cannabis products in Alabama” being the only testing lab in the state.
During the lab’s presentation the week prior, commission member pharmacist Sam Blakemore raised questions regarding quality control, particularly concerning heavy metals and fungi, and the ability to address dispensary concerns during Green Health Laboratories’ presentation. Siracusa and Biles said they would be ready to conduct on-site collections and testing quickly if issues arise.
Under Alabama’s medical cannabis law passed in 2021, physicians can recommend the use of cannabis for patients with qualifying health issues. These conditions include chronic pain, PTSD, epilepsy and cancer-related pain. The law allows cannabis to be dispensed in forms such as tablets, tinctures, patches, oils and gummies, though only peach flavored. The use of raw plant material is not allowed.

Trump’s deportation plan relies in part on cooperation from local law[...],"(Photo: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)A suit filed against the City of Las Vegas and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could have national implications for President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort by limiting the offenses for which individuals can be held on immigration detainers under the 287(g) program.
Trump’s deportation plan relies in part on cooperation from local law enforcement agencies to detain foreign-born individuals for 48 hours beyond their scheduled release so ICE agents can take them into custody.
The suit asserts that federal law allows ICE to request detainers from local police only in arrests involving controlled substances, and that ICE is acting beyond its scope and authority by asking law enforcement agencies to hold those arrested for any other offense, with the exception of theft crimes covered by the Laken Riley Act.
Congress passed that law earlier this year. It requires the Department of Homeland Security to detain an undocumented individual who is arrested for burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.  
“It would be outside of congressional authority for ICE to issue detainers,” for anything other than those offenses, says Ernest Herrera of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), who represents two Las Vegas residents who were turned over to ICE by the City of Las Vegas jail in 2018.
The plaintiffs in the Las Vegas case, Alicia Ines Moya Garay and Juan Jaime Lopez-Jimenez, were arrested for unpaid traffic tickets, kept in the Las Vegas jail beyond their scheduled release, and turned over to ICE without warrants.  
“I think the law is clearly on our side, especially since the Supreme Court got rid of the Chevron Doctrine,” said Herrera. 
The Chevron Doctrine, which was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court last year, held that courts, faced with an ambiguous statute, should defer to a federal agency’s interpretation of the law, as long as the interpretation was reasonable.
If U.S. District Judge Anne R. Traum agrees with the plaintiffs that ICE is exceeding its authority, the ruling could be applied to 287(g) partnerships nationally.
“We would argue that depending on which court decides on it, that it could apply nationally,” Herrera said, adding the issue of national applicability could be determined by the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in the case regarding Trump’s ban on birthright citizenship. 
In that case, the Supreme Court is determining whether injunctions issued by lower-court judges can block executive orders nationwide.
Last week, Traum denied the federal government’s motion to dismiss four causes of action in the suit against the City of Las Vegas and ICE, including the plaintiffs’ claim that ICE is exceeding its authority via the 287(g) program, and violating the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens and immigrants from being detained without probable cause.
Attorneys for ICE did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“Freedom from imprisonment without a judicial warrant or probable cause lies at the heart of the Fourth Amendment,” says the complaint filed by Garay, Lopez-Jimenez, and Arriba Las Vegas Worker Center, which assists migrants with immigration and labor rights. City law enforcement agents, the suit says, “ignore their constitutional mandate to uphold the Constitution, choosing instead to be an uncompensated extension of and receiving direction from” ICE.
Documents obtained by MALDEF in the case reveal the city provided ICE with information for detainers for 1,680 people between Jan. 1, 2017, and Feb. 28, 2019. Of those, ICE picked up 1,139 arrestees.
“The City of Las Vegas is one of the most diverse cities in the state with one of the highest per capita immigrant populations in the country,” says the lawsuit. “Local families are put at risk every day because of City Defendants’ collusion with ICE. Defendants’ policy and practice not only violate individuals’ rights, they also undermine community safety and waste local public safety resources.”
In October 2019, a day after then-Sheriff Joe Lombardo announced the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department would no longer honor ICE detainers, the City of Las Vegas, in a tweet, said the same.
LVMPD renewed its 287(g) partnership with ICE this month, despite repeated assurances earlier from Sheriff Kevin McMahill that the department would not assist with immigration enforcement.

SPRINGFIELD — The parents of a 10-year-old girl who allegedly was assaulted repeatedly by a 14-year-old student in the Taylorville School District have filed a federal lawsuit against the school district and the school bus company.

The lawsuit, filed by a Chicago law firm, contains five counts against the Taylorville School District and Durham School Services, including violations of the victim’s Title IX rights, of her right to bodily integrity under the 14th Amendment, willful and wanton negligence, and infliction of emotional distress.

The victim is identified in the suit as Jane Doe, a minor. Her parents are named in the suit, but Capitol News Illinois is not using their names because it would identify the girl.

The victim's mother said that over the course of a week between late January and early February 2024, her daughter was sexually assaulted by an older student on her daughter’s school bus and at her bus stop. The court filing alleges that the assaults ranged in severity from fondling to digital penetration, most often taking place on the school bus where the perpetrator cornered the girl.

On three separate instances, the perpetrator chased the girl away from a bus stop, held her down, and covered her mouth while he sexually assaulted her, according to the suit.

The lawsuit also alleged that the perpetrator told the girl that he would harm her and her family if she reported the abuse, and that “the perpetrator admitted that he did not even know (her) name when he repeatedly assaulted her.”

The girl is a special needs student living with autism and ADHD, according to the suit.

“We are talking about one of the most vulnerable members of our society — a young, 10-year-old, special needs girl,” the lead attorney on the case, Cass Casper, said during a news conference about the lawsuit Tuesday. “This young child was so confused and distraught by what was occurring that she did not even understand what was occurring.”A spokesman for the school district did not respond to a request for comment by CNI.

After reporting the incident, the mother said she obtained an emergency order of protection for her daughter and brought it to the principal of Taylorville Junior High School, who made a “safety plan” for her daughter. She said the plan prohibited the accused student from coming into contact with her daughter at school, which the order of protection already called for, and simply relocated him to another part of the school building.

“This safety plan was shared with the bus company, my daughter’s fifth grade teacher and office staff,” the mother said during a news conference in the Statehouse in January. “No one else knew of the assaults. No one else knew of the safety plan.”

During that news conference, Peden also said that after several meetings with the school board and multiple court orders, the student was removed from her daughter’s school and sent to an alternative school for the rest of the spring semester. However, in August, she received a phone call about the student’s reentry into her daughter’s school and again asked the school to remove her daughter’s perpetrator.

“We have laws where a student gets expelled for bringing a weapon on school grounds, but what about cases like this, when the student’s body is the weapon?” the mother said.

Casper said the school district conducted what he called a “radically deficient” Title IX investigation. He alleged the school district was “more concerned with absolving the school district of responsibility” than of fleshing out what events took place when and where.

Title IX is a federal law enacted in 1972 that prohibits sexual discrimination in any education program or activity.

The court filing alleged that once the assaults were reported, the parents were informed about several other young victims in the community that the perpetrator had previously inappropriately touched.

“We do have specific information from three other sources that there were similar, not the same, but similar acts that should have raised questions within the community and within the school officials,” Casper said.

The lawsuits also mentions a previous Illinois court case decision, which ruled that a school district is responsible for child abuse occurring on a school bus, alongside the section in the Taylorville School District’s Student Disciple Code that says student conduct on school buses, at extra-curricular activities, on any property within 1,000 feet of school grounds, and “prohibited conduct that is plainly visible to a person situated on school grounds even if the misconduct occurs off of school property” is enforceable.

The lawsuit also seeks compensatory damages for the cost of the girl’s psychological treatment and for her emotional distress, as well as the implementation of new policies that will “prevent future harassment and abuse.”

“Most of what the family has pursued in Taylorville has fallen on deaf ears,” Casper said.

During the news conference, Sen. Steve McClure, R-Springfield, spoke about the failure of a bill he sponsored seeking to expel students who sexually assault another student at school. That bill had 31 co-sponsors in the Senate, 13 of whom were Democrats.

“There are legislators that do not believe that there should be any expulsion or even suspension for any student at all,” McClure said. “There's a focus too much with some legislators on the perpetrator, we got to look after the perpetrator. What about the victim who can't even go to school without seeing someone that attacked them on a daily basis?”

Our collective efforts will not be confined to hospitals, but that is where they must begin.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Don Tinney: Vermont’s students, among others, shortchanged by exorbitant health care costs.","This commentary is by Don Tinney of South Hero. He is a high-school English teacher who is the elected president of Vermont-NEA, the union of 13,000 educators who shape the state’s future every day in our local public schools.


Since the beginning of the year, Vermont Healthcare 911 — a broad coalition of unions (including Vermont-NEA), business leaders, reform advocates and medical caregivers — has been sounding the alarm about Vermont’s dubious distinction of having the highest commercial insurance premiums in the country and why key sectors of the health care system — hospitals, Federally Qualified Health Centers, primary care practices and mental health services — are on the edge of financial collapse or can no longer meet patient needs.
Even the state’s largest insurance carrier, Blue Cross of Vermont, is facing an unprecedented depletion of reserves and mounting costs that threaten its fiscal solvency.
The specter of the affordability crisis in health care looms large. We all live in its shadow. Ever-rising commercial premiums and out-of-pocket costs, driven largely by hospital prices and budgets, are an existential threat to the well-being and stability of businesses, public schools, municipal and state institutions, health care workers, patients and families.
Since 2018 alone, the cost of a family insurance plan on Vermont Health Connect rose by a staggering 92%, making Vermont’s family premiums the most expensive in the country.
Between 2020 and 2025, premium contributions by school districts and school employees combined grew by more than 60%.
The major drivers are hospital and prescription costs. 
Every dollar spent on overpriced medical services and products and bloated hospital administration is a dollar robbed from children’s education. When premium rates rise dramatically, year after year, so do property taxes. Gov. Phil Scott and lawmakers should begin to connect these dots first when they talk about affordability and public education.
Reading the data reports of VHC 911 and talking with fellow members of its leadership council has led me to hope that legislators, regulators and the governor can be compelled, finally, to act in concert in the public’s interest. In fact, I am happy to report that two measures recently passed by lawmakers would begin to curb the unsustainable growth in hospital and drug costs.
Recall that the Act 167 report, issued last September, laid out an ambitious but achievable roadmap to ensure the financial stability of our hospitals, to revitalize community care, and to bring down costs for the commercially insured. When introducing its findings, Dr. Bruce Hamory could not have been clearer on the scope of the problems we face and the necessity for corrective action: “The platform for health care in Vermont has burned and requires rebuilding in a modern form with more sustainable governance and funding methods.”
Let’s start rebuilding — and this means regulating and lowering hospital prices. Vermont-NEA is fed up with price gouging, cost-shifting and blaming patients and working families for high prices. Recently, Don George, Blue Cross’s CEO, acknowledged that the beleaguered carrier has called on the Green Mountain Care Board “to implement hospital/payer-specific revenue caps — an important step toward affordability.” 
Additionally, the persistent and widespread financial harm endured by community-care providers — the bedrock of primary care, wellness and prevention, and mental health — is unconscionable.  Our union, therefore, will continue to strongly oppose cuts to essential services and frontline medical personnel by hospital executives.
If certain hospital leaders refuse to work collaboratively with legislators and GMCB to bring down prices and spending, and to manage their facilities more transparently and cost-effectively, they should step aside in favor of those who will.
VHC 911’s detailed revelations on unethical profiteering by UVMMC at the expense of the commercial insurance market and its exorbitant spending on administrative and management personnel who do not deliver patient care show us that we can lower hospital costs without compromising access to care or hurting the medical professionals who provide it.
Health care reform is within our reach if we muster political resolve, strengthen the Green Mountain Care Board and craft rate-setting policies, regulations and population health priorities informed by the Act 167 Report and VHC 911’s research.
Our collective efforts will not be confined to hospitals, but that is where they must begin.

Our property tax system needs to support Vermonters and incentivize the kinds of communities we want and need.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kate Hughes: It is time to tax second-home owners more.","This commentary is by Kate Hughes. Kate and her husband, Ryan Becker, are educators who grew up in Bethel. They now live in Woodstock, where their son attends a thriving public school within the Mountain Views Supervisory Union.


As the Legislature grapples with the future of education funding and finance, it is time for Vermonters to demand that our legislators, and Gov. Phil Scott, make it a priority to tax second-home owners more. My family’s story illustrates why this matters.
My husband and I are lifelong Vermonters who chose to stay in Vermont and raise our young son here, largely because of the public school system. We’re also public educators trying to make a life without additional resources beyond the paychecks we earn. We own a house assessed at just over $300,000, a house that took 15 years of work, saving and sacrifice to buy.
Last year, primary residents in our community saw a property tax increase of $639.15 per $100,000 of property value, while non-residents saw an increase of $368.45 per $100,000 of value. If a non-resident owned our $300,000 house, their property tax bill would have increased by about $1,100. But because we live here full-time, we saw an increase of nearly $2,000. It’s hard to argue that’s fair or equitable.
In many Vermont communities, there is now a real cost to the high volume of second-home owners who have arrived in recent years. They buy up limited housing stock, raise home values, inflate grand lists and make it very difficult for Vermonters who want to live and work here — and send their kids to our schools — to find affordable housing. It also means there’s a shrinking number of primary residents left to shoulder the cost of essential services.
This disparity now happens in communities across Vermont. Our tax system increasingly privileges wealthier individuals who own multiple homes, rather than supporting low- and middle-income Vermonters trying to rent or own one. It’s a system that makes it difficult for families and workers to stay here, at a time when Vermont desperately needs them. Locals simply can’t compete.
There is little downside to taxing second-home owners more. Many will simply pay it, because they have the wealth to do so. Some may decide to sell, but our housing market makes clear there’s a long line of prospective second-home owners who will buy up those houses and pay whatever Vermont charges.
And for the rare houses that don’t sell quickly, the prices will moderate and return within reach of people who live, work and send their kids to school here. It’s a win in any scenario.
The landscape has changed, and Vermont needs to change its property tax classifications accordingly. Taxing second-home owners directly addresses many of our most pressing crises — a high rate of vacant homes, a profound housing shortage, a profound labor shortage, declining numbers of primary residents to pay for essential services and declining school enrollment.
Our property tax system needs to support Vermonters and incentivize the kinds of communities we want and need, now and into the future.

(Jordan Gale/Oregon Capital Chronicle)It is a common phrase in treaties between the U.S. government and Indigenous American tribes: “Each tribe or band shall have the right to possess, occupy and use the reserve allotted to it, as long as the grass shall grow and the waters run, and the reserves shall be their own property like their horses and cattle.”
But as Angie Debo pointed out in her 1940 book “And Still the Waters Run,” grass still grows, waters still run and all the treaties have been broken by the federal government for mining, grazing, land for settlers and other reasons. Tribes are protected people under federal law even though they are sovereign nations within the United States.
Now, the Trump administration continues that federal tradition by breaking yet another treaty, this one between the feds, four Indigenous tribes and the states of Washington and Oregon. The 2023 agreement to restore fish runs is being revoked so corporations can generate electricity in the Columbia Basin. Prior to the agreement, salmon, steelhead and other native fish were being killed by hydroelectric dams along the Columbia River.
For the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Nation and the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs of Oregon this is not a minor inconvenience. Fishing – especially salmon – is a sacred right, a duty for the tribe to protect the fish which feeds the people. Removing the fish protections from the dams erases a major part of the tribe’s identity and culture.
A major issue for the tribes is because of the dams, the salmon are disappearing at an alarming rate. Shannon Wheeler, Nez Perce tribal chairman, told the Oregon Capital Chronicle to eliminate the treaty is to deny the truth of what is happening.
“This action tries to hide from the truth,” Wheeler said. “The Nez Perce Tribe holds a duty to speak the truth for the salmon, and the truth is that the extinction of salmon population is happening now.”
Because Congress has the final say about dams, U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, in January introduced legislation protecting the Lower Snake River Dams, an action which erases the treaty with the tribes. Risch applauded Trump’s move, calling it “common sense.”
What would be more common sense is encouragement of other forms of electrical generation. Sources such as wind power, solar and geothermal are now being discouraged by the “big, beautiful bill” now in the Senate. There are alternatives out there, electricity could be generated using other renewable resources beyond hydropower.
By using these other resources, the U.S. could help tribes protect their cultures while still generating power for all citizens.
For anyone who would say the tribes no longer matter, think of it this way: How would it feel to have someone erase the Fourth of July saying it is no longer important? That it no longer matters for Americans to celebrate their independence from King George III? It represents something that happened 250 years ago, so why should anyone care?
To tribal members, their cultures are not just a symbol, it is their way of life, the essence of their soul. It is their belief systems, their history and how they see and interact in the world. Erasing part of that does more than simply reduce the salmon population, it destroys the center of tribal culture.
The U.S. needs to honor their treaties – promises – to people they are legally required under federal law to protect. Congress should insist on keeping the treaty. Otherwise, why should the government be trusted to keep their word?

We must protect Medicaid and SNAP — not destroy them.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kendra LaRoche: We must not balance budgets on the backs of our most vulnerable.","This commentary is by Kendra LaRoche of Manchester. She is a member of the Upper Valley DEIA Solidarity Group and executive director of the Special Needs Support Center in White River Junction.


In recent weeks, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a budget proposal that would make the deepest cuts to Medicaid and SNAP (food assistance) in our nation’s history — slashing vital programs that thousands of Upper Valley residents depend on to survive.
As a member of the Upper Valley DEIA Solidarity Group and someone who works closely with our region’s disabled, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, Indigenous and rural neighbors, I cannot stay silent.
If these cuts become law, the impact on our communities in Grafton and Sullivan Counties in New Hampshire, and Windsor and Orange Counties in Vermont would be nothing short of devastating.
Medicaid cuts: loss of life-saving health care
The bill proposes mandatory work requirements for Medicaid coverage — a policy the Congressional Budget Office estimates would cause over 7.6 million Americans to lose health care.
In the Upper Valley, we estimate that approximately 59,700 people with disabilities rely on Medicaid for care. Many cannot work due to disability, and yet these cuts would force them into an impossible choice: prove “worthiness” or lose coverage.
Adding insult to injury, the bill would ban Medicaid funding for gender-affirming care — targeting some of our most vulnerable LGBTQIA+ neighbors at a time when attacks on trans rights are already escalating
SNAP Cuts: a recipe for hunger and hardship
The proposed cuts to SNAP are equally brutal:

Nearly $300 billion in funding cuts — the largest in the program’s history.
New work requirements extended to adults aged 55–64 and parents of school-age children — groups who already face barriers to employment in rural areas.
A shift of costs to states — likely forcing reductions in benefits or eligibility.

Who will this hurt? Rural, Disabled, and BIPOC families in our region who are already struggling to afford housing and transportation — let alone groceries
The local picture: Upper Valley at risk
Consider just a few facts:

In Grafton County, New Hampshire, 10.1% of residents — over 9,000 people — identify as Black, Indigenous or people of color. In Sullivan County, it’s 5.6%. These communities already face disproportionate health disparities and economic barriers.
LGBTQIA+ residents across the Upper Valley rely on Medicaid for mental health care, gender-affirming care and primary care — all under threat.
Over 585 people with disabilities served by the Special Needs Support Center alone stand to lose crucial supports if Medicaid and SNAP funding are gutted.
Rural hospitals in New Hampshire and Vermont — already financially fragile — could be forced to close as Medicaid revenues disappear. This would leave entire towns with no local healthcare.

A call to our senators
I urge our New Hampshire and Vermont Senators — Sens. Shaheen, Hassan, Sanders and Welch — to stand up for the most vulnerable among us and publicly oppose these budget cuts.
Medicaid and SNAP are not luxuries. They are lifelines. They are the difference between a child having dinner or going hungry, between an elder accessing needed medication or ending up in the ER, between a trans person accessing affirming care or facing discrimination and despair.
Our senators have long championed healthcare access and rural justice. We ask them now to vote NO on any budget that balances its books on the backs of disabled, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, Indigenous and rural residents.
The Upper Valley deserves better. Our neighbors deserve better. We must protect Medicaid and SNAP — not destroy them.

(Photographs courtesy Bryan Ramirez; graphic by Leslie Bonilla Muniz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)There’s a photo of me from 25 years ago — the last time the Indiana Pacers made it to the NBA Finals. I’m just a small kid in an oversized, puffy Pacers coat I got from a winter coat drive. But that jacket was more than just a coat. It was warmth. It was safety. It was a place to hide from a world I was still trying to understand.
I had just moved here from Venezuela. I didn’t speak English, know what the American dream was, or even who the Pacers were. I knew I was cold. I knew I felt different at age eight. I knew I didn’t understand why kids made fun of me for how I spoke, or why they told me to go back to my country.
I also knew that coat was my sanctuary. I’d zip it up, tuck my arms and head inside, and call it “Dexter’s Lab.” It was my safe space. My imaginary world where I didn’t feel so out of place. Where I didn’t have to share a mattress with my mom and sister. Where I didn’t have to hear drunk strangers pounding on the door of our apartment off 42nd and Post Rd.
And now, here we are.
25 years later.
The Pacers are back in the Finals.
And somehow, so am I.
I’m living the dream, right? Assistant principal, dad, husband, homeowner. I figured it out. I learned the language, the culture — even who Reggie Miller was. I learned how to blend in. I learned how to survive.
After all this time, I still stare at that photo — not just at myself, but at the other kid. The one without the Pacers jacket, without the warmth I had — the one ICE just detained.
Why him?
Why anybody?
I don’t have all the answers, but I do know this: I see the fear in our students’ eyes and hear it in their parents’ voices. For too many, the American dream still feels out of reach. All I want is to give every one of those kids a Pacers jacket — not just to keep them warm, but to remind them they belong here, too.
So here’s what we can do:
Check in with a student. Donate a coat. Volunteer with your local school’s English as a new language program. Support immigrant advocacy groups here in Indy.
We can’t change the system overnight, but we can show up. Showing up can look as simple as a  warm jacket, a kind word, or a little space where a kid feels like they belong.
Sometimes I wonder if the dream was ever real. For both of us.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Congressional Republicans are working to extend President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts by cutting spending on safety net programs, including Medicaid and SNAP, which helps low-income families buy food. These cuts would also carry major ramifications for state budgets around the country.
If Congress follows through with its spending cuts, Minnesota could lose out on hundreds of millions of dollars annually, forcing cuts to programs that serve elderly, low-income and disabled Minnesotans.
Minnesota, however, has slightly less at stake than other states. Around 32% of the state budget comes from federal dollars, mostly for Medicaid. The national average is 36%, and in some states like Missouri, Montana and Wyoming, the federal government covers nearly half of the budget, according to data from Pew Charitable Trusts. Half of Louisiana’s state budget comes from federal funding. 

Medicaid pays for health care for the elderly, low-income and disabled. The cost is shared between states and the federal government; last year, Minnesota spent $18 billion on Medical Assistance, which is Minnesota’s version of Medicaid. The federal government covered $11 billion of that.
A tax bill passed by Republicans in the U.S. House would cost Minnesota around $500 million annually in lost Medicaid funding, though it is still far from becoming law. A Senate version of the bill released Monday would make even deeper cuts. 
Minnesota is already facing a looming deficit; while lawmakers took steps in the 2025 legislative session to rein in spending over the next two years, they’re expected to make another round of cuts when they write the next budget in 2027.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/johnsonthune-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 08:00:01.681452

Santiago/Getty Images)More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.
In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

(Getty Images)Another member of Gov. Mike Braun’s administration pinned policy changes on former state leaders growing a child care and preschool subsidy program beyond its means. 
Adam Alson, the director of the state’s Office of Early Childhood and Out-of-School Learning, paraphrased his boss, Mitch Roob, who recently said Braun had “inherited a mess” with the Family and Social Services Administration. 
“One of those messes is with child care,” Alson told members of the Early Learning Advisory Committee on Tuesday.
Earlier this month, Alson’s department announced it would cut preschool programming from 6,000 seats statewide to 2,500 total children, citing a need for financial sustainability. Additionally, rates for providers would fall and eligibility would be narrowed. 
On My Way Pre-K will also be decoupled from the Child Care Development Fund, which subsidizes child care for impoverished families. The changes come after Holcomb’s administration introduced a waitlist for CCDF vouchers and OMWPK at the end of his term. 










While millionaires and billionaires are getting more tuition assistance for the private schools their children already attend, working families are being told that pre-K for their 3- and 4-year-olds is too expensive for the state.


– Rep. Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne


As of Tuesday, more than 23,000 children are on the waiting list with a little over 60,000 children currently using both programs. 
“Children were enrolled on CCDF vouchers throughout 2024 with really no plan to fund them,” said Alson about the prior administration, not naming former Gov. Eric Holcomb. “This is the situation that we find ourselves in.”
Alson added that the agency projected CCDF vouchers would fall from 70,000 to “somewhere between” 48,000 and 50,000 over the next few years due to reduced funding. The federal government sent Indiana $284 million in the current fiscal year for CCDF and is the main funding source for the program.
The General Assembly set aside $147.5 million in funding this year to maintain the current number of children using such vouchers but didn’t allocate enough to expand enrollment.
“Our first and foremost goal as an office and as an agency is to make sure that (kids losing vouchers) doesn’t happen and to manage our funding accordingly,” said Alson. 
Prior to COVID-19, Alson’s department spent $200 million annually, peaking at $900 million in 2022 with temporary federal funds earmarked to help providers stay afloat through that period of economic uncertainty. Spending fell to roughly $650 million last year and is estimated to be closer to $600 million this year, according to Alson’s presentation. 
Those limited federal dollars were used to expand enrollment in preschool and child care programming by 75% since 2021, Alson said, with the number of providers expanding by 20%. But state lawmakers directed dollars elsewhere in the 2025 budget-writing session, opting not to continue enhanced funding for the program after a dismal revenue forecast predicted Indiana would be short $2 billion in the next two years.

“We all recognized heading into this legislative session that we really needed the state to come through and make good on many of the changes that we had implemented over the last several years,” said Sam Snideman, the vice president of government relations for United Way of Central Indiana. “Unfortunately, the fiscal picture was what it was and things took cuts that we wish hadn’t been necessary.”
Indiana’s House Democrats, in a caucus release, noted that some of the most populous counties will see their providers rates fall by 50%, tying the cut in state funding for preschools to the Republican supermajority’s decision to fund universal “school choice” vouchers for the wealthiest Hoosiers.
“Working parents are already stretched thin. Now, they’re being told to do more with less – the theme of this administration. Cutting On My Way Pre-K means pulling the rug out from under hard-working families who were planning to use this program to make their household budget work,” said House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne.
“These cuts weren’t inevitable. In the 2025 budget, Statehouse Republicans chose to prioritize making private school vouchers universal. While millionaires and billionaires are getting more tuition assistance for the private schools their children already attend, working families are being told that pre-K for their 3- and 4-year-olds is too expensive for the state. That’s not budgeting — that’s bad priorities. Amid a budget shortfall, Statehouse Republicans found the money to expand a program that they cared about. It just wasn’t the program that benefits families struggling to get by,” he continued.
 The state of Indiana’s child care

Advocates like Snideman, who is a member of the committee Alson presented to on Tuesday, worry that reducing the number of children getting state assistance will undo recent progress to expand options for parents. 
Data from Brighter Futures Indiana, a partnership between the state and Early Learning Indiana, estimates that 328,271 Hoosier children under the age of 6 may need care in addition to 173,529 schoolchildren. 
But the state’s 4,000-plus programs only have a capacity to serve just under 200,000 children. That doesn’t consider whether the program will be high-quality enough to impact a child’s learning outcomes — though early education is tied to better reading scores, another hurdle for Indiana’s children. Nor does this metric consider affordability, which disproportionately shuts women out of the workforce. 
In Tuesday’s meeting, Alson explicitly acknowledged the “duplicative” impact of child care and preschool programming for families and communities, noting that parents can’t work without child care options.

“We know that (the current supply is) not enough. There’s more to be done out there for child care,” Alson said. 
But reducing enrollment and paring down on payments to providers and families will impact the state’s economy and reduce opportunities for parents — especially those with younger children — Snideman observed. 
“That’s going to mean potentially thousands of children who need care now won’t get it. Or they’ll get part-time pre-K or part-time care when they need full-time care,” Snideman said. “… when families don’t have the resources that they need, they are going to rightly prioritize their household’s stability.”
Provider cuts, in particular, could bring “an era of potential instability” for Indiana’s caretakers, he added. State officials said some providers have opted out of the state’s voucher programming.
Tuesday’s meeting offered a ray of hope, albeit slim, for child care advocates like Snideman, with an update on so-called microcenter pilots, which serve 30 or fewer children. Three such programs have begun operating with another set to open its doors this summer. 
Such facilities depend on a hub and spoke model, where administrative duties are handled by one main office and caregiving buildings can be smaller. Some devote only a sliver of a building to child care and share their space with restaurants or other businesses. 
The aim of the pilot is to lower regulatory hurdles for child care providers without jeopardizing safety, coupled with the ability to open such centers in rural, hard-to-serve areas. 
“I do think that it has the potential to be a really impactful program,” said Snideman. “I also will stress that we need to be diligent about collecting the right data and we need to be diligent about making sure that we use this as a genuine learning opportunity.”

Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) and Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) on the Senate floor on Jan. 8, 2025, the Senate's first day of session for the year. | Kyle Davidson Several Republican members of the Michigan House of Representatives were in Washington, D.C. this week to meet with members of the Trump administration, which has one state Democratic senator questioning their priorities as the budget deadline looms.
Speaking to reporters following the Senate session on Tuesday, state Sen. Darrin Camilleri said he was disappointed that his colleagues in the House were gone while Senate Democrats were still working. He also laid blame for the slow pace of the budget process at the feet of Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township).
“We’re here on the floor working hard, not only still figuring out budget priorities and discussions, but we’ve been working on legislation while House Republicans are in D.C. kissing the ring of the president,” said Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Brownstown) in a scrum with reporters following Tuesday’s Senate session. “We have very different priorities, and that’s very clear from the contrast this week.”
Camilleri said the goal was to have the two chambers’ budgets ready to go by July 1, and the state Senate rose to the occasion by passing its entire budget – including spending plans for schools and higher education – months ago. Meanwhile, the House has only pushed through its education budget. That’s left their colleagues in the Senate unaware of their other budget priorities, stymying the negotiation process.
“The span between their budget proposal and ours is about as big as the [Mackinac Bridge],” he said. “For us to see where they put their priorities, it’s only been about increasing costs. They increased costs for retirement. They’ve increased costs for school operations … [and] university operations.”
Camilleri added that proposed GOP cuts to universal free school meals and preschool will raise costs on families.
The senator said it was troublesome that several members of the House Republican Caucus were in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday to meet with President Donald Trump’s administration to talk about the congressional budget bill – and not hashing out their own budget at home.
“The thing I don’t understand is what they’re hoping to learn out of D.C.,” Camilleri said. “The budget bill that they passed out of D.C. only makes our jobs harder. It cuts funding to critical services like Medicaid. It puts on the chopping block additional funds that we would rely on to figure out our state budget. I don’t know what they’re going to get out of that trip, but they are wasting an entire week doing so.”
That said, Camilleri, chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on PreK-12, has met with his counterpart in state Rep. Tim Kelly (R-Saginaw Township), chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on School Aid and Department of Education. It was an informal breakfast that served as a means to get to know each other better, but Camilleri said if the public school budget negotiations were up to him and Kelly, they could likely have a deal done before July 1.
Camilleri then said that bolstered his belief that Hall was the problem in the process.
“If he were to let [House Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. Ann Bollin] or Tim Kelly do their jobs, I think we could actually get to a deal,” he said. “I know that [Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Sarah Anthony] and Chair Bollin have developed a really good relationship the last couple months. Chair Kelly and myself had a great first meeting. I think that there could be some progress here, but because [Hall] has been micromanaging this process from day one, I don’t know how we can get a deal if he’s not letting his members do their jobs.”
It’s not all doom and gloom, though. 
Camilleri said there were areas of common ground between the two chambers. He said Hall wants more money funding schools, which the Senate agrees with. The devil is in the details in how that’s done. House Republicans passed a public schools budget with many of its past categorical spending on programs like school meals placed into per-pupil funding. Camilleri said the Senate wasn’t opposed to wrapping some of those programs up, it was simply a matter of doing that the right way.
Many of the programs that were rolled up into the foundation allowance are things Democrats in the House and Senate care deeply about, Camilleri said, and they fought hard in past budgets when they held all stations of state government to make sure they were funded appropriately.
“Their proposal guts most of them,” he said. “Are there some things I think we could find ways to just put into a per-pupil allotment? Perhaps. … But gutting the programs like at-risk [student] funding or free school meals, that’s just not somewhere where we’re going to go.” 
Camilleri said it wasn’t out of the question for the two chambers to start negotiating by July 1, but he wasn’t sure how the entire budget process could be completed by then.
It also wasn’t out of the question for the Senate to work through the summer on the budget with their House counterparts, but Camilleri said that if the parties can’t get something tangible done by July, he wasn’t sure how productive it would be to slog away in August.
“We can come back in September and try again in the fall,” he said. “But my hope is that if they can get to a target [of] negotiation by July 1, maybe that’s the first step of this process. … I’m being optimistic.”
Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) confirmed with reporters after Tuesday’s Senate session that she and Hall were meeting on Wednesday to start discussing budget plans.
“I certainly hope that’s the main topic,” Brinks said. “It’s June 17. They have still not passed [a full] budget, so I am very eager to make progress there. It’s high time that we have those conversations. I am very pleased that he has finally accepted the opportunity to meet and I’m very hopeful that these will be productive conversations.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSC_0896-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 08:00:01.681452

Ron DeSantis and his minions have perfected the art of bending and/or dispensing with the rule of law and long-held democratic norms in ways that have enabled Republicans to keep control of the state’s political levers.
During just about every news cycle, especially during legislative sessions, we see our high-handed chief executive belittling critics, sneering at perceived enemies, and rewarding his friends.
In their quest for unbridled power, Florida Republicans have wielded their immense political power in a multiplicity of ways to subvert the will of the people.
For example, Florida voters have long been able to use the citizens’ initiative process to bypass the Republican-dominated Legislature and advance progressive policies such as raising the minimum wage, legalizing medical marijuana, and restoring the voting rights of people with felony convictions.
Senate Bill 7050, which became law in 2023, illustrates DeSantis’ political tactics, using voter suppression to discourage Democratic and primarily Black and brown voters from being able to fully participate in the electoral process. Not doing this would leave them vulnerable to voters who would likely chase them out of office.
As the Florida Phoenix’s Michael Moline noted in a 2023 story imagining a handbook for autocracy: “… Republican-run states these days are experimenting with ways to disenfranchise Democratic constituencies, stack the courts against progressive initiatives, and cement their control over this country one state at a time. The dust cover could feature the smiling mug of Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, the Republican presidential candidate who since the Black Lives Matter summer three years ago has pushed an ever-more-reactionary campaign against marginalized communities, not least at the voting booth.”
A representative of the Elias Law Group pointed to the damage from the 2023 restrictions on third-party voter registration campaigns.
“Third-party voter registration organizations play a critical role in ensuring that every eligible Floridian has an opportunity to vote, especially Black and Brown Floridians,” said partner Abha Khanna. “These organizations have helped register roughly a quarter of a million Florida voters since 2018, yet they now find their important work under assault by Governor DeSantis and the Florida Legislature. SB 7050 threatens to disrupt and discourage these organizations from helping marginalized Floridians register to vote.”
However, the federal judge in Tallahassee recently allowed the state to enforce most of the law’s provisions pending completion of the litigation.
After observing the success of that law, DeSantis and Republicans set their sights on defanging that citizen initiative petition-gathering process, imposing a slew of burdensome constraints and penalties for organizations doing that work.
Lawmakers argue the petition restrictions are needed to reform a process they claim has been tainted by fraud. The Legislature pushed HB 1205 through months after Florida voters supported ballot initiatives to protect abortion rights and legalize recreational marijuana, although the measures fell short of the 60% needed to pass. The governor signed the bill into law on May 5.
Gum up the process
this year’s HB 1205 contains a raft of requirements that gum up the petition process. For example, those gathering signatures, whether paid or volunteer, must be registered with the Division of Elections beginning July 1. Petition circulators must be Florida residents and U.S. citizens. Convicted felons are barred from doing that job unless their right to vote has been restored.
In addition, the law prohibits anyone who has “not registered as a petition circulator from possessing more than 25 signed petition forms in addition to his or her own signed form or one belonging to an immediate family member.”
Other provisions in HB 1205 include the demand that voters signing the form must provide a “current or valid Florida driver license and valid Florida identification card number, plus the last four digits of his or her social security number.” The signer must affirm that he/she has not been convicted of a felony, or, if they have, they have had their right to vote restored. Lastly, the applicant must affirm that he or she is a U.S. citizen and a Florida resident.”
The law imposes fines for petitions delivered to a supervisor of elections after the  deadline. Fines increase from a $50 fee for each late petition form to $50 for each day it’s late, up to a total fine of up to $2,500 for each tardy petition form. If the sponsor or petition circulator acted willfully, the bill increases the penalty from $250 for each petition form to $2,500.
The  law also creates a new fine for forms collected before the Feb. 1 deadline but submitted after that date. Each form received by a supervisor after the deadline results in a $100 fine for each day late, up to $5,000, and if the sponsor or petition circulator acted willfully, $5,000 for each late form.
Meanwhile, the deadline for submitting petitions has been shortened from 30 days to 10 days.
Longer, costlier
Groups involved in gathering petitions point to the deleterious effects the law has already had since DeSantis signed it into law on May 2. Florida Decides Healthcare says circulation has dropped 88% since then, and Smart and Safe Florida, a group advocating for the legalization of marijuana, says costs of securing petitions have ratcheted up 370% while signature gathering has plummeted from 78,000 a week to 12,000.
A representative from the Elias Law Group pointed to the damage from the 2023 restrictions on third-party voter registration campaigns.
Many of the affected organizations are devising ways around the new provisions, while other groups, like Smart & Safe Florida, are doubling down on their efforts to get enough signatures to put issues of concern to the public on the ballot.
They are busy working to get another measure on the ballot in 2026. In a court filing, Smart & Safe Florida officials characterized the new restrictions as “legislative gaslighting,” designed not to block fraud but to “effectively destroy the people’s right to invoke the citizen initiative.”
Critics contend that the new hurdles would make it prohibitively expensive and effectively impossible for grassroots campaigners to place measures on the ballot.
“This bill is not about improving the ballot initiative process. It attacks the fundamental freedom of Floridians to participate in their own democracy,” said Florida Decides Executive Director Mitch Emerson. “It is a calculated and cowardly attempt by politicians in Tallahassee to rewrite the rules  — not to serve the people, but to protect their own power.”
Emerson estimates the new law will mean millions of dollars in additional costs for his campaign in complying with new requirements and hiring more paid circulators to make up for volunteers who back out for fear of legal liability.
“Volunteers are second-guessing whether they can legally help. Communities are confused. And that’s exactly what the law was designed to do: to sow confusion and try to shut down engagement before it starts,” he said.
Emerson said Florida Decides had collected about 100,000 signatures to date in its push to bank 880,000 verified petitions ahead of a Feb. 1 deadline.
Obama-appointee Chief U.S. District Court Judge Mark Walker will determine whether DeSantis has unfairly manipulated the ability of Floridians seeking to continue to have access to direct democracy.

In March, President Trump signed an executive order under the guise of “restoring truth and sanity to American history by revitalizing key cultural institutions and reversing the spread of divisive ideology.”
In fact, the very opposite is true.
Instead, the executive order is an attempt to erase the factual experiences, treatment and contributions of Blacks, women and others by removing documents and other evidence from the nation’s museums and institutions.
Also, it’s purpose is to revive and glorify military leaders that led the fight to continue the oppression and disenfranchisement of Blacks.
This week as we celebrate Juneteenth  — a federal holiday commemorating the emancipation of Blacks from slavery — it is a good time to reflect on what the removal, and now the impending restoration, of Confederate monuments will or will not mean for our everyday lives.
The removal of some of the Confederate monuments in recent years has not made a difference in making things better:
In closing the great racial divide that is on display all across America. Bigotry, racism, prejudices, disenfranchisement of groups of people based strictly on skin color and economic station in life are still an ugly part of America.
In changing how Blacks are perceived and denied in the workplace.
In stopping how Blacks are treated by police and the criminal justice system, being stopped more often than whites with or without a legitimate reason, and receiving longer and harsher sentences and judgements than whites for the same or lesser offenses. This is commonplace in towns and cities across America.
In eliminating the perpetual education achievement gap where Black children are still locked in poorer inferior schools, where in racially integrated schools they are disciplined and expelled at much higher rates than white children for the same behavior and infractions.
More importantly, removal of Confederate monuments has not erased the ugly history of America they represent.
The bane of racist evilness that still remains is seen in the resurgence and boldness of white supremacy and blatant expressions of racial hatred.
So, what is the priority and purpose of the resurgence to recognize, honor and regale us in such an ugly and destructive time in American history by our president and his administration?
With an administration where so much of what is done with “made for TV” drama and flair, renaming and restoring visible symbols of an inglorious past under the guise of American gallantry is one more act taking center stage.
Displaying and honoring the vestiges of that period in public squares and other public spaces of southern cities, towns and state capitals only serve to make a statement that this part of American history is laudable and something to be proud of.
Proud of the horrible deeds of those men, and the lasting destructive attitudes, laws, and practices that resulted from them.
The resulting Civil War threatened the very existence of this country. What is the purpose of waving the confederate flag instead of or alongside the American flag?
It is long past time that America’s confederate history takes it rightful place within the walls of a national museum or several museums.
The long-standing and appropriate practice has been that American history is preserved in national and local museums where it is accessible to anyone who would like to revisit our past, visit it for the first time, or learn anew the real facts.
The Smithsonian Institution, the world’s largest museum, educational and research complex, opened the National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2016. It is being targeted by the Trump administration.
Confederate statutes of generals, documents and other memorabilia belong in museums and designated parks to remind all Americans of a period in this nation’s history that was detrimental, inhumane, ugly and which should never be repeated.
Those reminders need not be destroyed or revered.
As the executive order to purge the collections and displays of historical accounts housed in some of our great museums and institutions is being caried out, will these reminders be recast, white-washed and honored?
The goal should not be to destroy history, but to learn from it.
Isn’t it enough to have lingering vestiges of racial conflict, inequality and oppression prevalent today and still affecting the quality of everyday lives?
It is progress to acknowledge that any period of human enslavement, oppression, servitude, and persecution in a country’s history is, indeed, a shameful and inglorious one.
To deny, disown or ignore it is not only crippling, but defeating.
There is a lot to be concerned about when it comes to these insidious efforts to rewrite the history of America.
We need to make concerted efforts to preserve the facts, major periods and their impact, and to make that information available to future generations.
Future generations need to know the complete American history — the good, the bad, to build a promising future.
Sadly, many American who regale in those times and symbols will likely continue to do so in their hearts and minds.
It begs the question why would any decent, compassionate, ethical, if not God-fearing, person want to honor and revel in such a time with visible, larger than life, reminders.
Only facing this scourge, confronting it, and actively taking the necessary steps to make things better will have lasting meaning.
Sadly, even then, there will be those who will stay stuck in the false sense of racial superiority that is merely a relic of America’s past.
Yes, Confederate flags and monuments are historical relics that too many are trying to preserve not because of their place in America’s history, but in an attempt to determine America’s future.
The president and his administration are leading the charge.

The report, published by The Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation focused on health care issues, used data from 2023 to measure every state’s health care access, quality and outcomes across six dimensions. 
Around 15% of nursing home residents nationally are administered antipsychotic drugs, according to the Commonwealth Fund study. In Missouri, that figure was just over 21%. Only Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota had higher rates. 
The data, collected by the federal government, excludes residents with schizophrenia, Tourette’s syndrome or Huntington’s disease — conditions for which antipsychotics are generally considered medically necessary.
Studies have found antipsychotic drugs are often administered to residents of nursing homes without medical necessity, posing medical risks and side effects. They’ve also been used for residents with dementia, other cognitive impairments, or behavioral issues to help control their behavior or sedate them without their consent. 
Research has found a link between low nursing home staffing levels and higher rates of antipsychotic drug use. 
The Commonwealth Fund’s findings echo a report last year from the U.S. Department of Justice that found Missouri in violation of federal disability law for unnecessarily institutionalizing thousands of adults with mental illness in nursing homes when they would be better off in a less-restrictive environment. 
Missouri is an outlier nationally in placing people with mental health needs in nursing homes.
The state is still in settlement negotiations with the DOJ over its findings, a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Mental Health told The Independent. Missouri officials are working with the DOJ to come up with a plan to fix the violations identified in the report. If they can’t reach a resolution, the DOJ could file a lawsuit.
Beyond issues in Missouri nursing homes, the state’s health care system overall ranked 43rd out of the 50 states plus D.C. in the Commonwealth Fund report. While the state has seen improvements in areas like the adult insured population over the years since Medicaid eligibility was expanded, other metrics, like premature deaths from preventable causes, have gotten worse. 
Sara Collins, author of Wednesday’s report and Commonwealth Fund Senior Scholar and Vice President for Health Care Coverage and Access, said in a press briefing that the report “continues to reveal vast geographic variation in Americans’ coverage and access to care, health outcomes and people’s ability to live a long and healthy life.”
Congress is debating a budget bill that could cut millions nationally from Medicaid.
“Federal policy changes, both underway and proposed, threaten to reverse the improvements achieved by states, exacerbate areas of slippage,” Collins added, “and deepen geographic income and racial and ethnic disparities and health outcomes.” 
 36th on access and affordability

Missouri’s uninsured rate improved between 2019 and 2023, as was the case nationally: The adult uninsured rate fell from 14% to 11% in Missouri, and kids’ uninsured rate fell from 7% to 5%. Both are now on par with the national average. Missouri implemented Medicaid expansion in 2021. The rate of adults going without care because of cost also declined.
But on the access and affordability category overall, Missouri ranked 36th, with a higher-than-average share of people with medical debt in collections and rate of those with high out-of-pocket medical costs relative to their income.
 50th on avoidable hospital use and cost

Missouri especially struggled in the “avoidable use and cost” category, with only West Virginia ranking worse. That includes low primary care spending, high rates of preventable hospitalizations and avoidable ER visits. 
 40th on prevention and treatment

More children in Missouri lack preventative care than the national average. Thirty-five percent of Missouri children lacked medical and dental preventative care from 2022 to 2023. The national average was 32%. 
Children also had trouble accessing mental health care in Missouri, with 24% of kids not receiving  mental health care as needed, while the national average was 20%. 
Missouri was better than average in a handful of categories. For one, the state had fewer adults with substance use disorder who lacked treatment. Nationally, 77% of those adults lack treatment, but in Missouri that number is 73%, or 11th best in the country. 
 40th on healthy lives

The infant mortality rate got slightly worse from 2019 to 2023 and ranked 39th in the country.
“Threatened access to reproductive and maternal health care may further worsen infant mortality and sharpen current disparities between states,” the report noted, nationally. Missouri banned abortion until late last year, when it was legalized by initiative petition.
The rate of premature deaths from preventable causes got worse during the same period, and Missouri ranked 43rd in the country.
Additionally, more adults smoke in Missouri than the national average — 15% in Missouri versus 11%, or the 44th ranking. 
Missouri had lower-than-average alcohol deaths. 
 47th on income disparity and 31st on racial equity 

Missouri ranked among the worst states — 47th — for disparities in health care based on income. Low-income Missourians are far more likely to report fair or poor health than higher earners, and far more likely to have lost several teeth and/or be obese.

The proposal was less than a third of the $500 million corrections proposal released by Gov. Tony […],"“Republicans would rather have a talking point and try to portray themselves as tough on crime, when really what they are is very stupid and wasteful on crime,"" Sen. Kelda Roys said. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)GOP lawmakers on the Joint Finance Committee approved a proposal for the Department of Corrections that includes an additional $62.9 million in state spending in 2025-26 and $73.8 million in 2026-27 as well as 18 new staff positions. The proposal was less than a third of the $500 million corrections proposal released by Gov. Tony Evers earlier this year, which he argued was necessary to pass in full in order to accomplish  the closure of the Green Bay Correctional Institution.
Evers’ plan, when released, included plans to overhaul the state’s correctional facilities, including closing GBCI, closing Lincoln Hills School for Boys and Copper Lake School for Girls and renovating other facilities as well as expanding earned release and taking steps to address recidivism rates.
Committee co-chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said GBCI, which was built in 1898, won’t be discussed until the committee takes up the capital budget later this week. He said the last budget helped reduce staffing shortages and that legislators want that work to continue with the portions of the budget taken up on Tuesday.
“As I’ve talked to the prisons in my district, they’re happy to see that their recruit classes are much larger, and the vacancies are about half of what they were prior to the last budget, so we think that’s working well,” Born said. “The next phase of this is to talk about the capital budget investments, which will happen on Thursday.” 
The proposal passed by committee Republicans also includes additional investments in the state’s adult institutions, including $65 million across the biennium for inmate costs, $4 million for contract beds, $5 million for fuel and utilities costs and $292,600 for body cameras. Fox Lake Correctional Institution would get 2.1 million in funding and 16 health care related positions. 
Democrats on the committee said the money allocated wouldn’t be enough to lay the groundwork for major reforms to Wisconsin’s correctional system, including shutting down the GBCI. They had introduced a motion that would have added $268.9 million in spending to corrections and 59 staff positions.
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) noted that previous budgets have spent more on incarceration than on the state’s public universities, and that Republicans’ proposal is half of what Democrats wanted to spend on community reentry. 
“Wisconsin is woefully behind the times when it comes to public safety reform and on criminal justice reform,” Roys said. “What’s disappointing about this is to see that we are going to continue to fall far behind. We spend so much money incarcerating people, and that means less money for all the other important things that we want to do in the state.”
Centers dedicated to community reentry will get an additional $1 million under Republican’s proposal.
The centers, Roys said, are a “proven way to reduce recidivism” meaning “reducing the crime as people move back into society.” She also added that the proposal included “no money for supported housing, which we know is one of the biggest barriers for people who are coming out of incarceration and re-entering the community.” 
Roys told reporters after the meeting that the state is incarcerating too many people, and said Evers’ plan would have helped address policy changes that need to be made to progress towards closing GBCI. 
“We don’t have the capacity and the programming and the staffing and the facilities to allow people to successfully reenter and we’re also taking [people] back out of the community after they’ve already re-entered for really minor technical violations. There are a lot of different things that we can safely do to help reduce and right size the prison population… The governor has proposed these things,” Roys said. “Republicans would rather have a talking point and try to portray themselves as tough on crime, when really what they are is very stupid and wasteful on crime.” 
Born said the budget proposal voted on Tuesday was focused on the services already provided by the state and not inserting policy into the budget. He said the committee was doing what it needed to to invest in public safety.
“It’s super expensive, and it is what it is because it is a super important part of public safety,” Born said. “Nothing to be sad or upset about and as I would hope most folks know the discussion on the future is in the [capital budget].” 
The committee also took up the budgets for district attorneys and public defenders. 
The Republican proposal approved on Tuesday adds 42 new assistant district attorney positions, costing $3.5 million in 2025-26 and $2.7 million in 2026-27. The counties with the most new positions include Brown with seven new positions, Waukesha with six positions and Fond du Lac with four. Milwaukee County would get no new positions and Dane County would get one additional position.

Republican lawmakers on the committee said the proposal was based on a workload analysis of the Wisconsin District Attorneys Association and should bring the state up to 80% of the staffing in the study. Roys disputed this, noting that Evers based his proposal on the same study, finding that 47 positions would be needed to bring the staffing to 70%.
Roys said the motion was a “nod in the right direction” but said it was missing commensurate increases for public defenders.
“You can have prosecutors charging and charging and charging all day, but if you don’t have defense attorneys, then people are going to languish in jail,” Roys said. “These cases are going to continue to sit there and not get resolved, and we’re going to see that backlog increase.” 
Roys also criticized the motion for including no new positions for Milwaukee County, the state’s most populous county, and only one new position in Dane County, the second most populous county. She also expressed concern that Republicans were not considering that federal funds that are currently supporting 30 assistant district attorneys across 28 counties are set to be expended in July. 
“The loss of federal funding, I think in some counties, this is going to be very problematic,” Roys said. 
“It’s like a 10% increase. What other agencies here are we giving a 10% increase?” Born said. “This is a priority. This is a key investment. I think it’s a positive thing that we were able to do there, but I’m not gonna cry over all our buddies that got ARPA money, [but] didn’t get it now.”
The positions would be anticipated to start in October.
The Republican motion also included investments of nearly $2 million in 2025-26 and nearly $4 million in 2026-27 for pay progression increase for assistant district attorney and deputy district attorneys. The State Public Defender’s office would get $1.9 million in 2025-26 and $3.8 million in 2026-27 for pay progression.
Other investments for district attorneys and public defenders included $3.5 million to upgrade the case tracking system for prosecutors and $858,400 and $922,4000 and 12.5 positions to address workload issues.
The committee also took up the portions of the budget for the Department of Military Affairs, the Public Service Commission and the budget management. 
UW budget delayed as deadline approaches
The committee did not take up the budget for the University of Wisconsin system, even though it had been scheduled. 
Marklein said leaders “decided not to take it up today” and the co-chairs declined to comment on rumors that lawmakers were preparing a significant cut to the system’s budget.
Roys said she had also heard that Republicans were preparing an $87 million cut to the system and said it would be a “non-starter” for Democrats on the committee.
“The university over the last generation has seen their budget shrink and shrink. They have not gotten inflationary increases, and they’ve had cuts,” said Roys, whose district includes the UW-Madison campus. “What they had asked for in this budget session would help make them whole from the cuts that they have endured over the last 15 years.” 
Roys also said that she thought Republicans were having “difficulty deciding whether they want to walk the plank on making cuts to education.” 
“When we do not fund public education, which is again the No. 1 thing that Wisconsinites have asked for consistently over the years, we are going to end up with a state where nobody wants to live,” Roys said. “We can fund prisons all we want, but ultimately, funding early childhood, funding education, funding higher [education] is how we make Wisconsin a great place to live.”
Marklein said he and his colleagues are trying to get the budget passed before the June 30 deadline. 
Republicans will be facing a small vote margin if they try to pass the bill with only Republican support. Two members of the Senate have already expressed concerns about the budget crafted so far by the Joint Finance Committee. 
Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) said that he sees three options: accepting Evers’ budget, approving the one being drafted by the Joint Finance Committee or leaving the current budget in place. 
“Unless something improves, I am going with option #3,” Kapenga wrote. 
Kapenga said the JFC budget so far includes “unnecessary spending without any reforms that would improve the budget process or dig into wasteful spending currently in place” and said that it would be a major risk to send the budget to Evers because the state Supreme Court hasn’t curbed his veto power.
Kapenga said letting the current budget stand would mean “the lowest spending increase in a decade” and would “have no veto pen risk.” 
Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) had already encouraged the state Legislature last month to either pass no new budget or “a very small mini-budget.” He has a history of voting against the state budget.

(Photo by Tom Werner/Getty Images)(This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)Oklahoma ranked 49th in the nation for its state health care system, according to a report released Wednesday. 
The Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation supporting independent health care research, reported that only Texas and Mississippi trailed Oklahoma. D.C. was also included in the report. 
Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of the foundation, said the 2025 scorecards show “incredible progress” around the country but also underscore the “peril that lies ahead.” 
“In addition to the importance of federal policy, it is clear that state policy matters as well,” Betancourt said. “I’m a primary care doctor. I see patients every week and people across the nation can tell you that there is no substitute for being able to get the care you need when you need it. And the evidence is clear that policies that make health insurance and health care more affordable and accessible work and make a difference for people everywhere every day.”
The scorecards use the most recently available data, said David Radley, a senior scientist at the Commonwealth Fund. This year’s report generally reflects the state of health and experiences in 2023, he said. 
Oklahoma performed worst in breast cancer deaths and people with medical debt in collections, but best on primary care spending for seniors. 
Oklahoma is 48th in access and affordability to health care, with Nevada, Mississippi and Texas the only states ranked lower. The state also ranks 46th in racial health equity as well as prevention and treatment. 
Ranked 25th for drug overdose, Oklahoma has over 32 deaths per 100,000 people. 
Oklahoma is ranked 50th for breast cancer deaths and 42nd for infant mortality. 
There are nearly 22 suicides per 100,000 people in Oklahoma, bringing the state a ranking of 46. 
Oklahoma was ranked in the bottom five states for premature deaths from treatable and preventable causes. 
In 2024, a report from the Commonwealth Fund found that Oklahoma’s maternal mortality was one of the worst in the country at 48th. 
Rates of uninsured people dropped in all states, which was likely because of expansions to Medicaid, subsidized coverage and consumer protections, according to a news release. But these improvements could be “reversed” by proposed federal policy changes cutting Medicaid. 
“My hope is that these findings serve as a guide and a call to action for policymakers to make sure everyone in America can get the care they need, no matter who they are, where they live, or how much money they earn,” Betancourt said.

(Read more about this here).
Both the House and Senate took initial votes to back legislation (LD 1770) that would establish a task force to study the challenge of property tax reform. As an emergency measure, the bill must gain the support of two-thirds of each chamber to take effect immediately. (Read about the bill here).
Legislation (LD 1263) that would have created a Class A crime for aggravated trafficking of fentanyl when it results in an overdose is effectively dead after the chambers were unable to agree, with the Senate in support of an amended version and the House opposed. 
Following the Senate on Monday, the House Tuesday voted to pass a resolve (LD 244) directing the Department of Corrections to contract with a community-based organization to establish a transitional housing pilot program to provide for individuals recently released from correctional facilities.
An amended version of LD 1126, which would require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns that are assembled at home or those made with a 3D printer, passed both chambers after the Senate voted 17-18 to reject an effort to pass a different amendment on Tuesday that would only focus on guns used in a crime or in possession of a prohibited person.
With the House voting 77-70 and the Senate 19-15, both chambers backed a measure (LD 1189) that would allow an attorney for the state to determine whether to charge certain class E crimes — unusually punishable by up to six months incarceration and a $1,000 fine — as civil violations.
After the House voted 75-72 on Tuesday, both chambers have now passed legislation (LD 1937) that would require hospitals and hospital-affiliated providers to establish financial assistance programs for medical care. Critics said the bill would add to the burden on struggling hospitals, but supporters argued it would help low income Mainers access medical care without the burden of insurmountable debt. 
After both chambers initially backed a bill (LD 978) to increase the state’s General Assistance reimbursement for municipalities and Indian Tribes, the Senate voted to reconsider and send the legislation back to the health committee, which the House ultimately agreed to do. 
Both the House and Senate backed a provision (LD 1665) that would increase the property tax fairness credit.
LD 953, which sought to align Maine’s definition with the federal definition of a machine gun, was ultimately rejected by both chambers. Critics said they were concerned the change would prohibit any potential future bump stock bans.
With the House voting 75-72 Tuesday, both chambers now passed LD 1867, which prohibits financial institutions and merchants from using firearm codes to track purchases.
A majority of senators and representatives voted to allow Hemphill Farms in Presque Isle to sue the state (LD 1667) over allegations the Department of Conservation, Agriculture and Forestry improperly inspected their seed potato, which they say led to the spread of Bacterial Ring Rot among their customers.
The vast majority of the House (135-12) and Senate (21-14) backed a bill (LD 1228) that would clarify certain terms in the Automotive Right to Repair Laws passed by citizen’s initiative in November 2023. While some lawmakers who voted against the measure argued it was disrespecting the will of the voters, Rep. Tiffany Roberts (D-South Berwick) argued it’s the role of the Legislature to implement the will of the voters. “While slogans win elections, they don’t make good law,” she said.
Nonconcurrence
Members of the House voted 77-69 in support of a proposal (LD 1270) to make the governor’s energy office a cabinet level department and later voted to pass a floor amendment related to labor standards. However, the majority of the Senate (16-19) opposed the measure and then tabled the bill. (Read more about this proposal here).
The House on Tuesday voted 81-67 in favor of LD 556, which would prohibit a municipality from banning a particular energy system or distributor, splitting from the Senate, which rejected the measure. Critics said the measure threatens home-rule and that municipalities should be able to ban dirty fuels. However, supporters argued people shouldn’t be told how to heat their homes.
The majority of the House voted in favor of legislation (LD 532) that would expand state law related to assault on emergency room workers to include all health care workers. The Senate later voted to indefinitely postpone the bill, leaving it in limbo.
House action
Members of the House voted 70-77 against passage of a bill ( LD 746) that would permit municipalities to impose a 2% sales tax on short-term lodging, if approved by referendum, to be used to fund affordable housing. (Read more about this bill here.)

YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, WYO. – Sitting in an old-growth spruce fir forest, Doug Smith says he can see first-hand the impact of reintroducing wolves on the larger ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park.

Long before Yellowstone became the world’s first national park in 1872, wolves thrived in the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
But early Yellowstone rangers killed off the last of the park’s wolves by 1926. By the late 1930s, the federal government had basically eradicated all the wolves in the American West.
That fundamentally changed the ecosystem, as far as Smith is concerned.
“To me it was just pretty scenery because it wasn’t ecologically vibrant,” Smith said.  
Then, in 1995, the U.S. government reintroduced wolves to Idaho and Yellowstone using wolves captured in Canada. 
Smith helped bring them back to the park and was in charge of Yellowstone’s wolf project for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022.
“Yellowstone is a very different place, with and without wolves,” Smith said.
“Wolves definitely have changed this landscape with the help of other predators,” he added. “It’s very different.”
Many of the changes have to do with the wolves’ status as an apex predator, at the top of the food chain. With the loss of wolves and the decline of other predators like cougar and grizzly bears, elk populations surged, Smith said.

Without the threat of wolves throughout much of the 20th century, the elk devoured woody vegetation in Yellowstone, like willows and stands of white bark Aspen trees.
When wolves were reintroduced, they preyed on elk, which reduced the number of elk and put pressure on the remaining animals to keep moving and not graze as long or as heavily in one place.
“I go to willow stands and aspen stands now that I was in 30 years ago, and literally, every single stem was eaten by an elk, and it was at the level of your knee,” Smith said. “And now I go in those stands, and you can lose your partner in them in regrowth of vegetation within 10 feet.”
Scientists debate an effect called the trophic cascade, which deals with how ecosystems are constructed and describes the cascading impact a predator has on its prey further down the food chain.
“Why it’s interesting is when European settlers moved across North America, they killed all the predators,” Smith said. “So you’ve really disrupted this process of a trophic cascade.”
Smith said the debate over the effects of the trophic cascade gets complicated – quickly. He himself falls somewhere in the middle when it comes to buying into the impact and intensity of the effect. But as Smith backpacked near Cache Creek in the northern section of Yellowstone, he said the impact of wolves and other predators is easy to spot. 
“You guys don’t have to be ecologists to see all these Aspen are young,” Smith said. “Within a few years – and, man, give them 20 or 30 (years) – you’re going to have a forest here, and we’re going to be standing in the shade. Totally different ballgame, and I think that’s restoring balance to the ecosystem.”
When vegetation grows back, as the aspen and willows grow tall, that impacts things like beaver populations, which Smith has documented, and even songbirds.
The big picture for Smith? Wolves restored balance that was missing from Yellowstone’s ecosystem when the predators were absent.
“It’s a nice story, too,” Smith said. “We ruined Yellowstone. We’re fixing it by bringing back the top carnivores, most notably wolves.”

For even more information about the impact wolf reintroduction had on the larger ecosystem in Yellowstone National Park, check out Episode 3 of the Howl podcast. During Episode 3 we hike into Yellowstone’s backcountry to see the changes in the ecosystem. And we take a deeper dive into the trophic cascade with Doug Smith, who headed up Yellowstone’s wolf program for nearly 30 years. 
 



Truth be told, most Yellowstone visitors have likely never heard of the trophic cascade or deeply  considered the wolves’ impact on the food chain and the larger ecosystem.
But like the ecosystem, wolves have a powerful effect on many people, too. 
Reintroducing wolves also attracted a new crop of tourists hoping to see a wolf in the wild. And that has had a cascading effect on the local economy.
Wolf-watching tourism has an estimated $80 million total economic impact on the communities surrounding Yellowstone National Park.
Any visitor to the wolves’ stronghold in the park, the Lamar Valley, can see the impact in the many tourists dotting hillsides looking through binoculars and spotting scopes hoping to spot canis lupus in the wild. 
And one wolf, in particular, fascinated wolf watchers for longer than almost any other.
 907: the one-eyed the queen of Yellowstone wolves




Even from a great distance, the old wolf’s large size and limp gave her identity away.
Gray, with a black nose, white legs, a cream-colored belly and a black spot near the base of her tail, wolf 907F stood out from the pack.  
907’s physical scars told the silent story of the struggles wolves endure fighting for control of the rugged Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park. 
Aside from a limp in her front paw, 907 was missing her left eye, the result of an injury park officials first noticed in 2017.

“Whatever tragedy, setback or loss she has, she just keeps on moving forward,” said Rick McIntyre, a retired Yellowstone National Park ranger and author who has studied 907’s pack since it formed.

“Nothing (stops her) – not health problems, getting beat up by a rival, the loss of her mother, the loss of her father, loss of pups,” McIntyre said.
Nobody in the world has seen more wolves in the wild than McIntyre.
He started working at Yellowstone in 1994 as an interpretive wolf ranger and documented his 100,000th wolf sighting in 2019.
Because he has 30 years of experience documenting wolves on a nearly daily basis, it takes a lot for a wolf to stand out to McIntyre.

But 907 accomplished something rare. 
She was able to rise to the rank of alpha female four separate times and control one of the largest wolf packs ever documented in Yellowstone. And while she was at it, 907  gave birth to more litters of pups than any wolf ever studied in Yellowstone and outlasted her rivals long enough to grow old in the wild.
In 2024, 907 turned 11 years old and continued to lead hunts for bison and elk as the oldest wolf in the national park.
By comparison, the average wolf lives for about three or four years in Yellowstone, McIntyre said. Even pet dogs that sleep indoors, receive veterinary care and have a bowl of food waiting for them twice a day don’t always make it to 11.
Because of her longevity and the fact that researchers put a radio collar on her when she was a pup, Yellowstone biologists and wolf watchers were able to study 907 so closely for so long that there are detailed numbers and statistics documenting much of her life. 
For her to reach the age of 11, 907 had to defend her territory from rival wolves and endure 10 snowy, freezing Wyoming winters. She had to fight for most of her meals – sometimes getting kicked in the head by 2,000-pound bison and sent flying through the air.
Her stats are a snapshot of the turbulent life wild wolves face. Throughout her life, Yellowstone National Park staff watched 907 participate in 566 hunts. 
Most of the time she chased bison (281 hunts) or elk (239 times). 
She was successful 33 times, or in about 6% of the hunts that park officials documented.
Yellowstone officials once watched 907 and the Junction Butte Pack endure 12 days without finding anything to eat – only for the pack to triumphantly bring down a bull elk on empty stomachs.
When it comes to numbers, the biggest impact 907 may have had was building up the bloodline of Yellowstone wolves.
In 2024, at the age of 11, she produced her 10th litter of pups. 
That is the most for any wolf in 30 years of wolf research at Yellowstone National Park.
“With her being 11 years old and having new pups that would be somewhat similar to a woman in her mid 80s having kids,” McIntyre said.
Numbers even tell the story of how 907 got her name.
When Yellowstone officials captured 907 and placed a radio collar around her neck in 2013, she got collar No. 907.
Each collar has a unique number to help identify and tell the wolves apart. Biologists use the “F” in 907F to designate her as female, but many people simply called her 907.
The collar allowed park officials to keep close tabs on 907 for more than a decade.
Many of the numbers and statistics about 907 can be found online in the 2024 Yellowstone Wolf, Cougar and Elk Project annual report, as well as previous yearly wolf reports.
 The chance to observe a wolf queen’s long reign attracts tourists to Yellowstone National Park 

Wolf 907 and the Junction Butte Pack’s territory spanned mountains, valleys and creeks within an area called the Lamar Valley, which is in the northern part of Yellowstone National Park on the Wyoming-Montana border. It’s one of the centers of wildlife activity in the park.
For years, 907 dug her den into a hillside covered by a mix of sagebrush and conifer trees overlooking Slough Creek, where 907 and her pack hunted bison and elk.



On a chilly July morning in 2024, the creek meandered through a giant meadow below the den, where bison wallowed as the morning sun crested the nearby mountain peaks. 
The den was a mile or more from the closest road, near the top of a diagonal section of forest. 
Toward the left side of the forest, barely visible to the naked eye from more than a mile away, stood four small clusters of conifer trees. 
At the base of one of the trees, near a patch of light colored dirt, 907 wrestled with two pups, one gray and one black
Unbeknownst to 907, she was often the object of attention from afar. 
And on that morning in July a handful of people with high-powered scopes were watching her every move.
One of the wolf watchers was Laurie Lyman, a schoolteacher originally from California.

Lyman became interested in wolves after realizing that third and fourth graders became more interested in learning about continents if Lyman described the animals that lived there.
One year, Lyman received a copy of Jim Dutcher’s 1997 Emmy Award-winning documentary “Wolves at Our Door,” which Lyman and her students promptly fell in love with.
Something about wolves – how they live in packs that function like a family, where all of the wolves help raise the pups, contribute to hunting and share food – made an immediate impression on Lyman.
Within wolf packs, including 907’s own Junction Butte Pack, biologists have even documented one wolf raising another wolf’s pups. One spring, 907 had a litter of eight pups. Other female members of the Junction Butte Pack who lost their own litters helped 907 raise her large litter  – even taking turns nursing the pups.
Before reintroduction, Lyman was fascinated by the ways the members of wolf packs worked together to take care of each other.
But wolves had been absent from the landscape in the U.S. Rocky Mountains for her entire life, and Lyman assumed she would never see a wolf in the wild.
That’s how wolf reintroduction changed Lyman’s life.
After wolves were reintroduced in 1995, Lyman started hearing about people seeing wild wolves again and she made a trip to see what it was all about.
“When they released them into Yellowstone, when they started to see them, it was incredible, and that was the changing point in my life,” Lyman said.
Lyman retired from teaching in 2005 and bought a house in Montana just outside of Yellowstone’s Northeast Entrance to be closer to wolves.
She became friends with then-Yellowstone Ranger Rick McIntyre and purchased a spotting scope. And for the past 20 years, Lyman has been watching wolves and documenting her sightings online at www.yellowstonereports.com.
Now, she thinks of wolves and wolf packs a lot like students and classrooms.
“It’s very similar to actually teaching my kids, watching the wolves out,” Lyman said. “It’s like watching a recess. Because you have the adults sleeping. And you have the yearlings playing.  And you have the pups and it’s very much like kids in a sandbox, kids playing soccer. And then the older kids sitting in the lunch center talking.”
“My thing is getting to know them on an individual basis, so that I can easily recognize them,” Lyman added.

 If you come at the queen, you best not miss

Thanks to their notes and years of daily field observations, McIntyre and Lyman have major details of 907’s life documented.
Even as a pup, 907 didn’t have it easy.
She was born in 2013, the second year of the Junction Butte Pack’s existence. Before the year was over, 907’s mother died or disappeared, McIntyre said. About that same time, 907’s father, wolf 911, took off, returning to the original wolf pack that he had been born into.
“In human terms, you could say that she was orphaned,” McIntyre said. “However, she was raised by the pack, raised by the family.”
After she became an adult, 907 fought with her twin sister, wolf 969, for control of the Junction Butte Pack.
The two sisters regularly pinned each other to the ground and bit at each other, Lyman said. 
“And they went back and forth several times on who had the alpha female position,” McIntyre said. “907 would have it for a while, the sister would take it away from her and then 907 would get it back.”
In 2017, 907 had a litter of pups and made her den in a remote location away from the rest of the Junction Butte Pack. 
Park officials and wolf watchers noticed that the other adults in the pack stayed away from the den and didn’t appear to bring food to 907 or her pups.

In May, 907 returned to the pack, but her pups had died.
“And to make it worse, while she was desperately trying to save her pups, her sister at the time, 969, took advantage of that situation to seize the alpha position,” McIntyre said. “And when 907 rejoined the pack after losing all of her pups, she was beaten up by her sister and relegated to a very lowly position in the pack.”
“Everything that year was against her,” McIntyre said. 
Even though she was relegated to a subordinate role, 907 didn’t leave the pack.

“She just has this ability to keep on moving forward, rather than dwelling on the past, dwelling on how unfair life has been,” McIntyre said. 
During the 2019-20 winter, the Junction Butte Pack experienced a bloody leadership shakeup.
The female wolves aggressively drove 969 – 907’s sister and rival – out of the pack.
Wolf 969 survived her initial expulsion, but park officials noticed she appeared to be in poor physical condition. 
A few weeks after her exile, 969 encountered the Junction Butte Pack again one January night, leading to a fight.
“The next morning 969F was seen with injuries and she died later that day,” officials wrote in the Yellowstone Wolf Project’s 2020 annual report. “Her injuries were caused by other wolves and she weighed only 33 kilograms (73 pounds).”
Even after her sister and closest rival was killed, 907 continued to face challenges from rival female wolves.
First, it was her sister’s daughter, wolf 1382, who became a problem for 907.
Then wolf 1262 took over as the pack’s alpha female.
Finally it was wolf 1276.
But after 1276 was last seen alive in October 2023, 907 again took her crown as the Junction Butte Pack’s alpha female.
“And this is her fourth term as alpha female, meaning that she lost it three times,” McIntyre said. “And in those cases, it was either to a sister or a niece. So she’s had a lot of hard times in her life, and she’s always been able to fight back and prevail.”
From 2016 to 2024, 907 claimed the rank of alpha female four separate times.
And she gave birth to pups every spring from 2015 to 2024.

For those reasons, Lyman views 907 as the stabilizing force in the Junction Butte Pack and one of her favorite wolves of all time.
“She would just put her head down and walk into the wind no matter what adversity came to her,” Lyman said.
 Ambushed in the dark, a queen makes her last stand in Yellowstone 

Despite her long rivalry with her sister, it turns out 907’s greatest threat came from outside her own pack.
It was just before Christmas 2024 when 907 made her last stand.
During the final few weeks of 2024, the Junction Butte Pack left the invisible, unfenced boundary of Yellowstone National Park and entered Montana, where hunting season was underway.
From Dec. 17 through Dec. 19, hunters legally killed two other adult members of the Junction Butte Pack outside of the park, Yellowstone officials wrote. 
After the shootings, 907 and some of the surviving members of the Junction Butte Pack returned to their home territory in the Lamar Valley inside of Yellowstone.

But the Junction Butte Pack’s numbers were reduced. Lyman said there were only six other wolves with 907 when the final battle went down – and one or two of them may have been pups.
A much larger force of 19 wolves from a different wolf pack, the Rescue Creek Pack, ambushed 907 and the Junction Butte Pack on Dec. 22 after wolf watchers spotted the diminished Junction Butte Pack feeding on an animal carcass.
The attack occurred at night.
Lyman wasn’t there, but she received a phone call from a friend who was.
“She was filming and her camera lights things up so she could see things pretty well,” Lyman said. “She called me and she said, ‘You know, it’s over. They got her.’”
The radio collar 907 was wearing was designed to enter mortality mode and emit a unique signal after several hours passed without any movement from the wolf. Officials didn’t detect a mortality signal from 907 until about three days after the attack, Lyman said.

Lyman was heartbroken thinking about 907 suffering at the end.
It may be impossible to know exactly what went down in the dark woods after the Rescue Creek Pack advanced on 907 and the Junction Butte Pack.
But this much seems certain.
907 went out fighting.
She died fighting a larger, rival wolf pack that had attacked her and the Junction Butte Pack – the family she lived with her entire life with.
No other members of the Junction Butte Pack died in the attack from the Rescue Creek wolves.
That means 907’s pack, including some of her pups and nieces, lived on without her. 
Strange as it sounds, Lyman takes comfort in that.
Despite the sadness, people like Lyman were happy that 907 lived and died naturally, as wolves did before humans became a factor. 
At least 907 wasn’t shot by hunters, like 15 other members of the Junction Butte Pack who were killed when they strayed outside of the park’s boundaries, Lyman said. 
The same week 907 died, her counterpart, the alpha male of the Junction Butte Pack, was killed by a poacher. The alpha male, who did not have a number or a radio collar, was killed Dec. 24, while the wolf was outside of Yellowstone National Park, in Montana. 
After living to be the fifth-oldest wolf ever recorded in Yellowstone and having more litters of pups than any Yellowstone wolf since the species was reintroduced 30 years ago, 907 went out fighting. 
“This is a wolf in the wild, and this is what wolves do,” Lyman said. “They’re wired to rise to the top to survive, and this is what they have to do to do it.”
“She just did what she had to do to make sure that her pack survived,” Lyman said. “So to me, she is a key to the Junctions surviving until now. And her legacy is in those three females that are left there in the pack.”
That’s one of the gifts of a wolf, Lyman said. 
“Just like a regular family does, you pass down what you know and help them learn to survive. And she really did that.”

(Getty Images)A settlement with Indiana coal producers, announced Tuesday, could lead to third-party operation of coal units at Duke Energy Indiana’s Cayuga Generating Station.
In a news release, President Stan Pinegar said the agreement with trade association Reliable Energy “is aligned with” coal-focused executive action from Gov. Mike Braun.
The utility’s request to spend an estimated $3.3 billion — or $5.3 billion with financing costs — on new gas units at Cayuga is still pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

The project would add more than 470 megawatts to the aging facility’s 1005-megawatt capacity. After more than 55 years in operation, Cayuga is the oldest coal-fired facility left in Duke’s Hoosier portfolio.
The utility previously planned to replace and retire the existing coal units.
But now — if regulators approve the plan — Duke has agreed to perform an engineering study to evaluate the technical feasibility of continued operation of the coal units by third parties that may be interested in purchasing them.
Duke would issue a request for proposal to solicit interest in the coal units, which could be available for sale after the two proposed gas units are operational in 2029 and 2030, according to the news release.
“The settlement is aligned with (Braun’s) recent executive orders aimed at making sure there’s a careful evaluation before retiring coal units and encouraging additions to the state’s power supplies,” Pinegar said. “The new natural gas units we’ve proposed add additional, highly efficient power capacity to Indiana’s electric grid.”
Reliable Energy President Savannah Kerstiens said the agreement is a “meaningful step toward preserving reliable, in-state power generation for Hoosiers.”
She praised Braun and Indiana Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski for their leadership, remarking that their “continued commitment to Indiana’s energy resilience made this outcome achievable.”
“As the state works to attract new investment and grow the economy, ensuring affordable electricity for working families means keeping every option on the table to maintain generation capacity,” Kerstiens added.
Age: not just a number
Cayuga’s coal units were built with estimated 30-year lifespans and have already operated for almost twice as long as expected, according to rebuttal testimony Pinegar filed late last month.
They “have reached the end of their useful lives from the Company’s perspective,” he wrote.
Performing the upgrades needed to further extend those lifespans “overlooks the additional maintenance required and increased reliability issues experienced by aging generating units,” Pinegar continued.
He added that Cayuga’s coal units have been and remain at risk of being derated due to operational constraints like river water temperature.
Ratepayer protection agency recommends against Duke’s coal-to-gas push

“We believe retirement of the units is in the best interest of our customers. That Duke Energy Indiana plans to permanently cease generating electricity from the Cayuga coal units, however, does not necessarily mean these units must cease operations altogether,” Pinegar wrote.
Duke plans to repurpose many of the coal-related assets to “reduce costs for customers.”
But if a third party does want to take over the coal units, it would be responsible for procuring the interconnection, air permit, and other assets required to continue or restart operations.
Such activities “can and should be done without impacting affordability for our existing retail customers,” per Pinegar’s rebuttal testimony.
If the natural gas project is approved, Duke estimates that the first tracker filed would add $1.87 to the typical residential customer’s monthly bill.
But that amount would rise as construction continues; the state agency tasked with protecting utility consumers estimated a total impact of $19.37 monthly. The Office of Utility Consumer Counselor in May asked regulators to reject the plan, which it described as “ill-advised.”
Duke contends the pay-as-you-go approach will “smooth out” the impact to customers and save them an estimated $812 million over the life of the revamped facility.

,WyoFile,2025-06-18 10:25:00+00:00,WyoFile,"Wyoming worker exodus threatens economic decline, business council says",Dustin Bleizeffer,,,,,https://wyofile.com/wyoming-worker-exodus-threatens-economic-decline-business-council-says/,"

The state agency proposes ""major"" reforms to a business loan program, and a broader discussion on Wyoming's economic future.
The post Wyoming worker exodus threatens economic decline, business council says appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming is experiencing a workforce exodus that will set the state on a long-term economic decline unless it grapples with how to enable communities to attract quality, knowledge-based jobs to compete with surrounding states, the Wyoming Business Council’s top officials say.
“What we’re finding is that, by and large, the [job] opportunities in Wyoming are not good enough, and there aren’t enough of them to retain our youth,” the council’s CEO, Josh Dorrell, told WyoFile. “It’s actually not just the youth. We noticed that our out-migration was twice that of the national average, where we have more out-migration than any other state.”
Some 60% to 70% of Wyoming-born residents permanently leave the state by the time they are 30, according to analysis prepared for the business council. Businesses looking to expand or open up shop in the state report that the available workforce is their No. 1 constraint, creating a “chicken-and-egg” crisis that will require several strategies to overcome, Dorrell said, including — potentially — reforming Wyoming’s tax-and-revenue system currently built around its extractive industries.

Wyoming Business Council CEO Josh Dorrell.
“They want places that have a vibrant workforce,” Dorrell said. “They don’t want a lot of the things that we think are important, like low taxes. Very rarely, if ever, do we hear a company say, ‘We like you because of your low taxes.’ It just doesn’t happen.”
The business council began ringing alarm bells in May when it was scheduled to appear before the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee. It prepared a presentation highlighting the problem, “long-term economic decline in Wyoming,” and proposed policy changes to address it. The committee ran out of time to hear the business council and rescheduled the discussion for its next meeting July 29-30 in Casper.
Reformations
Wyoming’s long-beleaguered tax-and-revenue system that stunts economic growth is at the root of the problem, according to both the business council and the Wyoming Association of Municipalities. That’s a larger conversation for lawmakers, they say. For its part, the council wants to reform its own Business Ready Community grant and loan program.
The program, which typically requires a small match, is intended to help towns and counties fund business-related infrastructure, like extending water and sewer to business parks. But it has proven ineffective in the face of increasing competition for businesses that require a skilled workforce for knowledge-based jobs, according to Dorrell and his team. 
From 2004 to 2019, more than $416 million has been granted to support 396 projects across the state. “And what we found,” Dorrell said, “is that it has not made the difference that it should have.”
Wyoming’s gross domestic product has lagged behind neighboring states. (Wyoming Business Council)
What’s needed are projects that enable businesses to tap into infrastructure and that improve the quality of life throughout the community. The focus, Dorrell said, should be more broadly rooted in community-wide resiliency. Rawlins, for example, can extend water lines to a business center, but that wouldn’t fix the town’s larger need to modernize its water system throughout the community where workers would live.
That particular concept “is on the right track, fundamentally,” Wyoming Association of Municipalities Executive Director Ashley Harpstreith said. “If you’re looking at the core of what government should be doing to be ready for businesses, it does come back to infrastructure and adequately funding our infrastructure.”
But the other reforms the business council proposes for the program will be hard to swallow for towns and counties. The council proposes increasing the grant and loan program’s required match to a minimum of 25%. The purpose, according to the business council, is to entice communities to raise more of their own revenue via the optional sales tax and mill levies.
“When we put a little pressure on leaders in our communities, they always rise to the occasion,” Wyoming Business Council Chief Strategy Officer Sarah Fitz-Gerald said. Raising the match requirement will force local leaders to engage more closely with residents about how they want to secure their economic future and, ideally, result in smarter business projects, Fitz-Gerald added.
Harpstreith doesn’t necessarily disagree with the premise, she said. But local governments have long struggled to increase their revenues via optional sales taxes and mills. Communities are even in a tighter pinch now that lawmakers slashed property taxes by 25%.
“I just think it’s going to highlight, honestly, the inability for locals to raise funds right now in these trying times,” Harpstreith said. “But I also think, on the positive side, it does really realign the [Business Ready Community] program the way I think it was initially intended.”Click here to learn more about the business council’s proposed rules changes regarding the Business Ready Community program.

The arc of human history on our planet has been one of conquest, columnist Rod Miller opines. 
The post We are all standing on stolen land appeared first on WyoFile .","I got some pushback on my last column for not calling the public lands in the United States “stolen land.” I’ll clarify that misunderstanding in this column.

Opinion

As you read this, you are occupying stolen land. No matter where you are in the world, you are standing on stolen land. No matter which continent, no matter who you are.
Every acre, every square inch of the planet Earth has changed hands at some time in history, most often by violence. That is simply the nature of history. That is the nature of humanity. And, no matter how you wish it were otherwise, or how wrong you think it is, there’s nothing you can do to change that fact.
This will not be my most popular column. Many of you will misconstrue this rant as either a liberal or a conservative viewpoint. It’s not, it’s history. You likely don’t want to hear this, and you will probably be outraged. But you are standing on stolen land.
This reality is helping to drive the protests in Los Angeles and elsewhere. We are seeing an outburst of emotional indignation by those rising up against ICE and that agency’s actions to deport undocumented immigrants from Mexico. Waving Mexican flags, protesters claim that California was “stolen” from Mexico.
California was not stolen; it was purchased in 1848 by the United States at the end of the Mexican-American War. But it was purchased from a nation that had “stolen” it from prior occupants, who had themselves stolen it from previous “owners.”
By violence. By being more powerful.
This is the same dynamic at work in the Middle East today, between Israel and the current and former occupants of Palestine. The same forces were at work in the 20th Century when European colonial powers lost their grip on Africa.
Go back further in history, to the “barbarian” conquest of the Roman Empire, to the Persian incursion northward into Greece. Go back further to the Neanderthal supplanting the Cro-Magnon. History is full of examples of people conquering people who conquered other people. Since humans walked out of Africa on two legs, this has been how we have behaved.
The arc of human history on our planet has been one of conquest. For a hundred millennia, humans of all races on all continents have conquered and taken land from fellow humans. Every skin color in the crayon box has stolen land from folks of the same color. They have killed them, enslaved them and sometimes eaten them. Guilt can be placed on no single culture nor any single empire.
Ancient cultures have been swept aside by invaders and lost to memory. Laws, customs, beliefs and knowledge held dear by the conquered people are replaced by those of the interlopers. It must be something in human DNA that makes us do this to one another. Perhaps it is a deeply rooted acquisitiveness in our nature, a lust to exercise power, to dominate and take by force what others own.
And it is perhaps this historic phenomenon that irks people and prompts them to protest a perceived “injustice” and to demand that stolen land be returned to the rightful owners. This, in my opinion, is nothing more than a lazy virtue signal that rolls easily off the tongue when shouted through a bullhorn during a protest. But it turns a blind eye toward reality.
Aside from the impracticality of returning the surface of the Earth to the original “owners,” it begs the uneasy question of to whom it should be returned.
Should the Black Hills, for example, be returned to the Sioux? Or should it be returned to the tribes that the Sioux drove off in order to occupy the Black Hills? Or to the unnamed people who lived there before they were, in turn, driven off?
Who is in a moral position to make that determination?
That conundrum prevails across the face of our planet, because there is nowhere that the original “owners” of the land still control it. Nowhere.
Seen in this light, land reparations are a surrogate issue for something deeper that bothers us. We have in our American nature the genetic makeup of both conquerors and the conquered. All people share that. And what might disturb us the most, might drive us into the streets in protest, is this inconsistency within us, this deep realization that power over others ultimately prevails in our world, no matter how much we might wish otherwise.
As you read this, we all live on stolen land. And the fact of the matter is that we stole it from ourselves. Cassius, in Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar,” nailed it when he said, “The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our stars. But in ourselves, that we are underlings.”

GEORGETOWN – The Sussex County Council has unanimously approved a $285.1 million operating budget for the 2026 fiscal year, marking a significant financial shift as the county adopts its first new property tax rate in decades following a court-mandated reassessment.
The budget, passed after a public hearing on Tuesday night, reflects a 7.3% increase over the current year’s spending plan.
The increase is largely driven by capital investments in wastewater infrastructure and public services. The new fiscal year begins July 1.
A key feature of the 2026 budget is the adjustment of the property tax rate from 44.5 cents to 2.14 cents per $100 of assessed value.
“This is a historic budget in that sense, but it remains true to what has been a familiar theme throughout the years in Sussex County,” County Administrator Todd Lawson said. “And that’s one of providing the highest quality services at the best possible value for our customers.”

Although the rate has dropped dramatically, the move is designed to keep revenues steady after higher property values were assessed during the recent countywide reassessment.
Officials say the change maintains “revenue neutrality,” ensuring the county collects roughly the same amount in property taxes as it did last year.
The budget is funded by a mix of revenue sources, including realty transfer taxes, sewer and water service fees, building permits, and document recording fees. Several of these fees will see modest increases in the coming year.
Budget details
Notable spending highlights include:

$76.7 million for wastewater infrastructure projects, including expansions and upgrades.
$7.4 million for open space and farmland preservation.
An increase in funding for supplemental state police coverage, from $4.6 million to $5.8 million.
$6 million in aid for local fire companies and ambulance squads.
$1.25 million dedicated to affordable housing initiatives.
$2.4 million for planning and constructing new paramedic stations in Dewey Beach, Lincoln, and Milton.

Finance Director Gina A. Jennings emphasized the County’s commitment to balancing rising service demands with fiscal discipline.
County Council President Doug Hudson praised the plan, citing its responsiveness to inflationary pressures and population growth.
“Whether it’s a household budget or a government budget, we all can feel the squeeze of inflation and increasing demand on our pocketbooks and wallets,”  Hudson said. “The Council recognizes that. I’m proud of the work this County does year to year in respecting the value of the taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars, and that’s clearly what’s driving this budget, one that keeps costs in check, but recognizes the ever-changing needs of our growing community.”

Colorado lawmakers from both parties have denounced the politically targeted shootings against Minnesota state lawmakers on June 14, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)More than 40 Colorado elected officials as of Tuesday have requested the redaction of their addresses and other personal information from the state’s online campaign finance database. The Colorado secretary of state suspended the website on Saturday, due to safety concerns in the aftermath of shootings targeting two Minnesota Democratic lawmakers.
Melissa Hortman, the Minnesota House Democratic leader, and her husband Mark Hortman were shot and killed this weekend by a man who came to their home posing as a police officer, federal officials said. Vance Boelter, 57, faces charges for the murders, as well as for the shootings of Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette Hoffman, who are expected to recover.
Colorado lawmakers have condemned the shootings, and many are taking additional safety precautions. Colorado House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Democrat from Dillon, said in a statement that “what happened in Minnesota has shaken us to our very core.”

“Our democracy is based on the idea that we resolve our differences through peaceful debate and in courts, elected bodies, state legislatures and the halls of Congress, not political violence,” she said.
Colorado Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, said he has “been in close and ongoing communication” with the Colorado State Patrol, and he has adjusted his driving patterns when going to work, for safety reasons.
“This assassination and targeted attack in Minnesota was a tragedy and a disturbing escalation of political violence in our country,” Coleman said in an interview Tuesday. “It’s understandable that legislators are concerned for their safety and the safety of their families. I am for myself and my family.”
Colorado political candidates submit their campaign finance information, which is posted in the online database, known as TRACER, to comply with state election transparency laws. The website includes their home addresses, phone numbers and other personal information. 
The secretary of state is allowing lawmakers to redact personal information online that is not required to be public based on a campaign finance rule that protects “any person who believes their safety or the safety of an immediate family member may be in jeopardy.”
A spokesperson for the Colorado secretary of state’s office said there is not a specific time anticipated for when TRACER will be online again, but it will be “back up soon.”
Colorado House Minority Leader Rose Pugliese, a Colorado Springs Republican, said in a statement about the Minnesota shootings that “violence has no place in our politics. Not now. Not ever.”
“This is an unconscionable act of violence,” Pugliese said. “There is absolutely no justification for targeted attacks on elected officials — or anyone — based on their political beliefs. Our nation was built on civil discourse and the peaceful exchange of ideas, not horrific acts of violence. We are keeping the families of Rep. Hortman and Senator Hoffman in our prayers.”
Coleman called for respect and less negativity in political interactions nationwide. He emphasized that he serves both Democrats and Republicans, and said the safety of all state lawmakers, as well as Coloradans as a whole, is a top priority. 
“I keep my head on a swivel,” Coleman said. “We always need to be aware of our surroundings and not get caught off guard, but we can’t live in fear. We focus on what we can control.”

The four-member committee unanimously approved Senate Bill 54, which would exempt projects from prevailing wage provisions if they were paid for using a bond or bond proposal approved before the state reinstated prevailing wage requirements for publicly funded construction projects.
Three of the four members voted to approve Senate Bill 319, with the committee’s sole Republican member, Sen. Thomas Albert of Lowell, voting against the policy. 
The bill would make staffing levels a mandatory subject amid collective bargaining discussions with police and fire departments. However, if a municipality collected less sales tax and property tax revenue than the previous fiscal year, those discussions are voluntary, rather than required. 
While the bill received support from the Michigan Professional Fire Fighters Union and the Police Officers Association of Michigan during the committee’s previous meeting, the Michigan Sheriffs’ Association, alongside several local government groups and local officials, stood opposed to the policy. 
The Michigan Municipal League cited concerns about the policy’s long term cost, arguing the exemption does not paint an accurate picture of a locality’s funds.
“Contracts are typically multi-year agreements. To take a single look in the year you happen to be negotiating would be fiscally irresponsible. This lookback would not accurately reflect the costs associated with staffing or other contractual costs. …It is an oversimplification and fails to address inflationary trends, contractual raises, health care costs, and the numerous other community expenses,” the League’s Legislative Associate Dave Hodgkins wrote in a letter to the committee.
Both bills await further consideration on the Senate floor.

The daily deliberations about what to have for dinner are a moot point – because there’s only one source of food. For every meal, every day, you dutifully head to the Monopoly Cafe.
At first, this arrangement seemed OK. It’s not the best cafe, but they always spoke of their plans to make it better, cleaner, and serve healthier food. It seems weird that the owners are guaranteed 10% profits every year, even as they make some questionable business decisions. But you stick it out, not wanting to complain. Besides, you have no choice anyway.
There’s no menu at the Monopoly Cafe, you get what’s served and if you don’t like it you can just go home hungry. There’s no option on the price, either – it’s expensive day in and day out. Recently they raised the price a whole lot, claiming they’re just catching up to the market and they won’t need to raise prices again for a while. Well, you can guess what happened next. They raised the prices even more.
And then there’s the food. This stuff is the worst, rubbery gristle you can imagine. Every so often, the management of the Monopoly Cafe holds a few “listening sessions” to get input on the food. Townspeople show up and stand in line to share their ideas. People express their visions for fresh meats, fruits, and vegetables. Our town has abundant potential to grow top-quality natural and local foods, so why aren’t we doing that instead of eating rubbery gristle?
After lengthy consideration, the Monopoly Cafe’s Board of Directors flies into town on their private jets to announce the new menu: More rubbery gristle! You see, there are special state laws that allow the cafe to layer on even more profit for rubbery gristle, so they’re happy to sell you even more of what you don’t want.
The locals are over it. They came up with a nickname for the Monopoly Cafe: The Neighborhood’s Worst Eatery. The name sticks, and soon everyone is referring to the Monopoly by its nickname, “NWE.”
The NWE management has yet another trick to enrich themselves. They toss all the garbage from the restaurant into the ditch behind the cafe. Piles of rotting gristle accumulate in foamy ponds, which overflow into the nearby creek. The creek used to be your town’s drinking water until it became contaminated. Cleaning up that mess is gonna be expensive one day, and you’ll have no choice but to pay for it. But NWE reminds you it’s a small price to pay for the treat of dining on rubbery gristle every day.
Your patience for the Monopoly Cafe is worn thin. You hate to see your kids eating the least healthy food imaginable, and you learn that cafes in other states use locally-grown foods that cost less. How is it possible that you’re stuck with the worst food and the highest prices? Don’t you have any recourse?
Amazingly, you do.
The People Supervising Cafes are in charge of making sure the cafe treats you right. Let’s call them the “PSC” for short.
The state government and the PSC are supposed to rein in the Neighborhood’s Worst Eatery – they can require better food, a cleaner restaurant, and lower prices. But weirdly, they never have. They’ve approved everything NWE asked for, leaving you stuck with the bill and a chronic case of heartburn. To make a bad situation even worse, lately NWE has decided to just go rogue, sidestepping the PSC’s authority and doing whatever they want. They’re betting that no one will stop them.
This metaphor seems outrageous, right? But it illustrates the situation NorthWestern Energy has created. It might feel hopeless but it isn’t. The PSC (Public Service Commission) now has a golden opportunity to rein in NorthWestern Energy.
We’ve all put up with expensive gristle for way too long. It’s time for Montana’s regulators to hold NWE accountable, restore the balance of power, and stop rewarding bad behavior.
Wouldn’t that be delicious?

In a legislative session dominated by the GOP supermajority’s conservative agenda, Tennessee lawmakers this spring took the unusual, bipartisan step of protecting certain reproductive rights.
Beginning July 1, Tennessee will become the first — and only — state in the South to have codified the right to access fertility treatments and birth control into state law.
Introduced by two Republican women and signed into law by Gov. Bill Lee, the legislation protects Tennesseans’ access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and a range of birth control methods — reproductive health options that have not, in modern times, been restricted in the state, but now have safeguards into the future.
Backers of the bill, among them progressive groups and conservative Republicans who have expanded their families through the use of IVF, called the legislation a needed win for preserving access to care.
“The law provides critical stability and peace of mind in an otherwise volatile political environment for women and families,” said Natalie Schilling of AWAKE Tennessee, which advocates for the rights of children and women. 
Despite bipartisan support, however, the legislation was nearly derailed during its last debate on the House floor, a potential signal for future legislative fights that still loom over efforts to restrict access to IVF some Republicans have already indicated they intend to bring next year.
After the bill passed narrowly in the House, 11 Republicans called the legislation a “Trojan horse that could potentially undermine Tennessee’s strong and righteous stance on the protection of innocent human life” in a letter that unsuccessfully sought Lee’s veto of the bill.

The 11th hour pushback caught Rep. Iris Rudder by surprise. Rudder, a Republican from Winchester, cosponsored the legislation with Republican Sen. Becky Massey of Knoxville. 
“I thought it was such a simple bill that said we just want to codify access to contraceptives and IVF,” she said in an interview with the Lookout.  “I had no idea it would mushroom the way it did. It opened my eyes. It really did,” she said. 
The legislation had sailed through legislative committees and earned a unanimous vote from the state Senate. Yet by the time it reached a vote on the House floor in early April, many of its Republican supporters sat silent during debate. 
“I was looking out at the House floor and I was thinking, I am standing here as a woman and this is such an important issue for women,” Rudder said. “Most of those men are married. They have wives. They have daughters. They should be able to understand how important all these conversations are to women.”
‘Here I am asking you guys to get on board’ 
The Fertility Treatment and Contraceptive Protection Act runs just five sentences long:
“The law of this state clearly and unambiguously acknowledges the right of a healthcare provider to perform, and the right of a person to receive or use, fertility treatment and contraceptives in this state,” it says in part. 
The legislation was introduced in the aftermath of a first-of-its kind Alabama Supreme Court decision that jeopardized access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) in that state – and broader concerns that efforts to restrict abortion access could extend to birth control.
Rudder said she brought the legislation after women and families across the state implored her to protect their access to IVF and birth control.
The measure is similar to unsuccessful legislation brought last year by Democrats Rep. Harold Love, Jr. of Nashville and Sen. Raumesh Akbari of Memphis, both Democrats. That bill would have made explicit that Tennessee’s near total abortion ban does not endanger fertility treatments or access to contraceptive care. 










I was looking out at the House floor and I was thinking, I am standing here as a woman and this is such an important issue for women. Most of those men are married. They have wives. They have daughters. They should be able to understand how important all these conversations are to women.


– Rep. Iris Rudder, R-Winchester


Unlike the Democrats’ bill, the Fertility Treatment and Contraceptive Protection Act makes no mention of the word “abortion.”
Rudder supports Tennessee’s near-total abortion ban and considers her legislation a wholly separate issue. During House debate over the bill, however, some Republicans argued the issues are intertwined.  
Rep. Gino Bulso, a Brentwood Republican, unsuccessfully sought to amend the bill to regulate the disposal of unused embryos in IVF treatment to “reaffirm that an embryo is a child.” The legislation, he argued, would create a “right to create and destroy human embryos without qualification, limitation or restriction,” contrary to the state’s recent anti-abortion history.
Republican Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson said he opposed the bill because it would make it difficult for lawmakers to introduce subsequent legislation protecting embryos. 
Rep Chris Todd, a Republican representing Madison county, called the bill “absolutely unnecessary.” He argued the bill would allow for “genetic testing to weed out embryos with undesirable genetic traits.” 
And Rep. Timothy Hill, a Blountville Republican, noted that the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and other groups that support abortion rights supported the legislation, giving him pause. 
“The bottom line is today you cast your vote not with a friend, not with a colleague, but with an organization that stands against life,” he warned colleagues on the House floor ahead of a vote on the legislation.

“Let’s get something the ACLU has a problem with and let’s come back here next year and get it right,” he sid.
Rudder, who stood for nearly 45 minutes in the well of the House defending the bill at times, emotionally, pushed back. She noted that President Donald Trump has signaled his support to protect IVF access. 
“Yes, I am your friend,” she told Republican colleagues. “But I don’t stand here as your friend. I stand here as a woman who believes this is important to families in Tennessee. 
“I stand with women in this state and families in this state that want the ability to have these precious babies they may not have the opportunity to have otherwise.”
Later, she said in an interview with the Lookout, she had been “naive” in thinking the legislation would easily pass muster with all of her Republican colleagues. She said she was grateful that Rep. Esther Helton-Haynes, an East Ridge Republican, stood beside her in the well. “She was the only woman legislator that did,” she said.
“When I walked in there (the House floor), I had 61 votes,” she said. “When I walked out, I had 54.
“The conversation just went in such a different direction,” Rudder said. “When I went into the debate, I just wanted them to know that for women in this state, it’s so important. I was very emotional saying, ‘here I am asking you guys to get on board and understand what this bill actually does.’ I think they missed the point.”

The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.

In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

(Photo courtesy of the New Jersey Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson)A state correctional officer was arrested for allegedly accepting bribes to smuggle tobacco and other contraband to people incarcerated at Northern State Prison in Newark, the New Jersey attorney general’s office announced Tuesday.
Senior Correctional Officer Christopher Santana, 32, of Hackensack, was charged with bribery in official and political matters, official misconduct, and contraband. Investigators with the state Office of Public Integrity and Accountability found that he allegedly accepted about $2,000 in bribes to smuggle contraband into the mixed-security lockup in a scheme that started around May 2024, the attorney general’s office said.
The arrest comes as state Department of Corrections officials struggle to contain drug activity behind bars, where several overdoses have resulted in wrongful death lawsuits and accusations of pervasive drug-smuggling. The department converted last year to a mail-scanning system to foil people who spray synthetic marijuana, fentanyl, and other drugs onto paper disguised as mail.
A department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
The investigators who charged Santana saw him arrive for his night shift on June 10 with “a large bulge” in his clothing, the attorney general’s office said. They searched him and discovered two vacuum-sealed bags containing suspected tobacco and three bottles of an unknown liquid under his protective vest and near his thigh, the office said.
Investigators searched incarcerated people suspected of conspiring with Santana in the smuggling scheme and found a cellphone, suspected tobacco, suspected marijuana, and pills suspected to be illegal drugs, the office said. The contraband was seized.
“This type of behavior damages the public’s perception of the many hardworking, honest officers who every day do the difficult, essential work of overseeing correctional institutions across our state,” Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a statement.
Santana, who payroll records show makes $70,630 a year, faces up to 25 years in prison and $315,000 in fines, if convicted.

2.	“Meeting with equity licensees, I heard overwhelmingly from them in large numbers that they're highly concerned about the bill out of the house to raise the license cap,” said Kimberly Roy, a member of the Cannabis Control Commission. “My concern is about consolidation and the Walmart effect, where you're left with a few big box stores and not many local[...]","THE MASSACHUSETTS HOUSE unanimously passed a wide-ranging cannabis bill on June 4 that would allow a single business to own double the number of dispensaries currently allowed by law. But the cannabis industry remains deeply divided on the policy change.
In 2017, the legislature capped the number of retail cannabis stores owned by a single entity at three. The intention was to keep bigger companies – particularly those that operate in multiple states – from buying up large swaths of the state’s cannabis market and make it harder for smaller companies or single owners to compete.
The new cannabis bill would raise the cap to six, allowing cannabis operators to purchase an additional license each year until they hit the cap. It would also allow a single entity to own up 35 percent equity in an unlimited number of cannabis businesses (up from 10 percent) before the ownership stake counts towards the cap. 
Increasing the cap has been pitched as a way to create more opportunities for bigger companies to buy struggling cannabis stores and thereby provide an exit ramp for failing cannabis businesses that want to sell. But there has been opposition to this change from business owners, non-profit leaders, and even a current commissioner on the Cannabis Control Commission who warn that raising the cap presents a dire threat to locally-owned and social-equity operated businesses.
In April, nearly 60 business leaders and advocates in the cannabis industry signed a letter urging legislators to continue to cap the number of dispensaries any business can own at three. They argued that strong ownership limits in the state are key to fostering a competitive and diverse industry that has a place for social equity business owners.
“It’s going to create pretty catastrophic market conditions for independent small businesses who don’t want to give up some of their…ownership control over to multi-state operators,” said Kevin Gilnack, deputy director of the cannabis advocacy group Equitable Opportunities Now. “And it’s going to undermine the Legislature’s goal of empowering communities harmed by the war on drugs.”
The change could help prevent businesses from having to close their doors and allow owners who are going out of business to preserve their finances, said Ryan Dominguez, the head of the Massachusetts Cannabis Coalition, another advocacy group for the cannabis industry.
The increase in the equity ownership ceiling to 35 percent is meant to bring more investment from bigger companies into cannabis businesses struggling to secure capital. 
“We’re just trying to give people and business owners different options on how they want to deal with their businesses,” said Dominguez. 
Current Commissioner Kimberly Roy and former Commissioner Shaleen Title both submitted testimony to the Legislature’s cannabis committee in support of keeping the license cap at three. Raising the cap, they argued, could lead to market consolidation, price manipulation, locally owned and operated social equity businesses being undercut by conglomerates with wholesale purchasing power, and other unintended consequences.
“Meeting with equity licensees, I heard overwhelmingly from them in large numbers that they’re highly concerned about the bill out of the house to raise the license cap,” Roy told CommonWealth Beacon. “My concern is about consolidation and the Walmart effect, where you’re left with a few big box stores and not many locally owned and operated ones.”
Dominguez said that raising the license cap from three to six is a compromise. There were bills under consideration that sought to increase the cap to nine or more. It won’t just be multistate operators who would come into the market to gobble up the cannabis companies, but local businesses would be able to merge to become midsized companies, he added.
Gyasi Sellers, owner of cannabis delivery company Treevit, which operates under a social equity license type, supports raising the license cap and the ownership limits. He said his business is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and that no one has been willing to buy or invest in his business while the cap on ownership remains. Sellers believes that an infusion of money from a larger company could save his company.
“My entire livelihood, my entire business, depends on this change,” said Seller. “Anything’s better than closing the doors and shutting down the operations. Anything’s better than that. That’s the nightmare.” 
The Massachusetts Cannabis Equity Council, a group of 18 cannabis business owners with social equity licenses, has come out against increasing the license cap and argues that this policy change will harm social equity operators and locally-owned cannabis shops the most. 
“From an equity standpoint, I have a lot of concerns regarding lifting the cap because it seems to be antithetical to the underlying motivation of keeping the industry a level playing field for all, especially for social equity applicants,” said Kobie Evans, co-owner of Pure Oasis, the first recreational dispensary in Boston and the first Black-owned store in the state.
Evans said that raising the cap could lead to “a Walmart effect” where one company can have six dispensaries and up to 35 percent stake in an unlimited number of companies, giving them more purchasing power. A company with six retail stores can buy larger quantities, negotiate a lower price for cannabis products and therefore sell them at lower prices than a smaller company with fewer stores. 
“Multi-state operators already dominate shelf space and capital. Expanding their footprint could wipe out the very businesses the state set out to empower,” said Phil Smith, owner of Freshly Baked Co. of Taunton, another social equity licensee. “I understand why some equity operators may want to sell. It’s hard to stay afloat in this market, and bigger players have the capital to get deals done. But if the state allows growth without guardrails, it won’t be a free market, it’ll be a foreclosure.”
In addition to doubling the license cap, the House cannabis bill would increase purchasing and possession limits for cannabis, restructure the Cannabis Control Commission, crack down on hemp-derived intoxicating products, and loosen existing requirements for medical marijuana businesses. The Senate has not indicated any urgency in taking up the cannabis bill. 
Nike John, the owner of The Heritage Club dispensary in Boston and one of the first licensees under the Cannabis Control Commission’s social equity program, has been advocating for the license cap to stay at three. Social equity businesses largely agree on preserving the license cap but aren’t being heard in this debate, she says.
“It seems like they’re doing this without consulting equity operators,” said John. “We’ve reached out, haven’t been able to meet with anybody, and this bill is already here.

(Photo courtesy of Visit Fargo-Moorhead)As super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.
And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”










Now they’ve seen measles in their community so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’


– Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas


In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”
 Outbreak moves north

In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”

Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas
According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 13, there are 1,197 confirmed cases affecting 34 states. Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
There have been 21 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Isiah Holmes | Wisconsin Examiner)Every day, I work on the frontlines of the addiction and overdose crisis here in Charleston, a crisis that has hit West Virginia harder than any other state in the nation. This work is difficult. 
As a clinical psychologist, I sit with people as they recall name after name of friends and loved ones lost to overdose. I listen as people recount their own near-misses and overflowing of gratitude for life saving overdose reversal medications.
But all of this work is at risk because of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that was adopted by the House of Representatives last month and is now before the U.S. Senate. This legislation slashes Medicaid by around $800 billion and will harm millions of people across the country, including 507,000 West Virginians who are only able to access critical health care because of this life-saving program.
Medicaid is the largest provider of addiction treatment in the country, providing coverage for 56% of people who utilize medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) and 64% of people who receive outpatient treatment for their OUD. Over 34,000 West Virginians rely on Medicaid for addiction services that would otherwise be unavailable. The majority of my patients with OUD use Medicaid to access lifesaving treatment and care. I have seen, over and over, how Medicaid saves and changes lives.
Cabin Creek Health Systems is a Federally Qualified Health Center that operates six integrated primary care clinics and eight school-based clinics across Kanawha County. Our goal has been, and always will be, to provide care to anyone, regardless of their ability to pay. Medicaid is a critical piece to achieving this goal that allows us to meet our patients where they are, financially, and still keep the lights on. If passed, Medicaid cuts would make it extremely difficult for many of my patients and others across Cabin Creek Health Systems to receive the care they depend on — from primary care to behavioral health, to our black lung clinic and addiction treatment programs.
One of the most harmful provisions in the bill — the work reporting requirement — forces many people on Medicaid to update the government every month on how many hours they have worked. If they fail to comply, they will lose their health care coverage.
As many as 110,000 hardworking and otherwise eligible West Virginians could lose their health care, simply because they sent the wrong form, couldn’t pick up enough shifts at work, or needed to take care of a loved one. The members of Congress who support this provision mistakenly believe it encourages people to work. The reality is that most people on Medicaid already work. These work reporting requirements would create a web of red tape that will push thousands of people off Medicaid.
We saw this very situation following the unwinding of expanded Medicaid access that occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of West Virginians — many of whom met all eligibility requirements — were suddenly left in a panic when they walked in for medical appointments only to find out they had lost their health insurance overnight, often due to something as simple as forgetting to notify Medicaid of a change of address or phone number.
While we were able to continue care for our patients and assist many in the long and arduous process of re-applying, many other health systems were not equipped for this, and many patients went without lifesaving medical care.
Patients don’t need more hurdles and barriers to care, especially the many who are already in poor health, disabled, dealing with substance use disorders, or living in challenging circumstances. They have enough to juggle without the risk of losing their health care hanging over their heads every single month.
If patients lose Medicaid, many will be forced to wait until they’re in a crisis and will go to the emergency room, instead of receiving less expensive preventative care at a clinic. This unnecessarily expends precious resources and burdens the health care system.
Health care systems will also be facing extreme challenges from the financial strain imposed by the legislation. Many of West Virginia’s rural hospitals may be forced to close as a result of this bill. This puts the lives and well-being of West Virginians at risk. Our community members should not be forced to drive for hours to receive care.
If the goal is to improve the health and well-being of West Virginians, to reduce overdose deaths, to incentivize work, and to improve management and occurrence of chronic health conditions, this legislation is not the solution. The good news is that our senators, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito and Sen. Jim Justice, have witnessed firsthand the challenges we face and the impact this legislation will have on West Virginians. We urge them to continue to safeguard the health of West Virginians and to spare us from this looming catastrophe by opposing this legislation.

(Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star) State lawmakers are debating juvenile justice reform proposals aimed at improving Pennsylvania’s approach to supporting youth offenders and holding providers and public officials accountable. 
The House Children and Youth Committee passed four measures Tuesday, as other legislators promoted additional bills they’re developing on the issue. 
Rep. Melissa Shusterman (D-Paoli) put forth a three-part package. 
“The allegations of abuse in Pennsylvania juvenile detention facilities require all of us to act,” Shusterman said. “Young people report that these facilities are unsafe, unclean and unable or unwell. We have to be willing to provide the effective treatment and education that these young people require.”
One bill would create a juvenile detention database.
Another would guarantee legal representation for children in custody  – and a 50 percent state reimbursement to counties for the cost. 
The third lays out rules for using physical restraints on minors in custody as a “last resort.” It would prohibit their use as a punishment or for convenience’s sake, and establish documenting, auditing and reporting requirements intended to enhance transparency and accountability. 
Rep. Carol Kazeem (D-Delaware) is pushing for a Joint State Government Commission study of youth justice facilities across the state and establishing guidance for running them, including utilizing video surveillance and optimizing staff training, recruitment and retention. The study also would explore expanding at-home detention including through using electronic monitoring devices. 
A grand jury requested a study on best operational practices in its report on rampant abuse at the Delaware County Juvenile Detention Center that closed in 2021, according to Kazeem’s resolution. 
Rep. Kate Klunk (R-Hanover), minority chair of the committee, said the GOP wants more information on costs and to avoid confusion with similar analyses already underway on restraints, specifically, as well as general best practices for youth detention.
“I do think that it might be premature in moving forward with this while that is working through the regulatory review process… those particular concerns regarding restraints and some of the regulation changes that the department is looking at right now,” Klunk said.
The committee passed Kazeem’s resolution and Schusterman’s bill to establish a juvenile incarceration facilities database on party line votes. 
Rep. Bob Day (R-Macungie)’s designee put forth a vote supporting Shusterman’s other two measures – one laying out rules for physically restraining kids in custody and another guaranteeing counsel for them in addition to partial reimbursement for the cost to counties. 
Day did not respond to a request for comment. 
Meanwhile, additional justice reform proposals have been dropping since being introduced as the CARE package earlier this year. 
Representatives Andre Carroll and Anthony Bellmon spoke Tuesday about drawing up a bill that would create a statewide youth ombudsman, along the lines of the local role established in Philadelphia, which they both represent. State Sen. Michelle Brooks (D-Crawford/Mercer) put out a memo for the same in January.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shusterman-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-06-18 05:58:31.182010

Wes Moore at a May news conference in the State House. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown has filed or signed onto two dozen lawsuits by states challenging Trump administration actions.
But not this one.
When California filed suit last week to defend its ability to set tougher vehicle emission standards — standards aimed at speeding adoption of electric vehicles — 10 states that had adopted the standards quickly joined the suit. Even though Maryland has adopted the California rules, it did not join.
A spokesperson for Brown said the attorney general’s office is “monitoring the California lawsuit while we assess the best path for the State to remain vigilant in enforcing standards that will help us achieve these climate goals.”
“Here in Maryland, we have made it a priority to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, setting ambitious goals to preserve our clean air and water,” wrote Kelsey Hartman, the spokesperson.
But environmental groups, still smarting from Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) decision in April to delay penalties under the California rules, were not pleased by Brown’s hesitation.
“If it is a ‘priority’ for Maryland to reduce greenhouse gases, then we should be first in line to sue over the Trump effort to remove our legal right to require cleaner cars,” said Mike Tidwell, executive director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, in a statement. “Instead we are completely missing in action on one of the most important climate lawsuits of the Trump era.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Tidwell called it “inconceivable that Attorney General Brown is not joining California and ten other Clean Car states in fighting President Trump in court.”
The Maryland chapter of the Sierra Club urged the state to join California’s suit “and use every other tool at its disposal to defend our clean vehicle programs.” Lindsey Mendelson, the club’s senior transportation campaign representative, said in a statement that it’s important for Maryland to help keep the California regulations “on the books,” saying the congressional votes upending the program were “clearly unlawful.”
President Donald Trump has issued executive orders to roll back clean energy programs, including a freeze on billions of dollars for states to build electric vehicle charging stations along key highways under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. Maryland joined 15 other states to challenge that move in court.
The action reining in the California regulations was an act of Congress, not an executive order.
Ramón Palencia-Calvo, senior director for Chispa Maryland, a program of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, said Tuesday the league is “still trying to seek clarification” on why Brown had not joined California’s suit. While it’s still possible Maryland could join the suit, Palencia-Calvo said, the EV rules are “key programs” for reducing climate pollution, particularly in vulnerable communities that tend to surround busy state highways.
“Here at Maryland LCV, we continue to support implementation of these two programs,” he said.
It’s not the first disappointment this year for Maryland advocates over the California rules.
In April, Moore issued an executive order that allows the state to delay financial penalties for car manufacturers that do not meet sales targets that were set to kick in next year with the introduction of model year 2027 electric vehicles.
Originally, 43% of new cars sold in Maryland in model year 2027 were supposed to be zero-emission. Under Moore’s order, penalties would not be applied for the 2027 and 2028 model years, unless California officials reach a new agreement on the rule’s requirements with car manufacturers representing at least 40% of the market share.

The order did not change the ultimate goal of the program, which is to require that 100% of passenger cars sold in the state by model year 2035 be electric.
Administration officials noted that, as of 2024, EV sales represented about 12% of new car purchases in Maryland, according to the Maryland Department of Transportation. Moore’s order relaxing the penalties was needed to give “manufacturers, dealers, and Marylanders a fair shot to prepare” for the higher sale targets, they said.
Maryland auto dealers had expressed concern that car manufacturers would send fewer vehicles to the state in order to ensure that the percentage of EVs would be high enough to meet the state’s target. State officials had previously argued that manufacturers could trade credits with one another to significantly reduce their obligations.
In May, with California’s Advanced Clean Cars program under fire, Moore joined 10 other governors in an “Affordable Clean Cars Coalition” to “sustain America’s transition to cleaner and more affordable cars, support U.S. automotive manufacturers and workers, and preserve states’ clean air authority,” according to a Department of the Environment news release.
Moore’s April executive order also created a working group to study how the Advanced Clean Cars rule can be “successfully implemented” in Maryland.
Peter Kitzmiller, president of the Maryland Auto Dealer’s Association, said he is excited for that group to convene, because his members are eager to sell EVs, having already invested in the vehicles and their charging technology.
“We have to sell these vehicles and we need to sell them in bigger numbers than we’re doing,” Kitzmiller said. “We’ve got to get a return on our investment.”
Kitzmiller said he is also concerned about other federal action on EVs, including the possible end to a $7,500 tax credit for buyers. That loss could drive EV purchases down in the short term, he said, but he is hoping that any decline would be temporary.
“That’s going to be the thing to look at: What’s the impact going to be on the market?” Kitzmiller said.
As Trump hits 100 days, Brown among attorneys general battling him at every turn

The California rules were aimed at helping create a market for EVs. In order to set emissions standards stricter than the federal government’s, California receives a waiver from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Under that authority, California has set the EV sales rules.
But the Republican-led Congress adopted resolutions disproving of the waivers under the Congressional Review Act. Trump signed the measures June 12, saying in a statement that the resolutions were “ending the electric vehicle mandate for good.”
“It is the Federal Government, not States, that should establish vehicle emissions standards given the inherently interstate nature of air quality; a patchwork of State vehicle regulations on this subject is unworkable,” Trump wrote. “Our Constitution does not allow one State special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire Nation.”
In its lawsuit, California argued that the Congressional Review Act could not be used to overturn its waivers, because the waiver decisions are not considered formal federal rules.
“The CRA has never before been used in any context that resembles this one. It has certainly never been used, as it was here, to negate particular state laws,” reads the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
The suit says the review act was simply an end run around the lengthy process of rolling back the waivers through an administrative process at EPA, which Trump did during his first administration. Congressional leaders and administration officials “took these unprecedented steps because they saw the CRA as a quick and easy way to ‘take … down’ California’s regulations,” the lawsuit said.
Kitzmiller said he was “a little surprised” not to see Maryland on the list of litigants beside California.
But he said he “wouldn’t read too much into it.” It was always expected that California would lead the litigation countering the Trump administration’s efforts to end the program, Kitzmiller said.
“It doesn’t mean that Maryland doesn’t care about EVs, or anything like that,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0487-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-18 05:58:31.182010

Jackson meets reporters Tuesday, one day after Prince George’s County Circuit Court judges selected her as interim state’s attorney. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A day before she’s to be sworn in as interim Prince George’s County state’s attorney, Tara H. Jackson summarized her philosophy Tuesday.
“My philosophy is simple. I will always try to do the right thing, to seek truth, to uphold the law and to pursue justice,” Jackson said during a briefing Tuesday at the Wayne K. Curry Administration Building in Largo.
Jackson was picked by the county’s circuit court judges from four applicants seeking to replace Aisha Breveboy, who leaves the state’s attorney job to be sworn in Wednesday as the new county executive.
It’s the second straight interim role for Jackson, who was serving as  the county’s chief administrative officer when then-County Executive Angela Alsobrooks (D) was elected last fall to the U.S. Senate. Under the county charter, the chief administrative officer steps in when there’s vacancy in the county executive’s office, and Jackson has been serving in that role for about six months now.
Jackson immediately said she was not interested in running for the permanent county executive job. But state’s attorney, which she calls a return “to my roots,” is different.
When asked Tuesday if she might run for state’s attorney in the 2026 election, Jackson said, “Let me get into the job, first. I won’t rule it out.”
Jackson noted that she began her legal career as an assistant state’s attorney in the office, where Alsobrooks also worked as the first full-time assistant state’s attorney to handle domestic violence cases.

After eight years in private practice, Jackson returned to the county as principal deputy state’s attorney and then deputy county attorney.
“I understand the job of state’s attorney and the importance of the office to individuals in our community,” she said Tuesday.
County Councilmember Wanika Fisher had indicated an interest in pursuing the interim state’s attorney appointment, but released a statement Monday morning saying she would not seek the temporary job. Fisher cited the cost of a special election to fill her District 2 council seat if she moved into the state’s attorney job now. She estimated such a race could cost $500,000 to $800,000.
But Fisher did say she plans to run for state’s attorney in 2026 — when she could face Jackson.
Jackson takes over as the county police department faces the possible loss of Chief Malik Aziz, whois a finalist for the same position in Phoenix.
“In whatever he chooses to pursue, I wish him well,” Jackson said.
If Aziz leaves, Jackson said she would hope to see a replacement “who has the same philosophy as I do. We want to pursue justice. We just don’t want to lock up folks. We’re not just trying to put people in jail. We want due process to be the rule of the day.”
An email Tuesday from the Maryland Judiciary said Jackson will be sworn in during a “closed event” Wednesday.

The suit, filed Monday in Baltimore City Circuit Court, asks the court to declare that Maryland Physicians Care wrongfully denied claims for certain emergency care and to make it pay the $15 million the medical system believes it is owed. UMMS also wants the court to prohibit the managed care organization’s use of its current automatic claims approval system.
Maryland Physicians Care CEO Jason Rottman said the company believes it has acted lawfully, and it “strongly disputes the University of Maryland Medical System’s unfounded characterizations.”
“We have worked in good faith to address these concerns with the University of Maryland Medical System and have engaged in dialogue to seek resolution,” Rottman said in a statement Monday.
Maryland Physicians Care is one of nine Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) in Maryland. Medicaid MCOs receive federal and state tax dollars to cover medical care for those who qualify for Medicaid, including in emergency rooms.

Health systems such as UMMS are supposed to be reimbursed for medical services provided in emergency situations under certain circumstances. But the lawsuit claims that Maryland Physicians Care has unlawfully denied claims that should have been covered.
Federal law uses the “prudent layperson” rule to determine whether or not a claim in an emergency setting is covered. That means that if a person with an average knowledge of health and medicine went to an emergency room because they reasonably believed their symptoms required immediate medical attention, insurers should pay hospitals for that care, regardless of the outcome.
But UMMS alleges that Maryland Physicians Care instead relies on its internal system, called the “Sudden and Serious” list, that automatically approves or denies claims based on diagnosis. The list’s definition of what qualifies as an emergency is more narrow than the prudent layperson standard, the suit says.
It says MPC also regularly denies claims based on the entire medical record of the emergency visit, not the layperson’s initial assessment, which “intentionally ignores” the prudent layperson standard.
As a result,Maryland Physicians Care has improperly denied payment for medical care UMMS provided to more the 15,000 patients, resulting in $15 million in unpaid services, including interest, over the last three years, the lawsuit says.
The suit cites the case where a man was in recovery from a motor vehicle accident who experienced significant abdominal pain. The physician ordered a CT scan for the man’s chest and spine, but Maryland Physicians Care denied payment for the scans, saying the symptoms were not “acute” symptoms of sufficient severity to justify CT scans. UMMS appealed that decision, and a third-party review organization sided with the hospital system.

UMMS also claims that Maryland Physicians Care withheld payment for sustained hospital care, citing the case of a patient with multiple conditions – including a recent stroke, HIV, COVID-19 and sepsis – who was hospitalized for three months. Maryland Physicians Care denied coverage for portions of the hospital stay, “asserting—without any credible clinical basis—that the patient could have been safely discharged,” according to the complaint.
UMMS said denials extended to even “the most fragile newborns,” pointing to an infant born three months prematurely, who weighed about a pound and had been exposed to fentanyl and cocaine in utero. The infant had significant medical need due to “extreme respiratory distress, recurrent apnea, severe feeding intolerance, and numerous other comorbidities associated with extreme prematurity,” the suit said.
“It is hard to conceive of a patient more in need of, and deserving of, intense clinical intervention. And yet, MPC denied significant portions of her treatment—questioning the need for care even during the height of her clinical instability,” the complaint says.
But Rottman said Maryland Physicians Care adheres to state and federal laws for claims.
“Maryland Physicians Care … is committed to the highest standards of integrity and compliance in administering health benefits since 1997 on behalf of our partner, the Maryland Department of Health,” Rottman’s statement said.
“We strictly adhere to all state and federal rules and guidelines as our policies and procedures are regularly reviewed by the MD Department of Health as well as national accrediting bodies,” his statement said. “The rigorous reviews consistently confirm that we meet regulatory requirements.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_jun317_umms_adminbuilding-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-18 05:58:31.182010

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Medicaid expansion helped Kentucky and other states get more people covered by health insurance, but proposed federal cuts could undo that, a new report found. 
“Fragile Progress, Continuing Disparities,” released Wednesday by the Commonwealth Fund, also shows a decline in the number of children getting routine vaccinations against such diseases as measles, mumps and rubella.
Kentucky was among the worst states for vaccinations, with 64% of children having all doses of recommended vaccines. Of its neighbors, Kentucky’s childhood vaccination rates were higher than only Tennessee, where about 63% of children are fully vaccinated. Commonwealth Fund researchers said misinformation about vaccines has caused public trust to decrease. 
Researchers also found that from 2013-2023, rates of uninsured individuals across the country fell to a “historic low,” Dr. Joseph Betancourt, the Commonwealth Fund president, said during a Tuesday call. 
“The coverage gains can largely be attributed to provisions in the Affordable Care Act that made Medicaid available to more people and that helped many low and middle income people afford the cost of health coverage purchased from federal and state run health insurance marketplaces,” Betancourt said. 
The report highlights how Kentucky’s decision to expand Medicaid to more low-income people has increased access to health care.
“In Kentucky, one of the first states to expand Medicaid eligibility, the uninsured rate for people with incomes under 200 percent of poverty ($30,120 for an individual and $62,400 for a family of four) fell by two-thirds between 2013 and 2023, from 38 percent to 12 percent,” the report states. “By contrast, in Tennessee, which has not expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate for the same group of low-income adults declined by only one-third, from 37 percent to 24 percent.” 
Kentucky is inching higher in the report’s health rankings — from 40th among the 50 states in the 2023 report to 37th overall in the 2025 report. The state improved on several measures, including having more people covered by health insurance, fewer people with medical debt in collections and fewer depressed youth not getting treatment.
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are pushing to cut Medicaid over the next decade. A proposal that emerged from a U.S. Senate committee Monday makes even deeper cuts than those already approved by the U.S. House of Representatives in a controversial spending and tax package, dubbed the “big, beautiful bill” by President Donald Trump who supports the measure. The federal-state Medicaid program pays for almost 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care. Many health advocates are warning the Republican legislation will hurt hospitals and patients. 
Is health care affordable, accessible?
The Commonwealth Fund report looks at a variety of measures to rank how well health systems work across the nation. Researchers look at how affordable and accessible health care is, how widespread prevention treatments like vaccinations and screenings are, the prevalence of preventable deaths and more.

The report shows:

In 2023, 4% of Kentucky children ages 0-18 were uninsured. The national average is 5%. 
In 2023, 8% of Kentucky adults ages 19-64 were uninsured, which is lower than the national average of 11%. 
In 2022, 40% of Kentucky adults hadn’t had a dental visit in the past year. That’s higher than the national average of 36%. 
In 2023, 36% of children did not have all their recommended vaccinations. The national average is 31%. 
In 2022, 70% of Kentucky adults living with substance use disorder did not receive treatment.  Nationally, that number is 77%. 
From 2020-2023, the 30-day hospital mortality in Kentucky was 15%, slightly higher than 14% across the U.S. 
In 2022-2023, Kentucky had 117 preventable deaths per 100,000 people, higher than the national rate of 86. 
In 2022, for every 1,000 live births in Kentucky, there were nearly 5.8 baby deaths, slightly higher than the 5.6 national average. 
In 2023, there were nearly 18 suicides for every 100,000 people. The national average is 14. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988. 
In 2023, Kentucky saw 18 firearm deaths per 100,000 people, which is higher than the national rate of 14. 
In 2022, 16% of Kentucky adults had lost six or more teeth. The national average is 9%. 
In 2023, Kentucky had more diabetic adults get their annual hemoglobin A1c test. That year, 4% of diabetic adults in Kentucky didn’t have the test, which is much better than the national average of 9%. 

  Kentucky has high rates of premature deaths from preventable causes. (Screenshot)
Betancount said the insights should be a “call to action for policy makers” both federally and at the state level to “make sure everyone in America can get the care they need, no matter who they are, where they live, or how much money they earn.” 
“I see patients every week, and I and people across the nation can tell you that there is no substitute for being able to get the care you need when you need it, and the evidence is clear that policies that make health insurance and health care more affordable and accessible work and make a difference for people everywhere every day.”
Even though Kentucky still has a lot of bad health marks, having higher rates of insured people is key to improving health, said Sara R. Collins, a senior scholar and vice president for health care coverage and access and tracking health system performance at The Commonwealth Fund.
“Health insurance coverage is essential in this country,” she said. “One cannot access health care without it, except if you’re very, very wealthy.” 
It’s also important to have high quality of coverage, low deductibles, low cost sharing, Collins said. 
“We continue to have a lot of people, millions of people, who are underinsured in the country, and there are ways of addressing that, through public policy and changes in insurer behavior,” she said. “But it is really a necessary condition for improving home health system performance.”

One of the most disturbing developments of the second Trump administration has been the President’s clear effort to encourage U.S. military service members to endorse his political views and exhibit loyalty to him personally.
This pattern was on display last week at Fort Bragg where Trump inappropriately sought to engage the troops in booing former President Biden and other elected leaders.
This represents a deeply troubling break with 250 years of well-established law and tradition in which servicemembers swear loyalty to the Constitution – not any individual.
Fortunately, many veterans of all parties and persuasions are forcefully pushing back. Many were in attendance across the nation at last Saturday’s “No Kings” events where they loudly, proudly and repeatedly rejected Trump’s offensive impersonation of a would-be autocrat.
The bottom line: the United States is a nation of laws that no individual is above. And try as he might, our veterans have made clear this is not a principle that Donald Trump should or will succeed in destroying.

(Photo by Michael G. Seamans/ Maine Morning Star)After the chambers of the Maine Legislature failed to agree, an effort to remove the state from a compact that seeks to abolish the Electoral College failed on Tuesday. 
In 2024, the Legislature adopted something called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which Gov. Janet Mills allowed to become law without her signature. 
States that are part of the compact pledge their Electoral College votes to the presidential candidate with the most overall votes across the country, but it would only take effect once states with a total of 270 Electoral College votes have joined. Including Maine, 17 states and the District of Columbia have ratified the agreement, giving the compact a total of 209 electoral votes. 
Earlier this month, the Maine House of Representatives passed legislation, LD 252, that sought to repeal the decision to enter the compact. 
The Senate tabled the bill until Monday, when the upper chamber failed to pass it with a 16-18 vote before ultimately rejecting it. 
Both the House and Senate insisted on their positions on Tuesday, effectively killing the bill. 
Maine and Nebraska are the only states that split their electoral votes across candidates. Other states use a winner-take-all system where the candidate with the majority of the state’s popular vote gets all of the state’s electoral votes.
During floor speeches throughout consideration of LD 252, lawmakers disagreed on whether the current system or one in which the Electoral College is nullified would better represent Maine. 
In the House on Tuesday, Rep. Barbara A. Bagshaw (R-Windham) argued the current system reflects the will of all 50 states individually, whereas the National Popular Vote would dilute Mainers’ votes. 
However, Rep. Arthur Bell (D-Yarmouth), who sponsored the legislation to enter the pact last year, argued during a floor debate last month that the Electoral College system results in candidates only paying attention to voters in swing states, which Maine is not.
Mills allowed the measure to become law last year because she saw merit in both sides of this argument. “Recognizing that this measure has been the subject of public discussion several times before in Maine, I would like this important nationwide debate to continue and so I will allow this bill to become law without my signature,” she said in the statement at the time. 
And both sides of the debate do not fall squarely along party lines.
While LD 252 was sponsored solely by Republicans, it has been backed by some Democrats in committee and floor votes. 
In April, the majority of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee voted in favor of it, with eight legislators — Republicans, Democrats and one unenrolled — in support and five Democrats opposed.
Separately, the committee voted against another proposal, LD 1356, that sought to change Maine’s method of allocating electoral votes from the current district split to a winner-take-all system — but only if Nebraska also adopts winner-take-all. This bill is currently tabled in the House. 
In April, the Nebraska Legislature killed a bill that sought to make this switch, after Republicans failed to secure enough votes to overcome a four-hour filibuster.

John Hoffman and his wife.
The police have identified 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter as the suspected gunman. Boelter  had a list in his car of dozens of people including elected officials and abortion providers, according to police. Boelter was apprehended Monday and faces federal and state murder charges.
All three of Wisconsin’s federal Democratic lawmakers and 11 state lawmakers were identified as being named in documents left behind by Boelter.
According to Politico, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin spokesperson Eli Rosen said Monday she was notified by law enforcement she was included on the alleged shooter’s list of names and “is grateful for law enforcement’s swift action to keep the community safe.” 
Rosen also said Baldwin “remains focused on the things that matter most here: honoring the legacy and life of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, praying for the other victims who are fighting for their lives, and condemning this abhorrent, senseless political violence.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore wrote on social media that she was aware her name was on one of the documents recovered from the vehicle of the suspect in Minnesota. 
“I thank law enforcement for their swift notification and subsequent response,” Moore said. “My prayers are with all those impacted by these horrific acts.” 
U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan has said he is “appreciative that law enforcement apprehended the suspect” in the shooting and he had heard that his name was in the Minnesota shooting suspect’s notebooks.
“I will not back down in the face of terror, however, we as elected officials must do better to lower the temperature,” Pocan said. “That said, my schedule remains unchanged.”
According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 11 Wisconsin state lawmakers were named in lists left behind by Boelter. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) has requested additional security for the Assembly floor session this week, according to Vos’ communications director Luke Wolff. Vos’ office  declined to provide additional details about the new security plan Tuesday afternoon.
The Wisconsin State Senate Sergeant at Arms Timothy La Sage announced Monday a series of enhanced security protocols at the State Capitol being taken in coordination with Capitol police, including “increased situational awareness practices, strengthened access control points, and updated emergency response protocols.” Specific security details are not being disclosed publicly, according to the statement.
The steps are meant to provide a secure and responsive environment and maintain public accessibility and civic engagement.
“The safety of those who serve, work, and visit the Capitol is my top priority,” La Sage said. “We remain vigilant and prepared. These enhancements are part of our ongoing commitment to security and public service.”
The week prior to the Minnesota attacks, Wisconsin Democrats on the budget committee spoke about increasing political violence across the country and, specifically, the targeting of judges and justices as they defended a budget request to add specific security for the state Supreme Court. State lawmakers have passed bipartisan laws in the past to help protect judges. Republicans on the committee, however, rejected this proposal, saying that the Capitol police is doing a good job and there isn’t a need for separate security.
At a press conference following the budget committee’s Tuesday meeting, Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said she thinks increasing security at the Capitol is part of a “broader conversation that state legislatures are having all around the country.”
“I’m hopeful that we’re going to have some of that in Wisconsin,” Roys said. “Obviously, our thoughts are with all of our colleagues in Minnesota.”
Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) told WISN-12 reporter Matt Smith that he wants increased security around the Capitol, including metal detectors and a ban on members of the public (but not lawmakers) carrying guns into the building.
“I have not been through another Capitol that has not had metal detectors,” Kapenga said. “We need to have a higher level of security just because of, unfortunately, ingenuity with how you can hurt people.”
Security at the state Capitol was a point of concern previously in 2023 after a man entered the building twice with a gun in search of Gov. Tony Evers. At the time, Evers said about increasing security that he was “sure they are looking at that” but that it was “not something we talk about [or] something police talk about.”

When diamondback terrapins spy bait sitting in a crab pot, they often push their way inside to feast, only to get stuck.
Terrapins, a small and vulnerable species, use lungs to breathe and can drown while trapped in cages underwater.
Conservation groups are asking Virginia regulators to require a solution: adding small gadgets to crab traps that keep terrapins out while still allowing crabs to enter.
“Virginia can take a really important step to saving this species by adopting this really simple, cheap, easy rule,” said Will Harlan, Southeast director and senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity.
The organization, along with the Virginia Herpetological Society and nonprofit Wild Virginia, petitioned the Virginia Marine Resources Commission earlier this year to require what are called turtle excluder devices on any crab pots used less than 150 yards from shore.
The commission will consider the petition on June 24.
Diamondback terrapins are the only turtle in the U.S. to live in brackish water, which is a mix of freshwater and saltwater that makes up most of the Chesapeake Bay.

The terrapin is considered a keystone species because of its role as a predator that helps maintain the salt marsh ecosystem and ingestion of eelgrass seeds, which helps distribute the seeds throughout the environment, according to the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources.
The turtles were heavily harvested in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and now face pressure from development and other human activities on their habitat and nesting areas, Virginia officials say.
Harlan said the population of terrapins along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts has plummeted by about 75% in the last 50 years. The federal government is in the process of studying whether to list the species as endangered.
“They’re in trouble,” Harlan said. “And the biggest threat to terrapins are crab traps.”
Roughly 60,000 to 80,000 terrapins drown in crab pots each year, he said.
Turtle excluder devices, or TEDs — also known as bycatch reduction devices — have been around for decades.
Biology professor Randy Chambers has studied the issue since he started working at William & Mary in 2001.
The devices work just as they sound, he said, narrowing the openings that allow marine life into crab traps.
“The shells of a turtle are much higher in profile than the shell of a crab, so crabs can still slip into the traps,” Chambers said. “But turtles are excluded.”
He and other researchers at William & Mary’s Keck Lab have spent years studying the effectiveness of various designs of TEDs, combining different shapes, colors and materials.
“The overall impact of all these different bycatch reduction devices has been a dramatic reduction in the bycatch of terrapins” – a decrease of about 90%, Chambers said.
The Keck Lab uses 3D printers to produce a red, oval-shaped device designed by a research associate. Crabbers can also simply narrow the funnels of their cages using standard wire when constructing traps, he said.

Maryland officials recognized back in the 1940s that the design of crab traps also attracts animals such as turtles, diving birds and muskrats, Chambers said. The state banned the use of commercial-style traps in tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. In 2000, Maryland started requiring the use of TEDs.
The VMRC currently “strongly encourages” TEDS for all recreational crab pots, and offers discounted fees for those who do so.
Harlan said the lack of regulation puts Virginia behind other East Coast states.
“Virginia’s kind of the last holdout, and is probably the most important habitat for diamondback terrapins,” he said.
Many commercial crabbers in Virginia oppose the proposed regulation.
“Without concrete research, implementing TEDs in crab pots could be an unnecessary burden on the crabbing industry rather than a proven conservation measure,” watermen wrote in a public comment to VMRC.
“More studies would be required to determine if there is any legitimate risk to turtle populations before requiring additional modifications to crab pots in Virginia waters.”
Chambers said research shows a slight reduction in crab catch when TEDs are used – a significant effect in an industry already facing challenges with a declining crab population.
The devices cost only about $1 or $2, but having to buy hundreds of them would be another economic constraint.
However, environmental groups’ petition to VMRC requests regulation only for waters within 150 yards of shore, where most crabbing is recreational.
Harlan said they’re open to any measures the commission would be willing to enact, such as limiting the rule to recreational crabbing.
“This species is really important socially and culturally for the entire region and especially Virginians. This is their turtle,” he said. “Keeping terrapins around means keeping our marshes healthier.”

(Getty image)With the end of the legislative session fast approaching, a slate of bills is on track for passage in the Rhode Island General Assembly that will increase the cost of insurance for the state’s drivers.
Insurers cannot endlessly absorb costs and still offer protections for drivers. The money to pay for increased burdens being considered by state lawmakers will have to come from somewhere. Insurers do not have unlimited reserves, so the rates paid by Rhode Island residents would likely go up if these bills pass.
This is part of a years-long pattern in Rhode Island. Onerous regulation and legislation have played a significant role in making Rhode Island the fifth-most expensive state in the country for auto insurance.
Rhode Island drivers now pay the highest amount for collision repair in the country, thanks in large part to bills coming out of Smith Hill over the past five years. The average collision repair cost for a driver in the Ocean State was $1,987 in 2024, according to Auto Body News. In Hawaii, the least expensive state, the average cost was $410 for collision repairs.
One out of every six Rhode Island drivers is now going without any auto insurance. We rank 16th in the country in that respect. This is another pressure point for auto insurance, raising costs for those who continue to protect themselves and others by paying for insurance.
The problem could now get worse. Five different bills all have a significant likelihood of passage and would likely continue to increase costs for Rhode Island residents.

H.5104/S.766 would prohibit the use of ZIP code alone in territorial rate-making. This would make it harder to accurately price risk. It would also likely cause drivers in areas with fewer accidents to pay more in premiums to make up for the cost of drivers in areas with more accidents.
H.6053/S.902 would increase the total loss threshold from its current 75% to 85%. This is the standard for when a damaged vehicle is considered to be totaled and in need of replacement rather than repair. This would be among the highest rates in the country. It would likely increase the number of potentially dangerous vehicles on the road that have been badly damaged but repaired rather than sent to the scrap heap. Our estimate is that this change would lead to an increase of 2,128 vehicles each year that are sent for repairs rather than declared a total loss, and that this would increase insurance costs by at least $3 million.
H.6079/S.985 would require insurers to cover additional drivers to use rental vehicles. This requirement to increase coverage of risk would necessarily drive up the cost of insurance for these rental vehicles.
H.6032/S.925 would pile another mandate on to insurers who cover rental vehicles, forcing them to pay luxury rental upcharges. It would prohibit insurers from negotiating with car rental companies over the type of vehicle that is rented to a driver whose automobile is being repaired. This would add an estimated $5 million in insurance costs, which would again drive up costs for everyday Rhode Island residents.
H.6054/S.901 would bar insurers from using an out of court appraisal appeal process for resolving auto insurance disputes. This would likely inflate repair appraisals and increase litigation, leading again to higher premiums for Rhode Island drivers.

Rhode Island didn’t become this expensive overnight, and recovery won’t happen overnight. But the first step to charting the right course is to stop heading the wrong direction, rather than continuing down the path of higher costs for Rhode Island drivers.

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia could be on the hook for $8 million to cover two initiatives to address student attendance and teacher retention if the federal government denies the commonwealth’s appeals, House lawmakers learned on Monday.
Appeals for federal relief funds for Virginia schools remain uncertain

The Virginia Department of Education, along with 14 school divisions and the Department of Juvenile Justice, filed appeals after being informed that the deadline for spending all allocated funds was abruptly moved to March 28 of this year. The original deadline had been set for March 2026.
VDOE’s two appeals focused on the state’s Attendance Data Dashboard, designed to combat chronic absenteeism, and Grow Your Own, a program to support teacher apprenticeship pipelines. If the agency’s appeal is unsuccessful, education leaders will likely return to lawmakers with a request to make up the difference for the two programs in state dollars.
“We believe that the attendance dashboard is really critical,” said Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson at Monday’s House Appropriations Committee meeting. 
She said the data is “incredibly informative” for school divisions and for the state to determine where to send resources and support when mitigation is needed. However, the development has been suspended because the federal agency cut off the relief funds.
Gullickson said the agency is considering other ways to support the development of the system and the teacher apprenticeship program.
The state agency is also appealing for $25 million for 14 school divisions, including Halifax County, the cities of Richmond and Portsmouth, and the Department of Juvenile Justice. The funds could be utilized to address the learning loss from the pandemic and improve school facilities.
Gullickson said some projects are already completed or are near completion. 
Lawmakers expressed serious concern about the potential loss of funding for school divisions.
“I don’t want to see (the school divisions) held accountable for the money that they were promised for grants to do,” said Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, who added he hopes the relief funds will be returned to the school divisions.
Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, added that school divisions could potentially “be on the hook for paying more costs than originally they thought” due to the changes and “left holding the bag” to absorb the costs.
Gullickson said she hopes Virginia’s requests will be favored, considering the administration’s connections to the federal agency and the shared interest in mitigating learning loss.
Already, VDOE has received an extension of $18 million for statewide tutoring services. Gullickson said federal approval of the request would allow schools to use “high-intensity” tutoring platforms specifically for reading and math through tutoring services such as Zearn, Ignite and Lexia for the upcoming school year.
The Mercury contacted the U.S. Department of Education for comment last week; the department has yet to respond.
 SNAP costs on the horizon?

The committee received the update on the education initiatives as it weighs multiple areas of cost concerns due to the federal changes by President Donald Trump’s administration that stand to impact the state’s economic standing and benefit programs, which the commonwealth could soon be responsible for covering.
More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says

Virginia could also have to pick up a $540 million expense to cover SNAP, also referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, lawmakers learned at the meeting. The government initiative that provides monthly food benefits to low-income people and families could come with a price tag for states for the first time, if a GOP-led plan to slash federal spending succeeds.
“We’re going to be faced with some challenges, but what we’ve done over the past few years is tried to put as much money as possible in reserves so that we will be in a position and a posture to address some of the requirements that will be handed over to the state,” said House Appropriations Committee Chair Luke Torian, D-Prince William, told to the Mercury.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)From a podium in Concord’s Legislative Office Building Tuesday morning, Kristina Amyot spoke about her intense struggles with substance use disorder, which included incarceration and bouncing between treatment centers that allowed her to stay only 28 days. That was “nowhere near enough time,” she said, but Medicaid “changed that,” providing a foundation for Amyot to rebuild her life.
Now, she and other Medicaid proponents are making a last-minute push to persuade lawmakers to pull back from structural changes to the program.
Currently, negotiators with the Republican-majority New Hampshire House and Senate are working to hash out their differences and put together a final proposal for the state budget. As part of that process, lawmakers are eyeing changes to the state’s Medicaid program that are meant to save money and restructure how it operates. During Tuesday’s press conference, Medicaid proponents argued the proposals would be disastrous.
One of those changes is a Senate-proposed plan to add work requirements to Medicaid, which provides health coverage to those with low incomes and unique needs. That plan, originally a standalone bill, has been incorporated into the Senate’s budget proposal but is not in the House’s spending plan. 
The Republicans behind the plan argue work requirements will encourage people to work and eventually earn enough money to no longer need Medicaid. While debating the proposal in March, Sen. Howard Pearl, a Loudon Republican, said Medicaid “should be a bridge for non-aged, non-disabled adults, not a destination.”
“We are a state that prides itself on work to support our families, independence, and self-sufficiency,” Pearl said in a Senate floor speech.
Speakers at Tuesday’s press conference argued work requirements would place an insurmountable bureaucratic burden on recipients and that they don’t take into account the unique medical challenges many of these recipients experience. Melinda Asbury, chief medical officer and interim CEO at Monadnock Family Services, spoke about the substance use disorder patients they treat in Keene.
“A Medicaid work requirement that is mandating work across the board simply is not going to work because these diseases do not work that way,” Asbury said. “People have times of health, and people have times of illness, and it is impossible to predict where someone is going to be at any point in time along the recovery journey.”
She said when a patient slips into these times of illness, they become less able to work, but their need for coverage increases. She pointed to “supported employment” programs that are designed to help people in recovery get into jobs as soon as their health allows as more effective ways to get people working. These programs have been proven to work and are offered at all 10 of New Hampshire’s community mental health and certified behavioral health centers, she said.
“I’ve heard a lot about exceptions,” Asbury continued. “And in theory, these sound good, right? It’s great to have an exception, but do not let that be a safety point. Let’s play this through just a little bit. So if someone is able to get an exception, then that means that that person has to be so seriously ill that they are unable to work. When someone is unable to work, what do we think the likelihood is that that person is going to be able to do this amount of paperwork and follow the process necessary in order to qualify for an exemption? To me, that just does not make sense.”
Asbury and her fellow speakers argued the paperwork will be a problem for all types of patients.
“The burden of proof does fall on a patient,” she said. “A patient who at that point in time may not be capable of advocating for him or herself. And the other burden will fall on community mental health centers to consistently have to approve work hours or apply for exemptions and certify that an individual at that point in time indeed cannot work.”
New Hampshire has attempted Medicaid work requirements before, in 2018. During that attempt, the fears Asbury and her colleagues described Tuesday seem to have been realized. 2018’s bill mandated Medicaid recipients work 100 hours a month to receive coverage. However, about one month after it went into effect in 2019, then-Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, intervened after only about 8,000 of the 25,000 people subject to the requirement complied and documented their hours, the Associated Press reported. Sununu paused the new system before the remaining roughly 17,000 people lost coverage. The state had spent more than $130,000 in outreach efforts to inform recipients of the requirements.
Two more Medicaid changes proposed this year came from Gov. Kelly Ayotte. In February, as part of her budget agenda, Ayotte proposed charging premiums to some Medicaid recipients. The recipients in question — those who have children and earn 255% of the federal poverty level and those without children who earn between 100% and 138% of the poverty level — would be charged up to 5% of their household income in order to receive coverage. Ayotte also proposed increasing pharmacy cost sharing. This means increasing the co-pays — the amount Medicaid recipients contribute to pay for their prescriptions — from $1 or $2 to $4 per prescription.
Ayotte has defended the plan by pointing to how expansive New Hampshire’s Medicaid eligibility is compared to other states. Indeed, the state ranks fourth (tied with Connecticut) among U.S. states and territories for most expansive income eligibility requirements for children, as of January, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Ayotte also proposed a provision allowing people experiencing hardship relief from premiums.
The House agreed with Ayotte’s proposal and implemented it in its budget proposal. When it became the Senate’s turn to review and amend the budget, it made some slight changes. Instead of capping the premiums based on income, the Senate changed this proposal to a flat fee regardless of income. Under that plan, single people with no kids would pay $60 per month; households of two would pay $80; households of three would pay $90; and households of four or more would pay $100.
That proposal, like work requirements, is a subject of negotiations during the committee of conference this week. Because both chambers passed premiums and co-pays, the debate will likely center around the different mechanisms for charging premiums. Still, speakers at the press conference Tuesday urged lawmakers to change course and eliminate these plans altogether.
Andrew Harmon, who is disabled and has unique medical needs as a result, spoke Tuesday about how Medicaid helps him afford the expensive medications he needs to deal with those medical needs. Harmon lives in rural New Hampton and works remotely as an independent contractor for a Canadian company, he said. He also receives disability insurance. 
“I never know what my actual income is going to be from month to month outside of my disability insurance,” Harmon said. “So I will never be able to plan for it if they go with the ‘up to 5%’ of my income. I’ve had some months where I barely get a little bit more than the disability insurance. I’ve had other months where I’ve made almost $500 on top of the insurance. So I would never know how much of that I need to set aside, nor would I know who I would pay it to.”
Harmon also said the cost alone would create a big financial burden, and there hasn’t been guidance on many of the specifics. He’s confused by how it will work. He said he’s not sure if he will be charged $4 per testing strip he uses to check his glucose levels in light of his diabetes or if he’ll be charged $4 for all the testing strips together.
“I would be paying a lot more, probably my entire money that I make for my job, probably a good portion of my disability insurance on top of that,” he said. “Which means I wouldn’t be able to afford my rent, I wouldn’t be able to afford groceries, and I definitely wouldn’t be able to afford if I needed to travel because of how rural (it is) where I live.”
Harmon is blind and cannot drive himself.
One Medicaid proposal that appears to now be off the table is a 3% cut to reimbursement rates. When it approved its budget proposal in April, the House voted to reduce Medicaid reimbursement rates — the rate at which providers get paid for services they provide Medicaid patients — by 3%. After a testy public hearing that saw residents repeatedly lambaste the cut and Ayotte publicly calling for it to go, the Senate reversed the cut in its version of the budget. On Monday, the House’s negotiators agreed to accede to the Senate’s position and reverse the cuts. So long as the full House agrees with the negotiators and neither Ayotte nor the Senate change their minds, the 3% cut now appears unlikely.
The House and Senate committees of conference must complete their negotiations this week, and the full chambers must vote on the final budget bills, House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, by June 26.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6174006-Medicaid-press-conference-1-scaled-e1750203686810-1024x713.jpg,,,2025-06-18 05:58:31.182010

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)While on her way home from a coworking space in Denver last year, Colorado state Rep. Jenny Willford says she was sexually assaulted by her Lyft driver.
In her lawsuit filed against Lyft in January, Willford alleges she was “subjected to unwelcome, nonconsensual sexual contact, touching” and lewd comments during the ride.
Willford was picked up by a different driver than the person identified in the Lyft app, according to the suit.
Her experience — and those that other survivors shared with her after hearing her story — prompted Willford, a Democrat, to introduce legislation this year that aimed to require safety measures for both riders and drivers using ridesharing apps.
“In my mind, all of these things are very basic when it comes to safety,” Willford said. “They’re just so common sense that it’s been really disheartening and frustrating to me that Uber … threatened to leave the state if the bill becomes law.”
Her bill would have required rideshare companies to conduct more regular background checks for drivers, to create a program for passengers or drivers who want to audio or video record their rides and to develop other safety policies.
But following Uber’s threats to leave the state if the measure passed, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis vetoed it in late May. The bill would jeopardize rideshare services in Colorado “to an untenable degree, and could very well lead to companies that Coloradans rely on exiting the market, raising prices, or reducing the number of drivers,” his veto letter said.
Colorado isn’t alone. State and city leaders across the country are looking for ways to make rideshares safer. But lobbying campaigns from Uber and Lyft in many cases are blocking legislation meant to strengthen protections for both drivers and passengers.
Uber and Lyft, the two companies that dominate the U.S. rideshare industry, argue they have sufficient safety features within their apps.
“At Uber, we put safety at the heart of our operations, using technology, transparency, and accountability to help protect riders, drivers, and the broader community, with robust background checks and safety features like Audio and Video Recording, the Emergency Button, PIN verification, and RideCheck,” Uber wrote in a statement to Stateline.
“We remain committed to this work, and to dialogue with bill sponsors on sensible policies that keep people safe while protecting privacy and access.”
Rideshare drivers win more benefits, protections despite industry pushback

But there’s still a gap in regulations for rideshare companies because of their evolving technologies, said Lorena Roque, the interim director of education, labor and worker justice at The Center for Law and Social Policy, a left-leaning anti-poverty advocacy organization.
“Working on an app-based platform — like with delivery workers and rideshare workers —that sort of work is relatively new, so there’s not a clear standard,” Roque said.
Uber and Lyft are employing lobbyists at the state and local levels. In Rhode Island, another state where legislators are pushing rideshare safety bills that the companies have objected to, Uber is on pace to spend $50,000 this year on lobbyists, according to the state’s lobbying database. Lyft has been spending $5,000 monthly on lobbyists in Rhode Island.

Across the country, Uber and Lyft have testified against measures in state legislative hearings and city council meetings. In Colorado’s case, a number of officials representing Uber spoke out against Willford’s legislation at committee hearings, while Lyft sent a letter to Gov. Polis urging him to veto it. Jerry Golden, Lyft’s chief policy officer, wrote in the letter that the legislation’s requirements “ignore and ultimately will not improve conditions for riders and drivers.”
Uber told the state Senate it would be “impossible” for rideshare companies to comply with the bill’s requirements immediately upon approval and that the  audio and video requirement is “not possible to enforce.”
“The intention of my legislation was never to drive out Uber or Lyft,” Willford said. “The intention was always to require a higher level of accountability and safety from them. But we can’t do that if they’re going to throw tantrums and pick up their toys and go home every time somebody asks them to do better.”
 Safety for passengers

As a part of Lyft’s safety measures, drivers must complete annual background checks and mandatory driver safety education. The app is also programmed to check in with riders when drivers take long stops or deviate from the route they were assigned.
Uber conducts periodic criminal screenings for all active drivers and requires drivers to regularly verify their identity by sharing a selfie with Uber using the app. Both companies offer live emergency assistance to riders.
Between 2020 and 2022, Lyft reported 23 fatal physical assaults of people using the Lyft platform and 2,651 instances of the five most serious categories of sexual assault, according to its 2024 Safety Transparency Report. While incidents of sexual assault had decreased 21% since the last report, which covered 2017-2019, fatal physical assaults jumped by 185%.
Uber saw 36 physical assault fatalities in 2021 and 2022 and 2,717 incidents of the most serious categories of sexual assault, according to the company’s most recent safety report. Despite a 22% decline in sexual assault and misconduct, there was an increase in fatal physical assaults since its 2019-2020 report.
State lawmakers in several states have tried to address rideshare safety concerns with varying degrees of success.
Pending legislation in New Jersey and Massachusetts aims to prevent sexual assault and misconduct against passengers.
The New Jersey measure would require rideshare companies to share information concerning sexual misconduct investigations into a driver and would allow companies to ban drivers during an investigation. It remains in committee.
The bill in Massachusetts, introduced by Democratic state Sen. Rebecca Rausch, would create a specific criminal penalty for the sexual assault of a passenger by a rideshare driver. The bill also would deem any rideshare passenger incapable of consenting to any sexual contact during a ride.  A hearing on the bill took place yesterday.
“We need to be able to make sure that people are safe and that people can trust those kinds of spaces to be safe,” Rausch said.
States and cities eye stronger protections for gig economy workers

In May, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation that creates criminal penalties for impersonating a rideshare driver. Starting July 1, the crime counts as a second-degree misdemeanor. Uber supported the legislation.
But in Rhode Island, Lyft is pushing against legislation that would require fingerprinting as part of criminal background check. Brendan Joyce, the Lyft public policy manager, testified against the measure in April, saying the fingerprinting requirement relies on the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information System, which Joyce said has incomplete data. He also asserted that fingerprint checks “disproportionately impact and have potential discriminatory effects on communities of color.” Uber also testified against the proposal.
Rhode Island legislators introduced another measure that would prevent people under the age of 16 from using a rideshare service alone. Both bills are being held for further study.
 Driver protections

JC Muhammad, 57, has been a rideshare driver in and around Chicago since about 2016.
Now, he works full-time as an organizer for faith-based organizations and groups that support rideshare drivers, including The People’s Union, a membership-driven organization aimed at supporting workers in the city.
Muhammad was attacked by a passenger during a Lyft ride in 2022, he said. The passenger asked to borrow Muhammad’s phone and opened its Cash App. The passenger also hit him over the head twice, he said, and threw a brick at his car, denting the side.
“I was angry as hell,” Muhammad said. “I really wanted to engage the kid, but I said, ‘No, let me get back in my car.’”

After sharing the incident with Lyft, the company responded by saying it would not match him with that passenger again. But the person who rode with Muhammad did not match the profile of the person who originally requested the ride, he said.
Muhammad also said he couldn’t go to the police because he did not know the identity of the person who was in his car — and Lyft would not share the identity of the account holder who ordered the Lyft.
Uber and Lyft customers have the option to verify their account, but not everyone does, Muhammad said.
“That gives us some measure of comfort, but it really doesn’t do enough, especially when it comes to calling rides for other people,” Muhammad said. “The account holder may not be the actual passenger.”
Rideshare drivers across the country — especially those of color — are frequently harassed, according to a 2023 report from the Strategic Organizing Center. The center is a coalition of labor unions representing more than 2.5 million workers across the country.
The survey of over 900 app-based rideshare drivers found the majority had been verbally abused and more than a quarter of respondents were threatened with physical harm. Nearly 15% of the drivers were grabbed, groped or hit, according to the report.
There have been several incidents in Chicago where drivers are lured by a false account to a location where they are then robbed or attacked, said Deana Rutherford, the communications manager at the Chicago Gig Alliance, a subset of The People’s Lobby.
“These drivers just show up and they have no idea who’s about to get into their car,” Rutherford said. “And Uber doesn’t know who they are either.”
To address some of the safety and labor issues drivers were facing, the Chicago City Council began considering an ordinance backed by The People’s Lobby that would require passenger verification.
If passed, the ordinance would have also set a minimum wage for drivers, require companies to be more transparent about fares, have them disclose the details of driver account deactivations and more. Both Uber and Lyft initially opposed the ordinance. Uber warned the measure’s sponsor that the changes in pay rates would drive up costs for customers and force the company to cut 10,000 drivers, according to a letter Uber sent to a city alderman that was obtained by Stateline.
But Uber this week agreed to a deal that scraps Chicago’s ordinance in exchange for the company’s support for state legislation that would allow rideshare drivers to unionize, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

Rep. Julie von Haefen (D-Wake) posted a video Saturday on Facebook from the “No Kings” protests in North Carolina that included the image. She later removed the post, which came after a man shot two Minnesota lawmakers, and posted a statement Sunday saying it was “inappropriate,” and that she condemned “political violence in all forms.”
On Tuesday, she echoed that sentiment in person among her House colleagues.
“I realized that quickly and took the post down, and I want to apologize today,” von Haefen said. “I apologize to members of the House, to my constituents and to any North Carolinian who was offended.”
House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) responded briefly to the statement on the floor, telling members to “watch what we say in this body.”
“What you end up doing is putting yourself in danger and other members of this body,” Hall said.
Speaking to reporters after the remarks, Hall did not rule out further action against von Haefen, which could include a motion to censure.
“The body elected me as speaker, and ultimately the body decides on what consequences are for things,” Hall said. “I can agree one way or the other, but they can decide at the end of the day. I don’t know what folks’ reactions are yet to the apology.”
Prior to House debate Tuesday, von Haefen’s post had drawn outrage from North Carolina Republicans, and a response from the head of the state Democratic Party.

The NC GOP called on von Haefen to resign. Chairman Jason Simmons said in a statement that the post does “not show the judgement or temperament of someone to hold public office.”
NCDP Chairman Anderson Clayton, in response, cited “hypocrisy” on the part of Republicans outraged over the post.

The rally, led by child advocacy group Groundwork Ohio, included not only advocacy groups and faith leaders, but also workers in child care and parents who have had to face their own battles with the costs of everything regarding having children.
Briayana Odeneal is a parent who also works in early childhood education. She spoke at the rally, flanked by her toddler daughter. While she said she loves being a mother, she is always reminded that motherhood “does not come with a manual or any guarantees,” and “for a lot of us, it does not come with financial stability.”
“Not because of a lack of effort, but because the cost of living doesn’t always match the reality of raising a child,” Odeneal said.

Things like Publicly Funded Child Care, the Child Care Choice Voucher Program, and a child tax credit are ways in which the state can boost families and take away some of the struggle, according to those at the rally.
The cost and lack of access to child care, along with the low wages and high turnover of being a child care provider, have long been sore spots in the state and country, and those that attended the rally say more must be done.
“The supports that (working families) get for child care and the (child care choice) voucher program, for home visiting and all of those things, are really critical for them to be able to stay employed and participate in the workforce, as well as then for the children to be ready for kindergarten,” said Gina Ginn, CEO of Columbus Early Learning Centers.
Ginn attended the rally to encourage legislators and emphasize the need for reinforcements for issues ranging from infant and maternal mortality rates to pre-natal care and child care.
“It’s a conversation that we’re still having every budget cycle, and if our elected officials really believe in families and want families to move to Ohio, to stay in Ohio and to thrive in Ohio, we really need the support for working families, so they can build a life here,” Ginn said.

The budget is currently in conference committee, a joint gathering of both chambers of the General Assembly to harmonize the House and Senate drafts of the budget, on the way to a signature and/or line-item vetoes from the governor.
Both the House and Senate proposals left the Publicly Funded Child Care eligibility at 145% of the federal poverty limit, rather than raising it to 160% as advocates had asked for, to allow for more families to use the benefits.
The Child Care Choice Voucher Program remained in the budget through the Senate draft, but funding for the program dropped from $225 million over the biennium as was proposed in the governor’s budget, down to a total of $200 million.
The House and Senate proposals also both removed a provision from Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive proposal that would have created a child tax credit through the use of tobacco tax revenues. The credit could be used for many things related to care for a child, and would give $1,000 per child in tax relief.
While legislative leaders weren’t convinced by the use of what they see as a fading revenue stream in the tobacco tax, organizations and individuals from around the state put their support behind the measure to bring about some financial relief, and economists said the measure could bring the state itself millions of dollars in extra funds.
While the conference committee marks an imminent end to the budget process, Lynanne Gutierrez, president and CEO of Groundwork Ohio, is still optimistic that movements to change the language can make a difference, especially with the finish line marked by DeWine’s approval.
“I have a lot of hope in Gov. DeWine’s really front-stage advocacy on the child tax credit,” Gutierrez said.  “He’s continued to really voice that very loudly, being a leader in the space, so I believe that our legislative leaders can make that a priority, too. There’s revenue for it, if they choose to do it.”
Legislators have until the end of June to approve and present DeWine with a final draft.

The foundation analyzed 50 health indicators for all 50 states plus the District of Columbia. In the six categories into which the report divided the indicators, Arkansas ranked:

42nd in health care access and affordability
41st in prevention and treatment of health problems
36th in avoidable hospital use and cost
49th in healthy behaviors
36th in health disparities based on income
48th in health disparities based on race and ethnicity

Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi are the three states the Commonwealth Fund ranked below Arkansas overall. The organization advocates for equitable health care and provides grants for health research and improvements.
In a press briefing Tuesday, the authors of the report said they believe proposed federal cuts to public benefits, primarily Medicaid, will worsen the health care landscape and undo years’ worth of progress improving health outcomes and insurance rates. Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, part of the Casey Foundation’s KIDS COUNT network, expressed similar concerns earlier this month after the Annie E. Casey Foundation released a report ranking Arkansas 45th in child well-being nationwide.
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid

A federal budget bill moving through Congress would reduce Medicaid spending by $625 billion over 10 years. Arkansas was the first Southern state to expand Medicaid in 2013, but it is among the states with a trigger law to end the expansion program if federal funding for Medicaid is reduced.
More than 800,000 Arkansans are on Medicaid, and more than half are children.
The federal budget bill would also add new Medicaid work requirements for some non-disabled adults. AACF has repeatedly denounced such requirements, and Wednesday’s report asserted that working adults would lose Medicaid coverage under such requirements “because of the known difficulties associated with submitting documentation, filing paperwork, and securing internet access.”
About 5 million Americans could become uninsured as a result, report co-author Sara Collins said.
Arkansas became the first state to implement a work requirement for some Medicaid recipients in 2018, but a federal judge struck down the policy the following year. The initiative cut 18,000 people’s Medicaid coverage.
Additionally, the budget bill’s proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act, including a reduced open enrollment period and the expiration of pandemic-era subsidies for care plans under this law would lead to even more people losing insurance coverage, Collins said.
“When people go to the marketplace in November [2026], they are going to see their premiums spike,” she said. “They will see major increases in their premiums, so we’ll potentially see dropoffs in enrollment pretty quickly.”

Arkansas_EMBARGOED_2025-06-18 
Every state saw a decrease in its uninsured adults between 2013 and 2023, and the Affordable Care Act was a major contributor to this, the report states. Arkansas’ uninsured rate nearly halved, from 24.2% to 12.5%, during that time.
Arkansas also saw fewer instances of avoidable hospital use and cost from 2019 to 2023, according to the report, particularly for Medicare beneficiaries, who are at least 65 years old.
However, 3% more children in Arkansas were uninsured in 2023 compared to 2019, and there was no change in the proportion of uninsured adults in Arkansas during that time, according to the report.
Almost every state saw fewer adults forgo medical care due to the cost between 2013 and 2023. Arkansas’ rate dropped from 21% to 13.9%, according to the report.
Nationally, the percentage of working-age adults without health insurance fell from 20.4% in 2013 to 11% in 2023, and the percentage of adults that skipped medical care because of the cost declined from 15.9% to 11.7%, the report states.
 Child health

The report notes that fewer children have been receiving all seven recommended early childhood vaccinations against infectious diseases in 36 states, including in Arkansas. In 2019, 73.9% of Arkansas children had received all of these vaccines, but this percentage dropped to 67.1% by 2023, the report states.
“In some instances, children start the vaccine series but don’t receive all doses — sometimes because they lack health insurance coverage,” the report states. “Children living in poverty or in rural areas are less likely to complete the vaccination series, with access-related barriers and logistical challenges key contributors to their lower vaccination rates.”
Vaccine hesitancy also has grown nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Report co-author Kristen Kolb said Tuesday that the federal government’s recent actions and rhetoric “could further erode the public’s confidence in vaccines.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly expressed doubts about the effectiveness of vaccines, and earlier this month he removed and replaced the entire Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel that advises national vaccine policies.
Kolb called this a “serious disruption,” noting that the panel might not recommend that insurers pay for vaccinations.
Arkansas is one of several states that has seen the recent community spread of measles, a disease once considered eliminated by herd immunity thanks to vaccination rates.
Wednesday’s report notes that the CDC no longer recommends COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women, despite evidence that this demographic is “at greater risk for severe complications” from the illness.
Maternal and infant mortality rose nationwide between 2018 and 2022, and Arkansas consistently has high rates of both. The report ranked Arkansas 49th in infant mortality with a rate of 7.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to the national average of 5.6.
Arkansas stuck among bottom five states for child well-being, report shows

The Casey Foundation’s report earlier this month stated that Arkansas’ rate of child and teen deaths worsened from 2019 to 2023, totaling 300 per 100,000.
More broadly, Arkansas’ rate of premature deaths from preventable causes per 100,000 people worsened over roughly the same time period, from 230.9 to 259.6, according to the Commonwealth Fund.
The report also noted racial disparities in health outcomes. The rate of Black people in Arkansas per 100,000 who died before the age of 75 from preventable causes in 2020-21 was 405.6, compared to 316.2 among white people, 225.5 among Asian Americans and 203.4 among Hispanic people.
Similarly, infant mortality for Black babies in Arkansas was 12.8 per 1,000 live births, compared to 7.2 for white babies, 5.7 for Asian American babies and 4.6 for Hispanic babies, according to the report.
The report’s overall analysis of Arkansas’ health landscape paints “a complicated and mixed picture,” Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families economic policy director Pete Gess said in a Tuesday email. He noted infant mortality and decreasing child vaccination rates as particularly concerning. He also said the state government will likely be required to direct more public funding to Medicaid, nutrition assistance and other “basic needs programs” in the face of federal budget cuts.
“All of these changes create stress for children and families in our state, and we can expect diminishing health outcomes,” Gess said.

However, it’s one of two Ohio “nonprofit” hospital systems to face scrutiny from Congress over the huge amounts it’s raking in from a federal program meant to subsidize care for the poor. 
It’s using some of that money to pay lavish salaries and buy stadium-naming rights. Meanwhile, it is reportedly boosting the bottom line by serving wealthy communities and neglecting poorer ones — an outcome that, if true, would directly counter the program’s intent.
In April, the U.S. Senate Health, Labor and Pensions Committee released the results of a years-long investigation it made into a federal program that has exploded over the past 15 years. Among the committee’s concerns was that there appeared to be few — if any — controls on the way hospitals, clinics, and contract pharmacies spend the billions they receive from the program.
And it singled out two Ohio-based hospital chains for special focus — Cleveland Clinic and Bon Secours Mercy Health. 
“These hospitals were selected for this investigation as a result of media reports alleging abuse of the 340B Program, such as hospitals cutting services to underserved populations and expanding into affluent areas to increase reimbursement rates and subsequent revenue under the 340B Program,” the committee report said.
The committee’s findings about Cleveland Clinic, which received nearly $1 billion from the program over a 38-month period, are detailed here. 
Ohio’s Cleveland Clinic faces questions over booming subsidies

The report focused on Bon Secours Mercy Health because of media reports that it had gained 340B status from a hospital it owns in a poor, Black neighborhood in Richmond, Va. It steadily depleted resources at that hospital, while adding them at facilities in more affluent neighborhoods nearby, the reporting said.
Bon Secours Mercy Health didn’t respond to requests for comment. But observers said such conduct is likely happening elsewhere in the 50-hospital chain.
Explosive growth
Intended to subsidize care for the needy, the 340B program has grown from $5 billion a year in 2010 to nearly $67 billion in 2023, and analysts say that growth is only accelerating.
The program works by requiring drugmakers to give deep discounts off of list prices for drugs to qualifying hospitals, clinics, and the pharmacies with which they contract. Those entities are then allowed to charge insurers and uninsured customers the full list price and pocket the difference.
The idea behind 340B was to help providers with a large share of uninsured and Medicaid patients make ends meet while they shoulder the cost of uncompensated and under-compensated care.
Cleveland Clinic claimed last month that the program has no impact on taxpayers. But Antonio Ciaccia, a Columbus-based drug-pricing analyst, said the program creates billions in higher costs for insurers and ultimately consumers.
After Congress created the Medicaid Prescription Drug Rebate Program in 1990, it created 340B in 1992, requiring drugmakers to give discounts to qualifying hospitals and clinics that were equal to the Medicaid rebates.
The program grew relatively slowly until passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, when rules changes allowed a lot more entities to qualify. It’s since grown by leaps and bounds and is now the second-largest federal prescription-drug program, behind only Medicare Part D.
Growing numbers of hospital systems have joined the 340B program through seemingly giant loopholes.
Cleveland Clinic, for example, doesn’t admit enough Medicaid and uninsured patients to qualify under the original 340B rules. But under a quirk in the new rules, it was allowed in as a “rural-referral center” even though it’s headquartered in the middle of a big city.
Rural referral centers have lower barriers to qualify and are the fastest-growing type of 340B hospitals. Possibly indicating abuse, by 2022, 82% of so-called “rural referral centers” were located in urban areas, as were 77% of their patients, according to the Berkeley Research Group, a consulting firm.
Intended outcome?
Facilities owned by another Ohio-based group — Bon Secours Mercy Health — qualified another way. Its Richmond Community Hospital in Virginia is located in a low-income Black neighborhood in the city’s East End, where it qualifies as a federal “disproportionate share” hospital and thus for the 340B program.
However, the New York Times reported in 2022 Bon Secours Mercy Health hollowed out Richmond Community, closing its intensive care unit, its maternity ward, and other vital departments. 
At the same time, it created legal connections between the hospital and other clinics it owned in wealthier parts of town so that they could get 340B drug discounts. In those facilities it could reap a greater percentage of the 340B benefit because more patients are privately insured. That’s because transactions involving Medicaid patients aren’t eligible for the discount.
The paper reported on the perverse outcome of Bon Secours Mercy Health’s practices: It stripped its hospital in a poor neighborhood of resources while it used money meant for it to build and renovate lavish facilities where few poor people went.
“Bon Secours was basically laundering money through this poor hospital to its wealthy outposts,” Dr. Lucas English, who worked at Richmond Community until 2018, told the Times. “It was all about profits.”
For participating hospitals, the profits can be huge. 
Bon Secours Mercy Health collected $276 million in 340B benefits over a five-year period that ended in 2023, the Senate committee reported. That was just for the facilities that participate in 340B under Richmond Community’s designation — not those connected to any of the chain’s dozens of other hospitals that might separately be part of the 340B program.

Questionable spending
Some critics who want to see reform say there must be greater controls over how money collected under the program is spent. As it is, there don’t appear to be any.
Bon Secours Mercy Health and Cleveland Clinic told Senate investigators that they simply put the money into their general revenue and don’t specifically account for it after that.
As tens of billions more flow each year into hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies that participate in 340B, some are accused of spending on things that have nothing to do with health care — much less health care for the poor.
For example, how much New York University’s Langone Hospitals receive from the 340B program is not publicly available, but the number surely isn’t small. The system raised eyebrows when it spent an estimated $8 million advertising itself during the Super Bowl. 
Bon Secours paid more than $4 million for the naming rights of a Greenville, S.C. sports arena, claiming it would produce better health outcomes for the community.
“We’ve truly used this collaboration to expand our reach beyond hospital walls and live out our mission of building healthier communities, which is why we are very excited to extend this partnership and continue working together to make a difference in our community for many years to come,” Mark Caldwell, an executive with the 340B hospital, said in a written statement.
How the community would be made healthier by the arena’s food and beverage offerings isn’t obvious.
“The arena proudly offers Carolina Smoke BBQ, Well Pressed and Swamp Dog food stands, Reedy River Roost (our in house fried chicken shop!), GVL Pizza, Moe’s Southwest Grill, Pepsi products, and a nice selection of craft beer, domestic beer, and wine,” says the arena’s website, which has a picture of a bartender pouring gin into a cup.
Mercy Health also held the naming rights to the Lake Erie Crushers baseball stadium in Avon, Ohio, until last year. Mercy Health Lorain Hospital, 12 miles away, is a 340B facility.
Community benefit
Nonprofit hospitals receiving huge amounts from 340B aren’t just facing questions about whether they’re using those funds in the best interest of the poor and uninsured. Nonprofit hospitals generally have been coming under fire as analyses have shown that most are not providing community services that are commensurate with the huge tax breaks they enjoy. 
Theoretically, institutions are given tax exemptions in exchange for providing community benefits, but in Ohio most nonprofit hospitals receive more than they give, according to a recent analysis. 
Nonprofit hospitals have an obligation to help their communities

The nonpartisan Lown Institute this year reported that Ohio’s nonprofit hospitals get $2.2 billion annually in tax breaks. Yet nearly three quarters (74%) of them provide less than that in community service, the report said. 
That creates a $1.3 billion annual “fair share” deficit — the second-highest of the 20 states studied, the report said. Cleveland Clinic was the biggest offender in the state, with a $207 million annual deficit. That also qualified as the fifth-highest among any hospital in the 20 states, the report said.
Some of these “nonprofit” hospitals are also paying their top brass huge salaries. In the case of Bon Secours Mercy Health, CEO John Starcher Jr. made $8.8 million in reportable compensation in 2023 and an estimated $3.5 million more in “other compensation from the organization and related organizations,” the nonprofit’s IRS Form 990 says. The resulting $12.3 million is 176 times the median household income in Ohio.
The Economic Research Institute in 2022 put Starcher among the 10 highest-paid nonprofit CEOs in the country. The average nonprofit CEO made much less — just $152,199, the report said.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)FirstEnergy’s former in-house lobbyist Justin Biltz took the stand Tuesday in a utility commission hearing about House Bill 6 — the bill at the heart of Ohio’s utility political bribery and corruption scandal.
His testimony filled in some of the details of what prompted the company to bribe former Public Utilities Commission of Ohio Chair Sam Randazzo.
“The Ohio hole”
Sometime before 2019, FirstEnergy realized it had a problem. As a regulated monopoly, the company set rates in hearings before the PUCO. But it was becoming clear that FirstEnergy wouldn’t be able to justify rates as high as it currently charged when it went back before regulators.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Biltz explained they had a special name for it.
“The Ohio hole,” Biltz described, “was the difference in revenues that were established from the company’s last base distribution case as compared to what the company could justify if it were to go in for another rate case in 2024 and the difference being that it would have been a lower amount.”
Concerns about that lower rate led Biltz and other FirstEnergy employees to start working on different strategies to fill in that hole.
“There was a broad kind of working group at the company who were coming up with these different options that could be put in front of Mr. Randazzo,” Biltz explained. “I don’t recall him arriving at any conclusion in any of those meetings, but rather, the information was presented and he had it.”
Biltz acknowledged FirstEnergy executives wanted to see Randazzo installed as PUCO chair, but said they simply saw him as a person with “subject matter expertise” who could “bring some stability to the agency.”
Biltz described at least three meetings between himself, FirstEnergy Vice President Michael Dowling, and Randazzo at Randazzo’s home in Columbus, his condo in Cuyahoga Falls, and a FirstEnergy office.
These meetings occurred around the time Randazzo was tapped to lead the PUCO but prior to his term officially beginning.
“Was it your understanding at the time,” Ohio Consumers’ Counsel attorney Thomas Brodbeck asked, “that it was okay for yourself and others at FirstEnergy to discuss business that would be before Mr. Randazzo as chairperson of the PUCO, with Mr. Randazzo, so long as those discussions occurred before he was seated as chief?”
“Yeah, that was my understanding,” Biltz said. “That as long as his term had not yet started, that the company’s lawyers were involved and seemed okay with it.”
But that wasn’t the last of communications between the company and Randazzo. Evidence in the case is littered with text messages between FirstEnergy executives describing interaction with Randazzo, and even a few with Randazzo himself. Biltz said he was unaware of those at the time.
Still, there was at least one apparent incident he knew about.
“Is it your understanding that Mr. Randazzo helped FirstEnergy draft House Bill 6?” Ohio Manufacturing Association attorney Kim Bojko asked.
“I can recall being on a conference call with Mr. Randazzo during the legislative drafting process, there were several other internal employees, discussing some of the language in House Bill 6,” Biltz said. “I think we were sharing different language approaches. I don’t recall exactly the outcome of that and whether you’d consider that helping FirstEnergy.”
Randazzo officially assumed his post as PUCO chairman on April 11, 2019. House Bill 6 was filed the very next day.
Biltzer didn’t put a date on the conference call he described, but FirstEnergy’s deferred prosecution agreement describes Randazzo having a direct hand in the legislative efforts in June and July of 2019. The measure passed in late July.
The payments
On Jan. 30, 2019, an “urgent and confidential” request went out to the accounting team at FirstEnergy. Could they track down any payments to an organization called ‘Sustainability Funding Alliance’ — or something like that? The following day, the ask was expanded to include ‘McNees Wallace’ and ‘Randazzo.’
Sustainability Funding Alliance was a consulting firm controlled by Randazzo, and McNees Wallace was the law firm he worked for.
Gov. Mike DeWine tapped Randazzo to lead the PUCO on Feb. 4 that year.
Biltz explained the internal review started up in response to a reporter’s request. They’d found a connection to Sustainability Funding Alliance in bankruptcy proceedings for a subsidiary called FirstEnergy Solutions.
“In late January 2019, Mike Dowling had asked or informed me that this was a contract that was being managed out of the legal department,” Biltz said. “He wanted to know exactly how much had been paid to that entity over time, and by which entities those costs were being allocated to.”
The review found FirstEnergy had paid almost $20 million to Sustainability Funding Alliance since 2010, including “a 4.3 million lump sum that was paid in December 2018.”
Brodbeck emphasized the timeline — lump sum payment in December, and Randazzo’s appointment to the PUCO two months later in February.
“Do you know what that lump sum was for?” he asked Biltz.
Biltz insisted, “I was never involved in any discussions regarding that lump sum.”
Brodbeck pressed on, asking whether those dollars got passed along to consumers.
“I was not able to determine that,” he said. “I knew which entities they were allocated to, but whether they eventually made it into rates or riders, that was not something that I had been asked to look into and did not.”
As for whether the expenses were applied to Ohio utility companies, Biltz acknowledged that they had.
Brodbeck asked if the company had discussed concealing the records from the public or sharing them with the PUCO.
“Not to my knowledge,” Biltz said.

The changes would be implemented starting Jan. 1, 2033.

“As of the last Census, the size of these districts in terms of population are roughly 358,000 and 119,000, respectively,” Blessing said Tuesday to the Senate General Government Committee during his sponsor testimony. “Smaller districts more firmly anchor legislators to their districts. They would represent fewer communities and constituents, and could devote more time to them.”
Legislative redistricting next occurs in 2031. 
“Should SJR 1 be put on the ballot and passed, I strongly believe that the proportion of Republicans to Democrats would more closely approach proportional representation through no other means than mathematics,” Blessing said. 
Seventeen senators’ four-year terms are set to begin in 2031 and 16 senators’ four-year terms are scheduled to begin in 2033. The proposal would keep the Senate’s term limit the same at four years in the long run. In order for that to happen, 34 senators would be up for election in 2032 with eight of them for a two-year term. 
“However, this is only temporary and will not count against their term limits,” Blessing said. 
State Sen. Willis E. Blackshear Jr., D-Dayton, asked about how much increasing lawmaker membership would cost the legislature. 
“We have a $100 billion budget in this state,” Blessing said. “There is, in my opinion, no way that this would be more than low tens of millions of costs.” 
Blackshear also asked if the legislature would be more or less efficient in passing legislation? 
“I do think to some degree, it is going to be more difficult on leadership trying to herd the cats together,” Blessing said. “But in the end, hopefully you have more eyeballs on things. You have more subject matter experts.” 
Ohio, the seventh most populous state, has the fourth largest population state senate seats and sixth largest population state representative seats, Blessing said. 
“The average for all states is 161,000 and 61,000, respectively,” he said. “SJR 1, if it were law today, would mean Senate and House district sizes of roughly 232,000 and 77,000, respectively.”

In February, Gov. Mike DeWine proposed his child care-centric budget, which is no longer being actively considered by the legislature.
In April, the House passed its conservative budget, mainly keeping funding levels the same for programs. However, the chamber slashed the expected education budget by hundreds of millions and changed Medicaid requirements and funding significantly.
And in June, the Senate passed its business-focused budget. It also added back in $100 million in school funding, and it cut Medicaid further.
It’s now time for common ground. Representing the Senate are Cirino, Finance Vice Chair Brian Chavez, R-Marietta, and Ranking Member Paula Hicks-Hudson, D-Toledo. The House team is comprised of Stewart, Finance Vice Chair Mike Dovilla, R-Berea, and Ranking Member Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake.
But just because Stewart and Cirino are from the same party doesn’t mean they will agree.
“There are some things that neither side will compromise on,” Cirino said.
One of those Senate non-negotiables is its 2.75% flat income tax, meaning the highest earners in the state, those making more than $100,000 a year, will no longer have to pay 3.5% in income tax, making them equal to the lower tax bracket.
“It’s going to put money in the hands of Ohioans,” Cirino said.
State data reveals that this could result in a loss of more than $1.1 billion in the general revenue fund. Stewart isn’t fully on board.
“We would like to see some income tax relief,” the House leader said. “I don’t know if we have the same view today that we need to get there entirely in this budget.”
The billion dollars would be made up by cutting a majority of social services that mainly benefit lower-income families, and specific provisions that House members put in to help their communities.
“I think that we prepared our budget based on what our members wanted to see. I certainly don’t begrudge the Senate preparing a budget based on what their members want to see,” Stewart said. “But now we’ve got to get to 50+ votes in the House, and I think that our members have an expectation that a lot of their priorities are going to be considered, and that’s what we’re going to fight for over the next week.”
The Senate also doesn’t want to compromise on its $600 million grant for the Cleveland Browns’ new stadium using unclaimed funds.
“There are some things that we believe in strongly,” Cirino said.
The House’s version proposed borrowing $600 million by issuing bonds. Speaker Matt Huffman, noting that he likes the Senate’s idea, raised questions about the other chamber’s proposal.
“The specifics of that seem to be vague,” he said, further referencing what the unclaimed funds could be used for in the future. “I don’t think they know all of the details of it yet.”
Sweeney, the House Democrats representative, said she is on the defensive.
“I actually have had very productive meetings, not on some of the big topics, [but] of how we can make real changes to some of the harmful provisions the Senate put in,” she said.
Last week, she said that she thinks both the House and the Senate’s budgets were bad, but that the Senate’s was worse.
At the end of the day, Stewart is confident he can push back against Cirino.
“I don’t call anything non-negotiable,” Stewart chuckled.
Cirino said that everyone on the committee respects each other, and there are policy differences, but the GOP is still on the same team.
“We’re going to work in good faith to resolve those differences,” Cirino said.
A final budget is expected to be passed next week.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)After the shootings of Minnesota state legislators and the apparent targeting of other officials, surely we can all agree that violence has no place in American politics.
Surely.
Yet what to make of the fact that President Donald Trump’s administration selected former Kansas Rep. Patrick Penn, R-Wichita, as the agriculture department’s deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services? You might remember Penn as the legislator who spoke on the House floor about blowing away former Hutchinson Rep. Jason Probst with tank fire.
The entire exchange was captured on a video feed from the floor, which can be seen here.


 Kansas Republican Reps. Kyler Sweely (left) and Patrick Penn exchange words on Feb. 13, 2005, on the House floor.
Here’s how part of Penn’s conversation with and freshly minted Rep. Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson, went town.

Penn: “Now when we talk about the commands for firing, what are the components of a firing command?”
Sweely: “Identifying the target, the direction the target is, the range that the target is, and then the type of ammo that you’re going to use to address the target.”
Penn: “So if I were to come to you and say, I have a firing command, and that command is, ‘Gunner, sabot, that guy from Hutch in the open, fire for effect,’ what would you say?”
Sweely: “Gunner, sabot, that guy from Hutch.”
Penn: “All right, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you on his maiden voyage here before you as colleagues, that new guy from Hutch.”

Some quick background: Both representatives are veterans, and they bantered about the subject as part of a freshman hazing ritual. “That guy in Hutch” refers to Probst, who runs a Substack newsletter and podcast under that name. Sweely narrowly defeated Probst, a Democrat, in the November general election.
Neither Penn nor Sweely ever apologized for their words about the former representative, as far as I know. Likewise, no other Kansas Republicans condemned their violent rhetoric.
Now, we have an all-too-clear example of actual, honest-to-God political violence. Melissa Hartman, speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatves, and her husband were shot dead. Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded but survived. A suspect was arrested Sunday after a statewide search.
The violence gives every indication of being politically motivated. It follows other alarming examples, such as arson at Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home in April and an assassination attempt on Trump in July 2024. Back in 2023, a man was convicted of threatening then-U.S. Rep. Jake LaTurner after reading a Kansas Reflector news story.
No political party, no official benefits from the normalization of political violence. We all lose.
That makes Trump’s decision to employ Penn all the more baffling. The Kansas Statehouse includes many qualified members who didn’t joke about blowing away their former colleagues through tank fire. Our state boasts of richly gifted residents who have conducted themselves in exemplary fashion. No one made Washington, D.C., officials pick That Guy from Wichita.
Listen, I get it. Some readers will claim I’m overreacting, given that Penn’s comments were made in jest. But they still promised violence.
You either take that seriously or you don’t.
Trump apparently doesn’t. As one of his first actions in his second term, he pardoned 1,500 people who tried to overthrow the U.S. government and kill his vice president on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s threatened cities run by Democrats. He even refused to call Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after the recent shootings, calling him “whacked out” and “a mess.”
I have written before that Kansans and Americans should not censor ourselves to protect others’ feelings, and I still believe that’s true. Participants in our democracy require the freedom to write and speak forcefully, to condemn that which must be condemned, to call the powerful to account.
Yet all of us — in Kansas, in the United States — stand at the edge of a scary new age. Penn and his fellow lawmakers, up to and including Trump, are playing with fire. We must find ways to navigate these exceptional times while avoiding any more bloodshed.
Lest the flames rage out of control.

David Thomas put forth a bill that would give the authority to lower property taxes for local governments to county commissioners.
This is just one of a series of recent proposals in Ohio to reduce property taxes, including a bipartisan bill to reduce property taxes for low-income homeowners, an Ohio House plan to reduce property taxes for school districts with budget reserves at the end of the year, and a constitutional amendment to end property taxation in the state.
There are reasons for this change. Cost of construction has tamped down supply of housing, causing housing prices to rise quickly over the past decade. This has led to assessments that have driven property taxes up quickly relative to incomes.
What happens if Ohio reduces its property tax revenue? In 2022, local governments in Ohio collected $19 billion in property taxes according to the Annual Survey of Local Government Finance. This accounted for 63% of total tax revenue collected by local governments.
So if Ohio, in the extreme case, ended property taxes, what options would it have?
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A first option would be just to eat the loss. This would lead to a massive disinvestment of local governments. This means fewer police and firefighter services, large reductions in the number of schools, and rapid deterioration of roads and utility infrastructure. This would likely lead to a quick deterioration of quality of life in Ohio.
Another option would be to make these property taxes up with income taxes, local governments’ second-highest source of revenue. In 2022, local governments in Ohio raised $6.5 billion in income taxes. This means income tax rates would need to quadruple to make up the lost revenue from property taxes. Currently, these sorts of changes can happen by a vote of the public. 
So this means a resident of the City of Columbus, currently paying a 2.5% local income tax, would see their local income tax rate jump to 10%.
This could have some benefits. Income taxes are generally more broad-based than property taxes, so this provides some more economic efficiency. They also are more progressive than property taxes, which can be especially burdensome to low-income renters who bear the burden of property taxes levied on their landlords.
That being said, 10% local income taxes would be a lot for many residents to stomach.
A final option would be a land value tax. This is a tax that applies not to property, but to the value of the land the property is built upon. This sort of tax is popular among economists because it is economically efficient because it does not discourage improvement of land. 
It is also equitable because the burden of the tax falls on the landowner and since they cannot control the amount of land available the same way they can control the amount of homes available by building or choosing not to build on land they own.
The drawback of land value taxation? It would take significant change in Ohio’s current laws and possibly a constitutional amendment of its own.
The options for replacing property taxation are stark. As legislators and potentially the public make decisions that could erode property taxation in Ohio, they will need to think with clear heads about what the alternatives look like.

In a recent study, researchers found more pediatric firearm deaths in states with looser gun laws. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
States move to outlaw popular ‘Glock switches’ that make some guns fully automatic

In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.










When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can't save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death.


– Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery, MetroHealth medical center, Cleveland


In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

Trump’s name never passed his lips.","“Where is Barack Obama?” asked the plaintive headline atop Mark Leibovich’s recent essay in The Atlantic. It all but pronounced the former president AWOL in a time of terrific tumult, a shirker ignoring Donald J. Trump’s “democracy-shaking, economy-quaking, norm-obliterating action.”
“No matter how brazen Trump becomes, the most effective communicator in the Democratic Party continues to opt for minimal communication,” Leibovich wrote in the piece posted June 8. “His ‘audacity of hope’ presidency has given way to fierce lethargy of semi-retirement.”
Ouch.
Obama made his whereabouts known Tuesday night, entering to thunderous applause at The Bushnell theater in Hartford, across the street from the state Capitol where an estimated 9,000 people had gathered three days earlier in a day of national defiance and protest.
Obama was not there to answer alarms sounded on social media and amplified by Leibovich. He was honoring a booking with a venerable venue for thinkers and artists, the Connecticut Forum. The 44th president of the United States arrived in crisp charcoal slacks, white shirt open at the collar and a dark blazer. There was neither cape nor cowl.
He spoke as a teacher, albeit one warning of a frightening flirtation with autocracy.
“If you follow regularly what is said by those who are in charge of the federal government right now, there is a weak commitment to what we understood — and not just my generation, at least since World War II —  our understanding of how a liberal democracy is supposed to work,” he said.
Obama challenged law firms and universities not to cower in the face of threats and intimidation but did not offer himself as more than an observer. In his only other substantive public appearance since Trump returned to the White House, a night of conversation on stage at Hamilton College in April, Obama had signaled against expecting more from him.
“It is up to all of us to fix this,” Obama said then. “It’s not going to be because somebody comes and saves you.”
On Tuesday night, in conversation with historian Heather Cox Richardson, Obama spoke of conflicts and commitment, of the sacrifices of John Lewis and the other civil rights marchers brutalized on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma more than a half-century ago.
“To me, that contest on the Edmund Pettus Bridge is as important a battle as Concord and Lexington and Appomattox,” Obama said.
But over nearly 90 minutes, Obama played by the unwritten rules of the ex-presidency, offering commentary that was sharp at times but oblique. He spoke harshly of Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, two pretenders at winning at the ballot. 
Trump’s name never passed his lips.
Obama, 63, the youngest of the three living former presidents, said the prosperity and relative ease of life in postwar America, especially after Vietnam and the passage of civil rights laws, smoothed the path for many to be socially conscious.
“If you were relatively privileged to have been brought up in the United States of America during this period, you could be as progressive and socially conscious as you wanted, and you did not have to pay a price,” he said. “You could still make a lot of money. You could still hang out in Aspen and Milan and travel and have a house in the Hamptons and still think of yourself as a progressive.”
“And now things are a little different. Your commitments are being tested, not the way Nelson Mandela’s commitments were tested, where you go to jail for 27 years,” Obama said. “You might lose some of your donors, if you’re a university. And if you’re a law firm, your billings might drop a little bit, which means you cannot remodel that kitchen in your house at the Hamptons this summer.”
He barely touched on recent events. He spoke as Trump hinted at a direct U.S. military role in Israel’s unfolding war with Iran, called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender,” threatened its supreme leader with death and, quite separately and casually, insulted the president of France and the grieving governor of Minnesota.

Cox Richardson, the former president’s interlocutor for the event, is a professor of American history at Boston College and a commentator on contemporary American politics on social media and a newsletter on substack that Obama praised for a clear-eyed view of what’s fact and fiction.
She did not press Obama on the desires of some to see him more active or on his view of the limits of being an ex-president and member of a party struggling for a direction and new leadership.
Five days ago, a call-to-action essay Cox Richardson delivered on YouTube was titled, “Now is the Time to Take Sides.”
She recorded it on the day when Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., was wrestled to the ground as he interrupted the press conference of the Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles. But it was less what security did than what Noem said that set off the professor.
Noem asserted, “We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialists and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into the city.”
Cox Richardson saw that as an ominous marker of things to come, namely the use of force to undermine a democratically elected mayor and governor.
“I won’t say it’s a wake-up call, because a lot of us have been awake for a long time,” she said on YouTube. “It is a sign for those people who were not, perhaps, paying close attention, or were hoping that Trump was not going to do the things like that. People like us were saying he was going to do that. In fact, he is going to do it. And now is the time for people really to take sides.”
That was not fodder for conversation Tuesday.
Instead, she said, she wanted to end on a “note of hope” and asked about his foundation’s mission.
“I would love if you could tell us what advice you’re giving those young scholars to enable them to be optimistic about their future, and about the future, and maybe about our future,” she said.
“Yes, I’m still an optimist,” he said. “I’m still the hope guy.”
The premise of his foundation is that leaders are nurtured and encouraged, which requires breaking from the cocoons of contemporary digital life and finding community. It means, he said, engaging with those who agree with you on little.
“It is important to be impatient with injustice and cruelty, and there’s a healthy outrage that we should be exhibiting in terms of what’s currently happening, both here and around the world,” he said. “But if you want to deliver on change, then it’s a game of addition, not subtraction, which means you have to find ways to make common ground with people who don’t agree with you on everything but agree with you on something.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/President-Obama-CT-Forum-selects-02-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-18 00:59:07.507492

This pushback comes at a dangerous cost. In the U.S., young people aged 15-24 account for half of all new sexually transmitted infections (STIs), highlighting a significant public health challenge. Despite this pressing need, many students lack access to essential resources for safeguarding their sexual health. Connecticut is among the states that have yet to mandate comprehensive sex education in schools and even in states where it is mandated, programs often emphasize abstinence-only approaches, despite evidence showing their ineffectiveness in reducing STI rates.
Through our education programs, our team sees firsthand that young people are seeking accurate information to answer their questions and help them make informed decisions. Sex education does just that–it provides a trusted source of information while also giving students the skills to find accurate information on their own.
Sex education is fundamentally about empowering people of all ages and locations to advocate for themselves and access medically accurate, inclusive, and age-appropriate info. Sex education is a matter of public health. Denying young people access to quality, comprehensive sex ed doesn’t deter –or delay– sexual activity; it only bars them from the tools and information they need to make informed decisions.
Let’s unite in demanding that every young person receives the education they deserve. Despite attempts to politicize the issue, the evidence is unequivocal: sex education saves lives. 
It’s time to move beyond debates over whether young people should have access to this knowledge and instead focus on ensuring it’s accessible to all. And for young people looking to be involved in peer education, they can check out our STARS peer education program here.

(Photo courtesy campaign)In a nail-biter Democratic primary Tuesday, Jay Jones narrowly defeated Henrico Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor in the race for attorney general, setting up a November showdown with Republican incumbent Jason Miyares. 
According to unofficial results from the Virginia Department of Elections, Jones won 51% of the vote to Taylor’s 49%.
Jones, a former state delegate from Norfolk and one-time candidate for attorney general in 2021, returns to statewide politics with a renewed focus on consumer protection, corporate accountability, and civil rights.
 “The Attorney General should work for the people, not the wealthiest corporations in our state,” Jones told The Mercury in a recent interview. “I will always fight to hold special interests accountable, encourage cleaner and more affordable energy practices, and protect families from unfair utility costs.”
With a razor-thin victory margin, the win marks a political comeback for Jones, who stepped away from elected office in 2021 following the birth of his first child. During his tenure in the House of Delegates, he helped pass legislation to expand Medicaid, raise teacher pay, defend abortion rights, and authored the “Ashanti Alert” law for missing adults — now used nationwide.
He also drew on his experience as an Assistant Attorney General in Washington, D.C., where he cracked down on slumlords, gun manufacturers and price-gouging corporations. 
“As Attorney General, I’ll continue this fight and take on the corporate price gougers driving up costs for working families,” Jones said, citing the proposed Kroger-Albertsons merger as one example.
Jones, a descendant of enslaved Virginians and son of the late Judge Jerrauld C. Jones, grew up steeped in public service. His grandfather was a pioneering civil rights attorney and the first Black member of the State Board of Education. Jones now seeks to carry that legacy forward in a rematch of sorts — his father once served alongside Miyares in the General Assembly.
In the crowded six-way Democratic primary for lieutenant governor, no winner had emerged by 10:30 p.m. Tuesday.
Virginia Primary Preview: 10 House of Delegates contests to watch Tuesday

State Sen. Ghazala Hashmi of Richmond held a narrow lead with 27.39% of the vote (131,587 ballots), followed closely by former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney with 26.64% (127,973) and state Sen. Aaron Rouse of Virginia Beach with 26.34% (126,525). Trailing were Prince William School Board Chair Babur Lateef (8.41%), former Fairfax judge Alex Bastani (5.69%), and activist Victor Salgado (5.56%).
That contest is likely headed for a canvas and potential recount given the tight margins between the top three candidates.
Virginia’s Democratic ticket will come into sharper focus once the LG results are certified. But with Jones now locked in to challenge Miyares, voters can expect a high-profile battle this fall over criminal justice, consumer rights, and the future of abortion access.
With primaries now decided in all 100 of Virginia’s House of Delegates districts, voters on Tuesday finalized the matchups for what’s expected to be a high-stakes general election in November. Several races across the state emerged as especially competitive or revealing, offering a preview of the ideological and geographic battlegrounds that could determine control of the chamber.
House District 1
Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, easily fended off a challenge in this safely blue district, winning 72.3% of the vote against Arjoon Srikanth (18.9%) and Sean Epstein (8.77%). Hope, a longtime delegate, has now secured his path to reelection in November in a district where no Republican has announced a bid.
House District 21:
Gregory Gorham will be the Republican nominee in this highly competitive swing district, after winning a three-way primary with 66% of the vote. Gorham defeated Sahar Smith (27%) and Xanthe Larsen (6.6%). The district is currently held by Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, and both parties are expected to invest heavily in the general election. Data center development has emerged as a flashpoint in the race, with Gorham promising stricter regulations and increased taxation.
House District 37:  
Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, overcame a rare Republican primary challenge, defeating Austin Schwend with 63% to 37% of the vote. Austin’s win reinforces his standing heading into November, although Democrats are targeting the seat in hopes of flipping it in a competitive year.
House District 46:
Grayson County Supervisor Mitchell Cornett clinched the Republican nomination with 54% of the vote over Adam Tolbert, a higher education administrator. Cornett now advances to face Democrat Jamie Ralston Hendry in November in a district that heavily favors Republicans. The seat opened after Del. Jed Arnold, R-Smyth, opted not to seek reelection, making this race a key one to watch in Southwest Virginia, though the GOP remains strongly favored to retain control.
House District 70: 
Republican Cynthia Scaturico cruised to victory in her primary against Hailey Louise Shupe-Dollar, winning 74% of the vote. She now faces incumbent Del. Shelly Simonds, D-Newport News, in a district with historic significance and a slight Democratic lean. Education policy and infrastructure are likely to dominate the campaign.
House District 72: 
Randolph Critzer Jr., a Richmond-based attorney, captured the Democratic nomination with 60% of the vote over educator Bilal Raychouni (40%). He will challenge veteran Republican Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, who has held the seat for more than two decades. Democrats see the district as a potential pickup depending on turnout and suburban shifts.
House District 73:
Leslie Mehta, a former congressional candidate, won the Democratic nomination decisively with 76.5% of the vote, with contender Justin Woodford taking 23.4%. Mehta now prepares to face incumbent Del. Mark Earley, R-Chesterfield, in a district that has trended conservative but remains on the edge of competitiveness. Her background in health policy and bipartisan messaging may help bridge the gap with swing voters.
House District 75:
Lindsey Dougherty emerged from a crowded Democratic primary with 45.1% of the vote, beating Dustin Wade (32.7%) and Stephen Miller-Pitts (22.5%). She will go up against incumbent Republican Del. Carrie Coyner in a suburban seat that has seen growing Democratic interest.
House District 97:

Former Delegate Tim Anderson staged a comeback by winning the Republican primary with 93% of the vote, defeating Christina Miriam Felder, who earned 6.7%. He will Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, in a general election race expected to draw significant statewide attention. Anderson’s platform focuses on public safety and rolling back what he views as excessive Democratic criminal justice reforms.

That’s according to Ronald Binz, who testified Tuesday in a controversial hearing before the Montana Public Service Commission about NorthWestern Energy’s bid to increase its electricity rates, among other issues. I[...]","Colstrip Power Plant in Colstrip, Montana (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).NorthWestern Energy paid zero dollars for additional shares of the coal-fired plant at Colstrip — but even no money at all might be overpayment.
That’s according to Ronald Binz, who testified Tuesday in a controversial hearing before the Montana Public Service Commission about NorthWestern Energy’s bid to increase its electricity rates, among other issues.
In January 2026, the monopoly utility, the largest in Montana, will increase its ownership of the electricity generation facility in Colstrip from 15% to 55%, but Binz said the increase comes with significant risk and high potential costs for customers.
Units 3 and 4 at Colstrip began operating in 1984, according to a history of the plant by the Northern Plains Resource Council.
“There’s a sense in which they’re paying too much — even acquiring it at zero cost — because they are buying a plant with substantial liability,” said Binz, an energy policy analyst.
At the hearing, expected to wrap up as early as Wednesday, the Public Service Commission is considering settlement agreements among select parties, including NorthWestern Energy.
Binz testified Tuesday on behalf of a group of organizations that argue the utility purposefully excluded more affordable options when it evaluated how to best serve electricity customers, and the PSC should hold it to account.
Utilities earn profits off of capital investments, and NorthWestern built an estimated $320 million gas-fired plant in Laurel without gaining pre-approval by the PSC. It argued it needed to move quickly to save money.
It also has planned investments in Colstrip, contested in the current rate case.
The group of organizations opposed to the settlements with NorthWestern argue the PSC should scrutinize the costs that will be passed onto customers from the methane-fired plant, the Yellowstone County Generating Station, and the ailing coal-fired plant in Colstrip.
In opening statements on behalf of the group, lawyer Jenny Harbine urged the PSC to “embrace … its leadership role” and open a separate docket focused on developing a plan to avoid or mitigate risks at Colstrip.
Harbine also described NorthWestern Energy as “testing the boundaries of its discretion.”
“Following years of being allowed to expand those boundaries, the company, in this rate case, again seeks reward for its risky investments that have served to drive up electricity rates,” Harbine said.
In fall 2023, the PSC approved a NorthWestern settlement that increased residential electricity rates for average customers by 28% from summer 2022.
Currently, based on data from NorthWestern, residential customers are likely to be paying $127.24 a month come July 1, a 39.4% increase in three years, before any order in the current case is issued.
NorthWestern has said if the PSC approves settlements in the current case, it would receive a 4.2% increase compared to rates from July 2024.
Citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Commissioner Annie Bukacek said Montana has the second lowest electricity rates for residential among the states categorized as in the Mountain region, second behind only Idaho.
However, Harbine said one important factor in the current case is the way permanent increases would continue to accrue. A customer’s bill includes a base cost, generally permanent, and it also includes ongoing costs that can go up or down.
In this case, Harbine said NorthWestern is proposing a 20% increase in its base rate, which would come on top of a 20% increase in its base from the most recent case.
“The impact to ratepayers, again, is durable, and it’s substantial,” Harbine said.
Binz, former chairman of the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, agreed Montana has had relatively low rates compared to the rest of the country, albeit not as low as some states in the Pacific Northwest with a lot of hydro power.
However, he said the low costs are due to many years of stable coal prices. He said that trend is changing.
Binz also said even though the purchase at Colstrip cost NorthWestern no money, it could state a market value for the plant that’s more than zero, and if that amount ends up in the base rate, the cost to customers won’t be zero.
“Customers are going to pay a lot for that even if the company did not,” Binz said as a potential outcome.
He also said ensuring the plant is compliant with federal regulations on mercury emissions will “require significant investment,” although PSC President Brad Molnar said the Trump administration recently delayed the implementation of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.
Burning coal releases pollutants, including mercury.
Nonetheless, Binz said it is difficult to predict when and if the rule would be completely abandoned, and he believes it is “highly unlikely” future administrations of any political party are going to ignore damage from mercury, other toxins and emissions.
In the past, Binz said, renewable costs were higher than fossil fuel equivalents. But he said that’s flipped with wind, solar and storage.
Binz, who also previously led the Colorado Office of Consumer Counsel, said utilities have a duty to give up the biases they have held around costs, or the idea fossil fuel generation is automatically more affordable.
He offered a prediction about the facility at Colstrip.
“Colstrip is going to be very expensive to keep going unless you make assumptions that there will be no penalty or sanction for its current level of mercury and air toxic emissions,” Binz said.
In his written testimony, Binz noted of the 314 coal-fired units covered by the federal standards, only two would require new pollution controls, both at Colstrip, based on an estimate from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
In the January 2025 statement, he said NorthWestern confirmed “it is their understanding that Colstrip is the only operating coal plant that will be required to make a substantial investment to comply with the new MATS rule.”
When NorthWestern CEO Brian Bird announced in January 2023 the additional acquisition at Colstrip, he admitted he was probably the only executive adding coal to his portfolio.
“More resources that can generate power on-demand, 24/7, located in Montana and dedicated to serve Montanans, are needed to meet our responsibility to provide our customers with reliable energy service, keep them safe in all weather conditions and avoid an energy crisis,” Bird said at the time.
NorthWestern’s acquisition includes shares from Avista, which in 2023 said coal generation might become “obsolete” through regulation or legislation.
Binz, though, said NorthWestern Energy is failing the public with its bias against wind and solar.
In her opening statement, Harbine said witness testimony shows customers are facing escalating costs at the Colstrip facility, which is 40 years old.
She argued the PSC should send a message to NorthWestern that it won’t rubber stamp those costs, “now or in the future, for any resource, including for Colstrip, that could unnecessarily harm customers.”
On the witness stand, Michael Barnes, superintendent of power generation at Colstrip, said it would take 33 to 44 months to install pollution controls that would ensure the facility is compliant with Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.
Under questioning by Harbine, Barnes agreed the costs for an overhaul of Colstrip Unit 3 was about $55.5 million in 2025, more than double the overhaul for 2021.
Barnes said a couple of factors contribute to the increase, including that a condenser in the facility was “re-tubed.” Those plants have tubes that need to be replaced if they start leaking.
“We’re starting to get to a time where we’re getting too many outages, and they’re going to be exponential even from here, because look, that was all original equipment,” Barnes said.
He also said materials, labor and other costs are more expensive than they were in 2021. He said NorthWestern has paid its 15% share of those costs, and its portion would increase to 55% if the acquisition goes as planned.
He acknowledged Unit 4 at Colstrip is expected to need an $81 million overhaul in 2027, necessitated in part by the age of equipment and effects of repeated heating and cooling.
However, a lawyer representing NorthWestern asked Barnes if overhaul of a coal generation plant is “a normal occurrence,” and he agreed, although he said the intervals of the work may vary.
Barnes also said it’s more cost effective to maintain an old plant than build a new one, and he said he believes the Colstrip facility is critical to NorthWestern’s entire system.
“Nobody’s building a coal plant these days, but if I was to build one, I know it would be very much more expensive than it is to maintain this one,” Barnes said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-9897-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-17 23:03:04.525930

(Photo by Bob Wick/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)The Trump administration on Tuesday proposed opening about 7 million more federally managed acres on Alaska’s North Slope to new oil development, resurrecting a pro-drilling plan proposed in the first Trump administration but never adopted.
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management released the new draft integrated activity plan for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. The plan proposes opening 82% of the 23-million-acre federal land unit on the Western North Slope to oil development; currently, only about half of the reserve is open to development.
The National Petroleum Reserve has yielded significant oil discoveries in recent years, most notably the 600-million-barrel Willow field that ConocoPhillips is currently developing. But it also holds important Arctic habitat for migratory birds, caribou and other wildlife, and is used by Indigenous residents for traditional subsistence food-gathering.
Under the existing management plan, a little over 11.7 million acres are open for leasing; under the proposed plan, more than 18.5 million acres would be available for leasing.
“This plan is about creating more jobs for Americans, reducing our dependence on foreign oil and tapping into the immense energy resources the National Petroleum Reserve was created to deliver,” Adam Suess, acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management at the Department of the Interior, said in a statement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we’re cutting red tape and restoring commonsense policies that ensure responsible development and good stewardship of our public lands.”
 

  Designated special areas in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska are shown in this 2023 map. Oil leasing is not allowed in the special areas. (Map provided by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management)
 

	In a post on the social media site X, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the administration “is unleashing American energy like never before” and that the plan is “delivering on our promise of ending Biden’s disastrous regulatory overreach.”
The draft proposal is available for a 14-day public review.
Like the previous Trump administration’s plan for the reserve, the new plan would replace a 2013 integrated activity plan adopted by the Obama administration. That Obama framework, still in effect, was the first ever management plan for the entire reserve. It included protections for specific areas deemed to be ecologically and culturally important.
As with the first Trump administration’s plan, the new plan would open the entire Teshekpuk Lake area to oil development. The lake, the largest on the North Slope, and the wetlands around it are considered to hold world-class habitat for migratory birds, as well as key habitat for the Teshekpuk caribou herd that spends the entire year on the North Slope, and other wildlife.
The lake and its adjacent lands have had formal protections from development since 1977, when the Department of the Interior designed the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area. The special area was later expanded in the Obama administration’s integrated activity plan.
Aside from allowing leasing and drilling within the lake and on its surrounding areas, the new Trump administration plan proposes eliminating formal protections for the Colville River. The river, which runs along high bluffs, is known for its raptor nesting sites and its rich paleontological resources. Several Cretaceous-era dinosaur species’ fossils have been discovered there, along with species of ancient fish, including the oldest salmonoid in the global fossil record, according to University of Alaska Fairbanks experts.

	The previous Trump administration’s plan for the National Petroleum Reserve prompted the environmental group American Rivers to list the Colville in 2019 as one of the nation’s most endangered rivers.
Environmentalists criticized the new plan.
“This is another step in the Trump administration’s reckless effort to sell out our most valuable national public lands to the oil industry in the midst of the climate crisis,” Matt Jackson, senior manager for Alaska at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement.
“They are scrapping a plan that is based on a robust body of science and traditional ecological knowledge that protects high-value wildlife habitat and subsistence resources that are vital to local Indigenous communities across Alaska, and replacing it with a strategy that puts corporate greed ahead of people.” 
The new Trump administration has already started the process of discarding other environmental protections in the reserve. President Donald Trump, in an Inauguration Day executive order, directed Interior to overturn Biden administration policies that allowed for expansion of the reserve’s special areas, among other limits to oil development.
Neither the first Trump administration nor the Biden administration held any lease sales in the reserve. Under the Obama administration, the policy was to hold annual lease sales in that area. The last National Petroleum Reserve lease sale was held in 2016.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Central Iowa Water Works’ long-range plans will increase water treatment capacity by 25%, and once in place would prevent water conservation orders like the lawn watering ban currently in place. 
In the meantime, CIWW leadership said the lawn watering ban will remain in place as it has reduced demand and allowed the system to remove the “near historic” levels of nitrate from the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers. 
Tami Madsen, CIWW executive director, speaking at a press conference Tuesday, emphasized that the regional water supply is dealing with a water quality issue and not a water quantity issue. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The system pulls water from the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers, and when necessary, treats the water for nitrate concentrations that exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s drinking water concentration limit of 10 milligrams per liter. According to CIWW the rivers had concentrations as high as 17 mg/l and despite running the nitrate removal systems at full capacity for nearly 60 days, water leaving the facility was in danger of exceeding the federal limits. 
CIWW issued a mandatory lawn watering ban June 12. Madsen said lawn watering accounts for 40% of demand, so stopping that use is the “fastest, most efficient way to reduce demand.”
Ted Corrigan, the CEO and general manager at Des Moines Water Works, which is part of the CIWW system, said the last time nitrate levels in both the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers were this high was in 2013. 
Corrigan said there is a trend of higher nitrate concentrations when there is a year of average precipitation following periods of drought, as the region has seen the past several years. 
Corrigan said rain in the Des Moines area would help the system by reducing demand and adding fresh water to the rivers. But, he said, rain up the watershed could have a negative effect by flushing more nutrients through farm tile lines, off of fields and into the river. 
He said the situation is “very dynamic” and therefore it is difficult to say when the lawn watering ban might be lifted, but he expects levels in the rivers will decline in the next two to three weeks. 
Corrigan said outgoing water has remained below the EPA limit, thanks to customers in the system who have complied with the lawn watering ban. 
“That is entirely due to the fact that the community has responded so well to our request,” Corrigan said. “Without that we would have violated the nitrate standard.”
Long-term plan will add significant treatment capacity 
Central Iowa Water Works is a regional water production authority founded by 12 utility and water entities in central Iowa. It serves more than 600,000 customers. 
Christina Murphy, West Des Moines Water Works’ general manager, said the CIWW has been planning capacity expansions that will help to treat water for nitrate, and other contaminants.
The plans include doubling the Saylorville Water Treatment Plant, which would add an additional 10 million gallons each day, expanding the City of Grimes Water Treatment Plants and constructing a 12-million-gallon, per day, treatment plant to the Des Moines metro’s west side. All of these facilities will have the ability to treat nitrates, according to Murphy. 
“We’re planning for the future — we’re not talking about just nitrates, we’re talking about production capacity that can treat not only nitrates but emerging contaminants,” Murphy said. 
Iowans across the state asked to conserve water due to dry wells, high nitrate levels

Additionally, two aquifer storage facilities within the CIWW sphere are under construction and a third is being designed, which Murphy said will also add to treated water capacity.
All told, the expansions will add 34.2 million gallons per day of treatment capacity. 
“If we had that capacity online today, I think it’s safe to say we wouldn’t have to be in the stage 3 position,” Murphy said, referencing the water conservation stage of banning lawn watering. 
Corrigan said the length of the current ban, which has also stopped spraygrounds and splash pads around the city,  will likely be measured in terms of weeks instead of days. 
“We’re gonna need your continued support,” he said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota regulators will take six months to study Otter Tail Power Company’s proposed 12.5% electric rate increase, which the company says would cost a typical residential customer an additional $14.39 per month, or $172.68 per year.
The proposal would generate an additional $5.7 million in annual revenue for Otter Tail, which delivers electricity to about 11,500 northeastern South Dakota customers.
The company applied for the rate increase on June 4. The state Public Utilities Commission voted Tuesday to delay the rate increase from going into effect for six months, giving the commission’s staff time to assess the request, which is a typical procedure for the commission.
The commission also voted Tuesday to charge Otter Tail up to $500,000 for costs associated with reviewing the request.
The company argues rising operational costs and infrastructure investments necessitate the increase. The current rates were set in 2019. 
“This increase is needed for the company to continue providing high-quality, reliable, and safe electric service,” Otter Tail wrote in a letter to the commission.
Otter Tail also increased fees in September, raising the typical resident’s electric bill by $4.14 monthly.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Last-minute changes to legislation that would ban assault-style weapons up for consideration Wednesday by the Senate Committee on Judiciary are dividing gun safety advocates.
Amended versions of companion bills sponsored by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, and Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, were unveiled by the Senate Tuesday afternoon. Senate leaders hope the changes will help the divided committee advance the legislation to the chamber floor.
“I look forward to casting my vote in favor of this legislation with the hope of making Rhode Island a safer place for all,” Senate President Valarie Lawson said in a statement.
The ban is proposed to take effect in July 2026. Much like in the amended proposal by Knight that cleared the House on June 5, violators would face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and would have to forfeit their assault-style weapons.
But how those weapons are defined has narrowed in scope in the revised legislation emerging Wednesday. Excluded from the reworked legislation are shotguns with detachable magazines, pistol grips and folding stocks along with most semi-automatic pistols.
The reworked bills also do away with a voluntary weapon certification program, which itself was amended from a mandate that grandfathered weapons be registered with law enforcement.
Removal of the voluntary program was meant to satisfy concerns that such language was akin to an unconstitutional registry, according to a Senate news release. The changes to the bills were based on feedback the Senate Committee on Judiciary received during the panel’s initial hearing for DiPalma’s bill on May 14.
Will assault weapons ban reach the Senate floor? Judiciary panel to decide on Wednesday.

The original legislation sought to restrict the “manufacture, sale, purchase and possession of assault weapons.” But the version the Senate panel will now consider removed the word possession. It would ban the “manufacture, sale, and purchase of prohibited firearms,” in effect allowing someone to purchase a weapon in another state where such sales are legal.
“While some committee members’ sincerely held beliefs make them unlikely to support any version of this legislation, I believe that the majority of the committee members brought their concerns to the table in a good faith effort to improve the legislation before us,” Chairman Matthew LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat, said in a statement. 
Diana Garrington, a volunteer with the Rhode Island chapter of Moms Demand Action, called the Senate’s proposals “the best path forward” in getting a ban on assault-style weapons across the finish line.
“Any restriction on these weapons of war is a step in the right direction for the state of Rhode Island,” Garrington said in a statement.
The same can’t be said for Melissa Carden, executive director for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence, who said she was dismayed by the Senate’s changes.
“Knowing we have a strong assault weapons ban bill that has already passed the House of Representatives, and knowing that the bill has the votes on the Senate floor, we don’t understand how a weakened version of the bill would be acceptable to advocates, lawmakers or partners,” Carden said in a statement.
The Senate’s changes also don’t appear to have appeased some of the ban’s harshest critics.
Senate Republican leaders, who can vote in an ex-officio role alongside Republican Judiciary Committee member Thomas Paolino of Lincoln, issued a statement that they still intend to oppose the legislation.
“The amended legislation still goes too far, banning certain shotguns and infringing on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens,” Minority Whip Gordon Rogers, a Foster Republican, said in a statement.
Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, a North Smithfield Republican, said she was pleased that Lawson and LaMountain opted to allow the proposed firearms ban to be vetted by the Judiciary Committee rather than another committee whose members were more supportive. She was referring to Lawson ruling on June 12 that Sen. Pamela Lauria, a Barrington Democrat, was out of order when she asked to move the proposed ban to the Senate Committee on Finance.
“While I do not support the legislation in any form, I appreciate that the bills, 2025-S 359 and 2025-H5436A, will be voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee – which heard hours and hours of public testimony,” de la Cruz said. “It unequivocally belongs in Judiciary.”
Glenn Valentine, president of the Rhode Island Second Amendment PAC, said the language still bans most commonly-owned firearms. He said in a text message that Senate leaders are trying to rush the bill that will only secure lawmakers a temporary win.
“A victory lap is their priority, not public safety,” Valentine said.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi declined to comment on the Senate’s revisions. He told reporters following the chamber’s passage of the fiscal 2026 budget Wednesday night that he had an informal briefing with Lawson on the amendments, but did not have the chance to review the updates.
“I respect the Senate,” he said.
The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to meet at 3:15 pm in Room 313 of the State House to vote on a revised version of the legislation.

The commentary authors write that salmon and other fish are harmed by trawling. (Photo provided by the National Park Service)As lifelong Alaskans and proud Republicans, we believe in stewardship — of our oceans, our communities and our resources. That’s why we see benefits to Senate Bill 161 and House Bill 203, bills that would ban bottom trawling in Alaska’s state waters. There are many much more sustainable ways to harvest fish from the ocean that don’t decimate ocean floor habitats and scoop up hundreds of thousands of salmon, halibut, blackcod, crab and even orca as bycatch.  It’s time for Alaskan leaders to take a stand in defense of our coastal heritage and the sustainability of our fisheries. Thankfully, Sens. Mike Cronk and Robert Yundt and Reps. Kevin McCabe and Neal Foster are leading the way at the state level by introducing these bills. Unfortunately, the vast majority of trawl fishing that occurs in Alaska is under federal management.  This is where the Alaska congressional delegation comes in — in particular, Rep. Nick Begich, who promised during his campaign to take action on this issue. 
Bottom trawling is an industrial fishing method that drags massive nets across the ocean floor, indiscriminately destroying vital marine habitats and scooping up everything in their path. The majority of the trawl fleet that fishes in Alaska’s waters are not Alaskan, but hail from Washington and Oregon.  While bottom trawling Alaska’s fish benefits these few Lower 48-based large corporate fleets in the short term, it threatens the long-term health of our oceans and the future of Alaska’s fishing communities.
This isn’t about opposing commercial fishing — far from it. Alaska’s economy and culture are deeply tied to the sea. But bottom trawling is neither necessary nor sustainable fishing. It’s strip-mining the ocean floor. And it’s time we call it what it is: reckless, wasteful and incompatible with responsible resource management.
Conservatives believe in local control and the protection of small businesses. Bottom trawling undermines both. Local fishermen — who fish responsibly using hook-and-line, pots and other low-impact methods — are being squeezed out by industrial-scale trawlers that deplete stocks and leave ecological ruin behind. 
We cannot let short-term profits override long-term responsibility. Our children and grandchildren deserve to inherit prosperous ocean and sustainable fisheries where their small family owned businesses can thrive. Legislation to ban bottom trawling is a step toward that future — and a demonstration that Republicans in Alaska are ready to lead with vision and courage.
The ocean doesn’t belong to multinational corporations — it belongs to the people of Alaska and our visitors who love to fish, travel and recreate here. Let’s protect it.

The Minnesota Democratic senators reflected on Melissa’s leadership, devotion to her community and many contributions to her state.
“Melissa is someone that I wish the whole Senate and the whole nation knew,” Klobuchar said. “We treasured her in Minnesota. She was the epitome of what you want in a public servant. She went into it for all the right reasons.”
Klobuchar said Melissa “knew no limits in terms of trying to get people together, trying to get things done.” She described both Melissa and Mark as “great neighbors, wonderful friends and great parents for their beloved children, Sophie and Colin.”
The senior senator recited a bit of Hortman’s lengthy list of legislative accomplishments: “When a Minnesota student gets a free school lunch, that’s Melissa. When a Minnesota parent is able to take paid leave to spend those early, precious moments with a newborn, that’s Melissa. When a Minnesota voter casts a ballot without facing unfair discrimination, that’s Melissa.”
Smith, who confronted her colleague U.S. Sen. Mike Lee Monday over some tawdry tweets he posted after the killings, said Melissa Hortman was funny, straightforward, kind, smart, driven and determined.

Austin Davis riding SEPTA's Trenton line for a ride-along to Suburban Station in Center City, Philadelphia. (Photo by John Cole/Capital-Star)The state House passed a bill to fund transportation on Tuesday, while Lt. Gov. Austin Davis worked to raise awareness during a visit to the Philadelphia region for an issue that is front and center for budget negotiations.
House Bill 1364 would invest nearly $300 million of new funding into mass transit, and $500 million to repair roads and bridges, House Transportation Committee Chairperson Ed Neilson (D-Philadelphia) said.
It draws on, but doesn’t change the state’s existing 6% sales tax. The share dedicated to funding transit would increase from 4.4% to 6.15% of all sales tax revenue, driving a total of $1.5 billion in additional funding over the next five years to 52 public transit systems across the state. The bill would also allow the governor to form a Transportation Funding Advisory Commission.
The measure passed with a bipartisan 107-96 vote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“This bipartisan bill injects critical dollars into public transit across Pennsylvania and adds new funding to repair roads and bridges — because folks rely on both to get where they need to go. It’s time for the Senate to get this funding done in this year’s budget,” Shapiro said in a statement.
Davis is the son of a Pittsburgh Regional Transit bus driver and on Tuesday, the lieutenant governor spoke about the urgency of passing the transportation bill during a news conference at a SEPTA regional rail station in Croydon, Bucks County.
“I want to be clear, public transit isn’t optional. It’s essential,” Davis said. “One million Pennsylvanians use public transit every single day.”
Davis, Shapiro, and other transit advocates argue for increased funding for mass transit agencies to avoid service cuts and fare increases as they face structural budget deficits.
SEPTA Board Chairperson Ken Lawrence said at Tuesday’s press conference that they are facing a $213 million structural deficit with the end of federal COVID funding and rising costs. If a transit bill isn’t passed by the Pennsylvania General Assembly and signed into law, he said SEPTA would have to cut service by 45%, increase fares by 21.5%, eliminate 50 bus routes and service on five regional rails, including the Trenton line, which services Croydon. He also said all rail service would end by 9 PM, without the funding from the state.
Advocates also stress that increasing funding would benefit rural and urban communities, alike.

Republican Reps. Joe Hogan, Shelby Labs and Kathleen Tomlinson of Bucks County, Tom Mehaffie of Dauphin County; Dane Watro of Schuylkill County; Martina White of Philadelphia; and Craig Williams of Delaware County voted in favor of the bill, Most of those lawmakers’ districts are within SEPTA’s service area, while the rest of the GOP caucus voted in opposition. Every Democrat voted in support of the bill, with the exception of state Reps. Frank Burns of Cambria County and Tarah Probst of Monroe County.
During a press conference rallying support for mass transit in May, White urged fellow lawmakers to not support a state budget unless it included additional SEPTA funding.
Prior to Davis boarding the Trenton line for a ride-along to Suburban Station in Center City, Philadelphia, he emphasized that it’s a priority in upcoming budget negotiations.
“We’re going to continue to keep talking with Senate Republicans, House Democrats, and our budget negotiators over the next 10 days, but I will say this,” Davis said. “This is a top priority for our administration, and as I said earlier, inaction is not acceptable.”
Although identical legislation passed in the House four times last year, it has not advanced in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Sen. Steve Santarsiero (D-Bucks), whose district includes the Croydon train station, challenged his colleagues to bring up the bill for a vote.
“Let’s see where everyone stands on this issue,” Santarserio said Tuesday at the press conference. “I’m happy to put up a vote. Why aren’t my colleagues on the other side of the aisle willing to do that?”
He continued, “The people who live in this area, the people who rely on SEPTA, the people who rely on mass transit in Pittsburgh and other parts of the state, they demand a vote.”

Davis called on Senate lawmakers to look for a compromise and said there’s “no room for inaction.”
“It is time to take off our red jerseys and our blue jerseys and to put on our Pennsylvania jerseys to get this done and to move our commonwealth forward, and I look forward to doing that as we close out this budget process,” Davis said.
While it remains unclear what the Senate will do when they return to session next week, SEPTA’s Ken Lawrence said while there is still a long way to go, passage of the bill in the House is “an important step.”
“I’m encouraged by the progress, and I’m optimistic,” Lawrence said. “Lawmakers recognize the value of transit. SEPTA is doing the work to grow ridership and be safer, more efficient and reliable, and it’s resonating with customers and funding partners.”
“The voices of our riders and our stakeholders are being heard. The tireless efforts of our legislative champions are paying off,” he added.
Mass transit agencies across the commonwealth have sounded an alarm about the looming prospect of higher fares and reduced services, putting the issue at the forefront of state budget discourse for more than a year.
In November, Shapiro transferred $153 million in federal highway capital funds to SEPTA so the agency could hold off on significant immediate fare increases and service cuts. This move was widely criticized by Republicans in the General Assembly, including some who voted in favor of the transportation bill on Tuesday.
Davis told the Capital-Star it’s uncertain whether that would be an option if the budget is late again this year.
“I will say the dynamics with the federal government today are very different than they were in November. When Governor Shapiro flexed those funds, it had to be approved by the federal Department of Transportation,” Davis said. “There’s clearly a different administration now than there was in November. So, I can’t say whether that would be successful or not, given the current setup of the federal government.”
Davis added “We’re open to getting a deal done now, so we don’t have to get to that point.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/austin-davis-SEPTA-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-17 21:00:36.548902
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-18 00:32:13+00:00,CT Mirror,ICE presence in Danbury leaves residents shaken: ‘Painful day’,Laura Tillman and Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/17/danbury-ice-presence/,A co-founder of Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants said 12 to 15 people were detained amid stepped-up immigration enforcement in CT.,"Leora Matison was parking her car on Monday in Danbury when she noticed a man in front of her wearing an armored vest. The man, she said, was approaching the car parked behind her.  
Matison, a member of Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants, began recording the incident with her phone. The video shows Matison repeatedly asking the man, whose shirt read “U.S. Marshal,” if he had a warrant, and to show her his badge number. The man does not respond, except to tell her to step back. 
Matison said she witnessed the agent remove a woman from the car and transfer her into their car. In the back of the woman’s car, she said, were children’s toys.  
She was one of what Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants co-founder Juan Fonseca Tapia said were 12 to 15 people who had been detained by ICE agents in Danbury within the last few days. According to Fonseca Tapia, several members of the organization’s Rapid Response Team, who have been trained to help members of the immigrant community when such activity occurs, took videos of the detainments.
The videos are marked as taking place on 5th Street, Moss Avenue and White Street in Danbury, an area near the Danbury Superior Courthouse.   
Connecticut has seen stepped up immigration enforcement in cities and towns over the past week, from the detention of a woman in New Haven who was taking her kids to school, to four men who were detained while working at a car wash in Southington, to a Meriden high schooler who was detained, along with his father, shortly before he was set to graduate. 
Across the country, protests to such actions have exploded into arrests, prompting a showdown in California between Gov. Gavin Newsom and President Donald Trump over Trump’s deployment of the National Guard. Tuesday also saw the arrest of New York’s Comptroller Brad Lander, a mayoral candidate, as he walked with an immigrant who had attended an immigration court hearing earlier that day. 
Tapia said that the group believed there were between 25 and 35 ICE agents in Danbury on Monday. He said the organization became aware of ICE activity around 5 a.m., when they started to send members of their rapid response teams out to canvas the streets. 
“It has been a very hard day, and painful day for me and for many of us,” Tapia told a crowd of people gathered in a parking lot across from the Danbury Superior Courthouse on Tuesday evening.

At the Tuesday press conference, Karen Hunter, a leader for Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants, told a crowd of people that she’d encountered two young women walking down White Street, handed them cards listing their rights in the case of an encounter with ICE and told them to be careful. 
According to Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants, the two were later apprehended and detained by ICE. 
“These girls could have been my daughter or my granddaughter. We need to do better protecting our community from horrible kidnapping,” Hunter said. 
Fonseca Tapia told CT Mirror that they knew the identity of one person who had been taken by ICE, a man who he said was exiting the courthouse. 
He and others spoke about fear among members of the community and mentioned that a nearby bakery that people often frequented was nearly empty on Monday. 
Yesenia Bernabi, whose family has owned La Mexicana Bakery on White Street for 25 years, said she’d never witnessed a similar situation.
“We have never seen our customers, our clients, people that we know, scared, scared, petrified to even come to our parking lot, come to get bread, come to get food,” she said. 
Bernabi said she had to ask ICE agents to leave the bakery parking lot on Monday. She said that although they left when she asked, they later returned. 
Julian Shafer, a history teacher at Danbury High School, said he’d watched his students struggle when a family member was forced to leave the country.  
“As a teacher of undocumented children, I’ve seen students of mine suffer emotionally, financially and academically because family members of theirs have been deported,” he said. “I personally have had students who had to drop out because they had to work to support their family when a parent was deported. They were heartbroken. They wanted nothing more than to stay in school and learn with their peers.” 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 35% of Danbury’s approximately 88,700 residents were born outside the U.S. Thirty-eight percent of students in Danbury Public School are learning English, a number that has increased over the past few years. 
Danbury has a history of working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In 2009, the City Council voted to enact an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security to become part of the 287 (g) program, which allows local law enforcement to take on some of the duties of immigration enforcement officers. 
And in 2006, a group of 11 men from Ecuador, who became known as the Danbury 11, were picked up by an undercover Danbury police officer and turned over to federal immigration agents. 
Rep. Farley Santos, D-Danbury, said that this week’s detainments brought back memories of that bitter history. 
“That was a terrible situation back then, and it impacted many immigrants. It hurt businesses here and the economy locally, and more importantly than that is how people feel,” Santos said. “Absolutely, that brings up old scars, I would say.”  
Santos himself was living as an undocumented immigrant in the U.S. until age 20. He said he was outraged by recent events but tried to calm his nerves.
“This creates a lot of fear, but our job as public officials is to get information out to folks to know there are resources available to them and tamp down that fear that is being promulgated in the community now.” 
Rep. Pat Callahan, D-New Fairfield, said that he was not concerned about the ICE activity occurring in Danbury, having worked in law enforcement for almost 30 years. 
“The fake narrative is that these are poor people they’re going after. No, it’s the bad actors. It’s the people who are on the radar for having committed crime,” Callahan said. 
He also criticized the Trust Act for degrading public safety by preventing local police from open communication with ICE. 
“To be clear, legal immigration great,” he said. “Illegal immigration and you’re here committing additional crimes, you should be removed.” 
Fonseca Tapia also criticized the Trust Act, which he said didn’t go far enough to protect immigrants. He noted that the bill did not include a provision that would have prevented certain state agencies from sharing information with ICE, such as a person’s address.
Danbury Mayor Roberto Alves told CT Mirror that any collaboration between ICE and the city of Danbury was long past. He said neither he nor the chief of police were made aware of the federal agents’ presence in Danbury on Monday. 
Alves, who grew up as an undocumented immigrant and received his citizenship in 2017, said he agreed that people who have committed serious crimes should be the main targets of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and that they should receive due process.   
“As somebody who’s formerly undocumented, I’ll tell you that nobody that grew up like me or currently is [undocumented] wants serious criminals living among them,” he said. 
Alves noted that local governments aren’t able to stop ICE from being on their roads. All they can do, he said, is try to comfort local residents, offer them resources and demonstrate the city’s position on immigration. 
“Folks who are here, hardworking, who are the backbones of our economy, our neighbors, your kids’ friends at schools, family members — we really should do what we can to protect folks and give people a path to be here legally,” he said.

Hence, why the Rhode Island House of Representatives approved a $14.3 billion fiscal 2026 budget in record time. The 66-9 vote came after three hours Tuesday — the speediest budget debate in the last decade, despite challenges presented by the threat of federal funding cuts and an estimated $185 million state deficit.  
“It looked short today but there were many many hours, many many meetings,” House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said, speaking to reporters after the vote. Shekarchi praised the tax-and-spend plan as a “good budget,” and one that he was comfortable with despite uncertainty over federal funding for Medicaid and food assistance. 
Health care and RIPTA prevail in lawmakers’ revised fiscal 2026 budget

Nine of the 10 House Republicans opposed the budget; the one exception was freshman Rep. Marie Hopkins, of Warwick. Hopkins, a nurse, praised the budget’s focus on health care.
“No budget is perfect, but there was enough good in it that I was able to lend my support,” Hopkins said following the vote Tuesday night. 
The approved budget is almost identical to the version given preliminary vetting by the House Committee on Finance one week earlier, with a focus on funding for health care and the state’s public transit agency. On Tuesday, lawmakers agreed to tack on $1.3 million more for Gov. Dan McKee’s Learn 365 after school education program, $125,000 for Rhode Island Commerce’s streetscape grant program and $100,000 for Sojourner House based on new revenue from the state’s recent opioid settlement with Purdue Pharma.
The $14.3 bottom line for fiscal 2026 falls $433 million shy of the record, $14.8 million final budget for the prior year. But, it’s $118 million higher than what McKee proposed in January, reflecting a higher-than-expected state surplus along with extra revenue from taxes on motorists, high-end vacation home owners and nicotine pouches. 
Tuesday’s decision came after a flurry of unsuccessful amendments, led mostly by the 10-member Republican caucus. They included a reprise of the perennial GOP push to create a state inspector general’s office and a new twist on Cranston Democratic Rep. Charlene Lima’s repeated insistence on relief for state pensioners.

AG vs. House Republicans 
New this year: a proposal by House Republicans to claw back the $11 million in state settlement money from a contamination lawsuit over the Route 6/10 interchange. Attorney General Peter Neronha has already brokered a plan for the settlement proceeds from contractor Barletta Heavy Division Inc., centering on pediatric dental care for low-income neighborhoods in Providence, administered by the Rhode Island Foundation. Republican representatives argued that state law authorizes the legislature, not the AG’s office, to decide how state settlement money gets spent.
“It’s an insult,” North Smithfield Republican Rep. Brian Newberry said Tuesday. “This should be the decision of the people in this room and the people of the Senate. The attorney general needs to be taught a lesson.”
Newberry laid out a host of options: suing the AG’s office, impeaching the attorney general — “not a bad idea,” Newberry quipped — or defunding the office. 
House Republicans instead proposed to take $11 million out of the attorney general office’s $50 million budget allocation, redirecting it to 11 nonprofits and community organizations.
But Democrats shot down the GOP proposal, noting that taking money out of the AG’s office did not settle the dispute over authority of state settlement money,
“The people that lose through this amendment are the people of Rhode Island who rely on the attorney general’s office for consumer protection, for public safety,” Majority Leader Christopher Blazejewksi, of Providence said. 
Neronha’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment late Tuesday, though he defended his ability to allocate state settlement funds in a prior statement.
A prescription for the health care crisis 
The spending plan made health care its focal point, boosting reimbursement rates to hospitals, primary care providers and nursing homes. 
“These people and places touch us all,” House Finance Chairman Marvin Abney, a Newport Democrat, said. “We must protect them.”
Providence Democrat Enrique Sanchez rattled off a list of examples of the ways the state health care system appeared on the brink of collapse: the abrupt closure of Anchor Medical Associates; striking Butler Hospital workers lobbying for better pay and workplace safety; nursing home closures amid widespread staffing shortages.
“If we don’t do this, people are going to die,” Sanchez said. 
Among the biggest sources of concern: a lack of primary care providers, viewed largely as a symptom of uncompetitive public and commercial insurance reimbursement rates relative to neighboring states. The fiscal 2026 budget injects another $45 million into primary care, including a $26 million boost to Medicaid reimbursement rates for primary care rates starting Oct. 1. Hospital systems will also see $38 million more in relief through a twofold measure that raises Medicaid reimbursement rates in accordance with federal pricing — McKee proposed a lower reimbursement rate based on projected state revenue growth — and restoring the state’s upper payment limit program, a longstanding reimbursement to fee-for-service providers meant to close the gap between Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals and what other health insurance programs would pay. 
Lawmakers also offered aid to nursing homes in the form of a $12 million increase for nursing home employees, coupled with easing of the state’s minimum staffing requirements for nursing home facilities, including forgiving outstanding fines for the facilities unable to meet the state’s prior, stringent staffing requirements amid widespread workforce shortages.

Not ‘all too well’ for Taylor Swift 
Taxes and fees proved among the most divisive elements of the spending plan, with all 10 Republicans and a handful of more conservative Democrats voting against individual budget articles related to raising taxes and fees.
Among the sources of debate: an extra property tax on high-end second homes. The “Taylor Swift tax,” known because it would affect the pop star’s Westerly home, applies to all non-owner occupied homes worth over $1 million, with regular updates for inflation. Starting July 1, 2026, Swift and other seasonal residents with high-dollar second properties would pay an extra $2.50 in taxes for every $500 of assessed value over $100. Swift, for example, would pay an extra $136,000 in state property taxes based on the $28.3 million assessed value of her Watch Hill home.

Westerly Democratic Rep. Sam Azzinaro expressed concern with the proposal during a June 12 budget briefing, suggesting it was unfair to affected property owners. But he was quickly shut down by other Democratic lawmakers, who said the extra money Swift would pay was inconsequential given her $1.6 billion estimated net worth. 
Lima on Tuesday criticized the tax as hurting working families whose vacation homes had been passed down for generations. 
“This is not the Taylor Swift tax, this is the mom and pop tax,” Lima said. 
She proposed raising the value of vacation homes subject to additional taxes to $2 million, rather than $1 million. But the amendment failed on a mostly party-line vote, with all 10 House Republicans backing Lima’s proposal. Azzinaro did not.
The state’s fiscal 2026 spending plan offers no estimated revenue for the vacation home tax, which Shekarchi explained was because it was new. Instead, the spending plan funnels the unknown amount of money into the state’s Low Income Housing Tax Credit program, which aims to spur private development of affordable housing.

En route to helping RIPTA
Among the most notable tax changes starting July 1: an extra 2 cents per gallon state tax on gasoline, which coupled with an already scheduled 1-cent hike and a 1 cent environmental protection fee, would raise the per-gallon tax to 41 cents per gallon. The move aims to help shore up the cash-strapped Rhode Island Public Transit Agency, which faces an estimated $32.6 million deficit in fiscal 2026.
Lawmakers stopped short of plugging RIPTA’s shortfall entirely, instead providing $14.6 million through the gas tax increase and an increased allocation of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account. How RIPTA will account for the remaining $18 million gap remains uncertain — advocates fear layoffs and service cuts could be on the line.
A Monday memo to RIPTA from the consulting firm hired to study its operations indicated an $18 million fiscal 2026 shortfall would force the agency to cut 20% of its bus service. RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand said in a subsequent email to House leadership Monday that cutting routes would also require laying off approximately 90 employees.

Taxing nicotine pouches, parking
While the revised fiscal 2026 budget nixes McKee’s proposal to tack on an extra 50-cent-per-pack to the state cigarette tax. But, it extends the state’s 80% wholesale tax on “other tobacco products” to nicotine pouches starting Oct. 1 as a means to close what proponents said was an accidental oversight previously.
Legislative budget analysts have not calculated the cost to consumers of the wholesale tax on nicotine pouches, though a representative for the company that makes ZYN told the Providence Journal the tax could raise retail prices per can from $4 to $7.50. Each can has 15 pouches, according to ZYN’s website.
The fiscal 2026 spending plan relies on a host of additional fee increases, including a $15 boost to traffic violations, from $85 to $100; an extra $10 fee on license and vehicle registration costs, rising to $40; and new, annual fees for electric vehicle and hybrid registrations, ranging from $50 to $200.
The budget also extends the state’s 7% sales tax to short-term parking at public garages, lots and metered spaces, and hikes the local hotel tax from 1% to 2%.
Boosting housing and homelessness services
Housing has topped Shekarchi’s priority list in recent years. This year was no exception, with a 12-bill package unveiled in February. But when it comes to spending, lawmakers largely agreed with McKee’s plan, which relies upon recommendations for the newly reorganized state Department of Housing. However, the spending plan approved by the House Tuesday offers $8 million more than what McKee proposed for homelessness services.
The boost came in part thanks to application of the 5% state hotel tax to whole-home short-term rentals, ending a long-awaited exemption and providing another source of highly sought-after revenue. Amid competition for how to spend the estimated $2.1 million in extra revenue, lawmakers opted to divide the money, reserving half of the anticipated income for homelessness and housing services, and a quarter apiece to local tourism districts and municipalities.
The budget also funds homelessness services and housing programs by increasing the state’s real estate conveyance tax, from $2.30 per $500 of value to $3.75 for all properties, with an extra increase on the sale of homes exceeding $800,000 (with an inflation adjustment) starting Oct. 1.
Education, state worker contracts, etc
On education, the spending plan preserves the state’s education funding formula, which is used to determine state aid to local districts. One notable change from McKee’s original proposal: backfilling a $12 million shortfall in aid for low-income students which resulted from incorrect data by the Rhode Island Department of Education. Lawmakers also opted to devote more funding to aid for special education students rather than offer an extra $12 million in state aid to students in poverty, as McKee proposed.
Other holes plugged in the revised fiscal 2026 spending plan include $15 million for new contracts with state troopers and correctional officers, and $3.2 million for the state’s motion picture tax credit program based on an inadvertent overspend in 2022.
Left on the cutting room floor are the majority of McKee’s workforce and higher education training programs. 
Other proposals axed by lawmakers included:

Various long-term capital projects proposed by McKee, including buying a former Citizens Bank building in Riverside to use as state offices, closing the Department of Corrections’ minimum security facility and opening a new, state-run long-term care hospital in Burrillville. The revised budget instead allocates $22 million in capital projects funds for the Washington Bridge rebuild. 
A 10% tax on billion dollar companies for money made locally off digital advertising, as proposed by McKee
Bally’s Corp.’s request for an extra $17 million in marketing money, aimed to offset potential revenue losses from a ban on indoor smoking in its Rhode Island casinos. The smoking ban legislation remains under consideration in both chambers, after being voted out of a Senate committee Tuesday to a floor vote scheduled for Wednesday. A House committee will consider the legislation on Wednesday.  
Exempting gun safety items such as lock boxes, safes, and trigger locks from the state sales tax, which McKee initially tied to his budget proposal around an assault weapons ban. Separate legislation banning the sale and manufacturing of  assault-style weapons was approved by the House on June 5, while the Senate Committee on Judiciary was slated to take up a revised version of the bill Wednesday.
Abolishing the politically appointed Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council and reshaping the agency as an administrative one, akin to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, pitched by environmental advocates and Attorney General Peter Neronha. However, a House panel is slated to take up an alternative reform proposal Wednesday that reduces the number of council members from 10 to seven, and sets specific criteria for qualification.

But, the fiscal 2026 budget restores the state-required return of half of excess revenue to the state pension fund, a move expected to boost the pension system by $21.6 million. McKee had moved to skip the transfer to the pension fund this year. However, lawmakers concurred with McKee’s move to pass on putting the other half of the state surplus into its reserve fund. The rainy day fund is expected to end fiscal 2026 with a $299.8 million balance, according to legislative budget analysts.
The approved spending plan now heads across the rotunda to the Senate, where review is largely a rubber stamp. The Senate Committee on Finance is scheduled to take up the fiscal 2026 budget at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, with a floor vote tentatively slated for Friday.

Vance Boelter, the man accused of killing DFL House leader Melissa Hortman and her husband and shooting and injuring DFL Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, voted in the March 2024 Minnesota Republican presidential party, belying online disinformation that has sought to paint Boelter as a leftist with ties to Gov. Tim Walz.
The Reformer obtained a screenshot of Boelter’s voter profile in the GOP Data Center — a national database with voter registration information used to target voters — from a source with access to it, which confirms other reporting about Boelter’s support for President Donald Trump.
Boelter, 57, was captured Sunday evening by state and federal agents in Green Isle, about an hour west of the Twin Cities, following a 43-hour manhunt. He’s facing several state and federal charges for the murders of the Hortmans, the shootings of John and Yvette Hoffman and other related crimes.
Disinformation has circulated online since authorities released Boelter’s name, attempting to cast him as a disgruntled leftist and agent of Walz even as Boelter’s roommate and longtime friend told reporters that he was a Trump supporter in 2024.
The Minnesota DFL Party on Sunday released data to the Star Tribune that Boelter voted in the 2024 presidential primary, but not as a Democrat. The Reformer confirmed the data. Boelter’s precinct, Washington Lake Township in Sibley County, had 100 voters in that primary, according to public voter rolls.
Aside from the DFL, the other two Minnesota presidential primaries were the Republican primary and the Legal Marijuana Now primary. No one in Boelter’s precinct voted for any of the Legal Marijuana Now candidates or submitted a Legal Marijuana Now write-in.
In a statement, Minnesota Legal Marijuana Now Party Chair Dennis Schuller confirmed Boelter did not vote in the 2024 Legal Marijuana Now presidential primary.
By process of elimination, that also points to Boelter voting in the GOP presidential primary.
A text to a Minnesota GOP spokesman was not immediately returned.
Right-wing influencers, including Dan Cernovich and Lara Loomer, who are important MAGA propagandists, have been speculating that Walz is connected to Boelter because he was appointed to the Workforce Development Board by Walz’s predecessor, Gov. Mark Dayton, and reappointed by Walz.
Minnesota state government is home to hundreds of nonpartisan and bipartisan boards and commissions, comprising thousands of appointees. Typically, simply volunteering is enough to earn an appointment. There are currently more than 300 vacancies on state boards and commissions.
Charging documents allege Boelter had a list of potential targets, which included Hortman and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Boelter is a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, according to interviews with Boelter’s roommate and videos of his sermons posted online.
In recordings of sermons Boelter delivered in Matadi, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he railed against abortion and LGBTQ people.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/boelter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-17 21:00:36.548902

(Photos courtesy of Howard Zehr)After spending almost all of her adult life in prison for her role in a robbery-murder, 71-year-old Marie “Mechie” Scott has hope for freedom.
Gov. Josh Shapiro signed an order Friday commuting Scott’s life without parole sentence for the 1973 murder of a gas station attendant as she and her boyfriend robbed the business. In six months, Scott will be able to go before the Pennsylvania Parole Board to make her case for release.
Scott had an outpouring of support at the May 9 public hearing where the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons recommended clemency, said Rupalee Rashatwar, staff attorney at the Abolitionist Law Center, which has represented Scott.
“I think that’s one of the most exceptional things about Mechie’s case — the whole movement that’s behind her,” Rashatwar said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In a recording on the Abolitionist Law Center’s Instagram page, Scott described how her cries of joy upon learning of Shapiro’s decision spread among others at SCI Muncy, where she is incarcerated. Scott said she couldn’t find words to describe how she felt.
“There was not even an expression that I could have picked, that would have brought out and made you understand and feel what I felt,” she said in the recording.
Pennsylvania and Louisiana are the only states that impose mandatory life sentences without parole for felony murder. Under Pennsylvania law, that’s when a person commits a crime that leads to another person’s death, even if they didn’t directly cause or intend the killing.
Pennsylvania Supreme Court to weigh life sentences for felony murder

Scott, then 19, and her boyfriend, 16-year-old Leroy Saxton, plundered a Philadelphia gas station’s safe amid a string of robberies while high on sedative pills. Saxton shot the attendant, Michael Kerrigan, but because Scott took part in the robbery, she was also held responsible for Kerrigan’s murder under the felony murder rule.
Kerrigan was a Philadelphia firefighter and father of three who was filling in at the gas station for a friend who was sick. Saxton, who was a minor at the time he killed Kerrigan, was released in 2020 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled mandatory life sentences for juveniles violate the U.S. Constitution.
In Pennsylvania, some 1,100 people are incarcerated for felony murder; more than two-thirds of them are Black, according to the Felony Murder Reporting Project. 
Scott’s case has been a focal point for those working to end what advocates call “death by incarceration.” With a moratorium on executions that began with Gov. Tom Wolf and continues under the Shapiro administration, life without parole is effectively the most severe criminal penalty Pennsylvania courts can apply.
In 2020, Scott led a group of six Pennsylvania prisoners serving life sentences for felony murder in a lawsuit, arguing that mandatory life without parole for those who did not kill or intend to kill violates the state constitution. 
That case was thrown out when the state Supreme Court found it was improperly filed as a civil lawsuit in Commonwealth Court, which lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ criminal cases. 
In October, the state Supreme Court heard arguments in the case of Derek Lee, who is also serving life without parole for felony murder. His lawyer, Bret Grote, also with the Abolitionist Law Center, told the Capital-Star he anticipates a decision this summer.

Lee, now 36, was convicted of felony murder in 2016 for his role in a 2014 Pittsburgh home-invasion robbery, when his accomplice fatally shot the homeowner.
Lee’s appeal challenges mandatory life without parole based on the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, and the state Constitution’s bar on cruel punishment.
Lee’s attorneys are joined by two former state secretaries of corrections who say keeping people who did not intend or cause the death of another in prison for the rest of their lives is financially insensible, prevents finite resources from being used for rehabilitation of those who could benefit, and has little effect on public safety.
Like the backing Scott received before the Board of Pardons, Grote said the support for Lee has been remarkable. Lee’s case drew the friend-of-the-court briefs from state officials, organizations, victims and former lifers who argued the court should end death by incarceration. 
They included Shapiro.
“It is certainly unprecedented for a governor of Pennsylvania to submit an amicus brief supporting striking down the life sentence of a person convicted of felony murder,” Grote said.
In a friend of the court brief on behalf of Shapiro’s office, General Counsel Jennifer Selber urged the court to find mandatory life without parole for felony murder in violation of the state Constitution, but cautioned against making the new rule retroactive. Doing so would place too great a strain on the legal system, the brief says.
Grote said the effect of striking down all 1,100-plus felony murder sentences should not be burdensome. Like Scott, each would be resentenced to a minimum that would make many eligible for parole soon after.
With Scott’s felony murder sentence commuted, she must still serve an aggregate sentence of six months for escaping from prison decades ago. 
While noting Kerrigan’s daughters have opposed her release, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer, Rashatwar remains hopeful that the Parole Board will consider how Scott has changed for herself and helped others during her decades of incarceration.
“She has countless people supporting her,” Rashatwar said, noting the Board of Pardons received letters from people who served sentences alongside Scott saying she taught them what she had learned about herself in prison. State House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) was among those who wrote in Scott’s support.
“It’s pretty amazing the amount of support that she had that led to this outcome,” Rashatwar said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2191-1024x576.png,,,2025-06-17 21:00:36.548902

He is pictured here at a February 2025 news conference.(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Board of Corrections needs its own attorney to represent it in a lawsuit filed by Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office, the attorney general’s office confirmed in a letter Tuesday.
But the board cannot simply keep the attorney it hired in 2023, according to the letter written by Zach A. Mayo, Griffin’s general counsel. The law requires the board to ask the governor to appoint someone or authorize the hiring of a lawyer to represent it, Mayo wrote.
The letter comes as a dispute between the attorney general and the corrections board reheats in the wake of a state Supreme Court ruling that revived Griffin’s lawsuit, which alleges the board violated the state Freedom of Information Act in hiring Abtin Mehdizadegan in December 2023.
Mayo’s letter responded to a letter the board sent Monday certifying that it needs outside counsel to defend it against Griffin’s lawsuit because it poses a conflict of interest for the state’s attorney to sue one of his clients. The board’s letter said it desired to retain Mehdizadegan and would object if another attorney is chosen.
“Now that the Board has certified its need and the Attorney General has determined that he cannot undertake the requested representation, the decision of whether to appoint and who to appoint as outside counsel or to authorize the Board to employ outside counsel is solely the prerogative of the Governor,” Mayo wrote.
The prison board initially hired Mehdizadegan to help it sue the governor and others over the constitutionality of two laws it said usurped its authority over the corrections secretary and other top corrections officials. Board members said they hired the lawyer because the attorney general would have to defend the suit, creating a conflict of interest.
Griffin filed his suit alleging state open meetings and public records law violations the day after the board sued over the laws affecting its authority. Board members saw it as retaliation. Griffin said the board violated the FOIA by holding two executive sessions before hiring Mehdizadegan and by not providing documents he requested.
Mehdizadegan wrote the letter the board sent to Griffin on Monday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Mayo’s response letter strongly re-asserts Griffin’s view that Mehdizadegan’s representation of the Board of Corrections “has been illegal from the start.”
The board’s efforts to hire and pay Mehdizadegan and his firm, Hall Booth Smith, “have violated the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act, the laws governing the retention of outside counsel, and procurement law,” Mayo wrote.
“Without conceding these legal objections,” Mayo says, the attorney general’s office will nevertheless communicate through Mehdizadegan about the board’s letter in light of a Supreme Court expectation that attorneys involved in litigation cooperate professionally.
“Even if there is a dispute over counsel’s official role and employment, we expect attorneys in Arkansas to communicate with each other while that is sorted out through the orderly process of law,” the court wrote in its May decision on Griffin’s FOIA case.
The attorney general’s letter to the board on Tuesday notes that his acceptance of the need for private counsel for the corrections board applies only to the FOIA suit, not the board’s suit against the governor.
The letter also directs the board to consult with the state procurement office regarding other rules it must follow regarding contracting with outside counsel.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Butler Hospital management and representatives of its striking workforce returned to the bargaining table with a federal mediator for nearly six hours on Tuesday, the first negotiating session since June 5. 
This time around, the union brought a larger negotiating committee, with about 150 members representing nearly every department in the hospital — up from 40 the last time. 
The two sides are set to resume talks on Thursday.  
Tuesday’s talks began at 12:15 p.m. and ended at 430 p.m., according to the hospital owner Care New England, which posted an update on its ButlerInfoForYou.org website. 
According to the site, the union shared proposals but did not respond to “all aspects” of the hospital’s June 5th proposal.”
The hospital administration and SEIU 1199 NE — the union representing about 800 workers including mental health staff, nurses, certified nursing assistants, and support personnel — had not convened in 12 days because there was no federal mediator available to referee. The union has expressed skepticism that a third party is needed, indicating its willingness to negotiate without a mediator as it tries to secure better wages and working conditions. 
“We’re always ready to bargain,” Niki Anthony, a registered nurse and a union delegate, said in a phone interview with Rhode Island Current Monday. “We’re just all working people who rearrange our lives anytime the hospital calls us in.”
Edwin Jean Louis, a union delegate who works as an intake coordinator, said in a Monday phone interview that a new federal mediator was arriving for Tuesday’s negotiations. So far, Louis said, the union has worked with two different negotiators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), a federal agency that helps to smooth out labor disputes. The independent U.S. government agency saw workforce reductions earlier this year as part of an executive order by President Donald Trump. Labor union AFL-CIO sued the administration in April over cuts to the agency, which has seen field offices closed and staff reduced.  
The FMCS presided over talks between the two parties on May 29 and 30 and returned on June 4 and 5, with each negotiating session consuming nearly an entire day, according to union comments and timelines given on Butler’s website. Despite the length of sessions, the talks apparently resolved little. 
The hospital’s timeline of the June 5 negotiations says management learned in the afternoon that union delegates had left the hotel where negotiations were being held, and the two parties did not reconvene until nearly 5 p.m. 
Hospital management said the union emailed them a “comprehensive package proposal” after 9 p.m., and they replied to the union with their own package around 11:20 p.m. The proposal, available online, specifies a starting wage of at least $18.03 per hour for all employees, up from $17. Mental health workers would start at $20 an hour, up from $18.27.
Louis said that Butler was inaccurate for suggesting workers walked away.
“We actually went on lunch after we had given them our proposal for them to have time to go over it and either approve or deny or accept,” Louis said. “We returned, and we were there at that hotel until about 12 o’clock [that night], which is something that has been happening. We’ll meet, we’ll give our proposal, and we’ll just sit there until 10, 11 p.m., at night, and we don’t receive a response.”
A statement posted Tuesday from Mary Marran, the hospital’s president and chief operating officer, said management had already offered numerous concessions, including “double-digit wage increases,” no-premium health coverage, retirement benefits, workplace safety considerations, and a proposed four-year contract to replace the old one that expired March 31.
Marran wrote that the hospital’s negotiators returned to the bargaining table “with the same commitment we have maintained throughout these contract negotiations, to reach a fair and sustainable agreement that supports our staff and our patients.”
Community brings food
Since the strike began May 15, workers have kept a picket line outside Butler’s entrance on Blackstone Boulevard in Providence. On June 13 and 14, Butler workers staged a 30-hour sit-in outside Care New England’s headquarters. On Tuesday, the union held an informational picket at Providence Center and plans to hold another on Wednesday outside Kent Hospital, both owned by Care New England.
The sit-in on June 12 and 13 was the largest single-day turnout on the picket line to date, Anthony said. Community supporters brought food, hosted karaoke, and even set up an overnight movie screening during the sit-in, she said. Another event, a June 9 candlelight vigil outside the hospital, brought hundreds of supporters.
“There are days where we have so many donations we don’t know what to do with them,” Anthony said. “It feels really good. It keeps our spirits up.”
That’s important especially as workers cope with the loss of job-related benefits, including health insurance, Louis said.
“The community has been there to help us throughout everything, and we’ve been in solidarity, which I believe is what has kept everyone going,” Louis said. 
Louis said Butler was known for its health care package — one of the amenities pulled on May 31, following an earlier May 14 recission of disability, life and accident insurance. Workers received their last paychecks on May 23. The hospital also said on June 3 it would begin replacing striking workers by filling their positions.

“Health care is very important to me because I have children,” Louis said. “If I’m not having to worry about my kid being sick, I can provide excellent care to my patients. … It puts a mental strain on you when you’re supposed to be the one providing mental health care.”
City leaders have also supported the ongoing strike. On June 4, Providence City Council President Rachel Miller proposed the city exempt striking workers from noise violations, after some were issued $500 noise violation fines. Her resolution said the fines infringed on workers’ right to peaceful protest.
Since the initial set of four noise violations were issued in late May, the city has only issued two more, said Samara Pinto, a spokesperson for Mayor Brett Smiley’s office, in an email Monday. All six violations were issued outside the Butler entrance on Blackstone.
The proposal still awaits a hearing in the Committee on Ordinances, said City Council spokesperson Marc Boyd.
As the Rhode Island House of Representatives forged its final version of the fiscal 2026 state budget Tuesday evening, Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat, rose in support of the workers, noting they had been on strike for over a month.
Morales said on the House floor that he hoped hospital and health care funding in the budget would “go back into the pockets of the frontline health care workers that provide care each and every single day to Rhode Islanders in need, not to the pockets of the executives within the hospitals.”
Real estate sale questioned by union
Ahead of negotiations on Tuesday, the union issued a news release pointing to a real estate transaction published Monday in the Providence Journal: a $15.7 million sale of land from Butler to Laurelmead Realty LLC, a retirement community adjacent to the hospital, on May 30. The union also noted the company reported a $1.2 million operating gain for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 — the second quarter in a row to turn more profits.
Marran, the hospital’s president and chief operating officer, addressed the land sale in a statement Tuesday, saying it was “part of a broader strategy to bolster the organization’s financial foundation and reinvest in our mission.” 
That’s because the recent quarterly gains have only come “after years of operating losses,” Marran wrote. “Achieving long-term financial sustainability demands constant transformation and strategic decision-making that avoids undermining an already fragile healthcare market. Our system still faces significant challenges, including the necessity for ongoing investments in infrastructure, patient care, and workforce support.”
Marran added that employees “experiencing hardship” can contact human resources or the hospital’s employee assistance program for support. She said that the hospital has continued to allow employees access to such “vital support services.”
“We understand that emotions are high, and we are hopeful that a collaborative and respectful dialogue will lead to a resolution that works for all,” Marran wrote. “In the meantime, we thank the many employees who have returned to work and continue to provide outstanding care.”

,DC,2025-06-17 23:59:59+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Appeals panel hints it may allow Trump to control California National Guard deployment,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/appeals-panel-hints-it-may-allow-trump-control-california-national-guard-deployment,,"A three-judge panel of a federal appeals court seemed poised Tuesday to allow President Donald Trump to command California National Guard troops during ongoing protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles.The judges noted U.S. Supreme Court precedent gives the president wide discretion to determine when it is appropriate to federalize a state National Guard.Sam Harbourt, an attorney for California’s state government, argued that the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals should keep in place a lower court’s order that Trump relinquish control of 4,000 state National Guard troops. Trump’s order calling up the troops over Gov. Gavin Newsom’s objections undermined state sovereignty and kept the Guard from its core mission, he said.The legal requirements for a president to take command of a state National Guard had not been met, making the order invalid, Harbourt argued.But the 9th Circuit panel, composed of Trump appointees Judges Mark Bennett and Eric Miller and Judge Jennifer Sung, whom Democratic President Joe Biden appointed, noted the 1827 Supreme Court case Martin v. Mott dealt with similar issues. It decided the president alone could decide whether the circumstances allowing a president to take control of a state National Guard — including whether a foreign invasion was happening — were met.“If we were writing on a blank slate, I would tend to agree with you,” Sung, the Biden appointee, told Harbourt. “But the problem that I see for you is that Mott seemed to be dealing with very similar phrasing about whenever there is an invasion, then the president has discretion, and it seemingly rejected the exact argument that you're making.”Miller said the state might be making good arguments, but they would be better made to the Supreme Court, as the circuit court was bound to follow the high court’s precedent.“We’re supposed to follow the applicable case and leave it to them to overrule it,” he said of the Supreme Court justices.Harbourt responded that earlier Supreme Court cases did not deal with the law at issue in this case, Section 12406 of U.S. Code Title X, that allows the president to call up National Guard troops if there is danger of an invasion, rebellion or if he is unable to enforce the laws with “regular forces.”President’s power ‘unreviewable’The judges also questioned U.S. Justice Department attorney Brett Shumate about the potential limits to Trump’s authority to declare that the conditions for calling up a state National Guard are met.Shumate said the president’s decision-making in that sphere was unreviewable.“Is it your view that if the president or future president simply invokes the statute, gives no reasons for doing it, provides no support for doing it, and there is nothing which would appear to a court to justify it, that the court still has no role at all in determining whether the present president (or) this hypothetical future president, correctly invoked (the law)?” Bennett asked.It was, Shumate responded, “because if the statute is unreviewable, it's unreviewable.”“The statute here confers unreviewable discretion for the president,” he said.Harbourt called that view an “extraordinary argument.”The federal government’s position amounts to saying “the president can federalize National Guard forces as soon as he makes a judgment that civilian federal law enforcement officials cannot do the job as they've been doing it in ideal circumstances or face any obstacles,” Harbourt said. “At minimum, (the law) requires the president to make a showing that he's at least contemplated alternative, more modest measures before calling in the National Guard.”Shumate said the deployment remained necessary because of unrest in Los Angeles. Over days of protests, federal law enforcement officers have been subject to “mob violence” that local authorities have been unable to stop, he said.Democratic states side with NewsomA coalition of 19 Democratic attorneys general and the governor of Kansas filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Sunday supporting California’s argument that Trump’s National Guard deployment deprived states of their right to use Guard troops for their own purposes.More than 430,000 state National Guard troops nationwide help state governments respond to natural disasters and other incidents, assist police in intercepting drugs and provide election support, the Democratic states wrote.“Allowing an unlawful federalization of the National Guard pulls service members away from responding to emergencies and performing vital services for which they are specially trained, and which Amici States cannot replace,” they wrote.They also noted that Trump’s order mobilizing the California Guard was not limited to the Golden State or the Los AngelesThe attorneys general of Washington, Delaware, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawai’i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin filed the brief, along with Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly.LA protestsProtests in the country’s second-largest city began June 6 after Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers raided workplaces. The raids were seen by protesters as an effort to detain migrants in the country illegally who had committed no other crimes.Despite Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass’ objections, Trump called 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 U.S. Marines to the city to quell the protests and protect ICE officers. It was the first time in 60 years a president called a state’s National Guard over a governor’s objections and Newsom sued to stop it.U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ordered last week that Trump return command of the Guard to Newsom. The 9th Circuit panel paused that order before it went into effect, leaving Trump in command and the troops in Los Angeles.A hearing in Breyer’s court is scheduled for Friday.",,,,2025-06-17 20:03:18.053296

Led by pastor and state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, the group had gathered the evening of June 17, 2015, for a Bible study in the basement of Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in downtown Charleston and invited in the man who would later open fire.
“At the end of that hour Rev. Clementa asked all the worshippers to bow their heads and close their eyes as he prayed,” U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., recalled in a speech on the House floor Tuesday. “While their heads were bowed and eyes closed, Dylann Roof opened his — after having been welcomed into their midst — and he slaughtered Rev. Pinckney and his eight worshipers.”
Roof was convicted in December 2016 of federal hate crimes for the shooting that stunned the nation and remains on death row.
“This atrocity, which was carried out in an attempt to start a second race war at the birthplace of the Civil War, changed the landscape, and frankly, the heart, not only of Charleston, South Carolina, and those members of Mother Emanuel church, but our entire state and nation,” U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., told members of the Senate.
Scott teared up on the Senate floor as he spoke about the moving statements of forgiveness the families and survivors made just days later.
Now, some family members and friends of the victims say it’s time to turn remembrance into renewed action.
“Forgiveness was important in that moment,” state Rep. J.A. Moore told the SC Daily Gazette. “This moment demands something more; it’s time for substantive change.”
In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the state Legislature moved quickly to remove the Confederate flag from Statehouse grounds. An $88 million agreement announced by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2021 settled claims by survivors and victims’ families that the FBI was negligent in not stopping Roof from buying the gun he used in the massacre.
“But what have we really gained 10 years later?” said state Rep. Hamilton Grant.

Moore, a North Charleston Democrat whose sister was among those killed, and Grant, a Columbia Democrat whose wife lost her grandfather in the shooting, both said it’s time to take up debate on long-stalled, state-level hate crime legislation.
South Carolina is one of only two states without enhanced penalties for hate-motivated crimes. The other is Wyoming.
Economic and educational equality and better mental health care are other issues to be addressed, they said.
Grant told the SC Daily Gazette he doesn’t want another anniversary to pass without a hate crimes debate at the Statehouse, particularly in the Senate, where legislation has been repeatedly blocked. Opponents have argued against trying to prosecute thought or create different penalties for the same crime, saying it would be more appropriate to stiffen penalties for all.
In the case of murder, those convicted already receive the harshest penalty available, and a hate crime distinction wouldn’t change the ultimate outcome, opponents have said.
“It’s a slap in face to tell me and my family that it does or doesn’t do anything,” Grant said. “At least bring it to the floor.”
But Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, at the end of the legislative session told reporters the bill does not have sufficient support in the GOP-controlled Senate.
“If it did, it would have already come up,” he said.
In Washington D.C., Clyburn used his floor speech to call for the closure of the so-called “Charleston loophole” in federal law that allows gun sales to go through if a background check is delayed more than three days.
It’s what made it possible for Roof to buy a pistol despite his arrest on a felony drug charge and admission to Columbia police at the time that he possessed drugs.
SC congressman again proposes closing ‘loophole’ that allowed Charleston shooter to buy gun

“Let’s give the FBI enough time to do their jobs. We’ll save lives and we’ll be the better off for it,” Clyburn said to cheers.
Others pointed to efforts of the victims’ families as examples of what more can be done.
“We say the names of the Emanuel Nine. We hold ceremonies. We post tributes. But we too often stop there,” former state Sen. Gerald Malloy wrote in a commentary. “We have grown comfortable honoring Black deaths, but uncomfortable confronting the structures that endanger Black lives. This cannot be the legacy of Mother Emanuel.”
Jennifer Pickney, the reverend’s widow, sponsors scholarships, wrote Malloy, an attorney and friend who has represented the Pinckney family.
In addition, Malloy said, the families of Tywanza Sanders and Cynthia Hurd started education and literacy initiatives. And Chris Singleton, who lost his mother Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, travels the country on speaking tours about unity and perseverance.
“Clem thought of community first and believed bringing people together was one of his duties as a pastor,” the Darlington Democrat later told the SC Daily Gazette. “As long as you are helping someone else, life will not be in vain. And that’s how Clem lived his life.”
Moore called the loss of his sister, Myra Thompson, the single most traumatic event of his life. He said Thompson had a “relentless love” always calling or showing up for family. It’s how he plans to model his own push for change.
“She would not let you not love her,” he said. “And that relentless love, that love for our community — it won’t be murdered or assassinated.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/mother-emanuel-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-17 20:03:18.053296

(Photo by Rich Shumate/Arkansas Advocate) The late civil rights warrior John Lewis once called protest “an act of love, not one of anger.”
His description perfectly captures the sentiment of last Saturday’s “No Kings” protest march in Little Rock. People may have turned out because they are angry and in despair over a never-ending stream of lawlessness from the Trump administration, day after discouraging day for nearly five months. Yet, the atmosphere as they marched over the Broadway Bridge was peaceful, determined, and — despite the grimness of the circumstances — even festive. 
The word heard most often from marchers about why they were there was “solidarity,” the chance to join with others to express outrage that can be isolating when experienced alone. This was solidarity born of frustration, unity in reclaiming what it means to be patriotic, with a sense of deep purpose often expressed in cheeky humor.
Signs pronounced that “Orange Lies Matter,” “Arkansas Melts ICE” and “No Sign Is Big Enough To List All of the Reasons I’m Here.” Democratic Socialists handed out free pizza. People line danced to the “Electric Slide” and the “Macarena,” the latter a perhaps unintentional rebuke to those who would target people because of the language they speak or the color of their skin.
This being Arkansas, signs also featuring Bible verses that Donald Trump and his MAGA faithful should find inconvenient: Matthew 25:40 (“Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.”) and Micah 6:8 (“What does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness.”)
Echoing Lewis’ sentiment, Pat Slaughter, a Vietnam veteran protesting for the first time, summed up his purpose this way:  “I love my country, and I want my country to be safe again. And it’s not safe.”

Many of the marchers seemed taken aback by the size of the crowd, estimated by organizers at 13,000. Of course, crowd estimates can be nebulous, but marchers filled up the bridge and the approaches on both sides, and it took about an hour for all of them to cross — an impressive turnout in a city not exactly known as a cradle for street protest.
As protesters carrying umbrellas and signs marched across the bridge, supportive drivers honked their appreciation, including one driver who inadvisedly rolled down his window to shoot video of the marchers on his cellphone. 
But perhaps even more impressive than the turnout in Little Rock, and a similarly large crowd in Fayetteville, were the people attending events in more than a dozen locations across Arkansas:
A noisy group perched along Central Avenue in Hot Springs near the national park; folks gathered in front of the courthouse in Russellville between bouts of rain; and a handful of sign-carrying protesters in West Memphis undaunted by paucity of numbers. Places where showing up to protest Donald Trump could come with physical risk.
Protest has been described as an antidote for despair. The “No Kings” protests — with a decentralized structure that allowed people to use social media to organize events in their own towns, big and small — were a way for people across Arkansas to turn that despair into action and plug in to something greater than themselves, joining with more than 5 million people at nearly 2,200 separate events in all 50 states and 20 other countries.
“Not only do we want to protest, but we want to build community,” explained Paul Hohnbaum, an organizer with The People’s Protests and Marches of Arkansas, which planned the Little Rock event. “We’re not just resisting Trump, we’re resisting all forms of authoritarianism. We don’t want to be ruled by fear, bigotry, and violence.”
The question, of course, is what organized protest can accomplish in the long run to reverse America’s slide into authoritarianism.
Smart politicians who value being responsive to their constituents ought to pay attention when 13,000  people get angry enough to turn out on a Saturday morning, or brave the possible wrath of their small-town neighbors by holding a protest sign in front of the local courthouse.
Alas, elected Republicans in Arkansas have shown themselves impervious to the concerns of people who don’t support them politically. Indeed, it would be surprising if Saturday’s marches weren’t being privately ridiculed in the halls of power.
Even in the face of sustained, nationwide protests, Republicans are still more afraid of their base than they are of their constituents.  Or as one of the protesters put it Saturday, “Eggs Are Expensive Because All of the Chickens Are In Congress.”
The ”No Kings” protests also took place within the context of a debate between establishment Democratic politicians — strategizing about how to respond to Trump and position their party for the 2026 election — and grassroots activists who believe focusing on traditional political considerations is misplaced amid an existential crisis facing American democracy.
In essence, if your house is on fire, discussing what shrubs to plant next spring isn’t a very wise use of your time. Nor is planning 2026 strategy when the country is in the hands of authoritarians who have proven themselves ready and willing to undermine free and fair elections or ignore the results.
The energy at Saturday’s marches reflected this second camp — people so alarmed by what’s been happening that they no longer have patience to wait for normal political processes to work.
In a debriefing call national organizers held after the event, the approach was described as “organized acts of non-cooperation with repression” designed to give people “social permission” to resist. Rather than focusing on electoral considerations, this movement is designed to build opposition to Trump’s actions within the larger civil society — businesses, faith communities, unions, professional groups, civil servants, police, the military, and the media.
The goal: Getting 3.5% of the population to engage in sustained, nonviolent, peaceful protest, which research has shown is enough pressure to force a government to either accommodate the movement’s demands or collapse. Nationally, that would require 12 million people; in Arkansas, about 110,000.
And while Arkansas is seen as a very red state, there were nearly 1.1 million adult Arkansans eligible to vote in 2024 who either didn’t register or didn’t vote. Activating just 10% of them would be enough to reach the goal.
Ultimately, though, protest — stripped of utility or larger strategy — is perhaps its own point. As Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel put it, “There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest.”
Bearing witness, then, can be its own reward. After five months of frustration and powerlessness, Arkansans found catharsis and renewed energy and purpose in marching across a bridge or standing in front of a small-town courthouse. And reclaiming agency can even include dancing the “Macarena.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shumate_macarena.jpg,,,2025-06-17 20:03:18.053296

Yessenia Ruano, who worked at the Academia de Lenguaje y Bellas Artes bilingual school in Milwaukee, is the mother of 10-year-old twin girls. Although the girls were born in the United States, Ruano took her daughters with her back to El Salvador on Tuesday, choosing to self-deport and keep her family intact rather than being forcibly removed by ICE. 
On Friday, federal immigration officials denied Ruano’s request for an emergency stay, which would have halted the government’s attempts to remove her while her visa application was considered, WPR reported. Ruano’s attorney Marc Chirstopher said that ICE gave a one-sentence rationale for denying the stay. 
Christopher said that ICE officials claimed that Ruano “did not warrant a favorable exercise of discretion.” 
“Quite frankly, if she doesn’t warrant it, I don’t know who does.” Christopher said. Ruano did not have a criminal record. She crossed the southern border in 2011 to escape gang violence after local gang members murdered her brother. Christopher added that “she’s very involved in the community,” as  a teacher’s aide for kindergarten teachers, owns  her own house and  pays taxes into a safety net system she is not eligible to access. 
 “I am extremely disappointed in ICE’s decision to deny an emergency stay for my constituent Yessenia Ruano,” U.S. Rep.  Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said in a statement. “It is outright cruel to force a human trafficking victim to return to the place she was fleeing from.” Ruano was applying for  a T-visa, which confers legal status on  victims of human trafficking. “T-visas are meant for people like Yessenia, but sadly, she wasn’t even given the chance to have her case heard,” said Moore. “Yessenia is a wonderful person and her and [her] children’s removal from Milwaukee will be a loss to our community.”
Ruano received a letter telling her  to self-deport on June 3, spurring condemnation from Milwaukee residents, immigrant rights advocates and elected leaders. At the time, Ruano’s attorneys said that it appeared that ICE was abandoning policies of waiting for T and U visas — which protect victims of trafficking and crime victims who are cooperating with law enforcement— to be processed. 
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley wrote on the social media website X that “deporting valued members of our community who are raising and educating our kids, assisting law enforcement in their important work, and giving back to our neighborhoods should alarm us all. It is wrong and unjust.” Crowley added that “these individuals are victims of a broken immigration system. The Trump Administration told the country they were only going after ‘the worst of the worst’. But time and time again, we see them targeting the very people who contribute the most — our neighbors, coworkers, our friends.” The county executive warned that “I am deeply alarmed that our country continues to turn its back on our most vulnerable. By not standing up and protecting our neighbors, we’re not just failing them — we’re failing our entire community. Due process is under attack, and that should concern all of us in Wisconsin and across the country.”
During a May 30 hearing, ICE officials told Ruano to self-deport by June 3. During that hearing her attorneys filed for an emergency stay, beginning a wait-period of several weeks until a decision was finally made, WPR reported. Attorney Christopher said that few emergency stays are being granted under the second Trump administration. 
Earlier this month, the Milwaukee Common Council released a statement opposing Ruano’s impending deportation, and held 14 minutes of silence to honor her 14 years in the United States. “Yessenia has developed roots here,” the council stated. “She is a wife with two Milwaukee-born daughters. She is an educator. She is a volunteer. She is a contributing member of our society. All of us should be outraged by this decision and what it means for Yessenia and her family, and other immigrants who could be facing similar fates.” 
“If there is one thing this case has made crystal clear,” the statement continued,  “it’s that the immigration laws and systems in our country are broken, and the administration at the federal level is more concerned with scapegoating hard working immigrants than fixing the process so it is fair and works for everyone.”
Before Christopher took on  Ruano as a client about two months ago, Ruano had paid over $14,000 in legal fees to file the T-visa application to a different team of Ohio-based attorneys. 
“From what I’ve been seeing consistently through other cases and hearing from other attorneys, they’re not granting hardly any stays for anyone really,” said Christopher. “I am more than positive that she would have been able to remain in the U.S. while the T-visa was pending…under previous administrations.”

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) It’s almost official. Utah is close to signing a settlement to receive $57 million in an agreement with the Sackler family and its former pharmaceutical company Purdue Pharma, the manufacturers of OxyContin, over their role in the country’s opioid epidemic.
In total, all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories are soon to settle for $7.4 billion, according to the Utah Attorney General’s Office, which described the agreement as “monumental” and “a critical step towards accountability.” In Utah the money will be used for efforts to combat the effects of the crisis in communities across the state.
That’s in addition to the $540 million the state is slated to receive from other settlements, with $275 million designated for the state and $265 million for counties.

“Utah families deserve this resolution after Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family recklessly harmed our communities, and contributed to the opioid epidemic,” Utah Attorney General Derek Brown said in a statement. “I will continue to use all the tools I have available, including litigation and prosecution, to protect Utahns in the future from these deadly drugs.”  
Under the Sacklers’ management, Purdue Pharma manufactured opioids like OxyContin, marketing it as a safe despite their knowledge of its highly addictive nature, the AG’s office wrote in a release. The campaign led to a surge in opioid prescriptions in the state.
Utah expected to join at least a dozen states in Purdue Pharma settlement

The Utah Division of Consumer Protection has pursued an administrative action against the company, Richard Sackler and Kathe Sackler since 2019 with allegations that they participated in “deceptive” practices, provided nearly $200,000 in gifts and payments to prescribers in Utah between 2013 and 2017, and employed 186 sales representatives in the state who conducted in-person marketing visits to 5,000 prescribers — all practices that intensified the opioid crisis here, the release says. 
The settlement establishes that the Sackler family will pay $6.5 billion in the next 15 years “coming from Purdue Pharma upon its emergence from bankruptcy protection.” Additionally, the family won’t be able to control the pharmaceutical company, the agreement says. It also restricts Purdue Pharma’s opioid sales in the country.
Between 2002 and 2015, opioid prescriptions surged by over one million, according to the AG’s office. Between 2014 and 2019, prescription opioids caused 1,611 deaths in the state. 
The state has also reached settlements with major corporations including Walmart, Walgreens, Kroger, CVS, Publicis Health, McKinsey, Cardinal, Johnson & Johnson, Allergan, Teva, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Mallinckrodt. 
“Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family caused immense harm and innumerable lives lost through their deceptive marketing and greed,” Margaret Woolley Busse, executive director of the Utah Department of Commerce said in a statement. “Utah never stopped its work to hold Purdue and the Sacklers accountable for what they have done and the devastation they have caused.”

Flash flooding began late Saturday evening in Ohio County, with roughly 3-4 inches of rain falling quickly Saturday. Two people remain missing as of Tuesday morning, according to the governor’s office. 
Ashlie Howard, 38, was cleaning up after cooking dinner for her children Saturday evening when water started rising rapidly in the creek along her property in Triadelphia.
“The creek, I’m going to say, had risen six to eight feet in less than five minutes,” she said. “It was absolutely insane.”
The fast moving water forced Howard’s trailer onto a neighbor’s property, destroying her home along with a shed and vehicle. On Tuesday, she walked through the area where her trailer used to stand. She has recovered very little so far.
“The telephone pole that was next to my house is now underneath my trailer. Everything’s destroyed,” she said. “You can just see bits and pieces of my life, basically, stuck in the mud.”

The flooding hit Marion County on Sunday, where rushing water demolished an apartment complex. No fatalities or injuries were reported. 
“Over the past few days, I’ve watched as West Virginians have come together with an indomitable spirit to support our brothers and sisters in need,” Morrisey said in a statement on Tuesday. The governor has visited Ohio and Marion counties to assess the damage. “Together, we will overcome our challenges and rebuild after these devastating floods.”
Cleanup efforts are underway as volunteers are helping homeowners remove waterlogged walls and flooring and sort through damaged belongings. Several organizations are collecting items, including cleaning supplies, clothing, paper plates and utensils, and more, for those affected by the flooding.
Hundreds of people remain without power in Ohio County, and crews are working to restore service.
Morrisey’s office said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground and working with state officials.
Flood watches continue for much of West Virginia, including the areas already impacted by the weekend storms. Morrisey said there is the possibility of further flash flooding.  

Yes, we’ll have more showers and storms this afternoon and evening. Yes, there’s another Flood Watch out for the area. And yes, we’re over it, too. But seriously, have a plan of action if you live in a flood prone area & remember TURN AROUND DON’T DROWN!!! #WVwx #OHwx #KYwx #VAwx pic.twitter.com/CMRFticY5O

WYDOT's permanent fix for vital link severed by landslide a year ago nearly done. 
The post Rain postpones Teton Pass repair closure by a week appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Department of Transportation has bumped back a weekend closure of Teton Pass, with the road now scheduled to shut down at 6 p.m. on June 27 and reopen at 6 a.m. on June 30, in time for the morning commute.
“We had some rain recently that put us behind schedule, and we wanted to make sure the crews were absolutely ready for the compressed weekend schedule,” WYDOT resident engineer Bob Hammond said in a Tuesday statement. “We didn’t want to schedule the closure during the week and disrupt commuters, so we opted to move the work to the following weekend.”
Closing Wyoming’s busiest two-lane highway, even for a weekend, during the height of the summer tourism season will disrupt travel for thousands of commuters and visitors who rely on Teton Pass. But trying to do the work without a full closure would drag out that disruption, WYDOT says. 
Once the closure commences, crews will work 24 hours a day to complete the job. Crews will be paving the final stretch of new roadway after a painstaking rebuild of the “Big Fill,” which collapsed last year.
During the closure, motorists will have to detour through Swan Valley, Alpine and the Snake River Canyon. The mountain pass accommodates an average of 10,000 vehicles per day. 
“I know that rescheduling the work will impact people’s daily lives, but we want to be sure we are ready when the weekend comes,” Hammond said in Tuesday’s update.
The highway will be closed between the Coal Creek Campground on the west side and the gate at mile marker 7 on the east side. People can still bike and otherwise recreate on the east side of Teton Pass and access the Coal Creek Campground on the west side. But WYDOT is warning walkers and bikers to beware of heavy trucks and not descend from the top of the pass down the west side toward the work site.
The rebuild follows the original, more gentle contour that uses fill material to create a bridge between two hills, hence the name “Big Fill.” Once the pass reopens after the rebuilt curve is freshly paved, only some minor cleanup will remain.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Columbia City Council voted Tuesday to repeal an ordinance banning so-called conversion therapy for minors, rather than risk getting sued and losing millions of dollars in state aid for a rule that’s never been used.
The 4-3 vote was the first of two votes required to officially repeal the 2021 ordinance, which threatens a $500 fine for licensed therapists who attempt to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of an LGBTQ+ minor.
The next vote will likely be sometime in July.
The split decision comes after the council twice deferred any decision on whether to repeal the ban. Over the course of three meetings, dozens of community members asked the council to keep the ordinance in place as a show of support for the LGBTQ+ community.
But keeping it would come at a cost of $3.7 million to the capital city after legislators inserted a clause in the state budget to revoke its share of money from what’s known as the “local government fund.” While the budget directive threatened any city with such a ban, it essentially targeted Columbia, since it remains the only city in the state with such an ordinance.
The directive takes effect with the fiscal year’s July 1 start.
Columbia City Council defers conversion therapy vote again

In April, Attorney General Alan Wilson called on the council to repeal the ordinance or face a lawsuit. His letter argued the ban violated a constitutional guarantee of free speech and a 2022 state law that leaves health care regulation, including over therapists, up to the state.
“We are encouraged that Columbia City Council took a step forward today toward repealing its unconstitutional ordinance,” Wilson said in a statement Tuesday. “This ordinance was never truly about ‘conversion therapy,’ but stifling faith-based speech and targeting counselors guided by their religious convictions. Even this initial step is a meaningful victory for faith-based institutions.”
No fines or warnings have been issued under the ordinance, according to the mayor’s office.
The council didn’t pass the ban four years ago because members believed the practice was happening in the city, said Councilman Will Brennan, who voted for the ban at the time. Instead, the ban was meant to increase the city’s friendliness to the LGBTQ+ community based on the nonprofit Human Rights Campaign’s Municipal Equality Index, he said.
The index grades cities on a number of factors, including local laws, to show the LGBTQ+ community whether the city is a safe place to live, work or visit, according to the Human Rights Campaign.
A ban on conversion therapy can gain a city two of a possible 100 points, Brennan said.
If the goal is to increase the city’s score on the index, there are other ways to accomplish that, including bolstering city programs, he said.
If the goal is to protect LGBTQ+ youth from abuse, then officials should strengthen other rules that would prove more effective, he said.
“I do believe there’s a better path for working together, being more responsive when abuse reports are heard about,” Brennan said.
Looking at the Municipal Equality Index reminded Councilwoman Tina Herbert of all the times as a Black woman she has felt unwelcome, she said. She likened the scores to the Green Book, a guidebook that told Black travelers what places were safe to stop in the 1930s through 1960s.
Because of that, Herbert voted against repealing the ordinance.
“I know that feeling of walking into rooms and not feeling comfortable,” Herbert said.
The loss of funding if the city kept the ordinance in place was a concern for Councilman Peter Brown, who voted to repeal the ordinance.
Though the $3.7 million the city is expected to receive from the state in the coming year is a relatively small portion of its total budget, it would further tighten a spending plan that already has no wiggle room, City Manager Teresa Wilson said previously.
That would likely mean cuts to a grants program meant to bolster tourism in the area, Wilson said.
Columbia postpones vote on conversion therapy ban awaiting state budget decision

Brown worried failing to repeal the ban would mean larger cuts in the future, he said.
“These funds are important to maintain public safety and city services and not put an additional tax burden on our citizens,” Brown said.
Advocates asked whether that money was worth the potential for LGBTQ+ youth to face harmful practices or feel unsafe in the city.
“Columbia’s kids need you to be the leaders who refuse to play politics with their lives,” said Jace Woodrum, head of the state American Civil Liberties Union and a transgender man.
Sen. Tameika Isaac Devine warned the council that bowing to state officials’ demands in this instance could lead to more problems further down the road.
Devine, a former Columbia City Council member who voted to instate the ordinance, questioned whether the attorney general or legislators might try to force officials in Columbia and other cities to repeal other ordinances they don’t like.
“If you cave to the bullying of the state, you will be showing the state can bully us and take away things,” the Columbia Democrat said. “So, what’s next?”
City officials have said they were caught in the crossfires of statewide politics.

Other coalition members, including Kymara Seals (right) stand behind him. (Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas ballot question committee submitted a revised version of its proposed constitutional amendment on Tuesday that aims to strengthen direct democracy rights while undoing some of the legislation targeting the citizen initiative process that passed during the 2025 legislative session.
Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin, who must certify the ballot title, rejected the first version of the proposed ballot title from Protect AR Rights, saying earlier this month that the drafters failed to meet new requirements that the title meet an eighth-grade reading level. 
Griffin will have until July 1 to approve or reject the ballot title, Griffin spokesperson Jeff LeMaster wrote in a text.
Act 602 of 2025 prohibits the attorney general from certifying proposed ballot titles that do not meet an eighth-grade reading level, as determined by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula. It was one of a number of new laws that took aim at Arkansas’ citizen-led initiative and referendum process. Supporters said they were necessary to safeguard direct democracy from fraud and outside actors, but critics said that all the laws did was make citizen-led measures that much harder to get on the ballot. 
Protect AR Rights also sued over the laws.
The proposed amendment, called the Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment, specifically aims to amend Article 5 Section 1 of the Arkansas Constitution, which governs the state’s direct democracy process. The amendment, if ultimately passed by voters, would make it a “fundamental right” for Arkansan voters to propose laws and constitutional amendments at the state level.
It also would change the requirement that signatures be gathered from 50 of Arkansas’ counties, bringing that number down to 15.
Changes in the version submitted Tuesday largely consisted of wording and phrasing adjustments within the ballot title, as drafters attempted to further simplify the language to comply with Act 602 and suggestions made by Griffin’s office. However, the committee’s spokesperson said it wasn’t possible to both comply with Act 602 and with requirements that state a ballot title must clearly and adequately describe what a ballot measure does.
“It’s more simple than we’ve ever written a ballot measure before … We’re trying to comply with the spirit of the law in terms of being as simple and clear and straightforward as possible, using as little legalese as we can, but the reality is certain words mean certain things,” said Bill Kopsky, a spokesperson for Protect AR Rights. “This is a constitutional amendment; you can’t even use the word constitutional and meet the eighth-grade standard. You can’t use the word fundamental, et cetera, et cetera.”
However, certain language remained — such as the phrase “fundamental right” when referring to the litany of direct democracy rights the ballot measure intends to strengthen. 
“It is our opinion that ‘right’ does not give the voter a fair understanding of the scope and significance of the changes to the law made by creating a ‘fundamental right’, and further simplification of that term is likely to mislead the voter,” Jen Standerfer, an attorney representing Protect AR Rights, wrote when submitting the revised amendment to Griffin’s office on Tuesday. “Further explanation would decrease readability and increase our FK score in the calculation.”
Standerfer wrote further that the ballot question committee didn’t change certain language in order to stay true to the meanings established in case law.
Protect AR Rights’ proposed amendment is one of two that have been put forward as a result of the lawmaking during the 2025 session that saw more than a dozen laws targeting the direct democracy process. The other, sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas, was approved by Griffin earlier this month following multiple rejections, also due to the eighth-grade reading level requirement.
In its latest submission, Protect AR Rights also incorporated two small aspects of the League’s proposed amendment. Currently, individuals who wish to challenge the ballot title must sue within 10 days of the attorney general approving it. Protect AR Rights added language to its proposal that would change that to 10 days after the attorney general publishes the notice of the amendment proposal. It also proposes changing the current requirement that ballot petition canvassers file an affidavit, changing it to a declaration under penalty of perjury.
However, the reading level requirement remains an issue. Standerfer said in a phone call that even with the simplifications the group made, they weren’t able to get it down to the eighth-grade level.
After the ballot title was first rejected, Kopsky said that the ballot committee intended to request a meeting with Griffin’s staff to gather feedback. However, Standerfer and Kopsky told the Advocate that their requests were ultimately rejected, with Griffin staffers citing the “active litigation” filed by Protect AR Rights as the reason.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kopsky-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-17 20:03:18.053296

At issue in court Tuesday was the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, or NEVI, that came from the bipartisan infrastructure law former President Joe Biden signed in 2021.
The Federal Highway Administration had previously approved states’ plans for using the money calculated for each state based on a formula.
But in February, the agency rescinded approval of all those state plans, which took years to develop, and started to withhold funding. In a notice to states, federal officials said they had “decided to review the policies underlying the implementation of the NEVI Formula Program.” 
The Trump administration maintains it will still disburse funding eventually.
Sixteen states and the District of Columbia sued in May, alleging the Trump administration violated the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches. A slew of nonprofits, including the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Climate Solutions, later joined the lawsuit.
The plaintiff states cover about $1 billion in withheld federal funding. They were in court Tuesday asking for a preliminary injunction to free up that money. But that ask would only impact the states bringing the lawsuit, while leaving the funding frozen for the rest of the country.
“This passing reference to revised guidance and to changed priorities is simply insufficient to override congressional intent,” said Leah Brown, of Washington’s attorney general’s office. She added that the states aren’t “challenging the ability to revise guidance, but we are arguing that doing so simply is not a sufficient explanation for the actions that they’ve taken.”
The Government Accountability Office has determined the Trump administration was illegally withholding the funding. The White House directed the U.S. Department of Transportation to ignore the watchdog’s “wrong and legally indefensible” ruling.
The transportation department could release a draft of its updated guidance for the charging program this month, according to Politico. 
Because this work is ongoing, the Department of Justice argued the states jumped the gun with their lawsuit. Trump administration attorney Heidy Gonzalez said the federal government will eventually approve EV charging funding under the revamped guidelines.
“The agency has no intent to withhold funds from the states,” Gonzalez said. “It just wants the opportunity to review past guidance and to promulgate guidance that comports with the current administration’s policies and priorities.”
U.S. District Court Judge Tana Lin, a Biden appointee, said she was worried the federal government would indefinitely delay new guidance, and in turn postpone funding new chargers. In her questioning, Lin repeatedly sounded skeptical of the Justice Department’s arguments.
In Washington, the money was set to go toward building chargers along Interstate 5 and other highways. It’s one of the biggest chunks of federal funding the Trump administration has tried to claw back. Trump has specifically focused on blocking earmarks for climate efforts, including the “electric vehicle mandate.” Transportation is the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Washington.
Washington is ahead of the curve in EV adoption, with more than 190,000 new registrations in 2024. That was up from 139,000 the previous year. But a lack of reliable public charging remains a major impediment for consumers with “range anxiety,” hampering the states’ efforts to transition away from gas cars.
The state has just half of the fast chargers officials hoped to have by 2025, state Transportation Secretary Julie Meredith wrote in court filings. And the need is only going to rise as more and more drivers switch to electric.
Meredith’s department was accepting grant applications early this year from businesses and nonprofits hoping to get some of the $71 million, but hadn’t awarded any of the money. Other states had spent some of their money.
“We have EV charging stations that are ready to build and we can’t build them,” said Theodore McCombs, of the California Department of Justice, speaking for all the states. “We have contracts with sub-awardees that we want to sign and we can’t sign them. We have solicitations that we want to run, and we can’t run them.”
Lin said she hoped to issue a written ruling within a week.
If Lin’s eventual decision is appealed, the case would go to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

An out-of-state visitor who traveled through Billings was contagious with measles while at the Billings Logan International Airport on Monday, May 26.
RiverStone Health, as the Yellowstone City-County Health Department, was notified June 16 by Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services that the individual became ill on their return home and tested positive for measles on Sunday, June 1.
RiverStone Health is asking anyone who was in the airport, including the baggage claim/car rental area between 2 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Monday, May 26 and then became ill with any symptoms of measles, to call the measles information line at 406-247-3396.
Measles symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red/watery eyes, spots in the mouth, or a rash that begins on the face and spreads down to the rest of the body.
Measles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with the virus has been. This can happen even up to two hours after that person has left. It is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people around that person will also become infected if not vaccinated. An infected person can spread measles before he or she develops symptoms – from four days before developing the measles rash through four days afterward.
“Vaccination is the best form of prevention against measles,” said Jon Forte, Yellowstone County Health Officer, President and CEO of RiverStone Health.  “Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing infection, which is key to keeping the spread of measles low.”
For full protection, two doses of the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine are recommended, the first at 12 months of age and a second dose from age 4-6.
People who are unvaccinated are at a higher risk of being infected with measles and spreading it to others. They may spread measles to people who cannot get vaccinated because they are too young or have specific health conditions.
People who are vaccinated do have a small risk of getting and spreading the disease, but the symptoms are usually milder.
Because measles is highly contagious, anyone who is not vaccinated and thinks they may have been exposed should stay home and call their healthcare provider for further information about testing and how to avoid exposing others.

(Caity Coyne | West Virginia Watch)Advocates and residents gathered at the West Virginia Public Service Commission on Tuesday to speak out against another proposed electric rate hike from Appalachian Power and Wheeling Power Company.
The companies, both subsidiaries of American Electric Power, filed the rate increase request with the PSC in November. It could impact more than 460,000 electric customers in West Virginia.
If approved, residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt hours would see a nearly 14% increase — about $24 more — in their monthly bills. Commercial customers would be charged $57 more monthly and industrial customers would pay nearly $32,400 more a month, according to the PSC filings.
In addition to raising rates, the request also asks the PSC to decrease net metering credits that allow customers who install solar panels on their homes to sell the excess generated electricity back to the grid and lower their own utility costs. The proposal from AEP would mean a near-67% decrease in payment for that power, according to the nonprofit advocacy group West Virginians for Energy Freedom.
To date, 4,311 letters and online comments have been submitted to the PSC protesting the proposed rates. Not a single letter of support has been recorded, per the agency.
Shawn Phillips, with West Virginia Citizens Action Group, said representatives for AEP have attempted to write those comments and letters off as “bots” instead of accepting that real people are unhappy at their request.
“That’s them denying that the public doesn’t actually want this,” Phillips said. “It’s a denial that our collective organizing is effective and that people are upset.”
On Tuesday, about 40 people gathered outside the PSC building in downtown Charleston to voice their discontent with the proposed rate hikes. After the rally, several went inside the PSC, where they spoke to commissioners in a public hearing against the increase.
Stewart Acuff drove to Charleston from Jefferson County for the rally. He said he was frustrated with how AEP is operating, especially as electric users in the state have almost no other options for their power.
“Let me just tell you — when they are trying to cut the reimbursement for homeowners [with solar panels], they’re stealing from us,” Acuff said. “It’s just like coal colonialism all over again.”

Gary Zuckett, executive director of the West Virginia Citizens Action Group, said he remembers in 2009 when CAG lobbied successfully for net metering. The policy, he said, has been a game changer. With solar panels on his home, he pays the same electric bill every month and will for the next 20 years, he said.
Now Zuckett said he’s angry to see the policy threatened — especially as the company attempts to make electricity more expensive for all consumers.
“We need bills to be low for everybody, not just those who can afford to put solar on their homes,” Zuckett said. 
The new rate increase request comes after the PSC in September threw out a similar request from AEP due to the company submitting an incomplete filing. Back then, the company requested an 18% hike on electric users.
It also hits as the company reports record profits and as West Virginians pay more for power than residents in almost any other state. 
At the end of 2024, according to AEP, the company saw nearly $3 billion in profits for its shareholders.
According to a 2022 review of electric utilities across the country, West Virginians paid the third highest total household electricity costs as a percentage of their income. Alabama and Mississippi, according to the study from the consumer advocacy group Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, were the only states where prices outpaced that of the Mountain State.
West Virginia AEP customers have already undergone 14 rate increases from the company between 2017 and March 2023, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail. In the last five years alone, according to Appalachian Power, residential rates for electricity have risen from $128.09 in March 2019 to $169.93 in June 2024. That’s a 32.6% increase in rates.
“It ain’t right for people to suffer when they get their electric bill. It ain’t right for people to have to decide what necessity to cut when they get their bill,” Acuff said. “This is unacceptable in all ways.”

Mike Lee of Utah took down X posts Tuesday making an apparent connection between Gov. Tim Walz and the man accused of shooting two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, and blaming “Marxists” for the murders. The change comes after blowback from Sen. Tina Smith and her staffers as well as Minnesota Democratic and Republican lawmakers.
One X post said “Nightmare on Waltz Street,” with pictures of Boelter, who is accused of killing Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and shooting Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in the early morning hours of June 14. Boelter also went to the homes of two other state lawmakers that night; one house was empty, and at the other, a police officer pulled up to the house shortly after Boelter arrived, so Boelter left.
Another Lee post read, “This is what happens When Marxists don’t get their way,” with a picture of Boelter.
Misinformation about Boelter’s apparent connection to Walz has been circulating online since the killing. Walz reappointed Boelter to the Workforce Development Board — one of hundreds of nonpartisan boards and commissions — after he was originally appointed by Gov. Mark Dayton, but Walz had no personal connection to Boelter. There have also been claims online that Boelter is a leftist, though his roommate told reporters that he is a Trump supporter.
The changes to Lee’s X feed come after a confrontation between Lee and Smith Monday at the U.S. Capitol.
“I wanted him to hear directly from me about how painful that was and how wrong that was,” Smith told the Star Tribune. Smith, who was a friend of Hortman’s, said Lee did not apologize during their conversation.
Ed Shelleby, Smith’s deputy chief of staff, sent an email to Lee’s staff condemning the senator’s posts.
“You exploited the murder of a lifetime public servant and her husband to post some sick burns about Democrats. Did you see this as an excellent opportunity to get likes and retweets? Have you absolutely no conscience? No decency?” a copy of the email obtained by Semafor said.
Several Minnesota Republicans also condemned Lee’s posts.
“I have tremendous respect for Senator Mike Lee, but it doesn’t mean he is immune from the base impulses social media incentivizes. People say stupid stuff on the internet all the time. The best they can do is admit they shouldn’t have and be better,” Rep. Nolan West, R-Blaine, wrote on X. He later responded to his post, writing, “Respect rescinded.”
“This has nothing to do with Governor Walz,” Rep. Walter Hudson, R-Albertville, posted on X.
In separate press conferences Monday, both state and federal officials addressed the misinformation that has been circulating online about the assassination.
“As our community grieves, I encourage those out there seeking to create additional chaos to stop spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said.

*Cue “Closing Time” by Semisonic*
After weeks of contentious negotiations over this year’s landmark education bill, H.454, which the House and Senate both passed on Monday, Vermont’s 2025 legislative session has come to an end. Lt. Gov. John Rodgers brought down the gavel in the Senate, for the final time, just before 7:45 p.m., while House Speaker Jill Krowinski did the same about an hour later.
“It’s actually early though, right? I mean, we’ve had some pretty late-night years before,” Gov. Phil Scott joked to senators in his closing remarks Monday to the chamber. (That’s easy to say, I thought, for a guy who spent the morning hanging out with his buddies down in Boston.)
With lawmakers clearing out their desks and heading home for the summer, Final Reading is signing off, too, until the start of the 2026 legislative session next January. 
But before we go, some thanks are in order. Putting together an originally-reported newsletter, every day of the session — on top of the more traditional news stories our readers expect — is no easy task. While you’re used to seeing my byline, and that of my fearless Statehouse colleague, Ethan Weinstein, there are a host of others who make this work possible. 
A number of VTDigger reporters took the lead on issues of Final Reading this year, including Carly Berlin, Emma Cotton (who’s now, in fact, an editor), Peter D’Auria and Habib Sabet. Interns Klara Bauters and Olivia Gieger also pitched in. Meanwhile, ace photographer Glenn Russell captured many of the moments — like this one — that defined this year’s session.
Kristen Fountain, senior editor on the politics desk, wrangled all the bits and bobs of each day’s newsletter, often writing copy and tracking key bills herself. Neal Goswami, VTDigger’s managing editor, brought his years of experience covering the Statehouse to the editing process.
Yardain Amron, VTDigger’s night editor, is the one who turned the plain text of a Google Doc into the email that landed in your inbox every night. Taylor Haynes, the newsroom’s audience and product director, made sure that email looks as good as it does. Natalie Williams, senior editor for the digital team, helped us deliver the most engaging, accessible product possible.
And of course, we’re grateful to all of you — our more than 7,000 subscribers — who turned to this newsletter, and do so year after year, to stay on top of the news under the Golden Dome.
If you care enough about how Vermont works to read this newsletter, then you know that clear, fact-based reporting on government can be hard to come by these days. Vermont has lost 75% of its journalism jobs over the past quarter-century. Across the country, dedicated Statehouse reporting has long been in decline, too, but recent research shows that nonprofit newsrooms — like VTDigger — are helping to buck that trend. It’s something we can only do, though, with our readers’ support. 
So, if you don’t already, please consider making a contribution to our newsroom to support Final Reading — and all of the VTDigger journalism you rely on to make sense of our state. Thank you!

So, about that voice vote
Some House lawmakers, particularly those opposed to the year’s landmark education reform package, were pretty pissed that the chamber took arguably the year’s most important vote by voice. 
I’m talking about the vote on H.454, which, when no one asked for a roll call, House Speaker Jill Krowinski conducted by weighing the volume of the spoken (or bellowed out) “Yeas” versus “Nays.”
Rep. Kate Logan, P/D-Burlington, leader of the Progressive caucus, said she didn’t think the speaker intentionally rushed the vote, but she still took umbrage with the process. 
“I do think they took advantage of the fact that we all kind of froze after a complicated procedural vote,” Logan said. 
Logan argued that while H.454 had the votes to pass, a majority of Democrats would have voted against it — a possibility that can’t be known given the lack of roll call.
In order for the vote to be reconsidered, a lawmaker who voted “yes” would’ve needed to make a motion that was then voted on and approved. But no one made that motion. 
“I did not clearly hear or understand the question, did not have an opportunity to ask questions or debate, and did not vote because I was unsure of what she had said and what we were voting on,” Rep. Ela Chapin, D-East Montpelier, wrote in a text. She did not support H.454.
“I have not experienced anything like it in my three years as a state representative,” Chapin wrote.
Burlington independent Rep. Troy Headrick made his frustration with the voice vote known on the House floor and again in an email yesterday to Democratic leadership.
“As you know, this was arguably the most consequential bill of the session, both in scope and in its political sensitivity,” Headrick wrote. “While I understand this may fall within the boundaries of procedural correctness, I believe it represents a misuse of authority.”
Conor Kennedy, Krowinski’s chief of staff, said in an interview that representatives’ frustration was “misguided.”
“For the people who are upset, I’m kind of like, literally anyone there could have done it,” he said, referring to making the request for a roll call. 
Kennedy noted the speaker allowed people to share their opinions on the bill during a later motion, and any representative can make their position known to their constituents. He said the speaker’s staff reviewed a recording of the floor and found Krowinski allowed a normal amount of time to pass before calling the vote by voice. 
“For me there has to be a little bit more self reflection rather than placing this blame on the speaker,” he said. “You can be frustrated about a piece of legislation, but I would caution us about how that frustration is directed.”

In the know
Just days after a gunman shot and killed one state legislator and injured another in Minnesota, security was tighter than normal at the Vermont Statehouse on Monday. Access to the building, typically available unchecked through a number of different entrances, was allowed only through a door by the loading dock, where Capitol Police were screening bags with a little-used X-ray machine and wanding down entrants with a metal detector.
State Rep. Melissa Hortman — the Minnesota House’s top Democrat and its former speaker — and her husband, Mark, were fatally shot at their home Saturday. Meanwhile, Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were shot and wounded at their home, too. The gunman has since been apprehended.
The shootings, which Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has said were politically motivated, weighed heavily on Vermont legislators in recent days. Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, who said in a statement over the weekend that she and Hortman were friends, called the shootings “unthinkable” in remarks on the floor Monday morning.
“There are really no words to describe how tragic this event was,” she said, appearing to tear up.

Plans for the state to build a secure youth treatment facility are “on hold” after officials withdrew a proposal in Vergennes, according to the Vermont Department of Buildings and General Services.
The news came a day after state leaders informed advocates for justice-involved youth and other stakeholders that Vermont would consider a variety of options in its effort to build a new facility, five years after the closure of the scandal-plagued Woodside Juvenile Rehabilitation Center.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa House of Representatives Tuesday secured the necessary two-thirds majority on a petition calling for a special session to override the governor’s veto of a bill pertaining to eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines. 
Seventy representatives signed the petition in favor of returning to the state Capitol to override the veto on House File 639, but two-thirds of the Senate will also have to sign on for a special session to be called. 
House Speaker Pat Grassley called for the petition immediately following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ veto of HF 639, which would have restricted the use of eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines and added a slew of additional requirements for pipelines and the regulator.

“This veto was a major setback for Iowa landowners and the tireless efforts of the House to safeguard property rights,” Grassley said in a press release Tuesday. “With 70 members of the House standing united, we’ve met the constitutional threshold to move forward. We now call on our colleagues in the Senate to join us by securing the necessary signatures so we can convene a special session, override this veto, and deliver the protections Iowa landowners deserve against eminent domain for private gain.”
Members of the House have pushed forward similar bills over the past several years. The 2025 session was the first time the Senate took up the issue, but only after a group of 12 Republican senators said they would not vote on budget bills until HF 639 was debated.
The bill is tied to opposition of the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline which was granted a permit, and the right of eminent domain, by the Iowa Utilities Commission in June 2024. Landowners opposed to the pipeline feel the privately owned project should not have the power of condemnation and fear the impact of the pipeline on their land. 
The pipeline would connect to biorefineries in the state and transport captured carbon dioxide through the state and up to underground storage in North Dakota. This would give ethanol facilities and corn farmers access to the ultra-low carbon fuel market, which industry leaders say is needed to fuel the agricultural economy in the state. 
The debate on the issue, and HF 639 in particular, has created rifts within the  Republican Party of Iowa, with those in favor of the bill alleging their colleagues, including Reynolds, abandoned GOP values.
Those against the bill said it reached beyond its intended targets and would have caused unintended consequences to agricultural and energy infrastructure in Iowa. 
A press release from Iowa House Republicans about the petition said Reynolds’ veto denied “critical protections” against eminent domain, was an “undermining” of years of legislative efforts and represented a “significant setback” for those who have fought for “fair treatment” in carbon capture projects. 
House Republicans also urged the Senate to “act swiftly” to meet the petition requirements to call a special session. 
Senate Republican leadership did not respond to requests for comment on the latest news, but Sen. Jack Whitver, R-Grimes, said last week the majority of his caucus would “not be interested” in pursuing a special session override. 
Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, who was one of the 12 holdouts on the Senate floor for debate on the bill, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Of the 30 representatives who did not sign the petition, 10 were Republicans and 20 were Democrats.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A Rhode Island Senate panel needed only 30 minutes Tuesday to unanimously endorse a bill that would end the exemption to the state’s indoor smoking ban enjoyed for years by the state’s two casinos. If the measure becomes law, it would not start until 2027.
The Senate Committee on Labor & Gaming voted 7-0 to advance an amended bill by Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski, a South Kingstown Democrat, for consideration by the full chamber. A floor vote has been set for Wednesday. Committee member Sen. Ryan Pearson, a Cumberland Democrat, was absent from the vote.
“To say it’s been a long time coming would be an understatement,” Sosnowski told the committee. “We want our workers to be strong, healthy, vibrant, [and] making money for our state.”
Sosnowki’s bill would prohibit smoking inside Bally’s Corp.’s Lincoln and Tiverton casinos effective Jan. 1, 2027 — though there is a carveout for smoking bars located within the buildings, specifically the Plume & Proof Cigar Bar enclosed inside Bally’s Lincoln facility.
Sosnowski’s original proposal called for an immediate ban. She said she still favors an immediate ban but called the compromise to delay its start by a year and a half “a step in the right direction.”
“It is going to take time for Bally’s to implement this,” she said. 
The revised timeline is not included in the companion bill sponsored by Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, set for consideration by the House Committee on Finance Wednesday afternoon.
But the wording on Tanzi’s bill is subject to change, confirmed House spokesperson Larry Berman. Tanzi said she appreciates the Senate finally advancing the smoking ban proposal but remains concerned about the language related to smoke bars.
Following months of private talks, potential compromise emerges in casino smoking ban debate

“It doesn’t put on the parameters that are necessary to prevent it from expanding,” she said. “They could put one in Tiverton with the same name.”
Tanzi suggested additional amendments to specify square footage of smoking lounges. Sosnowski said she does not intend to make any additional changes to her bill.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, who is among the 10 cosponsors of Tanzi’s proposal, said he supports the changes made by the Senate.
“This was an agreement reached by several interested parties and it now provides a date certain when smoking will be eliminated,” he said.
Sosnowski credited Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, for brokering the final version approved Tuesday. 
Ciccone, who has been a staunch opponent against banning smoking, initially sought to negotiate an agreement between Bally’s and union leaders to expand existing non-smoking areas at the Lincoln facility. 
Union officials opposed any deals that kept smoke inside, he previously told Rhode Island Current. 
Instead, Ciccone focused on what terms Bally’s could accept, which led to his introduction of a bill to raise the cap on marketing reimbursements the company receives from the Rhode Island Lottery. The Senate approved the measure 32-4 on June 3, despite objections from state regulators. Ciccone’s bill has yet to be referred to the House for consideration.
Bally’s representatives still voiced opposition to Sosnowski’s legislation Tuesday afternoon.

Elizabeth Suever, the company’s vice president of government relations, told the committee that banning smoking could have a negative effect on state revenue. She projects a potential loss of $30 million to $60 million in tax dollars for the state, citing revenue hits the company faced in Delaware and Shreveport, Louisiana.
Suever also argued that allowing smoking attracts customers coming in from out of state. If those customers stop coming, she said the company would likely have to reduce the number of workers in the facilities.
“Like all casinos, Bally’s staffs to volume,” she said.
But Karen Gorman, a bartender at Bally’s Tiverton casino, said the company already struggles to have enough workers — likely because they have to deal with constant second-hand smoke.
“People aren’t coming to be an employee at the casinos,” Gorman said.
Bally’s has 35 job postings for its Lincoln casino and 26 at its Tiverton location as of Tuesday, according to its website.
Gorman and the handful of other Bally’s workers who attended Tuesday’s hearing gave their overall support for the bill, though they would prefer the smoking ban take effect sooner.
“You’ve got to rip the Band-Aid off,” she said in interview.
Matt Dunham, president of Table Game Dealers Laborers Local 711, told Rhode Island Current he would have liked to see smoking gone within six months, but still sees Sosnowski’s legislation as a win.
“I’ve been doing this for four years and we’ve never made it anywhere,” Dunham said. “I’ll take this over starting fresh next legislative session.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Buoyed by a $30 million line of credit, Epic Charter School now has funds to survive the summer and a budget for the next academic year.
The virtual charter school’s governing board on Tuesday approved the line of credit from Regent Bank. The agreement requires the school to pay interest until October and make all repayments by June 2026, school spokesperson Rob Crissinger said.
A year of budgeting disarray left the public charter school with only $755,756, less than 1% of its $300.5 million general fund, to carry over to the 2026 fiscal year, which begins July 1. Crissinger said Epic needs extra funds to cover payroll and expenses for July when public schools receive no state funding payments.
Chief Financial Officer Michael Flory said Epic should be back on better fiscal footing this time next year, so “I hope to not have to come back here and ask for any more money.”
“I know it’s been a painful year, but I think the team I’m working with, we’re all committed,” he told Epic’s school board on Tuesday. “We’ll never be back here again.”

The school board also voted in favor of a 2026 fiscal year budget that projects $233.9 million in expenses, $75.9 million less than the 2025 fiscal year budget. The new budget anticipates $254.6 million in revenue, which is almost $46 million less than the previous year.
Flory said his staff built the budget from scratch by examining individual purchase orders and verifying whether each is a justified expense, a process known as zero-based budgeting.
Epic also made significant cuts to its spending this month by laying off 357 employees, eliminating and outsourcing certain course offerings, and closing its Blended Learning Centers in the Tulsa and Oklahoma City metro areas.
The school already laid off 144 employees in October after administrators overestimated expected enrollment by 4,000 students. Like all public schools, Epic receives funding from the state based on enrollment.
Superintendent Bart Banfield resigned last week after the layoffs, and Deputy Superintendent of Finance Jeanise Wynn left April 11. Flory stepped into the chief financial officer role from his previous position as Epic’s executive director of data analytics and accountability.
In 2020, the virtual charter school rapidly skyrocketed to 60,000 students, the largest school district in Oklahoma at the time. Now its enrollment is only half as much, forcing Epic’s leadership to right-size the budget.

Last week, Epic’s school board appointed a new treasurer, Daniel Haynes, and an assistant treasurer along with a new encumbrance clerk. The school also will select an external accountant and will disclose Epic’s up-to-date financial position with real-time budget dashboards, Flory said.
The school will be more conservative in the future, especially with its hiring practices, Flory said. It will focus on keeping funds concentrated on students, teachers and curriculum, he said.
“Anytime we’re going to hire, we’re going to have metrics-based hiring, especially on administrative positions,” Flory said. “We’re going to look across the organization and see (if) we have people who can take on additional duties. I’ve been with Epic — it’s my lucky 13th year — and we’ve gotten away from that.”

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe brain-dead pregnant woman who became a flashpoint in the national debate over reproductive rights and Georgia’s six-week abortion ban has delivered her baby, her family has announced.
Doctors told the family of 30-year-old mother and nurse Adriana Smith she had no chance of recovery after a series of blood clots in her brain left her brain dead in mid February, when she was about two months pregnant. Smith has been kept on life support since then to support the pregnancy.
The baby, Chance, was delivered Friday by emergency cesarean section and taken to the neonatal intensive care unit. Smith’s mother, April Newkirk, told 11Alive News the child was born prematurely weighing one pound 13 ounces.

Newkirk said she is calling for prayers for her grandson’s safety and health.
“Right now, we don’t know everything, because it’s so early. So they can’t tell everything,” she said. “Prayer changes things. And we just hope and pray that he’s OK.”
Newkirk told 11Alive that her daughter would be taken off life support Tuesday afternoon.
Smith became a flashpoint in the debate over reproductive rights and Georgia’s six-week abortion ban after family told news outlets that doctors told them that while she had no chance of recovery, Smith’s organs would be kept functioning so as not to violate Georgia law.
Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr has said the law does not require such action.
“There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” he said in an earlier statement. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy.’”
Newkirk said she is frustrated that Smith sought care for the blood clots that would go on to take her life. She said her daughter was released from the hospital without proper testing.
“All women should have a choice about their bodies. And I think I want people to know that [Adriana] was a nurse, an RN. The same field that she worked in is the same people who failed her. Can you understand what I’m saying? They didn’t go that extra mile, Not even that extra mile. They didn’t even do a CT scan on her. That would have detected it.”

Newkirk was on hand Sunday along with other family members and supporters gathered for a somber celebration of Smith’s 31st birthday at Park Avenue Baptist Church in Atlanta.
Several dozen people sang happy birthday and released white balloons into the sky. Smith’s mother helped serve slices of pink strawberry cake in the sanctuary as children laughed and shrieked in play behind the pews.
Smith’s family did not speak to the press and did not mention Chance’s birth at the time, but organizers invited members of the media to a rally in the church sanctuary following the private event.
Well-wishers and activists warded away the Georgia heat with “Black Lives Matter” fans as health care and abortion rights advocates spoke in front of an altar stacked with sunflowers and yellow and white roses between pillars of blue and pink birthday balloons.
Among them was Allison Coffman, executive director of the Amplify Georgia Collaborative, a reproductive rights group.
“Adriana Smith did not mean to die. She knew something was wrong, and she went to the hospital, and she was denied care,” Coffman said. “Unfortunately, this is not a unique story. Pregnant people across Georgia are receiving denied, delayed, and distorted care.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Legislature (mostly the House) and the governor have been rowing since the start of the year over immigration, tax relief, and spending. After a 105-day session, the Legislature finally passed a $115.1 state billion budget and $1.3 billion tax relief plan.
Now the ball is in Gov. Ron DeSantis’ court. Technically, after receiving the budget he will have 15 days to sign it, veto it, or line-item veto sections. In reality, his time frame may be much shorter because the new state fiscal year begins July 1. Usually, he’d have received the document weeks earlier.
The last section of the budget notes that the bill takes effect July 1 (except as otherwise noted) or upon becoming law, whichever is later. It continues: “However if this act becomes law after July 1 2025, then it shall operate retroactively to July 1.”
While it sounds strange, it turns out it isn’t. That failsafe language has been included in budgets for the past decade if not longer, according to a Florida Phoenix review of state spending plans.

Making government more efficient was a priority for the Legislature this session, and by the time the hankies dropped (ceremonially ending the session) the Legislature had agreed to a budget that eliminated 1,745 positions or 1.5% of the authorized workforce.
The Health and Human Services section of the budget lost the most positions with a 3.54% reduction in the aggregate across the six agencies included in the silo: Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD), Department of Children and Families (DCF), Department of Elder Affairs (DOEA), Department of Health (DOH), and the Florida Department of Veterans Affairs (FDVA).
Of those agencies, AHCA will lose the most positions, about 67 or 4.12% of its positions.The DOH is losing 572.7 positions, or 4.46% of its approved workforce, and DCF loses more than 450 positions or 3.5% of its approved positions.
Another agency that will see a significant reduction in the number of positions is the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, which is slated for a 3.44% reduction in jobs.
Conversely, the Department of Business and Professional Regulation will see its staff increase by 5.16% and the judicial branch will see its staff increase by 1.62% with an additional 75 positions.

The $115.1 billion budget comprises state tax dollars, referred to as General Revenue; federal funds; and state trust funds. General Revenue accounts for about 44% of the state operating budget. While the agencies in the HHS silo account for 41.2% of the overall spending, they account for 35% of GR spending. Most of the state’s GR goes to education, not HHS.

CHICAGO — Just over one year ago, the Illinois legislature approved spending more than $700 million to attract and support a new industry: quantum technology.

Now, representatives of other countries, federal research labs and a network of private organizations with ties to the state are beginning to ink deals and make agreements to bring specific quantum companies to Illinois — and boost the startups that are already here.

Illinois state officials are interested in attracting the nascent industry because of its potential for economic growth and positioning Illinois as a high-tech leader in the coming decades.

Quantum technology is an emerging field of research and business that creates specialized machinery and computers that use the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems and behave in ways that would be out of reach for traditional machines.

Last week, two events in Chicagoland offered a glimpse inside the world of quantum businesses and the layers of public and private funding going into the industry.

The Japan External Trade Organization — an economic development organization affiliated with the government of Japan — sponsored a two-day “delegation” of business representatives to Chicago.

At an early meeting of the delegation, representatives of the state and economic development agencies pitched the region — and Illinois’ state backing — as unique in the world.

“This is not a state government that is following trends but really setting the trends,” Intersect Illinois Chief Quantum Officer Preeti Chalsani told the delegation. “When I go to conferences, I hear about other states and countries who are thinking of doing something like Illinois. That really makes me proud.”

Intersect Illinois is a private nonprofit organization with ties to the state. It’s led by Christy George, a former Pritzker administration official who helped plan the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last summer. The organization also plays a prominent role in the state Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity's five-year plan for attracting business to Illinois.

“This is a state that is constantly on a mission to constantly build and expand our business environment,” George said at the event.


What is quantum tech?
Researchers and entrepreneurs are developing computers and other systems using the principles of quantum mechanics to achieve things that would be impossible with traditional computers. Current quantum computers can perform benchmark tests more than 1 billion times faster than traditional computers. Quantum technology can also be used to decode encrypted messages, posing serious questions for the cybersecurity industry. Other applications include simulations, sensor technology and communications.

World Business Chicago, an economic development organization backed by the city of Chicago, estimates the industry could generate tens of billions of dollars in Chicagoland and create more than 100,000 jobs.



Representatives of the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, World Business Chicago and the University of Chicago also participated in the event.

The visit mirrored Gov. JB Pritzker’s and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson’s visits to Japan where both men, along with sizable entourages of economic development leaders and businesspeople, met with Japanese officials.

Both visits, and especially Pritzker’s in October 2024, built hype in the Asian nation about Illinois’ role in the developing quantum technology sector. Pritzker is a self-professed “quantum geek” and his personal interest in the emerging industry contributes to the state’s interest in it.

Over the two days the Japanese delegation was in Chicago, they toured several local quantum businesses, including qBraid, InfleQtion, and EeroQ among other locations around the city. The DCEO and Intersect Illinois also hosted a reception for the Japanese delegation.

The efforts from state and industry boosters appear to be interesting to at least a few in the cutting-edge industry.

At a pitch and networking event capping off the Japanese visit last week, several Chicago-based and Japan-based companies discussed their business models and strategies.

One of the Japanese delegation members who pitched at the event, Quantumdata founder Yuki Nagasako, told Capitol News Illinois the quantum industry in Chicago is “very hot,” especially compared to artificial intelligence tech hubs in California.

“When I say I work in quantum technology in the Bay area? Nobody knows. Nothing,” Nagasako said. “But in Chicago, here? Everybody.”

Nagasako, whose company has offices in California and is currently in a fundraising round, said he’s seriously considering expanding in Chicago.

That event also featured a closed-door meetings between Japanese companies and officials at PsiQuantum as well as other local companies.

State quantum park

PsiQuantum is one of the jewels of the state’s quantum crown. It is the “anchor tenant” of the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, or IQMP, a research park set to break ground later this year on Chicago’s South Side.

The California-based quantum computing company was raising $750 million at a $6 billion valuation earlier this year, according to reporting from Reuters. Its last official valuation was $3.1 billion in 2021.

That park is being built with $500 million in state funding, on top of $200 million in tax breaks and other incentives going to PsiQuantum directly.

Harley Johnson, the University of Illinois professor who took over as the head of the IQMP late last year, said the “singular focus” of the research facility is to help scale up quantum computing technology.

“In some cases, it takes really specialized, industrial-scale infrastructure,” Johnson said last week.

Johnson was speaking at an event at Argonne National Lab where federal researchers and state-level quantum advocates discussed the state’s future as the “Quantum Prairie” — a riff on California’s Silicon Valley.

There, he also laid the groundwork for what is expected to be a busy few months at the state’s quantum research park.

“There are a lot of exciting announcements,” Johnson said. “We’re going to break ground very soon.”

In addition to PsiQuantum, several other major groups have said they’ll set up shop at the research park. Six months ago, IBM announced it would build a quantum computer and research center at the park. About a year ago, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, announced it would base a quantum testing program at the park.

Two weeks ago, the IQMP also announced that Australian tech and quantum company Diraq intends to open a facility at the park.

“Diraq building and scaling their quantum operation at the IQMP is a testament to Illinois attracting the tech and security sectors,” Pritzker said in a statement at the time. “Diraq’s commitment further cements Illinois’ position as a global quantum leader and reflects the state’s commitment to fostering innovation and economic growth.”

Diraq is one of nearly 20 companies that is participating in the first stage of DARPA’s quantum testing program.

“We’ve got others that will be coming on board soon,” Johnson said in his speech last week.

Gavin Newsom seeks concessions from public employee unions to manage the state's deficit.,"In summary
Some of the perks in a new contract for California prison guards are delayed as Gov. Gavin Newsom seeks concessions from public employee unions to manage the state’s deficit.


The union representing 25,000 California prison guards struck a deal for a new contract that gives Gov. Gavin Newsom some financial relief in the short term but includes a mix of bonuses and raises that would kick in over the next three years.
Newsom in May signaled that he’d be asking state worker unions to delay raises when he announced a budget proposal to close a $12 billion deficit. He was seeking $767 million in savings from public employee unions. 
The California Correctional Peace Officers Association, commonly known as CCPOA, was the first union to reach an agreement after Newsom’s budget announcement. Other unions are bargaining now over return-to-work policies in addition to negotiating over pay and benefits.
All together, the deal for correctional officers is expected to cost the state $600 million over the next three years, according to a summary released by the California Department of Human Resources. It includes two raises of 3% each with one taking effect next month and the second one in July 2027. 
That first raise would be offset by a personal leave program of unpaid time off that is expected to reduce guards’ pay by 3% in the coming year. That’s worth about $132 million.
The net savings to the state would amount to about $3.9 million. 
The contract saves more money by deferring the state’s contribution toward the health care coverage correctional officers will use in retirement. That’s expected to trim state spending by about $100 million over the next two budget years.
The raises will be reflected in guards’ overtime and in the state’s contributions toward their pensions.  
Newsom last imposed furloughs on state workers during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, when the economy tanked and the governor braced for a recession. The economy and state tax revenue recovered quickly and the prison union’s last contract was flush with bonuses, a new kind of savings account and raises. 
The union has made Newsom’s pet initiatives a focus of its political spending. The union under former President Glen Stailey gave $1.75 million to Newsom’s anti-recall campaign in 2021 – the largest single contribution to that effort – and another $1 million to support Proposition 1, Newsom’s treatment and housing plan for people experiencing serious mental illness. 
The new prison guard contract has perks that are meant to fill the ranks at specific prisons, including a $10,000 retention incentive for correctional officers at Salinas Valley State Prison, California State Prison-Sacramento and Richard Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego. 
New cadets who agree to work at nine other prisons would receive a $5,000 incentive. 
The prison guard union did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Its members must approve the deal for it to take effect. 
Though the contract also would still need the approval of the Legislature, the Democratic-dominated deliberative body is unlikely to reverse Newsom’s negotiations.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/050823-Blythe-Prison-Town-PU-CM-23.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-17 18:06:10.040735

Hosted by Michigan State University’s Institute for Public Policy and Social Research, alongside with the college’s Canadian Studies Center, the forum welcomed Jason Miller a professor and the interim chairperson of the university’s Department of Supply Chain Management, Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens and the Consul General of Canada in Detroit Colin Bird, to share their perspectives on how tariffs have impacted U.S.-Canada trade and industry.
Examining the economics
Thus far 2025 has marked the largest tariff shock that both nations have experienced in recent economic memory, with tariffs on Canada increasing by 19 times in April and March from where they sat in January of this year, Miller said. Comparatively, U.S. importers are paying 3.5 times more in tariffs than they were in 2018 and 2019, he said.
With tariffs on steel and aluminum increasing to 50% earlier this month, those costs have increased substantially, Miller noted.
Looking at imports, more than 60% of goods brought into Michigan from Canada are either finished vehicles or auto parts, pointing to how intertwined the nations’ economies are on the import side, Miller said.
As far as exports, roughly 53% of Michigan’s exports to Canada consist of finished vehicles and parts, totaling nearly $13 billion in exports according to a policy brief assembled by Miller citing trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

“Effectively, half of an auto plant of output goes to Canada each year, from the state of Michigan on a normal basis,” Miller told attendees.
Pointing to a set of charts examining the export of passenger vehicles to Canada, Miller pointed to a notable drop, with companies frontloading their exports in March, leading to a sharp decline in April.
“That drop in April is the lowest reading we have had since the auto plants were shut down in the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Miller said.
While vehicle imports also show examples of frontloading, the drop was less pronounced come April when Trump levied a 25% tariff on vehicles from nations including Canada and Mexico.
Though proponents of Trump’s tariffs on Canada frequently point to the U.S.’s multibillion dollar trade deficit with its northern neighbor, Miller said that if you exclude the import of crude oil, the U.S. actually holds a trade surplus over Canada.
A history of partnership and an uncertain future
Following Miller’s breakdown of trade between the two nations, Dilkens discussed the history of trade agreements between the two nations, beginning with the Canada-U.S. Auto Pact of 1965, which removed tariffs between the two nations.
While previous tariffs on parts and vehicles traded between the U.S. and Canada had become cumbersome, the pact allowed the U.S. and Canada to build something special, Dilkens said, noting Windsor’s status as the auto capital of Canada and Detroit’s reputation as the Motor City. 
While Trump has argued Canada stole the auto industry from the U.S., Dilkens likened trying to dissolve that relationship to trying to unscramble an egg. 
The auto pact between the U.S. and Canada later spawned the U.S.’s free trade agreement with Canada, which later evolved into the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico in the 1990s, which Dilkens said worked well until Trump’s first term, where he negotiated the U.S. Mexico Canada Trade Agreement, also known as the USMCA.

Pointing to positive remarks about the deal during his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Dilkens expressed hope that the nations could get back to that agreement. 
Bird further emphasized the country’s interconnection, noting that in building the arsenal of Democracy in the Great Lakes Region during World War II, both nations built up a support infrastructure of aluminum and steel on each side of the border. With the U.S. importing 60% of its aluminum from Canada, levies imposed on aluminum imports are set to hit manufacturers hard, with Bird warning about the impact this policy will have on Michigan. 
“You are at the bull’s eye of the potential negative impact from tariffs, because this region has integrated itself with Canada, which, if you put a giant tariff wall down the middle of the Great Lakes – cutting yourself off from a country that buys more from you than Mexico and China and Japan and Germany combined – you are disrupting an ecosystem that has been at the core of Michigan prosperity for over a century,” Bird said. 
Miller emphasized that it takes months for companies to begin shifting production, pointing to plans from General Motors to shift production away from Mexico back to the U.S. beginning in 2027. 
While it’s taking automakers 12 to 18 months to shift production back to existing plants in the U.S., getting new ones up and running will take at least four years, Miller said.

Although there are U.S. companies who are benefiting from tariffs, the uncertainty sparked by Trump’s tariffs have caused companies to freeze as they wait to see the impact. 
“Right now, the concern is just a general slowdown of economic activity because companies aren’t investing. Once we start to see clarity on what’s going to happen moving forward, we’ll, I think, get a better sense of longer term company decisions,” Miller said. 
As far as an immediate impact in the next several months, Miller predicted a decrease in the variety of goods available as companies focus more on producing their best sellers. Companies will decide to either expand their operations, or draw down, Miller said, noting a recent survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta which found 45% of executives polled planned to scale back their investments, while 4% planned to expand. 
“As of today, the U.S. economy is certainly not in a recession. So that’s one thing to be very clear about, no economic data indicates we are in a recession. But we’re waiting to see, do we see a slowing of activity over the next, let’s say, six months as companies have hit the pause button on hiring and capital expansion,” Miller said.
Whether it’s discussion with companies in Canada or companies in Michigan, Bird said he was hearing the same thing: “We’re on pause.”
Dilkens warned that there were two fallacies present in the discussion of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S, the first being that manufacturers have a surplus of funds waiting to be deployed, and that the best way to do that is to close foreign plants and build everything in the U.S. 
The second fallacy, he said, is that even if those funds were available, the U.S. is currently sitting at around 4.2% unemployment.
“Most economists would tell you that’s basically full employment in an economy. And so where are you going to get the people to do the work that you’re trying to repatriate, even if it happens in the next two, three or four years?” Dilkens said.
The road to a deal
With Trump and Carney setting a 30-day deadline for a new trade deal, both Bird and Dilkens were optimistic that the two nations would be able to reach an agreement. 
During a panel at the 2025 Mackinac Policy Conference, U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra expressed a similar optimism that the nations could come to an agreement that benefits both sides. 
While Bird and Dilkens remained opposed to tariffs on Canadian goods, Hoekstra told WOOD-TV reporter and panel moderator Rick Albin that Trump had been clear that there would be tariffs for every country looking to do business with the U.S.. However, there’s no reason why trade between the U.S. and Canada couldn’t be the least restrictive in the world in regards to tariffs, Hoekstra said. 
From a Canadian perspective, the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement had accomplished what it was intended to do, Bird said: reshore North American supply chains and increase wages in the manufacturing and auto sectors. 
“We have a really solid basis if we respect and preserve the rules that are in place, and then let’s look at opportunities for us to be more effective and more aligned in addressing unfair trade from offshore,” Bird told the Michigan Advance.

(Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)As the U.S. Senate continues to debate the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill, several West Virginia organizations came together Tuesday to ask their representatives not to support cuts to health care and food assistance programs.
“Right now, as we stand here on the West Side of Charleston, West Virginia, in Washington, D.C., they are making cruel calculations,” said Lida Shepherd, a representative of the American Friends Service Committee, which helped host the event. “How big of a handout of our tax dollars can be given to the wealthiest families and corporations … [while] taking SNAP and Medicaid away from all of us? Will we let them get away with playing political chess with our lives? No.”
The event — held at a Cabin Creek Health Systems clinic — was also sponsored by Catholic Charities of West Virginia, the American Cancer Society, Facing Hunger Food Bank, Protect Our Care, West Virginians for Affordable Health Care and the West Virginia Food and Farm Coalition, among other groups. 
The U.S. House of Representatives last month narrowly passed a version of the bill that would cut Medicaid by more than $700 billion — the largest in the program’s history. The bill would impose work reporting requirements and cause roughly 15 million people to lose their health care coverage over the next few years, analysts say.
The Senate version of the bill would cut Medicaid even more and expand the proposed work requirements for the program. 
The House’s legislation would also cut $300 million from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through 2034 and push some of the costs of SNAP benefits to states for the first time. 
In the Senate version of the bill, states would pay between 5 and 15% of the food benefits program beginning in 2028, depending on their payment error rate. The cost shift could put West Virginia on the hook for up to $84 million a year. 
“This bill is a cruel assault on veterans, on people with disabilities, on our health care sector, on people who struggle with food insecurity, and on working families who deserve health care and food as much as anyone else in this country,” Shepherd said.
About one in three West Virginia residents relies on Medicaid for their health care coverage. More than 277,000 — or one in six — West Virginia residents get food assistance from the SNAP program. 
Representatives for Justice and Capito did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Justice recently told Politico the SNAP cuts in the bill could cause Republicans to lose their supermajority. 
In an interview with CNBC last week, Capito said those who need SNAP or Medicaid benefits should get them, but said there are people on the programs who don’t qualify.
“But what’s happened here is there are people on those benefits, both benefits programs that don’t deserve to be on there or don’t qualify and have stayed on for years and years for one reason or another,” Capito said. “We need to flush that out. Get rid of the waste, the fraud, the abuse of the system so that it is there for the basic folks who need it.”

Amber Crist is CEO of Cabin Creek Health Systems, a federally qualified health center. Last year, the network of clinics treated 20,000 patients, including 7,000 Medicaid recipients.
Speaking at the news conference, Crist said nearly two thirds of West Virginians on Medicaid are already working, and another 29% are caregivers, students or have disabilities that keep them from working. 
“These facts don’t demonstrate fraud, waste and abuse…These are signs of people doing their best, often under incredibly difficult circumstances,” Crist said. 
Mariah Plante is a Wyoming County resident who cares for her brother who has autism, is legally blind and is nonverbal. Medicaid provides her brother’s medical care, eyeglasses, behavioral support, prescriptions and access to specialists that the family could never afford on their own, she said. 
“Most importantly, Medicaid allows for us to care for Matt at home, where he’s loved, not in a facility,” Plante said. “Without it, families like ours will be forced to make heartbreaking choices. Nobody wants to put their loved one into a place like that where the staff is too often overworked, underpaid and undertrained in how to manage the needs and nuances of caring for people who cannot care for themselves.”
Sherri McKinney is vice president of the Service Employees International Union District 1199, which represents more than 24,000 health care workers in West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. She said that proposed Medicaid cuts would decimate health care jobs. The state is on the verge of a “health care crisis” if Congress goes through with the Medicaid cuts, she said. 
“Let me be absolutely clear, cuts to Medicaid cuts our lifelines,” McKinney said. “In a state like ours in West Virginia, nearly one in three West Virginians relies on Medicaid. The consequences of federal cuts will not be measured in spreadsheets. They’ll be measured in lost jobs, closed clinics, struggling families, unnecessary suffering, and people will die.”
According to analysis from researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act in the legislation would cause the closure of rural hospitals around the country, including seven in West Virginia. 
The proposed 30% cut to SNAP in the bill would cause about 84,000 people in West Virginia to lose their food benefits, Shepherd said. 
Libby Booker, a food pantry operator and president of Women in the NAACP, spoke against cuts to SNAP. 
“There’s so much need in our community, throughout our state, just for healthy foods,” Booker said. “When we have healthy food, we have healthy bodies.”
Booker said that, years ago when she was a single mother, she struggled to put healthy food on the table for her son. 
“And now I see our government losing their hearts and turning on the citizens who sent them to represent us in office,” Booker said.

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) A North Dakota man was charged Monday with threatening at least one federal official in an email that references the Saturday shooting that killed one Minnesota lawmaker.
About 5 p.m. Sunday, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of North Dakota received a threatening email from St. Thomas resident Charles Dalzell, according to a complaint filed Tuesday in federal court by Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Christopher Potts.
In the email — addressed to a U.S. Attorney’s Office employee whom court records identify as “J.P.” — Dalzell claims he was being ignored by federal and state officials, law enforcement and a judge.

“I don’t want this situation to end up like Minnesota over the weekend,” Dalzell wrote, the complaint says.
Vance Boelter faces federal murder charges for the shooting death of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, on Saturday. He also is accused of shooting state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, who survived. 
The complaint against Dalzell does not identify by name any of the individuals Dalzell allegedly threatened and criticized.
Dalzell, born in 1979, has been charged with making interstate threats to injure another person and threatening to assault, kidnap or murder a United States Official.
Dalzell claimed he had been denied money he was awarded in court, and that law enforcement were “attempting to silence him” to conceal corruption by public officials, according to the complaint. Records don’t indicate what court case, if any, Dalzell may have been referring to.
“When law makers make laws and the state doesn’t follow the laws they created it would probably piss some people off right,” Dalzell said in the email, the complaint states.
The filing also alleges Dalzell sent another email to the U.S. Attorney’s Office on Monday disparaging North Dakota elected officials, including the governor.

The complaint states that Dalzell initially contacted the U.S. Attorney’s Office in February 2024 raising concerns about an attorney he hired to assist him with a property issue. Dalzell indicated in the 2024 email he was considering violence against the individual, according to court filings.
FBI agents told him that his emails were “borderline threatening” and that it is against the law to threaten people over the internet, the complaint says. Dalzell told them he did not threaten anyone, that he does not have access to firearms and “if he wanted to go shoot a place up he would not advertise it,” the filing states.
Dalzell used the pseudonym Chuck Miller in his initial communications with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, according to court filings.
The federal court docket for the criminal case does not list an attorney for Dalzell.
Court filings state Dalzell was arrested Monday in St. Thomas in northeastern North Dakota.
He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Fargo on Wednesday afternoon.

(Screenshot from video from James Uthmeier's X account)For the first time in recent history, a federal judge on Tuesday found Florida’s attorney general in contempt of court for referring to the court’s order blocking a new state immigration law as illegitimate and unlawful.
While U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams’ ruling is extraordinary, she spared James Uthmeier from paying hefty fines or spending time in jail. Instead, Williams ordered the state’s chief legal officer to submit biweekly reports to ensure police don’t arrest anyone under an immigration law she blocked in April.
Quoting Humpty Dumpty in her order, Williams chastised Uthmeier.
“Litigants cannot change the plain meaning of words as it suits them, especially when conveying a court’s clear and unambiguous order,” she wrote. “Fidelity to the rule of law can have no other meaning.”

The order followed a May 29 hearing in Miami, where Williams repeatedly locked horns with Jesse Panuccio, the prominent lawyer defending Uthmeier, during arguments about whether to hold him in contempt.
At issue in the contempt decision was a letter Uthmeier sent to law enforcement agencies, sheriffs, and police chiefs on April 23, stating that he couldn’t stop them from making arrests under SB 4C, a law making it a first-degree misdemeanor for a person to enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.”
“If being held in contempt is what it costs to defend the rule of law and stand firmly behind President Trump’s agenda on illegal immigration, so be it,” Uthmeier wrote on X.
Arrests after Williams’ order
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed SB 4C on Feb. 13, but Williams blocked its enforcement temporarily after the Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status brought suit against the state.
Still, law enforcement carried out arrests after Williams barred them from doing so. A Florida Highway Patrol trooper’s arrest of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen from Georgia, garnered international attention after it was first reported by the Florida Phoenix.
An investigation by the Tampa Bay Times found that police, mostly other troopers, arrested 25 people on April 4, but didn’t find evidence of arrests after April 18. The second date is important because that is when Williams issued a second order clarifying that her suspension of the law applied to cops, which the state argued against, claiming that Uthmeier lacked authority to stop the arrests.
Williams also noted in her Tuesday order various interviews and social media posts from Uthemeier flouting the temporary block on the law.
Leading up to the hearing, Uthmeier said during an interview that aired on Newsmax on May 6 that he wouldn’t rubber stamp her order.
“To be clear, the Court is unconcerned with Uthmeier’s criticism and disapproval of the Court and the Court’s Order,” she wrote. “But respect for the integrity of court orders is of paramount importance.”
After six months, Uthmeier can ask Williams to stop the reporting requirement, but Williams warned there would be additional sanctions if he disobeys her.
The law will remain blocked for the remainder of the litigation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit sided with the plaintiffs on June 6 and upheld the temporary bar, with the order stating that federal law likely preempted SB 4C.

Free.,GOP senators warn mega-bill’s new Medicaid cuts will hurt rural hospitals,"Jennifer Shutt, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gop-senators-warn-mega-bills-new-medicaid-cuts-will-hurt-rural-hospitals,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republican leaders expressed confidence Tuesday they’ll be able to tamp down opposition to various elements of the party’s “big, beautiful bill” in time to approve the measure before the Fourth of July, though they acknowledged there’s considerable work left to do. GOP senators from across the political spectrum have debated the broad strokes of the tax and spending cut legislation for weeks, but raised fresh concerns after the influential Finance Committee released its portion of the package, which addresses taxes and Medicaid. Some GOP senators objected to a change in Medicaid policy they said could harm rural hospitals.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said during a press conference that reducing the Medicaid provider tax rate that states can charge from the current 6% to 3.5% by 2031 represented “important reforms.”“We think they rebalance the program in a way that provides the right incentives to cover the people who are supposed to be covered by Medicaid,” Thune said. “But we continue to hear from our members specifically on components or pieces of the bill that they would like to see modified or changed or have concerns about. And we’re working through that.”While the complex provision is deep in the weeds of Medicaid policy, several GOP senators expressed concern during interviews Tuesday that changing the provider tax rate in states that expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act would be a problem for rural hospitals.Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said he opposes that provision and wants to see GOP leaders put back in the House language that would freeze the Medicaid provider tax rate at 6%.“We have to do something,” Hawley said. “If we pass this as it is, there's going to be a lot of rural hospitals in Missouri that close. So that's a big problem.”West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice said he had “all kinds of concerns” about provisions in the Finance Committee’s portion of the “big, beautiful bill,” which the panel released Monday.""The House side on the provider tax and everything said, freeze it,” Justice said. “Now there's a whole lot (of) different gyrations going on with that and everything. And there's other things that we just need to — just give us some time. We need to work our way through it.”Justice said he didn’t plan to be a “rubber stamp” on anything and appeared to discourage GOP leaders from bringing the package to the floor next week ahead of their self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.“I would love to get it done, like the president wants to get it done, by the Fourth of July. I would love for us to be able to do that and everything,” Justice said. “But I think, way more importantly than anything, we got to get it right.”Other Medicaid issuesAlaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski declined to weigh in on the changes to the Medicaid provider tax rate since her state doesn’t use it the way many others do.“I don't have a dog in that fight, because we don't have provider taxes in Alaska,” Murkowski said. “We're the only state that's actually maybe playing by the rules.”But Murkowski told reporters she does have issues with other ways the legislation would change Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower income people, and expects the bill will undergo revisions before a final floor vote.“I don’t think it’s going to stay in this form, let's just put it that way,” Murkowski said.Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said he’d vote against the package if leaders bring it to the floor next week as planned and said he expects that if they rush floor consideration, the entire bill will fail to pass.“I hope not because my guess is it'll fail and I don't want to see it fail. I want this thing to succeed,” Johnson said. “Again, the ball has been in the Senate court for two weeks — two weeks. But now we're seeing language. Now we're finally seriously considering some of these ideas, let's have time to seriously consider it and hopefully get them incorporated in the bill.”The House voted mostly along party lines to approve its version of the package in late May, but Senate Republicans have been reworking the bill in the weeks since.Among the changes in the Senate, Republicans plan to raise the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than House GOP lawmakers proposed in their version.Possible recess delayArkansas Sen. John Boozman said that if the Senate doesn’t vote to approve the package the week of June 23, they’ll likely stay in town the following week to debate the bill, instead of heading home for the Fourth of July week break.But he cautioned that “the longer it hangs out, the more difficult it is” to pass.Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley declined to answer questions about whether he supports or wants to change his chamber’s newly unveiled Medicaid provisions.“Ask me that question in a couple days because there's still discussion going on about it,” he said.Sen. James Lankford praised aspects of the bill, including, “long-term tax policy that's actually permanent,” which he said is “important for individuals and for small businesses.”“We're doing the full expensing, making that permanent — that doesn’t change a dollar as far as the income coming into the Treasury, but very significant for our economy,” the Oklahoma Republican said.Lankford said he also likes “the R&D tax credit piece to make sure we're competing with China on it,” “modernization of the air traffic control system,” as well as “some dollars that are going to border security, which has been very important to me, which they have been asking for for a long time and trying to get into structural things to the border that are needed there.”",,,,2025-06-17 18:06:10.040735

The ATC said it conducted the operation in coordination with Louisiana State Police, the Louisiana State Fire Marshal’s Office, state Probation and Parole and the federal Department of Homeland Security. The investigation sought to confiscate illegal vape products sold at retail and wholesale businesses and arrest the people responsible. 
The 10 arrests include three men Homeland Security Investigations took into custody for “immigration reasons,” according to a list of those apprehended ATC provided Tuesday in response to the Illuminator’s request. 
See the list of persons arrested below
Charges filed against the other seven men include possession of schedule I narcotics, unlawful possession of hallucinogenic plants and felony possession of nitrous oxide. 
Illegal and unauthorized products seized include: 34,000 vape pens, pods and juices; 16,000 CBD gummies, liquids and pre-rolled cigarettes; 6,500 containers of nitrous oxide; 1,800 schedule I narcotics, including marijuana, tianeptine and psilocybin; and 1,500 tainted sexual enhancement products.
ATC has suspended the business permits of six retail operations targeted in the operation: Smokin Aces Smoke Shop in Baton Rouge, Candle Hookah Smoke Shop and Old Smokey in Lafayette; and Vapes ‘R’ Us and two locations of 318 Cloudz in Shreveport.
In addition to the arrests and product seizures, ATC issued more than 140 citations for alcohol, tobacco, alternative tobacco and consumable hemp violations. The Fire Marshal issued more than 150 citations for safety and fire code violations.

The county and the cities of Las Vegas and North Las Vegas are in the process of negotiating a new contract with the shelter. The current contract expires June 30. The $2 million would extend the county’s funding commitment for six months while the governments continue to negotiate.
The Animal Foundation lost $4.2 million in 2023, according to its federal tax return, and $4.1 million the previous year.
“It’s just what we wanted,” Bryce Henderson of No-Kill Las Vegas, an animal advocacy organization, said of the six-month extension. “The county is not letting the Animal Foundation bully them into favorable terms.” 
Critics contend the shelter routinely euthanizes animals to make space for more, contributes to the valley’s critical animal overpopulation by releasing foster pets that have not been spayed or neutered, and relies on volunteer rescue organizations (that do not receive government funding) to care for sick and injured animals. 
The Animal Foundation’s CEO Hilarie Grey did not respond to requests for comment. 
“’I’m a no,” said Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick. “I’m a no all the time because I don’t feel that they’ve ever actually lived up to what they said they would do.” 
Kirkpatrick called the Animal Foundation “a bad actor” and said it has repeatedly sought the county’s financial assistance, failed to perform, and is now unable to negotiate a new contract. 
The county’s contribution to the current contract is approximately $25 million for five years.
“This literally kicks the can down the road,” Kirkpatrick said. “I don’t think that people know that we have invested $5 million in design, building a secondary shelter.”
“We’ve always been between a rock and a hard place here. What happens if we don’t approve this today?” asked Commissioner Justin Jones. 
The county would have a year to transition into its own shelter if it fails to negotiate a contract with the Animal Foundation, according to county staff. Doing so would be “a difficult lift,” said Assistant County Manager Les Lee Shell.
“There’s a motion on the rock and hard place,” said Commission Chairman Tick Segerblom. “Cast your votes.” 
Kirkpatrick and Commissioner April Becker voted against extending the contract.
The City of Las Vegas is scheduled to vote Wednesday on whether to extend its contract with the Animal Foundation for up to six months at a cost of $330,000 per month.
Henderson says animal advocates met with City of Las Vegas officials to ask for a similar extension in order for another operator to prepare to take over. 
“The city told us they wanted five years,” he said, adding “they had no problem with 10.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PXL_20230806_233048817-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-06-17 18:06:10.040735

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)When American politics is healthy — or as healthy as this two-party game can be — policy is created when the refined ideas of opposing philosophies collide, melding at their strongest points. On that subject, ask a few political junkies old enough to remember the 1980s and you’re bound to hear wistful tales of the collegial relationship between President Ronald Reagan and Democratic House Speaker Thomas P. O’Neill. The truth about the Gipper and Tip is more complicated, as truth often is, but that mix of fact and myth gives semi-modern shape to the dream of high function in a democratic republic.   
In deeply unhealthy periods, such as the one in which we’re currently trapped, the purpose of policy is fragmentation — that is, the isolation and punishment of targeted “out-groups” by an unchecked majority. Never mind that these persecuted groups lack the numbers and/or power to be responsible for the level of societal harm of which they are accused. That doesn’t matter to the majority party in Congress and New Hampshire, which is inextricably wrapped up in its own dark cycle, where the greater good cannot be achieved, or even approached, until the demonized out-groups are dealt with.   
So, in this year’s model, that’s immigrants, transgender people, poor people, and a revolving cast of others. Of course, the majority party responsible for targeting these groups doesn’t see its efforts that way, or claims not to see its efforts that way. It’s not immigrants they have a problem with, they argue, it’s certain immigrants. And their intent isn’t to persecute transgender teens and adults, they say, but to ensure safety (from apocryphal boogeymen) in public bathrooms and on ball fields. And it’s not poor people they have a problem with, it’s the lazy poor people committing “fraud, waste, and abuse” (of whom they have heard tell) against good, hard-working Americans.
Any nuance will always be lost in the fervor, and the majority party knows that. Elections are won — and policy executed — amid and because of the din.
The gravitational pull of the threat-obsessed far right is so strong in this state and country that the moorings of the political center have snapped. This year, New Hampshire has witnessed its entire congressional delegation, all Democrats, support the unjust, anti-immigrant Laken Riley Act and its two U.S. senators, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, lead the Democratic senatorial field when it comes to “yes” votes to confirm Trump administration nominees who are, in the most generous assessment, unqualified.
And then, within the increasingly barren space between the extreme right and the lightly populated center-right, there’s the cautionary tale that is the first six months of Kelly Ayotte’s governorship. If the bill signings she has celebrated so far truly represent what she envisioned as a successful first year of her first term, that’s one thing. Horrified congrats are in order for her and the pulsing right fringe, who got the governor they wanted and the victories they sought. But if her intention was to truly address the state’s most pressing needs — housing, child care, property-tax relief, workforce development, and a better future for New Hampshire’s public school students among them — then everyone should be asking what went wrong.
I have a couple thoughts on that. If you’re going to run a political campaign that frequently echoes the darkness of your party’s presidential candidate — and Ayotte spent a lot of time getting voters wound up about immigration, crime, and Massachusetts “socialism” — the sprawling and paranoid base that helped you secure power will demand their reward. So if Ayotte wanted to move the state forward on housing, child care, and those other top issues — even in her own deeply flawed, trickle-down way — she tied her own hands before the first ballots were cast in November. She traded a positive mandate — and I’m talking about “positive” just within the scope of her party’s traditional conservatism — for the negativity, cynicism, and misanthropy that defines the new GOP.
This won’t be a popular take on Bluesky, but there are New Hampshire Republicans who seem earnest about trying to serve the common good — at least in some areas. Whether on landfill siting or “Momnibus” health care legislation, there have been flickers of what a high-functioning two-party system is supposed to look like. Sometimes, Republicans seem to understand that you don’t have to vanquish all of your imagined enemies before you can start solving very real problems for very real people.
All it takes is allegiance to truth and some political courage. Who knew that, for so many public servants, that would be such an impossible hill to climb?",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/protestcolumn-1024x594.jpg,,,2025-06-17 18:06:10.040735

The raid, the largest immigration enforcement action in Nebraska since President Donald Trump took office a second time, targeted undocumented workers suspected of using fraudulent or stolen IDs to gain employment at the Glenn Valley plant near 68th and J Streets. Nearly 80 workers were detained.
According to a statement Monday night by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Nebraska, the four protesters ranged in age from 18 to 36. 
The fifth person charged was a Honduran worker, Marvin Aleman Zepeda, who was described early on by Todd Lyons, acting director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as “a violent criminal who attacked law enforcement while they were serving the public.”
 ‘Dark crawl space’

Here’s what happened in the encounter with Aleman Zepeda, according to recently unsealed federal court documents and a statement by a special agent with the Department Homeland Security, Justin Temperly:
The day of the raid, Temperly and other agents encountered Aleman Zepeda as they searched the facility for people trying to hide. A deputy U.S. marshal found the worker in a confined area above office spaces described as a “dark crawl space, near rafters of the building, that was not designed for human occupancy.”
Several agents directed Aleman Zepeda to surrender. He “refused commands” and “displayed a box cutter and other tools in his hands,” an affidavit for the criminal complaint said.
An agent deployed a Taser or stun gun, a law enforcement tool designed to temporarily incapacitate using electrical shocks. Aleman Zepeda reportedly pulled the Taser probes out of his leg. He reportedly threw the tools in the direction of the agents and “retreated further into the crawl space, where his hands were no longer visible.” 
The agent deployed a second Taser. The Douglas County Sheriff’s Office K-9 unit then assisted. 
A dog could be heard barking, the report said. “Law enforcement informed Aleman Zepeda he would be bitten” if the K-9 had to be used, and Aleman Zepeda surrendered. 
Aleman Zepeda, as a result of the incident that officials said took more than 45 minutes, is charged with use of a deadly or dangerous weapon to assault, resist, or impede a federal officer. The maximum penalty is no more than 20 years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine and supervised release of 3 years or less.
 ‘Middle fingers extended’ 

Charges agains the four protesters range from use of a weapon to assault, resist or impede a federal officer to willfully damaging federal property worth more than $1,000. They face prison time, fines and supervised release.
Of those, the most severe charges are against a 20-year-old. If convicted on one of the counts, Osmar Lorenzo-Genchi faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. For a second count, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

An affidavit supporting the charges, also based on Temperly’s statement, said Lorenzo-Genchi had been in the production area when he noticed agents and “became immediately agitated and began raising both of his arms with middle fingers extended while shouting profanities and racial slurs at the law enforcement officers.”
Agents put him in hand restraints. Lorenzo-Genchi was identified as a U.S. citizen during the process, and was escorted off the property and released.
As a law enforcement vehicle driven by a deputy U.S. marshal and occupied by two other agents later was leaving the area, “several members of the public” tried to impede movement by standing in front of the vehicle. Lorenzo-Genchi was identified as one of them.
An agent who got out of the vehicle pushed Lorenzo-Genchi toward the edge of the road. Lorenzo-Genchi reportedly returned and struck the driver’s side mirror with his fists and pulled and bent a rear windshield wiper. As an agent grabbed and pushed Lorenzo-Genchi, he spit on the agent, authorities allege in the document. Later, he reportedly threw rocks and other debris at law enforcement vehicles and shattered a rear passenger window of an occupied law enforcement vehicle.
On Tuesday, the first of the protesters appeared in federal court for a detention hearing.
Dave Domina, his defense attorney, said the man, a U.S. citizen who did not work at the plant and was there in opposition to Trump immigration policies, has pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanor charges. He said the judge did not make a decision Tuesday on whether to hold his client pending a trial, and the judge is awaiting information from the court’s pretrial services.
 More protests, peaceful  

A Saturday ICE update said the bulk of the nearly 80 workers detained in the raid were at the Lincoln County Jail in North Platte awaiting further proceedings. 
Omaha FBI Special Agent in Charge Eugene Kowel said the FBI is supporting ICE and Department of Justice partners in immigration enforcement operations across the country. He said “assaulting a law enforcement officer engaged in their lawful duties or damaging government property is not protected under the First Amendment — it is a criminal offense which we will investigate and apprehend those responsible.”
Several Omaha protests away from the Glenn Valley site followed the raid, including one on the late afternoon of June 10 that drew a police-estimated 400 people near 33rd and L Streets. A Saturday rally near the College World Series event in downtown Omaha drew several hundred demonstrators and no reported incidents. 
Omaha Mayor John Ewing, a former high-ranking Omaha police officer, said this weekend that he was thankful for how peacefully most protesters in Omaha so far have handled the ICE raid. He said acts of violence or vandalism will not be tolerated and “frankly hurt any message protesters want to give.”

 When the buses of Greater Boston go fully electric, there is a unique chance to capitalize on this moment of technological transition to meet a variety of environmental and community needs. 
The post How the MBTA move to electric buses could also help power the grid appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","SOMETIMES A BUS GARAGE can be far more than simply a place to store buses. This is especially true when the buses are electric. 
The MBTA’s long delayed plan to move to electric buses seems to finally be moving forward. It is a move, if the T can pull it off, that would have been unthinkable 25 years ago when I started working to improve transit in Greater Boston as an environmental advocate.  
This bus electrification plan is a laudable, albeit overdue and finally creaking forward, effort to meet the legal mandate of an all-electric T bus fleet by 2040. This initiative is the culmination of a long arc of progress: Buses put much less pollution into the air than when I started working on transportation issues at Conservation Law Foundation back in 1998.  
We were successful 20 years ago, pushing the MBTA to become a leader as one of the first transit agencies in the nation to switch to low sulfur diesel fuel — now the standard for all diesel fuel — and moving the T to put pollution controls on diesel buses. After these steps, the T began to employ newer and cleaner technologies — first compressed natural gas and then hybrid-electric buses. All these moves combined to slash emissions (which were causing real and direct harm to the health of our communities) by over 90 percent.  
But the upcoming bus electrification presents even more expansive opportunities. Our already cleaner buses have reduced asthma in kids and have meant fewer heart attacks among the elderly. Now, we can go even further than cleaning up the air in our neighborhoods: When the buses of Greater Boston go fully electric, there is a unique chance to capitalize on this moment of technological transition to meet a variety of environmental and community needs. 
We can reap even broader benefits from switching to electric buses by making the bus garages (“depots” in transit speak) into “energy hubs” that employ smart technology that allow batteries on parked buses to export power out to the grid when the energy system that powers our society needs a little help. 
Energy experts around the world have been working on designing the best algorithms and methods for coordinating electric bus fleet recharging with local electric demand and generation. The best of this work blends this theoretical calculation and modeling with case studies from the municipal bus fleet in Beijing and the Stanford University electric bus shuttle fleet where pilot efforts to coordinate electric bus charging with the needs of the grid have been implemented.  
While there are substantial efforts to deploy all types of distributed energy resources in a coordinated manner as “virtual power plants” across the United States — and many bus systems are moving towards partial or full electrification — there hasn’t yet been a full marriage of these concepts. If the MBTA were to take a leadership role, harnessing the full potential of the electric bus depot as a smart energy hub, the benefits in terms of dollars saved, improvement to the regional energy system, and pollution avoided would be substantial. 
There are big reliability, economic, and environmental benefits to charging batteries when the sun is shining, the wind is blowing, and power is cheaper and plentiful and then discharging those batteries back out to the larger grid when the system needs help and would otherwise be dependent on dirtier forms of generation. This time shifting of energy is a core benefit of large-scale energy storage generally and would be especially valuable if a solar array is placed on the bus garage roof. And in this case the energy storage facility providing these benefits would also be a needed home for electric buses that will provide much needed clean public transportation. 
Put plainly, smart design, construction, and operation of modern electric bus facilities will allow buses to not just charge quickly, but to also act as an energy storage system that can feed the grid when needed and help to power our communities. There are few opportunities to build that kind of vital energy infrastructure that also provide better and cleaner transportation. 
Keep in mind that an electric bus the length and size of those in the T’s standard workaday fleet has a battery that holds over 350 kilowatt-hours (kW-hrs) of power. Larger buses, like the “articulated” buses in use on routes like the Silver Line and the 39 bus through Mission Hill and Jamaica Plain, have a battery that holds over 500 kW-hrs. To put this into perspective, an average Massachusetts household uses about 20 kW-hrs of electricity per day and residential battery installations that provide backup power in the event of a blackout are usually between 10 and 15 kw-hr capacity. 
Imagine a scenario where an energy hub/garage housing 100 buses, cumulatively holding thousands of kilowatt-hours of power when fully charged, could supply enough power to the grid to feed thousands of houses during a moment when the grid needs a boost. 
Having these kinds of virtual power plant resources in the mix will become more and more important as the deployment of solar power continues and electrical demand rises — driven by the continuing rise of data centers supporting cloud computing, AI, and video streaming along with heat pumps during cold New England nights. 
Energy hubs like these garages will only become more and more important as we move towards a more dynamic power grid. Our grid will, increasingly, be home to variable “loads” that consume power — like the electric heat pumps that can heat our homes during the winter and cool them in the summer. 
Maintaining a stable and reliable power system will mean large scale deployment of all kinds of energy storage, both to provide power around the clock but also to avoid crises like those recently experienced in Spain and Portugal, which left millions without power. Avoiding such dire moments will hinge on whether we bring online resources that provide wonky, obscure, and vital services like “frequency regulation” — responding to a signal from ISO-NE, the regional system operator, sent every four seconds to increase or decrease output or consumption of power in order to help keep the regional energy system in balance.  
Battery energy storage resources, like a smart energy hub that actively charges and (when needed) pulls power from the batteries of electric buses, are exactly the kind of tool that is needed to do that job, and get paid for it — income that can help support the core transportation function of the T. 
Executing on a vision of electric bus infrastructure will require a coordinated effort between many different city and state agencies and authorities, as well as the T, carefully working with utility companies and our regional grid system. Harnessing the power of private enterprise through competitive processes for bringing in energy, infrastructure development, and bus manufacturing companies will be essential in building this new and better system meeting our energy and transportation needs. 
The time to mobilize to advance this vision of cleaner air and a stronger grid is now. Like the move away from the dirtiest diesels, this is an opportunity to provide cleaner air while providing critical transit to keep us all moving — and this time we can also help build a cleaner, more versatile, and resilient electricity grid at the same time.  
Seizing this moment, will allow us to add a new, clean and green refrain to a classic children’s song: The wheels on the bus go round and round – keeping the lights on all over town.

(Courtesy photo)The uncle of a Las Cruces man fatally shot in January by New Mexico State Police is asking a state judge to compel the Department of Public Safety to release records about the incident. 
Martin Beltran, of El Paso, on Monday filed a petition for writ of mandamus in First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe, alleging that the State Police records custodian violated the state Inspection of Public Records Act by refusing to release public records related to the Jan. 6 shooting death of his nephew Jesus Rubio.
That shooting occurred while Rubio, of Las Cruces, was driving to his sister Yesenia Avila’s home in Hobbs to download a video game, according to the petition. Rubio and Avila shared an interest in playing video games, Albuquerque-based civil rights attorney Laura Schauer Ives told Source NM.
State police reported the incident the following day in a news release, which said two officers pulled Rubio over for a traffic stop, at which point Rubio “ignored officers commands,” exited the vehicle and, ultimately “raised his arms as if pointing a firearm as he walked towards the officers.” 
Two State Police troopers then each fired “at least once” at Rubio, killing him, the news release said.
State Police also published a single frame of a police vehicle dashcam video, depicting what they say is Rubio raising his arms, pretending to point a gun at police. Police did not ultimately find a firearm on Rubio or in his vehicle, according to the release.
Beltran’s attorneys say the information released by the police does not tell the full story.
“While NMSP released a portion of responsive video footage to the media the day after officers shot and killed Jesus, his family still awaits the production of public records to understand the context of the incident,” wrote Schauer Ives and co-counsel Andrew Pavlides.
A spokesperson for State Police did not respond to a request for comment sent via email on Tuesday morning.
Rubio died at Covenant Hobbs Hospital, according to his obituary. He was 28.
In a written statement to Source NM on Tuesday, Rubio’s family said he had a unique gift for bringing joy into any room and was always the one making others laugh with his goofy sense of humor and playful spirit.
“Anyone close to him will tell you: he was deeply loving, endlessly caring and someone whose presence made the world a little brighter,” the family said.
Beltran on Jan. 7 filed a public records request with NMSP in an effort to better understand what led to Rubio’s death, and to determine whether to sue the police agency, according to the petition.
State Police on Jan. 23 determined Beltran’s request to be “over burdensome,” and then over the next five months asked for more time, missing its own self-imposed deadlines without explanation, according to the petition.
As of Tuesday, State Police had not turned over any responsive records nor offered any explanation for withholding them, Schauer Ives said.
Court records show a Fifth Judicial District Court judge on Jan. 21 appointed Beltran as the representative of Rubio’s wrongful death estate, which is a necessary first step to investigate and pursue a wrongful death claim. Rubio’s family cannot decide whether to pursue such a claim because they don’t have information about what happened and why, Schauer Ives said in a phone interview.
“Under these circumstances, families are left in the dark,” she said. “Unlike any other family members of a crime victim, they don’t have the basic information about what happened to their loved one and why.”
The New Mexico Supreme Court in July 2020 ruled that DPS must produce records, even when a criminal investigation is ongoing. That case stemmed from the police killing of James Boyd in 2014 in Albuquerque.
Schauer Ives said Tuesday that this is the third lawsuit her firm has filed against the state Department of Public Safety this year for allegedly circumventing the high court’s ruling by claiming that a records request is overly broad or burdensome.
“They are delaying release of records that should be public and should be provided to family members to find out the very basic facts of why their loved one was killed by a police officer,” she said.
Amanda Lavin, legal director at the Albuquerque-based nonprofit New Mexico Foundation for Open Government, told Source NM on Tuesday this case could be similar to others in which DPS is accused of unlawfully deeming a records request “overly burdensome or broad” in order to avoid having to offer a specific justification for withholding records. She pointed to a recent example of DPS refusing to turn over records from their investigation into the death of Rio Arriba County Sheriff Billy Merrifield to two local newspapers.
“What it seems like DPS is doing is that they’re using that excuse, that a request is overly broad and burdensome, when the reality is they have an ongoing investigation, they don’t want to give records, but they know that’s not a legal excuse,” Lavin said.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)The Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners voted to be represented by outside legal counsel hired by the Idaho Department of Lands – not Attorney General Raúl Labrador, who is also a member of the land board.
During a Tuesday meeting at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, the board voted to approve a new legal representation policy that states, “The land board shall receive its legal counsel through attorneys employed by the (Idaho Department of Lands).”
The new policy also states, “The land board shall be represented by its legal counsel in all courts and before all administrative tribunals or bodies of any nature.”

The policy also states that the legal counsel shall provide updates to the land board on pending and potential litigation.
Previously, Idaho’s attorney general had served as the legal counsel for the land board. 
That meant Labrador had been able to provide legal guidance to the land board, vote on land board policies and represent the land board in court.
  Idaho Attorney General Labrador votes against new Land Board policy

Labrador cast the lone vote against approving the new legal representation policy, which he said is contrary to the law and contrary to the state’s constitution. 
“They’ve been trying to do this for a long time because they don’t like to be told ‘no’,” Labrador told reporters after Tuesday’s meeting adjourned. “As you saw earlier in the meeting, they don’t like to follow the law. So when somebody stands up and tells them you’re not following the law, they seem to object to that.”
The Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners, which is often simply referred to as the land board, is made of five statewide elected officials in Idaho – the governor, attorney general, secretary of state, superintendent of public instruction and state controller. 
The land board provides direction for the Idaho Department of Land’s management of about 2.5 million acres of state endowment lands.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little supported the new legal representation policy, saying it aligns with Senate Bill 1292, a law the Idaho Legislature passed in 2024.
The law states that the Idaho Department of Lands will be represented by general counsel hired by the department, subject to approval by the land board. The law specifically states that the legal counsel shall be independent from the Idaho Attorney General’s Office.
During Tuesday’s meeting, Labrador said he told Idaho legislators at the time that the legal representation changes in the law were unconstitutional.
“I suggested to the Legislature they were unconstitutional, because the department is an instrumentality,” Labrador said Tuesday. “I think there seems to be a misunderstanding of what an instrumentality is. We’re trying to have the tail wag the dog here. Instrumentality means that they’re an appendage to the land board.”
During a March 21, 2024, meeting of the House Resources and Conservation Committee, Labrador used different terms when discussing instrumentality.
“At the time the Idaho Department of Lands was created, it was created as an instrumentality of the land board,” Labrador said in 2024. “What that means is that they are one and the same.”
Meanwhile, Little said Tuesday that adopting the new legal representation policy ensures the land board, collectively, all has the same common legal counsel.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — A Louisville Democrat who has been accused of inappropriate behavior toward women in and out of Frankfort appeared Tuesday in a hours-long closed door session with the Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission.
The commission took no final action on the matter Tuesday. 
Rep. Daniel Grossberg’s attorney Thomas E. Clay told reporters after his client left shortly before 5 p.m. that they could not comment on the matter.
  Rep. Daniel Grossberg, D-Louisville. (LRC Public Information)
Grossberg and his lawyer were in the meeting throughout the executive session. The commission also called various witnesses, including women who work in politics, former Democratic Kentucky House caucus leaders and workers from a Louisville strip club. 
The hearing was held in the Capitol Annex but closed to the public. 
Grossberg has been expelled from the House Democratic Caucus and faces calls from within his party to resign his legislative seat following allegations against him for inappropriate behavior toward women, as reported by the Lexington Herald-Leader last year. In a separate investigation, the Legislative Research Commission questioned women about inappropriate text messages sent to them by Grossberg. Later, the strip club, Foxys Gentlemen’s Club, told the Herald-Leader  it banned Grossberg for life after he inappropriately touched a dancer.
Grossberg had attempted to sway Franklin Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate to block Tuesday’s proceeding but the judge dismissed the motion Monday afternoon. 
House Democrats sought the investigation by the Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission. However, what exactly is in the complaint against Grossberg, as well as any investigation findings, are not publicly known though some details have been reported by media outlets. Kentucky law makes the ethics commission’s proceedings, including complaints and other records related to a preliminary inquiry, confidential until the commission makes a final determination.
Members of the Legislative Ethics Commission met in an executive session for more than six hours, taking occasional five- to ten-minute breaks. The commission also ate lunch in the closed door session. Grossberg and his counsel were in the room for most of the time. Throughout the day, various witnesses were called into the room
Former lawmakers, House Democratic Floor Leader Derrick Graham of Frankfort and Democratic Whip Rachel Roberts of Newport, and House Democratic Caucus Chair Cherlynn Stevenson of Lexington, were at the annex for part of the day. They were in party leadership when the caucus began seeking an investigation from the commission into Grossberg. 
Roberts and Stevenson were mentioned in Grossberg’s dismissed complaint in Franklin Circuit Court. He accused them of seeking a retaliatory investigation from the commission. Neither were defendants in his lawsuit. 
Three women who were initially anonymously quoted in an August Herald-Leader story and later went public were also at the annex Tuesday. They are Lexington Fayette Urban County Council member Emma Curtis, Kentucky Young Democrats President Allison Wiseman and former Democratic House candidate Sarah Ritter. Workers of Foxys, the Louisville establishment that banned Grossberg, appeared before the commission. 
Though Kentucky Democrats across the state have been steadfast in their call on Grossberg to resign, he continued to represent the 30th House District in the General Assembly earlier this year. 
He has gained some primary challengers for the 2026 election. 
If the commission now finds probable cause that Grossberg committed an ethics violation, it may issue a confidential reprimand or schedule an adjudicatory hearing. It may also choose to dismiss the case.

Kennedy Jr.’s claims about autism.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Laura Tillman to discuss her article, “After RFK Jr. autism claims, CT families respond — one with a poem,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short.
WSHU: How did the story about Connecticut families and their reaction to RFK’s comments about the autistic come about?
LT: So I think like a lot of people after RFK held a press conference in April about autism numbers, and more broadly about this effort to find an environmental cause of autism, I saw a video that was posted online with some of the cast members of Love on the Spectrum, which is a Netflix reality show about people with autism spectrum disorder who are who are dating, who are looking for relationships. And some of the cast members of that show are speaking out about language in RFK’s comments that they found offensive, and it just made me think that there might be a bigger story to be told about how this rhetoric and some of these actions might be impacting people.
WSHU: How did you find Emma and Pamela McKeever, and could you first tell us a little bit about them?
LT: Pamela and Emma live in Glastonbury, and Emma is an artist. She lives at home with her parents, and she and her mom do a lot of different artistic projects together. They had some, you know, strong feelings about some of RFK’s comments, which prompted Emma to write a poem, and also Pamela wrote her own poem, in fact. Kind of in response to some of the things that RFK said, including one of his comments, was that, you know, these are children who will never write a poem.
WSHU: Now, there’s a quote you have here — “If you’ve met one person with autism, you’ve met one person with autism.” Tell us a little bit about that quote itself.
LT: This is a quote from Dr. Steven Shore, who is an autism specialist, and I think it’s something that you often hear talking to people, whether they’re in this community or people who are part of the advocacy broader community around autism, you know, autism is not a condition that you can see in a genetic test, the way that you might see Down syndrome or some other conditions. It’s more something that’s diagnosed based on behavior and it really is an incredibly broad category. Years ago, there were more subcategories in terms of, you know, Asperger’s and, but now all of these things are classified as autism, and so it’s a descriptive term in the sense that autism can mean a lot of different things.
WSHU: Now, RFK in his comments at the press conference, seemed to indicate that there was some environmental cause to autism and that there’d probably be a cure in the next few months. What does the community feel about those statements?
LT: Just to clarify, he’s saying that they would identify the cause within the next few months, not necessarily a cure. But I think that even so, it seems, you know, for people who have been studying this for a long time, there’s been a tremendous amount of effort to find the cause, and the research predominantly points to a genetic, biological set of causes. It may not be as clear-cut as something like Down syndrome, but there is, you know, a preponderance of evidence talking to scientists who study this, that it is primarily something that is genetic rather than environmental. There have been some isolated studies that have shown that a particular, you know, toxin in a particular place has led to a higher incidence of autism, but I think in general, researchers agree that that the environment may be a, a factor in autism, but it is likely to be sort of a very minor piece of the picture.
I think also in part because the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has for many years focused on the possibility that vaccines could be a cause for autism. And so I think there is concern about continuing to stoke that belief and the fact that that could have very serious effects, and people not vaccinating their children, and that those effects can be deadly, whereas, you know, there is no research — there isn’t a significant amount of mainstream research or, I should say that, scientists in general don’t believe that there’s any link between vaccines and autism, in the mainstream.
WSHU: However, it seems most of the people you talked with are happy that attention is being paid to this. However, they’re concerned that it might not be the proper type of attention. Would I be correct in saying that?
LT: Some people might feel, I did speak to one woman, you know, whose son has more significant challenges, related to his, his autism, and she did feel, you know, this gratification that at least there was sort of this renewed burst of attention and And I heard that echoed in comments from other people that they had kind of heard that from, you know, some people in this community. But I think in general, there is a real concern that the type of attention that is being paid is potentially damaging, creating renewed stigma around autism diagnosis, and I think it’s important to note that, you know, more kids are being screened for autism than ever before. So, that is part of the picture of the increase in diagnosis, and that can actually really benefit those children and their families. You know, if a child is diagnosed early and they’re able to get educational interventions, or therapies that help them, manage some of the, the behaviors and sensory issues that can be associated with autism that it can really help them thrive, over, over their lifespan. And so this idea of wanting to avoid a diagnosis or avoid being part of this community because there’s this renewed burst of stigma and attention, I think, is something that people are concerned about.
WSHU: And also something that you say people are concerned about is the fact that some of the services have been cut in the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse by the Department of Government Efficiency. Could you tell us a little bit more about that?
LT: Some services have been cut that benefited the elderly and disabled already and then there are concerns about other, other services, you know, there, there has been this, Effort to dismantle the Department of Education and a lot of the federal funding that states receive from the Department of Education goes towards special education. So that is a major concern, and then there are also concerns about whether there would be major cuts to Medicaid. There have already been a number of autism-related NIH grants that have been canceled, and there are concerns about whether more could be coming.
WSHU: How about the concern about the fact that RFK, in his comments, has talked about creating some type of tracking system for people with autism and having a database.
LT: The database idea, I think it’s still a little bit unclear what it would actually do, but that is part of what is alarming to people, is, you know, is this a tracking system or is this anonymized data collection? The stated purpose of this is to look for an environmental cause of autism and to look at whether there are commonalities that can be identified among people with autism that could lead to some kind of scientific advance in terms of understanding the cause. But when I spoke to one of the researchers at Yale, who studies this issue, you know, he did say that there is already a database that collects information about people with autism spectrum disorder. It does so, you know, according to U.S. laws, in which that data is anonymized. People have to choose to opt into this, so it’s kind of unclear why there would need to be another database or what RFK is seeking to find that can’t be found through the scientific data that already exists.
I think that just the language around this idea of a database is really alarming to people, and it’s one of the main things that I heard from people that I spoke to and also just people who interact with this community is there’s a lot of fear around. So that’s definitely part of his comments and his plans that have, in particular, inspired a lot of concern, and it is part of what’s driving some parents to not want their children to be diagnosed at all because they don’t want them to be on this database.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AUTISM-IMPACT-0520-SR-14-1024x728.jpg,,,2025-06-17 18:06:10.040735

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As questions continue to circle around the “peacekeepers” acting as armed security at the “No Kings” protest in Salt Lake City on Saturday, when police say a man inadvertently shot and killed a bystander, protest organizers issued a statement Tuesday saying the “safety volunteer” who was involved is a “military veteran.” 
“During the protest an individual was spotted holding an AR-15 style weapon,” organizers with Utah 50501 said in the prepared statement provided to Utah News Dispatch on Tuesday. “Our team of safety volunteers, who have been selected because of their military, first responder, and other relevant de-escalation experience, believed that there was an imminent threat to the protesters and took action.” 
Utah 50501 is a state chapter of the 50501 Movement, a grassroots group that organizes rallies to protest actions by President Donald Trump and his administration. 
According to Salt Lake City police, the shooting happened after two men described as “peacekeepers” confronted another man, 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa, who was carrying an AR-15 style rifle. One of the men, reportedly part of the event’s security team, fired three shots from a handgun, grazing Gamboa but also hitting an “innocent bystander,” Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, who was pronounced dead at a hospital.

Shortly after the shooting, police arrested Gamboa, and he was booked into jail for investigation of murder. Police say, however, that Gamboa did not fire his rifle. The two “peacekeepers,” who wore high-visability vests, were initially detained by police, but were released after being questioned. Police said the man who fired the three shots is cooperating with investigators. 
“The safety volunteer who responded to the individual (holding the rifle) and who was questioned by police is a military veteran,” the Utah 50501 statement said. “The person currently in custody was apprehended thanks to a protester who saw the rifle and brought it to police attention.” 
In the statement, Utah 50501 organizers also expressed “profound heartbreak” for the death of Ah Loo. 
“We are mourning Afa Ah Loo with everything we have, and we are holding his family and friends in our hearts,” the statement said. “Afa’s name, courage, and commitment to his people will never be forgotten. We express our dearest and deepest sympathy to all those who knew and loved him.” 
The protests’ organizers also noted the investigation into the shooting is “still currently ongoing. At this time SLCPD has not chosen to charge any of the volunteers.” 
Salt Lake City police are investigating the shooting, but the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office will ultimately decide charges. As of Tuesday, no charges had been filed against Gamboa or anyone else involved in the shooting. 
Salt Lake County DA: ‘Be patient and let law enforcement finish their work’
The Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office has declined to say whether prosecutors are considering filing any charges against the “peacekeepers” who were involved in the shooting.

“This continues to be an active investigation by the SLCPD that is yet to be screened by our office, which is not uncommon or of concern as we remain so early into the criminal inquiry,” Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said in a prepared statement issued Tuesday. 
“When the gathered evidence is presented to our office and homicide team, we will have a better understanding of facts, evidence and any chargeable decision,” Gill continued. “Until then any conjecture would be purely speculative, inaccurate and inappropriate.”
Gill urged Utahns to “be patient and let law enforcement finish their work.” He also asked anyone “who may have evidence or may be witnesses to contact and share that information with the SLCPD.” He referred to a link to the Salt Lake City Police Department’s website, where evidence can be submitted online. 
Unanswered questions
In the days following the chaotic shooting, unanswered questions remain, including more details of who the “peacekeepers” were and how they were vetted to be acting as armed security. Questions also remain regarding Gamboa’s intentions and why he brought a rifle to the protest. 
As Utahns grieve Ah Loo’s death, some have applauded actions by the “peacekeepers” to prevent what could have been a mass shooting, while others have questioned whether the armed man who shot at Gamboa and inadvertently fatally struck Ah Loo acted appropriately. 
The Utah 50501 statement provided Tuesday offered a bit more information about who the protest’s organizers said served as “safety volunteers,” including that the people selected had “military, first responder, and other relevant de-escalation experience,” and that the man involved was a “military veteran.” 
However, other questions remain unanswered, including the ages of the two “peacekeepers” that were involved in the shooting, how they were vetted, and how many of them present at the protest were armed.
The Utah News Dispatch on Monday sent emails to both national and local organizers asking those questions and others. On Tuesday, Utah organizers pointed to the prepared statement and declined to provide interviews at this time. 
“The organizers genuinely want to engage with the public but we have to balance the public’s need for transparency with the participant’s legal and psychological health,” the organizers said in an email.

Criticism from an armed activist group
Utah 50501 organizers have drawn some criticism over the shooting, including from other local activist groups. The group Armed Queers SLC, which describes itself as an “LGBTQ organization dedicated to the defense, and success, of oppressed people’s movements,” posted a statement on its Instagram story saying “we are still shocked at how the events unraveled” at the protest. 
“Armed Queers takes gun ownership and its use for defense of our communities very seriously, and reject the way this situation was handled,” the group said. “This event resulted in a direct loss of life that could have been avoided, and other measures should have been in place for proper de-escalation before openly shooting into a vulnerable crowd.”

Armed Queers, the statement said, “had no involvement in the planning” of Salt Lake City’s “No Kings” protest, adding that though some members attended, “Armed Queers was given very little information about this event or our role in it.” 
“We were asked to work as extra members of 50501’s de-escalation team 2 days before the event,” their statement added. “We agreed to participate because the organizers were concerned about agitators, but we were given very few details and transparency about the de-escalation plan.” 
The group said its members “worked as a ‘secondary de-escalation’ team, and had no real interaction with agitators, or coordination with the event organizers while fulfilling that role.” It noted that no Armed Queers members were wearing high-visability vests, and no Armed Queers were “part of any escalation of events.” 
“One of Armed Queers’ founding principles is ‘The abolition of prisons and police as they serve as nothing but tools of capitalist oppression.’ We completely reject any collaboration with the police or efforts by the state to celebrate certain protest movements, while repressing others,” the Armed Queers statement added. “We were only made aware of any information being shared with the police when public videos had surfaced of 50501’s team.” 
The group added that they grieve “the killing of Afa Ah Loo. His life was unjustly cut short, and our hearts are with his family and his community.’ 
50501 Movement has discouraged bringing guns to protests
Organizers with the national 50501 Movement have said they discourage people from bringing firearms to protests. 
“In the face of this heartbreaking situation, we would like to affirm our commitment to nonviolence and to our non-negotiable prohibition of firearms policy for anyone representing 50501 at any of our actions or events,” organizers with the national 50501 Movement said in a Facebook post Monday. “It is clear we do not have a complete understanding of what happened yet. What is certain is that, if no guns were present at the protest, this tragedy would have been prevented altogether.”
Utah, however, is a “constitutional carry” state, which means its laws allow the open and concealed carrying of firearms without a permit for those who are legally allowed to possess them. In 2021, with HB60, the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature eliminated the state’s concealed carry permit requirements. Now, anyone 21 and over who can legally possess a gun is free to carry it loaded and hidden in public. 
Unlike 26 other states, Utah has not adopted a law prohibiting carrying long guns at state capitols or political protests, according to Everytown Research & Policy, an organization that produces research on gun violence and advocates for gun violence prevention. The group has ranked Utah as No. 36 in the country for “gun law strength.” 
Salt Lake City police continue to investigate
Salt Lake City Police spokesperson Brent Weisberg said in a lengthy statement issued Monday that police are continuing to investigate the “peacekeepers” involvement, as well as other aspects of the protest’s organization and staffing. He said neither of the two men identified as “peacekeepers” involved in the shooting were “current or former members of law enforcement, including the Salt Lake City Police Department.”

“While Utah law governs when and how a person may carry and use a firearm, the lawfulness of any individual’s possession or use depends on the specific facts and circumstances of each case,” Weisberg said. 
Weisberg said it “remains unclear whether these individuals were hired by or volunteered for the event organizers, or acted on their own initiative.” 
He also noted that the term  “peacekeeper” does not “represent any formal designation recognized by the Salt Lake City Police Department or the City,” and that there was “no record in the event’s permit indicating the presence of organized or armed security.” 
He said the “peacekeeping” term was how the volunteer questioned by police “self-identified.” 
“While the Salt Lake City Police Department was aware that Saturday’s demonstration would include people in support roles, such as those helping to marshal or guide the crowd, these functions are entirely internal to the event,” Weisberg said. “They are not overseen, sanctioned, or trained by the Salt Lake City Police Department. From the department’s standpoint, these persons are considered members of the public, subject to the same rights and responsibilities as any other person in Utah.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowans in communities around the state, primarily in central and southern regions, have been told to refrain from watering their lawns, washing their cars and filling swimming pools. 
Some utilities issued preventative conservation orders in anticipation of dry conditions through the summer, while communities in central Iowa are conserving water to keep drinking water nitrate concentrations below the federal level. For other Iowans, water conservation orders are the new normal.

Conservation for protection from nitrate contamination
Central Iowa Water Works, which serves more than 600,000 people in the Des Moines region, issued its first ever lawn watering ban June 12 due to high nitrate concentrations in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers from which it sources. 
Nitrate levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers have tested as high as 17 mg/L this month, making it difficult for the facilities to meet water demands while removing enough nitrates to comply with federal drinking water standards. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency set a maximum nitrate concentration of 10 mg per liter to avoid pregnancy complications, blue-baby syndrome and other potential health risks. Facilities in the central Iowa system have been able to keep concentrations below the federal limit in outgoing water by “pulling all the levers” on its nitrate removal facilities.
Melissa Walker, a spokesperson with Des Moines Water Works, said the concentrations Monday were 15.6 mg/L in Des Moines River and 15.3 mg/L in Raccoon River. 
“When concentrations are this high, production at treatment facilities is limited,” Walker said in an email. “The lawn watering ban will remain in effect until nitrate concentrations drop in our rivers.” 
In a Tuesday press conference, CIWW leadership said the lawn watering ban has been effective at reducing demand on the system.
The City of Des Moines has additionally closed spraygrounds and splash pads to help conserve water. CIWW customers can be penalized if caught violating the orders. 
Des Moines Water Works, part of CIWW, installed a nitrate removal facility in the 1990s due to steady increases of nitrate concentrations in its source-waters. A fact sheet from the facility said operation of the removal system adds an estimated $10,000 each day to facility costs. The removal system has been operating this spring for nearly 60 days, according to a release from CIWW.

The “spring flush,” as water quality advocates call it, of nitrates in Iowa rivers is an annual occurrence caused by spring rains that wash nutrients off of crop land, feedlots and other areas, into the waterways. 
Heather Wilson, Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator with Izaak Walton League of America, said surface water nitrate concentrations across the state “habitually” exceed the 10 parts per million standard in May and June. 
“For the average surface water readings to be so high is definitely indicative of a lot of input,” Wilson said. “Some of it is cyclical, like every year around this time there’s more rain, so there’s more runoff, but as far as what that runoff contains, it’s definitely being impacted by the fertilizer and manure applications on the landscape.” 
Izaak Walton League leads the Nitrate Watch program, which relies on citizen scientists to take regular samples of rivers, creeks and drinking water. The data is available online and shows streams and wells with records of high nitrate concentrations. 


Boiling drinking water does not remove nitrates, but causes the concentration to intensify which can be harmful, especially for pregnant individuals or children. 
Nitrates in excess of 10 parts per million can cause methemoglobinemia, or blue baby syndrome, which is a life-threatening condition that reduces the amount of oxygen that can be carried in the blood.


Wilson said it’s important to note that 10 parts per million is the regulatory standard that water treatment facilities are held to, but research exists that shows concentrations of 5 parts per million, which is equivalent to milligrams per liter, may be linked to increased risk for certain types of cancer and thyroid diseases. 
Wilson said EPA has initiated processes to reevaluate the regulatory figure, though the work has been started and stopped with administrative changes. 
“Ten parts per million, that’s the regulatory standard, and that’s the goal for Waterworks, because that’s what they’re held to, but I think it’s important to remember the research that exists about what is actually probably a healthier nitrate diet,” Wilson said.
Ted Corrigan with Des Moines Water Works said Tuesday the water coming out of the Fleur Drive facility had nitrate concentrations of 7.7 mg/L.
The Nitrate Watch map shows quite a few red and orange dots, indicative of excessive nitrate concentrations, around the Des Moines region, but also around Iowa City, Waterloo and several other parts of the state.

Nitrate monitoring from the Iowa Water Quality Information Center, which pulls from U.S. Geological Survey monitors, show surface level measurements in the Iowa River in excess of 10 parts per million this spring. 
Jonathan Durst, the water superintendent for the City of Iowa City, said while the city’s water treatment facility draws from the Iowa River, it also draws from groundwater aquifers to dilute nitrate concentrations and comply with EPA regulations. 
Durst said the Iowa River nitrates spikes periodically, but if it were to stay consistently high, the facility’s current dilution methods at the plant would not be effective. 
Durst said it’s “hard to put a finger on” if the levels have gotten worse or changed over the past years.
“It really is weather and human dependent, like where is the rain going to hit and how much fertilizer has been spread on the ground,” Durst said.  
Low wells in southwest Iowa make water conservation a perennial necessity
Water conservation orders have become the normal for cities in southwestern Iowa, where years of drought conditions have created water shortages in the system. 
The shortages have become severe enough that several towns were put under boil advisories for almost a month, after too much stress on the system depleted stores in city water towers, causing a drop in system pressure. 
Municipalities on the Regional Water Rural Water Association in southwest Iowa no longer have to boil their drinking water, but remain in a “red” level advisory that restricts things like lawn watering, filling pools and washing cars. 
These shortages are not caused by nitrate filtration concerns, but by consistent drought over the past 10 years that has impacted the replenishment of groundwater stores.
In its latest release, Regional Water said it is 7-10 days away from completing a pipeline to pump water into the system from Council Bluffs’ water supply, which sources from the Missouri River.
Some Iowans in the water system, which covers Avoca, Persia, Panama, Portsmouth, Westphalia, Kirkman, Tennant, Earling, Exira, and Brayton, however, are skeptical the pipeline will solve the water shortage problems they have been dealing with for the past several years. 
Denison Municipal Utilities, together with West Central Iowa Rural Water Association have been under water use restrictions for watering lawns, filling pools and washing cars since mid March, due to “an extended dry spell” that has caused the levels at the facility to drop. 
Shenandoah residents have been under some form of water use restrictions for about a year and a half, according to the city’s water superintendent, Tim Martin. The municipality is currently under a stage four restriction that prohibits residents from irrigating lawns, filling pools, or watering with their outdoor hoses. 
“We’re hanging on but we’re not in dire straits yet,” Martin said. 
The utility has bought property over the Fremont Channel, an alluvial aquifer, and plans to install two new wells to tap into the groundwater source. Martin said he expects the project to be online in fall 2026 and said he was “very confident” the town “should not have to worry about drought again” once the wells are in place.
Utilities are not required to report water conservation orders to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, but DNR field offices are generally aware of shortages in their regions. 
Field office staff in north central, northeast and northwest Iowa said they were not aware of any communities under water use restrictions. 
Staff at the field office in Des Moines, covering south central Iowa communities, said they were only aware of the restrictions in the Des Moines region. 
In southeast Iowa, the Poweshiek Water Association initiated mandatory water conservation orders at the beginning of March for Tama and Amana systems. The water association issued the same order last year, and according to its website, was able to keep enough water in the system through the high demand summer months until wells were replenished in August. 
The water association had to terminate some well contracts last year which, if completed, would have alleviated the need for a summer 2025 conservation order. The association said it is planning to drill new wells in Tama and Amana in July, and continue to treat existing wells to improve flow. 
In the meantime, affected customers in parts of Tama, Benton, Black Hawk, Poweshiek, Mahaska, Jasper, Iowa, and Keokuk counties join other Iowa residents in refraining from watering grass, washing cars or streets and filling swimming pools. 
“Let’s all band together and do our part one last time to help each other through this time frame,” a release from Poweshiek Water Association read.

Bohannan, a University of Iowa law professor and former member of the Iowa House of Representatives, announced her 2026 congressional campaign Tuesday morning in a news release and said in an afternoon interview her phone has been “blowing up” with messages from people excited about the race. She added she’s received many small donations as well, which she said was “heartening” as she does not take donations from political action committees.
“The outpouring of support has been tremendous,” Bohannan said. “There’s a real excitement here, I feel it, it’s contagious, and I am just so excited to get started.”

Miller-Meeks was reelected to the district in the 2024 general election, beating Bohannan by just under 800 votes that were confirmed by a vote recount requested by Bohannan. The district spans across eastern and southeastern Iowa, including Iowa City, Davenport and Indianola. Bohannan also ran for the seat in 2022, losing with 47% of the vote to 53% for the Republican.
Over the past four years, Bohannan said she’s traveled to all parts of the district to speak with Iowans in their homes and businesses, and has found many people dealing with unreasonably high costs of living, from young families to seniors, as well as issues with their health care. Bohannan said she understands these struggles well, having grown up in a family that had to choose between putting food on the table and paying for prescription medicine for her father.
The constituents she’s spoken with have fallen all across the political perspective, Bohannan said, and she’s done her best to show them that she is an “independent thinker” who believes her own politics matter much less than the needs of the district.
It was hearing from people about the troubles they’re facing and the encouragement she received from supporters that led Bohannan to run again, she said.
“I have gotten to know people. I know what people are facing in the district, the joys and also the challenges,” Bohannan said. “And they have gotten to know me, and they know that I would be a strong independent voice for them in Washington, and that I would always put Iowa first.”
Bohannan said one of the big differences between her and Miller-Meeks is that, if elected, she won’t bring her own or outside political agendas to office, when Miller-Meeks has voted against the wants and needs of Iowans while in office. These include voting in favor of tariffs that will hurt Iowan pocketbooks, Bohannan said and voting for Medicaid cuts, among other decisions.
“People are fed up. They know that (Miller-Meeks) is not looking out for them,” Bohannan said. “She is voting the way that her party bosses and her billionaire donors and corporate special interests are telling her to vote rather than how they need her to vote.”
Other Democrats joining the fray include former legislator Bob Krause and Travis Terrell, a patient access specialist at University of Iowa Health Care.
Bohannan said Democrats’ chances of winning the general election against Miller-Meeks are going to come down to the candidate’s experience and the relationships they’ve formed. She said she outpaces her primary opponents in both of those criteria.
“I am really the only person in this race who has any chance of defeating Representative Miller-Meeks at a time when our representative democracy is really at stake, and when everyday Iowans’ ability to get ahead and not just get by is really at stake,” Bohannan said.

A bill to raise Providence’s total tax levy beyond the state-mandated cap cleared its penultimate hurdle Tuesday. 
The Senate Committee on Finance voted 8-1 to advance Sen. Sam Zurier’s S1041 toward the full Senate floor for a possible vote in the waning days of this year’s legislative session. 
Sen. Elaine Morgan, a Hopkinton Republican, was the sole senator to vote ‘no.’ Majority Leader Frank Ciccone was absent for the vote.
Zurier, a Providence Democrat, introduced the bill in May at the request of city officials. It mirrors legislation sponsored by Rep. Rebecca Kislak, a fellow Providence Democrat, that passed the House of Representatives in a floor vote on May 27. 
Both bills would authorize the last resort requested by Mayor Brett Smiley: Permission to increase the city’s total tax levy by 7.5% for fiscal year 2026, in hopes of balancing the city’s budget to fund a court-ordered school funding settlement from last November.
Without the General Assembly’s approval, the city would be limited to the 4% maximum increase typical under state law, and would be forced to revise its budget before the new fiscal year begins on July 1. Smiley released his budget in April. The Providence City Council, which also supports the levy increase, continues to work on the budgeting process for the year ahead.
The levy cap increase remains a foundational stone in the building of this year’s city budget, but it has not roused unanimous support among Providence delegates due to its expected impact on homeowners and renters. Smiley’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget would technically lower tax rates, but the city’s most recent cycle of property revaluations means that most residents would still see higher tax bills. According to the city’s estimates, single-family homes would see increases around 4%. But for two- to five-unit multifamily properties, tax increases could reach 16% for whether or not a property is occupied by its owner.
Kislak was able to garner support in the House from a few Providence reps, some of whom signed on as co-sponsors, despite opposition from other reps who live in the city. Zurier, meanwhile, had trouble finding co-sponsors for the bill in his chamber, and no other Providence senators signed on.
Providence is not the only municipality to request a levy hike above the state limit this year. Legislation to increase Little Compton’s total levy by a whopping 12% passed both chambers earlier this month, and was signed into law by Gov. Dan McKee on June 13. According to the Sakonnet Times, town officials asked to tweak the levy after finding a $1.5 million structural deficit in the proposed $18.9 million budget for the municipality. The levy still needs to go before a vote of the town’s Financial Town Meeting, scheduled to take place Tuesday at 7 p.m. 
The Senate bill now heads to the full chamber for a vote, likely to be taken up before the legislative session ends, possibly later this week or next week. Each chamber’s version of the bill needs to pass both chambers before the legislation can arrive on McKee’s desk.

The facility, previously planned for Vergennes, was supposed to be a more therapeutic replacement for Vermont’s scandal-plagued and shuttered Woodside Juvenile Rehabilitation Center.

Plans for the state to build a secure youth treatment facility are “on hold” after officials rescinded a proposal in Vergennes, according to the Vermont Department of Buildings and General Services. 
The news came a day after state leaders informed advocates for justice-involved youth and other stakeholders that Vermont would consider a variety of options in its effort to build a new facility, five years after the closure of the scandal-plagued Woodside Juvenile Rehabilitation Center.
“There were a lot of factors that went into the decision, including a statutory timeline. The plans are currently on hold as the State considers and evaluates options, whether in Vergennes or elsewhere,” Cole Barney, a Department of Buildings and General Services spokesperson wrote in an email.
The statutory timeline refers to a deadline for action by Vergennes on a zoning exemption request, according to Barney.
“It is a priority for both BGS and (the Vermont Department for Children and Families) to move forward in a way that will support the unique needs of Vermont youth in crisis, regardless of where it may be located. We appreciate the City of Vergennes’s consideration of our request to date,” he wrote. 
In 2024, the state announced plans to build the Green Mountain Youth Campus. Department for Children and Families leaders have said Vermont’s lack of a “secure facility for youth in crisis” has strained the state’s ability to care for juveniles, prompting the plans for the 14-bed facility in Vergennes. 
The program is intended as a more therapeutic successor to Woodside. At one point, the state considered increasing the size of the facility to house 18 and 19-year-olds in the criminal justice system, but ultimately scrapped that idea earlier this year.

The state has enlisted Sentinel Group, a for-profit organization, to help design the Vergennes location. The same company runs the temporary Red Clover Treatment Center in Middlesex, and its leader is connected to the nonprofit Vermont Permanency Initiative, which runs residential programs for youth in Bennington. Sentinel has received more than $10 million from the state for its work.
Officials at DCF did not respond to requests for comment on Monday and Tuesday.  
Now, the state is “taking a step back” and trying to figure out what to do next, Barney said in an interview. Officials are currently unsure where the new facility will be located or if there are other plans in store for the plot of land in Vergennes, he said. 
The state considered a spot in South Burlington in 2024 before moving forward in Vergennes — now they might consider that location again, Barney said. As the state looks for other sites, it plans to maintain its current building plan as much as possible, including the size and services currently proposed, he said. 
Barney said state officials appreciated that Vergennes considered its plan, but “a lot of not in our backyard advocacy” stood in the way, he said. 
In an interview Monday, Mark Koenig, the chair of a Vergennes committee negotiating with the state about the facility, said the city received a short email from Buildings and General Services Commissioner Wanda Minoli earlier this month “withdrawing” the state’s request for a zoning waiver to build the youth campus. 
But that zoning waiver, Koenig said, “wasn’t actually a legitimate request in the first place.”
To Koenig, the state’s decision to pull its request is just the most recent episode in a dysfunctional process.
Town officials documented their rocky relationship with the state over plans for the residential facility in a June 6 memo. 
“Since this process began, Vergennes’ concerns and requests have been dismissed or trivialized by State officials,” Koenig wrote in the memo. “We also note that, although the State says it needs this facility operational as soon as possible, State agencies have done very little over the past year to move it forward.”

At a press conference on the Statehouse steps, a small group of advocates called on the Republican governor to extend an executive order he signed earlier this spring – which allowed families with children and people with acute medical needs to remain in motel rooms. The order is set to expire June 30, and a spokesperson for Scott has indicated that he does not plan to continue it.
“Every one of the people being exited is in a category that the governor himself has deemed would struggle to survive outside,” said Brenda Siegel, executive director of End Homelessness Vermont. “These are people who are homebound, who require assistance from a wheelchair or walker to leave the house.”
Scott signed the executive order in late March, days before the motel program’s loosened winter rules were set to expire for the season. At the time, lawmakers had sought a three-month extension for everyone sheltered in motels to head off a mass-eviction. Scott, a frequent critic of the motel program’s cost and effectiveness, opposed their effort, twice vetoing a midyear spending bill over the disagreement.

But he then took executive action to extend stays for a narrow group of people, writing at the time that “we have an obligation to protect children and Vermonters who are most vulnerable.” The order granted three-month extensions for families with children, pregnant people in their third trimester, and people who met specific medical criteria, like requiring home-based nursing services or receiving active cancer treatment.
The order also stated that an 80-day cap on motel stays during the warmer months “shall be waived” between April and June for people sheltered in these priority groups “to allow time for DCF to ensure” they have access to services and supports needed to transition to a long-term housing, shelter or health care placement.
Many service providers interpreted that language to mean people sheltered under the executive order would not accrue days toward their 80-day limits, affording them more time in emergency housing after the order’s expiration. But the Department for Children and Families issued notices earlier this month saying the opposite. 
Advocates on Tuesday said the department’s move amounted to an abrupt change of course that has not allowed clients and service providers to adequately prepare.  
“We are in the midst of a housing crisis. There’s nowhere for people to go,” said Maryellen Griffin, a staff attorney with Vermont Legal Aid. “People will be camping in sidewalks, parks, river banks, empty lots.”
DCF officials said last week that 348 households currently housed under the order will reach the end of their eligibility period if they don’t transition out of the motel program beforehand. A spokesperson said officials had “intensified efforts” to support clients who were willing to accept the help, but declined to provide data on how many households they had helped ensure alternative accommodations for past June 30.
“The state has not made good on its promise to make sure that these months were used to make sure people could find long-term housing – in part because there is no long-term housing out there for many people,” Griffin said.
Advocates declined to answer a question about whether they planned to take legal action against the state. Instead, Griffin encouraged individuals facing an impending eviction from the program to appeal to the state’s Human Services Board. Multiple people have done so, Griffin said, though none of the cases have been decided yet.
The emergency housing program has been defined in the last several years by tightening eligibility requirements and waves of mass evictions, as Scott and Democratic leaders in the Legislature have battled over how best to wind down its pandemic-era expansion. All the while, Vermont’s homeless population has ballooned, more than tripling from pre-Covid levels.
The coming exodus in July comes days after Scott vetoed lawmakers’ most comprehensive attempt at reform, a bill that would have devolved the motel voucher program next year and given funding and decision-making power over emergency shelter to regional, private nonprofits. Scott contended the legislation would “not adequately reduce the size or cost” of the motel voucher program.
“The governor has presented no plan to end homelessness in Vermont,” Griffin said. “Abruptly turning people out of emergency housing without a short-term or a long-term plan for where people should go is cruel and fiscally irresponsible.”

(Photo courtesy Bureau of Land Management)Two wildfires burning north of Silver City have burned an area more than 80,000 acres, according to the latest updates, as state health officials warn of smoke impacts on respiratory health in the area. 
Also, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Tuesday afternoon issued an emergency declaration, which directs $750,000 in state money toward firefighting efforts. She also announced she’d secured federal help via a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant that will cover some costs for fires that threaten to become “major disasters.”
“I appreciate our federal partners for taking this threat seriously and for doing their part in supporting the responders who are working their hardest to protect the community,” Lujan Grisham said in a news release. 
The smoke advisory is in effect in Grant and Catron counties until at least Tuesday afternoon, according to health officials, with smoke reaching as far away as the Las Cruces area. The officials offered some tips here. 
The advisory comes as both fires burn in hot, dry conditions forecasted to last for several more days. Since Monday, both fires grew significantly, with the Trout Fire doubling in size from 12,000 acres to more than 24,000, and the Buck Fire about 30 miles north of it growing from 34,000 acres to more than 57,000. 
Both fires are now the biggest of this wildfire season in New Mexico. Forecasts for both note the drought conditions that aren’t expected to let up. 
“Crews are bracing for increased fire activity,” according to the team in charge of the Trout Fire. “And the public should expect the potential for additional changes to evacuation status.”
While evacuations have been ordered in the Trout Fire, no structures have been damaged or destroyed in either blaze. A detailed evacuation map can be found here. A shelter for evacuees has been set up by Red Cross New Mexico at the Grant County Business & Conference Center in Silver City.
Private ranches with structures are near the Buck Fire, but crews are taking steps to protect them, according to previous updates. The Trout Fire is burning a little more than 10 miles north of Silver City. 
The Buck Fire is 15% contained, according to the latest update. The Trout Fire is still 0% contained.

Todd Young in the Indiana Senate on Feb. 17, 2024. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A $1.5 million ad blitz is hitting conservative channels urging President Donald Trump and Sen. Todd Young not to kill clean energy tax credits as Congress debates a massive reconciliation bill. 
The coalition behind the ad, Built for America, launched this month with a $2 million campaign to sway Trump and his supporters to defend renewable energy tax credits established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. They are saturating conservative media platforms including Fox News, Truth Social and Rumble, as well as digital trucks looping the Capitol and Trump-friendly establishments. 
The ads shape the tax credits as essential to American manufacturing and national security. They warn that chopping the credits would cover over four million jobs and hand China a win.

“Trump’s country is booming. We’re building, hiring and winning in America, because energy tax credits put America first,” one of the ads said. 
Built for America is now expanding its reach by delivering new television ads in six states, including Indiana, aimed at pressuring Republican senators to keep the tax credits while they weigh in on the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Young has not taken a stance yet on the credits. 
“Senator Young continues to have conversations with his colleagues and stakeholders about improving the House-passed bill and addressing our nation’s debt and deficit challenges,” Communications Director Matt Lahr said. 
While some Republicans have labeled the billions in tax credits a “green new scam,” statistics reviewed by States Newsroom show the jobs and benefits would boost predominantly GOP-leaning states and congressional districts. Now the industry is already slowing amid Trump’s back-and-forth tariff policy and mixed messaging on energy and manufacturing.
The credits have bolstered the production of batteries and solar components in numerous states — top among them North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada, Illinois and Oklahoma, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.
The Senate draft of the bill was released Monday evening and continues to phase out tax credits associated with renewable energy. The bill extends tax credits for geothermal, hydropower and nuclear projects. 
“President Trump promised to bring jobs and manufacturing back to America’s left-behind communities, and that’s exactly what these credits are doing,” said Mitch Carmichael, executive director of Built for America. “This isn’t about climate politics. It’s about American strength, investment, and families getting back to work. That’s the America First legacy we’re fighting to protect.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/289144C6-E7A0-4A6F-8015-762B83130617-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-17 17:04:13.064414

Padilla blasts Trump 'path toward fascism' in LA immigration crackdown,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-sen-padilla-blasts-trump-path-toward-fascism-la-immigration-crackdown,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat who was forcibly removed from a press conference with the secretary of Homeland Security, said Tuesday that his home state is the testing ground for President Donald Trump’s push to deploy the military within the United States.Trump is using immigrants in the country without legal status as scapegoats to send in troops, said Padilla, who in a speech on the Senate floor choked up as he related how he was wrestled to the ground by law enforcement officials. “I refuse to let immigrants be political pawns on his path toward fascism,” Padilla said.It’s the first floor speech the senior senator from California has given since the highly publicized incident in Los Angeles last week. The Secret Service handcuffed Padilla after he tried to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who was defending to reporters Trump’s decision to send 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to LA.Trump sent in the troops following multi-day protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and against California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s wishes. An appeals court Tuesday is hearing arguments on a suit by California contending that the president unlawfully took control of the state National Guard.“He wants the spectacle,” Padilla said of the president. “To justify his undemocratic crackdown and his authoritarian power grab.”The LA protests were sparked after ICE targeted Home Depots, places where undocumented day laborers typically search for work, for immigration raids.Arrests, confrontationsThe Padilla incident, widely captured on video, was a stark escalation of the tensions between Democratic lawmakers and the administration over Trump’s drive to enact mass deportations.A Democratic House member from New Jersey is facing federal charges on allegations that she shoved immigration officials while protesting the opening of an immigrant detention center in Newark. And on Tuesday, in New York City, ICE officers arrested city comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander while he was escorting an immigrant to their hearing in immigration court, according to The Associated Press.In a statement to States Newsroom, DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said Lander “was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer.”“No one is above the law, and if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will face consequences,” McLaughlin said.The president late Sunday directed ICE to conduct immigration raids in New York, LA and Chicago, the nation’s three most populous cities, all led by elected Democrats in heavily Democratic states.""We will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets,” McLaughlin said.‘They opened the door for me’Padilla in his Senate remarks gave an account of the events that led to him being handcuffed and detained last week.On June 12, he had a meeting scheduled with General Gregory M. Guillot, commander of the U.S. Northern Command, to discuss the military presence in LA.Padilla, the top Democrat on a Judiciary panel that oversees DHS and immigration policy, said his meeting with the general was delayed because of a press briefing across the hall with Noem. Padilla said he has tried to speak with DHS because for weeks LA has “seen a disturbing pattern of increasingly extreme and cruel immigration enforcement operations targeting non-violent people at places of worship, at schools, in courthouses.”So Padilla said he asked to attend the press conference, and a National Guard member and an FBI agent escorted him inside.“They opened the door for me,” he said.As he listened, he said a comment from Noem compelled him to ask a question.“We are not going away,” Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, told the press. “We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialists and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into the city.”Padilla said her remarks struck him as “an un-American mission statement.""“That cannot be the mission of federal law enforcement and the United States military,” he said. “Are we truly prepared to live in a country where the president can deploy the armed forces to decide which duly elected governors and mayors should be allowed to lead their constituents?”   Padilla said before he could finish his question, he was physically removed and the National Guard member and FBI agent who escorted him in the room “stood by silently, knowing full well who I was.”As he recounted being handcuffed, Padilla paused, getting emotional.“I was forced to the ground, first on my knees, and then flat on my chest,” he said.Padilla said a flurry of questions went through his head as he was marched down a hallway, and as he kept asking why he was being detained: Where are they taking me? What will a city, already on the edge from being militarized, think when they see their U.S. senator being handcuffed just for trying to ask a question? What will my wife think? What will our boys think?“I also remember asking myself, if this aggressive escalation is the result of someone speaking up about the abuse and overreach of the Trump administration, was it really worth it?” Padilla asked. “If a United States senator becomes too afraid to speak up, how can we expect any other American to do the same?”Padilla-Noem meetingIn a statement, DHS, said that the Secret Service did not know Padilla was a U.S. senator, although video of the incident shows that Padilla stated that he was a member of the Senate.“I’m Sen. Alex Padilla and I have questions for the secretary,” he said as four federal law enforcement officers grabbed him and shoved him to the ground.Noem met with Padilla after he was handcuffed, his office told States Newsroom.“He raised concerns with the deployment of military forces and the needless escalation over the last week, among other issues,” according to his office. “And he voiced his frustration with the continued lack of response from this administration. It was a civil, brief meeting, but the Secretary did not provide any meaningful answers. The Senator was simply trying to do his job and seek answers for the people he represents in California.”U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested that the Senate take action against Padilla, such as a censure. Johnson criticized the senator's actions and accused him of charging at Noem, which Padilla is not seen doing in the multiple videos of the incident.“I'm not in that chamber, but I do think that it merits immediate attention by other colleagues over there,” the Louisiana Republican said. “I think that behavior, at a minimum, rises to the level of censure. I think there needs to be a message sent by the body as a whole.”Senate Democrats have coalesced their support around Padilla. During a Tuesday press conference, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Padilla for his speech on the Senate floor.“It was basically a strong plea for America to regain the gyroscope of democracy, which has led us forward for so many years and now we’re losing it,” the New York Democrat said. “It’s a wake-up call to all Americans.”Jennifer Shutt contributed to this report.",,,,2025-06-17 17:04:13.064414

Richard Blumenthal makes his latest pitch for the Kids Online Safety Act, some organizations still have reservations over what the bill could mean for LGBTQ+ youths and protected speech — and one of those groups is making the case from his home state of Connecticut.
A billboard truck drove around Hartford on Monday displaying messages criticizing Blumenthal’s push for KOSA, which aims to protect kids from the dangers of tech and social media. Against the backdrop of a pride flag, the billboard scrolled through posts on social media platform Bluesky and urged people to “tell him to stop betraying us.”
The digital rights group Fight for the Future, led by queer and transgender women, said they hired the billboard truck because they wanted to highlight how KOSA could censor and limit access to resources like gender-affirming care and reproductive health for vulnerable youths, particularly trans kids.
In response, the senator called the group a “pawn” of Big Tech, noting that he is still talking with LGBTQ+ groups about the way forward on the legislation.
The bill has undergone multiple revisions over the years to address their concerns, which led some groups, like GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign, to drop their opposition last year. But that hasn’t changed for all groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, which is still opposed.
Fight for the Future, which is part of a coalition of state-based LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights groups, said it focused its attention on Blumenthal compared to his co-sponsor, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., because of his work on such issues.
“We specifically want to bring attention to how the community is feeling about his involvement and his insistence on KOSA as the answer for some of the problems that folks have been talking about in Congress around kids’ safety and social media,” said Sarah Philips, who works on KOSA and free expression at Fight for the Future.
“For us, Blumenthal is a pressure point because he professes to be an ally to these communities, but we want to show how you actually have to have your policies reflect that in order to say so,” Philips added.
The rare pushback against Blumenthal on such an issue comes amid debate over the Kids Online Safety Act, which was reintroduced last month. The bill got another big show of support from Senate leadership in both parties and a new endorsement from Apple.
The senators made an 11th-hour push to get it over the line before the end of last year but fell short. KOSA overwhelmingly passed the Senate in a 91-3 vote last summer. A few months later, a House committee approved a different version of the bill, but it ultimately didn’t come up for a full vote in the House. Because the session ended, proponents need to start the process over.
KOSA aims to put in place stricter settings by allowing children and parents to disable addictive features like infinite scroll and autoplay, enable privacy settings and opt out of algorithmic recommendations. It also has a “duty of care” section to mitigate harm to children when using such platforms.
The bill also orders the creation of an 11-member council with appointments made by the president and leaders in both parties to include academic experts, researchers, parents, youth representatives and others who are well-versed in social media and online safety.
The duty of care section has been at the heart of concerns, though it has been revised and narrowed in newer iterations.
Platforms covered under the bill must “exercise reasonable care” in creating and implementing design features “to prevent and mitigate the following harms to minors where a reasonable and prudent person would agree that such harms were reasonably foreseeable.”
Some of those harms include eating disorders, substance use disorders, suicidal behaviors, and depressive and anxiety disorders with “objectively verifiable and clinically diagnosable symptoms” that relate to compulsive usage of the platform by a minor. Sexual exploitation and physical violence and online harassment that is “severe and pervasive” are also included.
In pushing companies to reduce harm to minors, the bill says a government entity cannot enforce it “based upon the viewpoint of users expressed by or through any speech, expression, or information protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.”
Blumenthal has said that the changes made to the duty of care section show that KOSA is “content neutral” and would not allow the Federal Trade Commission or state attorneys general to sue over content or speech.
Groups like Fight for the Future saw some initial positive developments, saying at the time the enforcement of attorneys general was “narrowed” to prevent politicization of content, as well as limiting the duty of care section to product design. But they have continued to ask Blumenthal to reconsider the duty of care framework on content. 
Philips pointed to the current push by some more conservative states over limiting online content. They see that as an indicator of how some in government may try to regulate what they deem inappropriate or controversial. And in turn, the group warned that companies may take down such information if they fear legal ramifications.
“It keeps the duty of care framework, which would make the enforcement so that the companies are held liable for user-generated content on their platforms. This framework does not work keeping information from marginalized communities safe because social media companies will always cover their own bottom line,” Philips said.

Parent-led organizations have been among the biggest supporters of KOSA. Advocates and parents who have attributed the deaths of their children to harmful content viewed on social media have come to Capitol Hill multiple times since 2022 to rally for the bill. Some teen and student groups have also come to Congress to ask for protections as they navigate the challenging landscape of social media.
“There is indisputable harm happening to children at an industrial scale — reaching literally millions of children,” Jonathan Haidt, social psychologist and author of The Anxious Generation, said in a statement after KOSA’s most recent reintroduction. “KOSA would begin to address those harms. Parents say this is the No. 1 issue, above school violence, drugs and bullying. Free speech protections are enshrined in explicit language in the bill. I look forward to lauding the efforts of all who see this bill through.”
At a Monday press conference on broadband affordability in East Hartford, Blumenthal was asked about the billboard truck circling his Hartford office.
“I’m not surprised by it, but people should know we talk directly and constantly to the LGBTQ community,” Blumenthal told reporters Monday. “We’re listening to suggestions they have about the legislation, and we’re going to continue to be in direct conversations with them.”
Fight for the Future “is essentially a pawn or a tool of the big business interests that oppose the legislation because they have a strong business self-interest in the dollars and cents they reap from toxic content aimed at kids,” he added.
The nonprofit gets individual donations but has also received large donations from tech companies like Yelp, DuckDuckGo and Pinterest. Philips pushed back on Blumenthal’s characterization, arguing that he speaks more with tech companies than Fight for the Future does.
Companies like Microsoft, Snap and X, formerly known as Twitter, have backed the bill for some time now. Apple was the most recent one to throw its support behind the legislation, which was announced during the reintroduction of the bill last month.
The bill’s revisions in December came in part from X CEO Linda Yaccarino, which led to an endorsement from X owner Elon Musk. That was before Musk became part of the Trump White House, but the bill also secured support from other allies of President Donald J. Trump.
But some of the LGBTQ+ and digital rights groups aren’t the only skeptics of what it could mean for free speech.
Some conservatives in the House have shared concerns on this front. When it was up for consideration last year, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.,  said he has seen some “great work” on KOSA but wants to address “whether it might lead to further censorship by the government of valid conservative voices, for example.” He indicated at the time a GOP-led Congress would keep working on online protections for minors next year.
“I think all of us, 100% of us, support the principle behind it. But you gotta get this one right when you’re dealing with the regulation of free speech. We are very optimistic that if it’s not done this year, that we can do that early next year with our Republican majorities,” Johnson said at a December press conference with House GOP leadership.
Now that KOSA is being considered in a different political environment — though they note that they were opposed to the bill during the Biden administration — critics are more worried about what it could mean for LGBTQ+ youths.
“That’s why LGBTQ youth who are fired up about KOSA and are so frustrated with him,” Philips said. “Because it felt dire last year and it feels unbelievably more dire now.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Truck_2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-17 17:04:13.064414

Legal challenge asks court to block the new universal voucher program, which already has nearly 4,000 applicants. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers forewarned of school voucher lawsuit as they debated program’s constitutionality appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s new universal school voucher program spurred intense debate during the 2025 Legislature, and a major sticking point among lawmakers and education officials was a belief that it violates the state’s constitution. 
“It’s clear as day that this bill is unconstitutional,” Rep. Karlee Provenza, D-Laramie, said during House floor debate. “We as a state will clearly lose when we are inevitably sued.”
Litigation seemed all but certain. Even those in favor of passing a law to give state funds to students for private or homeschool costs welcomed a court challenge. 
“There’s good constitutional arguments on both sides, and we’re only going to find out by trying it with a real-life case and seeing what the Wyoming courts will say,” Casper Republican Sen. Charlie Scott said during another debate. 
Those predictions became reality Friday, when Wyoming parents and the Wyoming Education Association filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act. 
The lawsuit asks the court to block the new universal voucher program, which roughly 3,800 students have applied for since the application opened on May 15. By doing so, it threatens to unravel a years-long effort to expand school choice in the state. 
That outcome also was forewarned during the session. Advocates of the state’s 2024 education savings account — an early iteration of the voucher program that was not universal but instead based on income qualifications — said expanding it too fast could result in the entire program getting scrapped.
“You gotta learn to walk before you run,” Rep. Cody Wiley, R-Rock Springs, a 2024 education savings account proponent, said during debate. Without a judicious process, he said, “we could kill this whole effort before it even gets off the ground.” 
A controversial expansion
The Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act represents a significant expansion of school choice in the state, offering families $7,000 per child annually for K-12 non-public-school costs like tuition or tutoring. The scholarship also offers money for pre-K costs, but only to income-qualified families at or below 250% of the federal poverty level.
It comes as a school-choice movement mounts nationwide, particularly among conservatives. 
Rep. Ocean Andrew, R-Laramie, who sponsored and championed the Steamboat Scholarship bill, called the state’s 2024 ESA program much too narrow. His 2025 bill, in its original form, made the program universal and dropped the preschool component, statewide assessments or similar nationwide tests for students and a requirement that providers be certified by the Department of Education.

The bill ignited one of the hottest debates of the recent session. It sparked a deluge of constituent feedback, according to lawmakers, both from supporters of school choice and from critics who called the measure an unconstitutional bill that will erode the quality of public education in the state. 
Lawmakers transformed it before it passed out of the Legislature; they brought 26 amendments, including 11 that passed. The final version reinstated the assessment requirements, the provider certification and the inclusion of pre-K, though families have to show income need to qualify for that portion. 
Many also urged the body to hold off and allow the existing ESA program to roll out and work out any bugs before changing it so drastically. Lawmakers asked what the rush was, given that Wyoming’s existing ESA program was only two months old. 
“I’m not quite sure why on this issue the Wyoming Senate feels the urgency to have the accelerator all the way to the floor, with no guardrails, going 100 miles an hour,” Sen. Bill Landen, R-Casper, said on the Senate floor. “That’s what it feels like we’re doing here.” 
In addition, lawmakers and others repeatedly questioned the constitutionality of the expanded program.
Sen. Chris Rothfuss, D-Laramie, was perhaps the most strident voice against the measure, which he asserted runs counter to the Wyoming Constitution. In particular, Article 7, Section 8, which reads: “Nor shall any portion of any public school fund ever be used to support or assist any private school, or any school, academy, seminary, college or other institution of learning controlled by any church or sectarian organization or religious denomination whatsoever.”

Rothfuss and others, like Rep. Steve Harshman, R-Casper, warned that its passage would be an invitation for the state to spend a great deal of resources in court. 
“We’re going to blow the ESA bill up for something that’s going to spend a lot of time in our third branch of government, and rightfully so,” Harshman said in reference to the courts.
Education is ‘paramount’ 
Nine parents of school-aged children and the Wyoming Education Association, which represents more than 6,000 of the state’s public school employees, filed the lawsuit Friday. Parents reside in counties across the state. Many have children who receive special education services through public school or are queer or non-binary.
The lawsuit argues the voucher program violates the Wyoming Constitution, which makes public education a paramount state commitment. The constitution’s education clause states, “the legislature shall provide for the establishment and maintenance of a complete and uniform system of public instruction.”
A previous Wyoming Supreme Court ruling on education funding “found that ‘education is a fundamental right’ in Wyoming, that ‘all aspects of the school finance system are subject to strict scrutiny,’ and that ‘any state action interfering with [the right to equal educational opportunity] must be closely examined before it can be said to pass constitutional muster,’” the lawsuit reads.
This voucher program, it asserts, does not pass that muster. That’s because “the state cannot circumvent those requirements by funding private education that is not uniform and that meets none of the required state constitutional standards for education.”
In addition, the program is unconstitutional because it violates constitutional language that allows the state to give public funds only for the necessary support of the poor, the lawsuit reads. Instead, it’s an example of “gratuitously funneling public funds to private individuals and entities, regardless of whether they are poor and regardless of whether that support is necessary.”

Parents who signed onto the case oppose the voucher plan due to the harmful impact it will have on their children, according to the lawsuit, “because private schools receiving voucher funding can refuse admission to children with disabilities … and are not required to provide special education services or comply with [individualized education programs].” They are also concerned that private schools can refuse to admit and educate children who identify as queer, transgender or non-binary.
The voucher program will also negatively impact funding at public schools the parents’ children attend, the lawsuit says. “As students leave the public school system using public funds provided through the Voucher Program, the public schools will lose funding under the Average Daily Member (‘ADM’) formula, thereby resulting in fewer resources available to educate and support the students remaining in public schools like [their] children. As long-time parents, teachers and educators, Plaintiffs have seen the impact of inadequate funding for public schools, which will only be exacerbated by a further loss of funding.”
The Wyoming Legislature has established standards and oversight concerning the nature and quality of education that Wyoming students receive in public schools. But there is no mechanism to authorize Wyoming’s Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder to ensure those same standards and quality are furnished through the voucher program, the lawsuit states.
“Despite charging the Superintendent with administering the Program, the statute explicitly deprives her of any authority to ensure students utilizing the program receive a quality education,” the lawsuit reads. “In effect, the Program is a black box: funds will go in, but except in isolated instances the state and the public will have no way to know what is coming out.”
Nothing in the statute, the lawsuit concludes, “prevents instruction from being perfunctory, or worse.”
What’s next
Applications for universal vouchers opened in May, and the Wyoming Department of Education intends to begin depositing voucher payments to registered families on July 1. Some 3,817 student applications had been submitted by Monday. 
Plaintiffs requested a preliminary injunction in this case. That would essentially halt the voucher program immediately while the court reaches a final decision. 
If that happens, it poses major questions about the fate of those 3,817 students. 
Outside of the lawsuit, issues have emerged over several aspects of the program due to legal ambiguity, according to WDE. Those include questions over the right of ESA students to participate in middle/junior high school activities, age eligibility and notification to school districts. Degenfelder plans to work with the Legislature to clarify those areas, according to the department.

The lawsuit comes on the heels of a significant court decision that resulted from another Wyoming Education Association lawsuit. The association filed suit in 2022 alleging the state violated its constitution by failing to adequately fund public schools and has withheld appropriate funding at the expense of educational excellence, safety and security. Eight school districts joined the lawsuit as intervenors to challenge the state.
Laramie County District Court Judge Peter Froelicher ruled in favor of plaintiffs in February and ordered the Legislature to fix a funding formula he determined to be impacting Wyoming children’s right to a proper education. 
Superintendent of Public Instruction Degenfelder accused the WEA of “left wing lawfare” in a Tuesday statement to WyoFile. Degenfelder was not surprised by Friday’s lawsuit, she said, but called the timing “deeply” troubling.
“To wait until two weeks before the [ESA] funds are to begin distribution to ask for an injunction is devastating to the nearly 4,000 Wyoming families that have signed up for the program and the many service providers that are counting on those families,” Degenfelder said. “This is reckless and our Wyoming children are the collateral damage.”

Mike Lee of Utah took down X posts Tuesday making an apparent connection between Gov. Tim Walz and the man accused of shooting two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, and blaming “Marxists” for the murders. The change comes after blowback from Sen. Tina Smith and her staffers as well as Democratic and Republican state representatives.
One X post said “Nightmare on Waltz Street,” with pictures of Boelter, who is accused of killing Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and shooting Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in the early morning hours of June 14. Boelter also went to the homes of two other state lawmakers that night; one house empty, and at the other, a police officer pulled up to the house shortly after Boelter arrived, so Boelter left.
Another post read, “This is what happens When Marxists don’t get their way,” with a picture of Boelter.
Misinformation about Boelter’s apparent connection to Walz has been circulating online since the murder. Walz reappointed Boelter to the Workforce Development Board after he was originally appointed by Gov. Mark Dayton, but Walz had no personal connection to Boelter. There have also been claims online that Boelter is a leftist, though his roommate told reporters that he is a Trump supporter.
The changes to Lee’s X feed come after a confrontation between Lee and Smith Monday at the U.S. Capitol.
“I wanted him to hear directly from me about how painful that was and how wrong that was,” Smith told the Star Tribune. Smith, who was a friend of Hortman’s, said Lee did not apologize during their conversation.
Ed Shelleby, Smith’s deputy chief of staff, sent an email to Lee’s staff condemning the senator’s posts.
“You exploited the murder of a lifetime public servant and her husband to post some sick burns about Democrats. Did you see this as an excellent opportunity to get likes and retweet? Have you absolutely no conscience? No decency?” a copy of the email obtained by Semafor said.
Several Minnesota Republicans also condemned Lee’s posts.
“I have tremendous respect for Senator Mike Lee, but it doesn’t mean he is immune from the base impulses social media incentivizes. People say stupid stuff on the internet all the time. The best they can do is admit they shouldn’t have and be better,” Rep. Nolan West, R-Blaine, wrote on X. He later responded to his post saying, “Respect rescinded.”
“This has nothing to do with Governor Walz,” Rep. Walter Hudson, R-Albertville, posted on X.
In separate press conferences Monday, both state and federal officials addressed the misinformation that has been circulating online about the assassination.
“As our community grieves, I encourage those out there seeking to create additional chaos to stop spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said.

Now, it’s fallen into disrepair, its brick building crumbling and overcome by plastic waste and graffiti. 
Putalamus “Tala” White, executive director of the Jackson Resource Center, has a vision for the space and what it could become for people who are experiencing homelessness. 
“Almost the entire street is 18 acres, and on this end is where the tiny homes are gonna be,” she said, pointing to an overgrown patch of weeds and debris. “Then on down, you got the rest of the campus.” 
This spot, supposedly the future home of The Junction, is the place where White intends to build a village of 80 tiny homes and a community hub. But the project has been delayed after White’s organization received less funding than it anticipated.

In 2021, the city of Jackson accepted just over $3 million in HOME Investment Partnerships – American Rescue Plan (HOME-ARP) Program funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Those funds are dedicated toward reducing homelessness. 
In September of 2023, the city published a request for proposals for the Safe Space: Safe Place tiny home development, a 30 unit pallet shelter village. Jackson Resource Center was the only respondent, said Melissa Payne, Director of Constituent Services and Communications. 
On February 13, 2024, the city allocated an amount “not to exceed $2.87 million” of those HOME-ARP funds to the Jackson Resource Center. 
But last month, the Jackson Resource Center received a memorandum of understanding from the city of Jackson for just over $1 million.
“Since approval, the City and JRC have worked with HUD to draft a compliant Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). However, JRC repeatedly altered its plans — doubling costs, expanding to 80 units, purchasing modular homes from China at significantly larger sizes, and proposing rental use—changes far beyond the scope of the original RFP, and created additional HUD compliance issues,” Payne said. “In May, the City offered JRC an MOU with $1,086,440 in funding and access to additional grants if needed. Despite this, JRC is now demanding a $2.5 million guarantee to begin the project.”
Jackson Resource Center issued a statement in response to “correct the record for the sake of public trust, our partners, and—most importantly—the hundreds of unhoused individuals in Jackson still waiting on relief.”
“…While the modular homes are comparable in cost to earlier models, it is the site infrastructure—sewer, water, electrical, environmental remediation, and ADA compliance – that represents most of the budget increase,” the statement reads. “These are unavoidable costs that have continued to rise over the past year and a half we’ve been waiting.”

Jackson Resource Center secured an additional award of $2 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas for a project involving 80 homes, hence the expansion from the original proposal, the statement said.
“This was a net gain for the City, not a deviation,” the statement reads.
White said JRC can’t make any movement on The Junction because the lender won’t disperse its funds until the city of Jackson does. 
“When we wrote that grant to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, it was as a subsidy to the original grant. So we can’t do everything that we proposed to do with the Federal Home Loan Bank until we have those funds as well.”
While the organization hasn’t received any of the city funding for the tiny home project so far, it has received over $350,000 from the city in the last two years for other programming, including workforce development and operation of its permanent supportive housing campus called Langley. 
Now, White said she’s waiting to meet with the city’s new administration and gain what she said are necessary funds to start work on the development.
“That’s where we are, hoping that after the new administration gets in office, we can sit down, have a conversation, and finally get this ball rolling,” she said.
The Junction, a multi-phase project, includes the tiny homes and the creation of a community complex complete with a pet kennel, a medical wing, a detox center, post office and a food court. White hopes that in creating The Junction, she’ll cultivate a safe space where people who are experiencing homelessness can have a place to thrive.
“Having all of those services right there in the community on the campus would assist in them changing their mindset,” she said. “We’ve got to come in and be able to give them the help they need to get back on the right track.”
The Junction project has many detractors in local government, some of whom said the creation of the tiny homes will lead to more homeless people in Jackson. Jackson’s city council was divided on the vote 4-3, with Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote, Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes and Ward 5 Councilman Vernon Hartley voting against the project.
 ”We need to have a program in the city with a coordinator that can coordinate with nonprofits to help manage this issue, but just to create 60 homes? That’s one more thing for other municipalities to do with the shuffling them off on Jackson, because now it’s like we got another program,” Hartley said in an interview with Mississippi Today back in February. “Build it and they will come. Build it and municipalities will send them to Jackson.” 
White said that she’s tried to have conversations with city leaders about the project, and a few have understood her vision. She points to unaffordable housing as one of the leading factors in Jackson’s homelessness statistics. 
“You say you don’t want the homeless in the community. You say we’re gonna bring more homeless people into the community, but they are already here and if we don’t give them somewhere to go and something productive to do to help, then it’s not gonna change,” she said.
According to the annual Point in Time Count, a national census of homeless populations, Mississippi has one of the lowest rates of homelessness, though some advocates have said the local count is likely artificially low. White agreed that in the downtown area, there may be close to 1,000 homeless individuals. 
“My biggest hope is that this campus will be a light in Jackson and that it will assist individuals that feel like they’ve been forgotten, and that it will assist the city as a whole in being able to bring more revenue to the city, so that we can be a thriving city so that we can take care of the least of these. We have to take care of the least of these,” White said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/11200835/Tala-White-Jackson-Resource-Center-1.jpg,,,2025-06-17 16:12:17.607842

(Photo by Edwin J. Torres | N.J. Governor’s Office)State legislators advanced legislation Monday that would establish an advisory commission to improve out-of-school-time programs in New Jersey. 
The bill aims to improve the quality of before-school, after-school, and summer programs, which supporters say provide relief for working families and enrichment for children during a pivotal developmental period. 
Supporters who testified before the Assembly’s education committee Monday said the bill would benefit working parents who need childcare.
Rob Casale, executive director of School Age Child Care and Camp at the YMCA Montclair, cited research associating high-quality programs with improved academic performance, engagement in learning, and social and emotional skills.
“These programs provide safe spaces that keep students actively engaged, reducing the likelihood of risky behaviors and fostering positive relationships with mentors and peers,” Casale said.
Paula White is executive director of JerseyCAN, an education policy advocacy group. She asked legislators to task the commission with establishing curriculum standards for out-of-school-time programs to ensure they align with what’s taught during the school day and don’t vary wildly from district to district.
“We have barely half of our third-grade students reading proficiently, and many schools in our state have single-digit proficiency,” White said. “The statistical evidence is that most of those children will never catch up, and we have to disrupt that trajectory.”
Under the bill, the commission would assess existing out-of-school-time programs, adopt statewide standards, review research and best practices, coordinate funding requirements and sources, and develop an action plan. The commission would be tasked with issuing a final report on its findings and recommendations to the governor and legislators within two years of its organizational meeting.
The committee unanimously passed the bill, which has been introduced but failed to pass in every legislative session since 2013. The bill now awaits votes in the Assembly and Senate appropriations committees.

The T-bone, a cut of beef taken from a cow’s short loin section near the spine, is officially the state steak after the Oregon House on Monday in a 50-2 vote passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 13. The Senate already passed the resolution, in a rare unanimous vote in March.
Rep. Bobby Levy, R-Echo, the bill’s chief sponsor, said the resolution represents Oregon’s rich agricultural heritage and cattle ranching that has been present in Oregon since 1824.
“We’re honoring the people behind the plate — the hard-working ranchers, processors and rural communities that make it possible,” she said. “Let’s take this moment to stand with rural Oregon. Let’s lift up an industry that’s fed us, employed us and shaped our state’s identity for generations.”

But why the T-bone and not the ribeye, which tastes better to some lawmakers?
The Oregon CattleWomen chose the T-bone because the Cascade Mountains split Oregon in the shape of a T-bone. And cattle and calves were Oregon’s second-leading agricultural commodity in 2023, when Oregon had half a million beef cows and 1.2 million cattle and calves — totaling a value of production of nearly $985 million across all 36 of the state’s counties, according to the Oregon Department of Agriculture.
The T-bone joins other state emblems, including the Chinook salmon as the state fish, the hazelnut as the state nut and milk as the state beverage. Most recently — and in a possible affront to Idaho — the potato beat out the onion to become Oregon’s official vegetable.
“Make no beef about it, today you do get to vote on the T-bone as the state steak, but in all sincerity, as you’re grilling this summer and enjoying time with family and friends, please remember ag, the cattle industry and what they do for the land and what they do for Oregon’s economy,” Rep. Mark Owens, R-Crane, told his House colleagues.
Lawmakers celebrated that 2023 designation by snacking on French fries provided by then-Rep. Janelle Bynum, now a member of Congress, who owned McDonald’s franchises at the time. On Monday, legislators chowed down on steaks grilled on a capitol patio for a “Meat and Greet.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma mental health department missed its first series of deadlines to provide improved competency restoration services. 
The Oklahoma Legislature approved the agency’s settling of a 2023 lawsuit that alleged the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services violated the rights of mostly indigent defendants who had been declared incompetent to stand trial by failing to provide timely court-ordered competency restoration treatment. 
The consent decree requires the agency to reform its competency evaluations and restoration treatment programs.
As part of the settlement, the department is required to make progress in its competency restoration services on a set timeline. The mental health department was supposed to meet 10 benchmarks by June 8. 
Seven benchmarks were not met. One was partially completed. One had an “unknown” status. Only one deadline was met. 
The consent decree is expected to cost between $26 million and $45 million over three to five years, depending on the agency’s ability to provide competency restoration services as required.  
“Interim Commissioner Slavonic began his tenure on June 9 and has made aligning the agency with the consent decree a top priority, including targeted restructuring to enhance implementation and oversight,” said Maria Chaverri, spokesperson for the mental health department, in a statement Tuesday. 
Former Commissioner Allie Friesen was removed by the Legislature May 29 because lawmakers had “lost confidence” in her ability to lead the department amid financial disarray. Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Retired Rear Admiral Gregory Slavonic as the interim commissioner. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXUnmet benchmarks included reevaluating those awaiting competency restoration, developing and implementing an approved strategic plan and creating a pilot in-jail restoration program at Tulsa County Jail.  
The report, dated June 13, found that at the end of May, 180 people were in custody awaiting competency restoration services with 135 people waiting for an initial evaluation. 
The only benchmark fully met, per the report, was creating and implementing a plan to require continued education for Oklahoma Forensic Center staff involved with carrying out the consent decree. Developing a triage screening protocol was a “partially” met benchmark.  
“Progress in implementing the Decree to date has been halting to date,” the report read. “The policy statements submitted by (the mental health department) in response to various June 8 deadlines provide a good start for implementation of the Decree. However, those statements do not constitute a true Plan, and (the department) needs to move rapidly and with urgency to create and implement the various plans required by the Decree. In our view, there is little evidence that steps taken to date have had a direct impact on the waitlist, though the triage process, new beds at (the Oklahoma Forensic Center), and better tracking of data by the (mental health department) Central Office should have a positive impact over time.” 
The consultants, who are charged with tracking the progress of the settlement, are supposed to provide biannual reports on progress made for the settlement. But they opted to write an interim report ahead of the scheduled date in July because of several changes involving the mental health department, including Friesen’s dismissal and Slavonic’s appointment as well as legislation passed involving the department this year. 
The Legislature passed two bills, House Bills 2785 and 2513, that concern the department and the consent decree. The first allows the director of the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services to oversee the mental health department’s finances and spending. The second measure charges an official with overseeing the implementation of the consent decree. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who was an advocate for the consent decree, said in a June 10 letter to Slavonic that he’s committed to helping the mental health department fulfill its mandates and offered assistance from his legal team. 
Drummond wrote that given Slavonic’s recent appointment, he should have the opportunity to comply with the settlement but any future failure would be met with “significant sanctions and penalties.”
“The agency must commit to a concerted effort to provide comprehensive and reliable data for a systematic reformation to be realized,” his letter read. “Otherwise, the consequences of (the mental health department’s) delayed restoration services will continue to compound to the detriment of the class and (the department).”
The attorney general said he met with Slavonic to outline the pressing issues and has great respect for the interim commissioner, but his office will be “watching closely,” he said Tuesday in a statement. 
There are no fines or fees associated with these missed benchmarks, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office said. 
The consultants for the consent decree are set to return to Oklahoma at the end of June, visiting the Oklahoma and Tulsa county jails as well as the Oklahoma Forensic Center.

Mike Lee is facing criticism from a number of Minnesota politicians after appearing to make a joke about the suspect accused of shooting two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, claiming it was the result of “Marxism.”
That outcry includes the chairman of the state’s Democratic Party, who called Lee “one of the most dishonorable senators in American history;” Minnesota Democrat Sens. Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar, who said the joke was inappropriate and “fuels this hatred and misinformation;”; Minnesota Rep. Kelly Morrison, also a Democrat, who said Lee’s comments represented “the watershed moment where things need to change;” and several state Republican lawmakers, who pushed back on Lee’s attempt to connect the alleged shooter to Democrats.
Vance Boelter was arrested Sunday night, suspected of the murder of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home. Boelter allegedly wounded state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in a separate shooting. Police say Boelter had a “hit list” of 45 Democrat elected officials. He’s facing several charges, including first-degree murder.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the shootings “an act of targeted political violence,” although police have yet to publicly announce Boelter’s motive.
Lee, who posts frequently on his personal X account, took to social media on Sunday, claiming Boelter has ties to Democrats and liberal politics.
“Nightmare on Waltz Street,” Lee wrote, attempting to connect Boelter to Walz, with his name misspelled. Lee’s post featured two images of Boelter, including one taken from the crime scene.
Boelter was initially appointed to a Workforce Development Council by former Democratic Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton in 2016, then reappointed in 2019 by Walz, according to the Minnesota Reformer.
“My plumber is connected to me and my wife. That doesn’t mean we have anything to do with his other activities,” wrote Minnesota state Rep. Walter Hudson, a Republican from Albertville, in a social media post, arguing “this has nothing to do with Governor Walz.”
Lee also made two other posts tying Boelter to “Marxism,” the political philosophy serving as the foundation for communism that’s often used by Trump-aligned conservatives to insult Democrats. That includes a post featuring the same image from the crime scene that read “This is what happens … When Marxists don’t get their way.”
Lee’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

Lee, a prolific poster, made the comments on Sunday morning around 9 a.m. on his personal account on X, where he is known to be more inflammatory.
Hours later, at 2:30 p.m., Lee posted from his official U.S. Senate account, where he typically takes a more measured tone, writing “These hateful attacks have no place in Utah, Minnesota, or anywhere in America.”
“Please join me in condemning this senseless violence, and praying for the victims and their families,” the post reads.
The Utah senator has since faced widespread backlash for his comments, including calls for his resignation. Critics have pointed out that Boelter was targeting Democrats, that his “hit list” included abortion clinics, and that his roommate told reporters Boelter was a Trump voter.
“Senator Lee’s heinous lies have only made the pain that Melissa’s loved ones and colleagues are going through even worse. Using Melissa’s murder to spread these lies is an act of evil that will cement his legacy as one of the most dishonorable senators in American history,” said Richard Carlbom, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party, in a statement to Utah News Dispatch.
Smith, the junior Minnesota senator, confronted Lee in Congress on Monday, telling him his comments were “brutal and cruel.”
“He should think about the implications of what he’s saying and doing. It just further fuels this hatred and misinformation,” she said, according to CNN. “I wanted him to hear from me directly how painful that was and how brutal that was to see that on what was just a horribly brutal weekend.”
Smith said Lee “didn’t say a lot. Frankly, I think he was a bit stunned. … He certainly didn’t promise to take it down or say anything publicly about it. … He seemed kind of surprised to be confronted.”
Speaking on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Monday, Klobuchar said she also plans to confront Lee.
“What I’m going to tell him is this isn’t funny what happened here. This is an incredible woman,” she said, adding that “there was no Father’s Day” for Hortman’s children.
“I’ll tell him about the law enforcement that did incredible work here,” Klobuchar continued. “That’s what I’m going to tell Sen. Lee when I get back to Washington today. Because this is not a laughing matter and certainly what we are seeing in increasing violence and this evil man who did this, this is not a joke.”
Morrison, a first term congresswoman, took to X on Monday accusing Lee of promoting “dangerous and harmful rhetoric we need everyone to call out and condemn.”
“This is the watershed moment where things need to change,” Morrison said, urging Democrats and Republicans to condemn Lee’s remarks.
“This was posted one day after my friend — one of Minnesota’s elected representatives — and her husband were assassinated in a politically-motivated attack. One day after another elected representative and his wife took 17 bullets from the assassin,” she said. “We cannot accept this from a sitting United States Senator.”
Minnesota state Rep. Nolan West, a Republican from Blaine, posted to X that he has “tremendous respect” for Lee.
“But it doesn’t mean he is immune from the base impulses social media incentivizes. People say stupid stuff on the internet all the time. The best they can do is admit they shouldn’t have and be better,” he wrote.
Speaking on the Senate floor Monday, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, said he was “deeply disappointed” in Lee, accusing him of taking “cheap political shots at the other side.” Lee’s comments, Schumer said, risk “escalating a perilous moment.”
“What the senior senator from Utah posted after the shooting was reckless and beneath the dignity of his office,” Schumer said. “For a senator to fan the flames of division with falsities while the killer was still on the loose is deeply irresponsible. He should take down his post immediately and apologize to the families of the victims.”

The Idaho State Board of Examiners voted unanimously to approve the request without any discussion during a meeting Tuesday morning at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.
Funding to not exceed $300,000 will come from the Governor’s Emergency Fund, which will be used to reimburse Idaho State Police personnel for providing transportation to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, detention centers.

Tuesday’s vote was significant because state officials said the first ICE transports could not begin until funding was approved. Now that funding has been approved, the transports to ICE detention facilities can begin.
 Idaho to participate in 287(g) immigration program

Little announced the new partnership between Idaho State Police and ICE on June 5. 
Idaho is participating in the jail enforcement model under the 287(g) program, which allows ICE to delegate specific immigration functions to state or local law enforcement agencies such as Idaho State Police, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Before Idaho State Police entered into a partnership with ICE, the Owyhee County Sheriff’s Office became the first agency in Idaho to partner with ICE, InvestigateWest reported. 
Trump directs ICE to target 3 big Democratic cities for raids

When the Idaho State Police partnership was announced earlier this month, state officials said they would only target and transport people who have been convicted of a crime in Idaho and are finishing their sentence or incarceration period. 
Instead of releasing those people back to the community when they complete their sentence, those individuals will be transported to an ICE detention center such as the Jefferson County Detention Center in Rigby, state officials said. 
Little said Idaho would target people convicted of violent crimes and felonies, as well as people who have been convicted of driving under the influence, which is a misdemeanor.
“Idaho is stepping up to help the Trump administration transport dangerous illegal alien criminals to ICE facilities instead of being released back into our communities,” Little said in a written statement June 5. “These are people who have committed crimes such as domestic violence, robbery, driving under the influence, and other dangerous activities that threaten Idaho families. Idaho has taken many steps to increase our coordination with the Trump administration in the enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws, and I want to further strengthen our state’s partnership with President Trump to help address the national emergency posed by years of reckless border policies under the Biden-Harris administration.” 
It was not immediately clear which specific people will be targeted and transported for deportation or how many people in Idaho will be processed for deportation. 
However, state officials said they will be able to transport “hundreds” of people under the ICE partnership.
 ICE in Idaho faces some pushback

However, during Saturday’s “No Kings Day” protest against President Donald Trump at the Idaho State Capitol, several public speakers and protestors spoke out against ICE raids and carried signs in opposition to ICE.
ACLU of Idaho officials have also spoken out against the new partnership between Idaho State Police and ICE.
“ICE and local law enforcement partnerships deteriorate trust, harm families, and can lead to constitutional violations,” ACLU of Idaho Executive Director Leo Morales said in a written statement June 5. “This new partnership will intimidate and cause real trauma to our immigrant community. Immigrants make our communities stronger, and they deserve to be treated with dignity. Nothing will ever change the fact that immigrants belong in Idaho.”
The new Idaho State Police/ICE partnership implements portions of House Bill 83, a Texas-syle immigration law that the ACLU of Idaho filed a lawsuit in opposition to.
Before announcing the new Idaho State Police/ICE partnership, Little issued an executive order calling for the state to continue collaborating with ICE and encouraging state agencies to assist with enforcing immigration laws. 
Immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States are a key part of Idaho’s economy and agriculture industry, according to a 2024 report from the University of Idaho’s McClure Center for Public Policy Research.
The Idaho dairy industry, which reports nearly $11 billion in total sales, says 90% of dairy jobs are held by Spanish-speaking workers who were not born in the U.S., many of whom do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The Idaho State Board of Examiners is made up of Idaho’s governor, attorney general and secretary of state, with the state controller serving as the secretary. The Idaho State Board of Examiners was created in the Idaho Constitution, and the board has the authority to “examine all claims against the state, except salaries or compensation of officers fixed by law …”

A wastewater detection does not change the official statewide case count in New Mexico, which remains at 81, with no confirmed cases in Luna County. The last confirmed and reported cases occurred in Lea and San Juan counties on May 27.
“This detection tells us there was at least one person infectious with measles in Deming on June 10 that has gone undiagnosed,” New Mexico Department of Health Epidemiologist Dr. Daniel Sosin said in a statement. “We expect that there may be more cases in Luna County in the coming days.”
The wastewater sample comes via a weekly state program testing wastewater in Albuquerque, Carlsbad, Chaparral, Deming, Las Cruces, Portales, Rincon, Rio Rancho, Roswell, Santa Fe and southern Doña Ana County.
Officials also announced a detection in Roswell last week.
Measles symptoms are often delayed by one to three weeks after exposure, and can be spread in the days before and after symptoms appear. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and the spotted red rash on the head and face, spreading down the body.
According to health officials, two doses of the measles vaccine remains the most effective protection against contracting and spreading the disease. If caught, the vaccine also lowers the severity of symptoms. Since Feb. 1, NMDOH reports that more than 36,000 New Mexicans have received a vaccine.
NMDOH officials urge anyone with symptoms to stay home to prevent further spread and contact the state’s helpline staffed with nurses at 1-833-796-8773 for questions about testing, treatment and vaccines.
The state’s measles webpage includes information on vaccine clinics and case counts.

Many inmates wait for months to be admitted to the Montana State Hospital for mental health treatment so they can stand trial.  (Photo by Aaron Bolton for KFF Health News). Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte vetoed several medical insurance and healthcare bills last week, including one that would have allowed first responders to get workers’ compensation for post-traumatic stress disorder.
Senate Bill 394, Senate Bill 422, House Bill 585 and House Bill 643 were all among a slate of vetoes last week.
SB 394, the post-traumatic stress disorder bill, essentially would have added the condition as eligible for workers’ compensation for firefighters, law enforcement and emergency medical technicians. 
The bill drew significant debate in the Legislature.
In his veto letter, Gianforte said it would have added $100,000 annually to state insurance premiums, which was also reflected in the bill’s fiscal note. He also wrote it was a “fundamental issue of fairness” as work-related PTSD claims would not be eligible for other state employees.
“Senate Bill 394 threatens the progress we’ve made over the past four years to protect hardworking Montanans’ tax dollars and decrease worker compensation coverage by reducing the number of wage-loss and medical-only claims filed,” the veto letter reads.
An attached letter from Department of Administration head Misty Ann Giles said the state could be subjecting the “state and employers to inequitable treatment,” though added that the DOA was “committed to supporting all first responders.”
Gianforte, a Republican, also vetoed two bills dealing specifically with medical insurance.
Senate Bill 422 would have required insurance providers in the individual or group market in the state to cover the cost of any Food and Drug Administration approved medication for terminal cancer.
A letter attached from Giles said the legislation would increase costs to the state insurance plan by $500,000 annually. The impact on the Montana University System would have been high too, and the bill was an unfunded mandate, Giles said.
Ali Bovingdon, chief legal counsel for the MUS, wrote in a letter attached to the veto the impact for fiscal year 2026 would be nearly a million dollars.
The bill could put “the financial stability of the entire MUS plan at risk,” Bovingdon wrote.
House Bill 585, meanwhile, dealt with reimbursement rates for physical, speech and occupational therapists at 122% of the Medicare reimbursement rates.
Gianforte wrote in the veto letter that while the bill was “well intentioned” it does not cover other providers like optometrists, psychologists and licensed professional counselors. There was also a price tag with the bill, coming in at about $13 million during the next four years.
Some clinics and organizations have already begun an effort to override the veto. The governor also noted budget challenges in his letter.
“The budget and other bills with hefty price tags that the Legislature passed, however, are not fiscally responsible,” Gianforte wrote. “Therefore, I will keenly review the budget and spending bills the Legislature passed, making some difficult decisions to protect taxpayers and their hard-earned resources. Hardworking Montanans expect us to be fiscally responsible.”
Gianforte also vetoed House Bill 643, which sought to change the payment structure for costs associated with the use of detention centers. 
The bill would have increased reimbursement for local governments holding prisoners for the State of Montana or the federal government. Gianforte wrote in his veto letter it would have cost Montana $24 million during the next four years and the $6 million appropriation the Legislature approved would not be enough to cover the bill’s cost.
The bill sought to address some behavioral health challenges, and the governor noted in his veto letter that the state is addressing waitlists at the Forensic Mental Health Facility in Galen. One issue for counties is that they’ve been forced to hold prisoners who are waiting for a bed at the Galen facility.
“This issue requires a permanent, comprehensive solution,” Gianforte wrote. “ But House Bill 643 only applies an expensive Band-Aid.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Flathead-County-Detention-Center_01-resized-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-17 15:12:25.951935

Next to the sign are boxes of hemp-derived beverages. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A proposed ban on hemp-derived THC beverages has morphed into a request for state regulators to recommend how to handle the products by next March, under a joint resolution that cleared the House Committee on Corporations in a 10-0 vote Monday.
The resolution sponsored by Rep. Scott Slater, a Providence Democrat, requests that the state’s Cannabis Control Commission come up with recommendations on dosage limits, packaging standards, labeling requirements, licensing conditions, and other ways to ensure children don’t accidentally consume the intoxicating drinks.
“One of the major reasons for passing the [2022] cannabis act was to have recreational [cannabis] safe and tested,” Slater said in an interview Monday.
Slater’s bill is scheduled for a vote by the full House chamber on Wednesday.
Hemp has been legal at the federal level since 2018 and, by itself, produces little to no THC (the compound most commonly associated with cannabis intoxication) content and is typically non-psychoactive when first harvested — unlike other cannabis plants. But with the magic of chemistry, delta-8 and delta-9 THC can be produced.
Delta-9 THC is a naturally-occurring cannabinoid within cannabis plants and often more potent than synthetic delta-8 products, which are unregulated.
THC drinks derived from hemp were illegal in Rhode Island until August 2024, when the state’s Office of Cannabis Regulation began allowing the sale of products containing low levels of delta-9 THC at licensed retailers, including vape shops and liquor stores.
Slater’s original legislation called on the state to ban hemp-derived THC beverages until regulators could craft new rules under the 2022 law that legalized recreational cannabis, a stance he said he still personally holds. But he said it’s important that state regulators collect data before further legislative action is taken.
Cannabis and liquor retailers at odds over proposed rules on hemp-derived THC beverage sales

Connecticut last July mandated THC-infused drinks only be available at state-licensed liquor stores and cannabis retailers. Massachusetts regulators, meanwhile, declared last May that intoxicating hemp-based products cannot be sold outside of cannabis retail stores.
Members of Rhode Island’s recreational cannabis industry for the most part have been against allowing THC products to be sold outside licensed pot shops. The liquor industry supports the legalization of hemp-derived drinks, but only if they’re sold from their stores.
Both sides made their stances clear when the House Committee on Corporations held its initial hearing on Slater’s bill May 15.
“THC belongs to the cannabis cultivator, not the liquor store,” Armand Lusi, owner of Evergreen Gardens in Warwick, told lawmakers.
But Nicholas Fede Jr., executive director for the Rhode Island Liquor Operators Collaborative, wrote to lawmakers that beverage alcohol retailers are “perfectly set up and equipped” to handle intoxicating drinks and that a number of stores already sell hemp-derived drinks with success.
“They are already trained to detect the effects of intoxicating substances when interacting with consumers and are specialists in regulating when and when not to serve clients,” he wrote.
Fede pointed to a separate bill sponsored by Rep. Jacquelyn Baginski, a Cranston Democrat, as the correct solution. Bagiski’s legislation would declare it legal for licensed distributors to sell beverages containing up to 5mg of delta-9 THC at liquor stores, bars, and restaurants. 
Her bill remains held for further study by the House Committee on Corporations, which held its initial hearing for the legislation on April 8. However, companion legislation by Sen. Robert Britto, an East Providence Democrat, is scheduled for a vote by the Senate Committee on Judiciary Wednesday afternoon — along with a proposed ban on assault-style weapons.
Should the General Assembly approve Slater’s resolution, state regulators intend to carry out lawmakers’ directive, Cannabis Control Commission spokesperson Charon Rose said in an email Monday.
“The commission is committed to ensuring public health, safety, and regulatory clarity in Rhode Island’s cannabis and hemp markets,” Rose wrote. “Any potential updates would follow a thoughtful and transparent process, with stakeholder input and public engagement.”

More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.

Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.

In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.











When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can't save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death.


– Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery, MetroHealth medical center, Cleveland



In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.

“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

Santiago/Getty Images)More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and children’s deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
South Carolina is among the 30 “most permissive” states.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.

In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens.
The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.

In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.


The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate.
The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access.
Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision.
South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who’s advocated for closing the so-called Charleston loophole that allowed the Charleston shooter to buy the gun he used in the massacre. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
Moore has also opposed permitless carry, which became law last year in South Carolina. During the 2023 debate on the legislation, he chastised his fellow legislators on the House floor, repeatedly saying, “Shame on y’all!”

And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said.
Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-17 18:59:05+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘One of the worst things I’ve ever seen’: Baby tests positive for meth following day in child care,Kate Royals,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/17/child-care-baby-positive-meth/,"The Mississippi Department of Health, which is responsible for regulating and licensing day care centers, fined Little Blessings $50 after the incident.","Marla Demita could hear the screams of her 9-month-old son as soon as she entered Little Blessings Daycare in Yazoo City. When she got to the room where he was kept, baby Dean was crying inconsolably – unusual behavior for him.
She said that most days, Dean “lights up” with a smile when he sees her. But on the afternoon of May 20, “it’s like he looked straight through me, like he didn’t know who I was.” 
The troubling behavior escalated that night. Demita shared a video with Mississippi Today that showed her husband Johnathon holding Dean while standing, bouncing up and down to try to comfort their child. But Dean screamed and thrashed from side to side. After a call with his pediatrician offered no solutions, the parents took Dean to the Children’s of Mississippi hospital in Jackson. 
Dean jerked his head from side to side and screamed the entire hour and a half drive from their home, another video shows.
A drug test administered at the hospital showed Dean had methamphetamine in his system. A doctor told Demita the baby had ingested the substance somewhere between noon and 4 p.m., she told Mississippi Today. Dean was at Little Blessings Daycare during that time.
The Mississippi Department of Health, which is responsible for regulating and licensing day care centers, fined Little Blessings $50 after the incident. The agency could not confirm the baby ingested methamphetamine while at day care, according to its investigative report.

The department cited Little Blessings because the center’s director, Lisa Martin, did not report what happened as required by agency regulations. Martin did not respond to questions for this article. 
Demita said the $50 fine felt like a “punch in the gut” after what happened to her son, who is now 10 months old.
She said he screamed as though in terrible pain from 7:45 p.m. on the day of the incident until 4 the next morning.
“And I’m not talking about fussy crying. I’m talking about blood curling screams,” Demita said. “It was one of the worst things I’ve ever seen.”
The Health Department did not respond to Mississippi Today’s detailed questions about the investigation into the incident and past allegations of abuse at Little Blessings. Two complaints filed with the agency in 2023 and 2024 accused workers and the director of “whooping” and hitting children and locking them in dark rooms.

Mississippi Today obtained the documents detailing the earlier allegations through a public records request. None are available on the Health Department’s public database, a tool parents can use to research a child care facility’s history. It is unclear why. 
The Health Department launched the database following a 2016 investigation by The Hechinger Report and The Clarion-Ledger found that, unlike other states, Mississippi had no such system. 
The agency submitted a statement to Mississippi Today by email calling what happened to Dean “distressing” to both the Demita family and others, and said it is coordinating with law enforcement and the state Department of Child Protection Services. 
“Consequently, the investigation and determination of abuse or neglect by a caregiver fall under the authority of those agencies,” the statement said. “Our goal is to ensure that children are safe in licensed childcare programs.”

When the Demitas arrived at the emergency room with Dean, the baby was inconsolable and “tachycardic,” or had an irregularly fast heart rhythm, records state. 
The medical staff thought he had a fracture and checked him for hair tourniquet – a painful condition that occurs when a piece of hair wraps tightly around a baby’s finger, toe or other body part, restricting blood flow. 
“Patient placed in C-collar. Patient cried for the upwards of 4 hours straight,” the records say. 
The hospital emergency room ran a battery of tests, including a drug screen. Dean’s initial screen came back positive for amphetamines.
A follow-up confirmation drug test, a more specific and accurate screen, was ordered. Demita received results of that test about a week later, which showed the baby tested positive for methamphetamine, a lab-made stimulant commonly known as crystal meth. The drug can cause paranoia, anxiety, rapid heart rate, irregular heartbeat or death. 
Dean stayed in the hospital about 12 hours. Before he was released, Marla and Johnathon Demita submitted to drug screens themselves, and medical records show those were negative. 
His mother said for the next week, Dean remained irritable and had little appetite. 
She has since pulled Dean out of day care altogether. He is an active and crawling baby, and he spends the day with Demita at a veterinary clinic where she is the office manager. She said it is stressful. 
“So, I’m having to do my everyday job and keep up with a child all day from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.,” she said. “He has to sit in a playpen 90% of the day.”

Day care’s corrective plan involves ‘shoe coverings’
The Health Department’s investigation consisted of interviews with the day care director and caregivers, according to records obtained by Mississippi Today. Two investigators with the  Health Department also noted they reviewed pictures of formula and breastmilk bottles in the facility refrigerator.
Notes showed the day care did not have cameras in the rooms, which surprised Yazoo City Police Department officers who came to the facility. 
The Little Blessings director, Martin, told health officials a police officer told her “it could be something as (sic) a someone coming into the classroom and has residue on their shoes,” Health Department records show. The director would be “purchasing shoe coverings for individuals” that enter and exit the infant room as part of its corrective plan approved by the agency, the records say. 
Health Department officials did not answer Mississippi Today’s questions about whether the agency reached out to the baby’s medical team, other parents of children at the facility or former employees of Little Blessings.
Demita said after she told the Health Department what happened to her son, she did not hear back from anyone at the agency.
Yazoo City Police Chief Terry Gann on June 11 said the investigation continues, but he had been unable to reach Demita. After Mississippi Today relayed Gann’s cell phone number to Demita, the two met the next day to discuss the case.
Gann was unaware of past allegations of abuse against the day care, and told Mississippi Today the day care was closed down. A photo taken of the facility on June 12 around 5 p.m. showed what appears to be parents picking up children.
Health Department records contain two complaints accusing the day care workers and director of abuse in 2023 and 2024. 
“They hit children on the hands and butts and grab them very roughly,” said a March 2023 complaint from a former employee of Little Blessings. 
Another complaint accused employees of locking children in dark rooms. The agency, after interviewing the employees and director, could not substantiate either complaint. 
However, video footage later received by the Health Department revealed a day care teacher threatening to bite a child, and Martin, the director, was heard referencing “the ones that do get spanked.” The documents do not specify whether the video footage was from the facility’s cameras or if someone submitted footage to the agency.
Martin did not respond to Mississippi Today’s questions about Demita’s son and past allegations against her and other employees of the day care, including one asking what she meant by her statement. 
The facility’s corrective action included holding a meeting with caregivers about not hitting or spanking children. The Health Department provided “technical assistance” to the day care on discipline and positive redirection, according to records. 
No fine or other action was administered, records show.

“I’m taking it day by day,” she said. “I know he won’t be going back to a day care.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12154233/3X0A4327.jpg,,,2025-06-17 15:12:25.951935

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said Monday that it had shared information leading to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest of a Utah college student, which unintentionally violated a Colorado state law prohibiting cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.
Caroline Dias Goncalves was stopped by a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy on Interstate 70 near Fruita on June 5. She was let go with a warning but was pulled over again a short time later near Grand Junction and detained by federal immigration enforcement.
The sheriff’s office said it had discovered that federal law enforcement officers have begun using information shared in a multi-agency “communications group” for the purposes of immigration enforcement.

“This use of information is contradictory to Colorado law and was initially intended for the purpose of reducing illegal drug trafficking in Colorado,” the statement said. “Unfortunately, it resulted in the later contact between ICE and Miss Dias Goncalves.”
The information was shared via the secure communications app Signal, to a group organized by Homeland Security Investigations, Molly Casey, public information officer for the sheriff’s office, told Newsline on Tuesday. HSI, a separate branch of the Department of Homeland Security, works closely with ICE to identify targets for enforcement operations.
A Colorado law passed in 2019 generally prohibits cooperation and information-sharing between local law enforcement agencies and federal immigration authorities.
“We would like to reiterate that we were unaware that the communication group was used for anything other than drug interdiction efforts and that we have since removed all Mesa County Sheriff’s Office members from the communication group,” the sheriff’s office added.
Dias Goncalves’ arrest was first reported last week by The Salt Lake Tribune. A nursing student at the University of Utah, she was born in Brazil and brought to the United States as a 7-year-old. She and her parents applied for asylum three years ago and subsequently received temporary work authorizations, driver’s licenses and Social Security numbers, the Tribune reported. She is being detained at the ICE facility in Aurora, operated by private prison firm GEO Group.

Body-worn camera footage released Monday shows Dias Goncalves was pulled over just after 1:30 p.m. on June 5 by Mesa County Sheriff’s Office Investigator Alexander Zwinck, who said she was driving too close to a tractor-trailer.
“Where are you from? You’ve got a little bit of an accent,” Zwinck said to Dias Goncalves shortly after telling her he would give her a warning.
“I’m from Utah,” she replied. After Zwinck asked if she was born and raised there, she said she was born in Brazil.
ICE’s Denver field office did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday on Dias Goncalves’ arrest or its use of the “communications group” for immigration enforcement.
Tensions over immigration enforcement have risen across the country in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s administration, seeking to fulfill its promised mass-deportation campaign, has ordered ICE to dramatically broaden the scope of its operations. Agents have undertaken high-profile raids at restaurants, farms and other workplaces following a directive from top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, and have begun arresting individuals and families outside federal immigration courts, reversing a longstanding policy that avoided such arrests so as not to deter immigrants from going through lawful court proceedings.
Contrary to claims by the Trump administration that its efforts are targeting violent criminals, the share of people held in ICE detention with no criminal record has risen sharply since January.

“Celebrating Pride is step one in the work we need to do to protect queer people and to make this world a safer, better place,” said Hannah Pearce, a farmer from Albany.

The Northeast Kingdom Rainbow Coalition is set to celebrate its third annual PrideFest on Sunday. While around 20 Pride events will be held around the state this year, the celebration in Newport is the only one of its kind in Vermont’s rural northeast corner.
Hannah Pearce, a queer farmer born and raised in Albany, attended the first PrideFest event in 2023.
“We know where the centerpoints of queer community are in Vermont; it’s not typically the Northeast Kingdom,” she said. “Just knowing that there was a PrideFest (in Newport) in which there were hundreds of people in the parade … just that alone, there’s value in that.”

Avi IC Ward, co-chair of the coalition, grew up in Montpelier and moved to Saint Johnsbury with their husband several years ago. Ward said they struggled to find community at first because the NEK is “so big and so spread out, it makes it particularly hard to find your people.”
Then Ward connected with the fledgling Rainbow Coalition and helped plan the first PrideFest. They said a lot of the people they have met through the LGBTQIA+ organization are now their closest friends.
“I feel really grateful to have found this group and be able to do this work,” they said.
NEK PrideFest features a one-mile parade through downtown Newport, set to begin at noon and concluding in Gardner Park. In the park, a festival is scheduled to run from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., featuring live music, speakers, vendors and activities.

“Celebrating Pride is step one in the work we need to do to protect queer people and to make this world a safer, better place, but it’s important because it’s joyful and also just the visibility of it is really important,” Pearce said.
Ward said the nonprofit Rainbow Coalition was created from two distinct groups: one focused on planning a Pride event in Newport and another focused on creating queer community in the Northeast Kingdom.
The coalition adopted both missions and tries to host a community event at least once a month — either in Saint Johnsbury or Newport — to play games, make art or just “be in community,” Ward said. The coalition also holds a Halloween dance party and craft fair event, has a peer support program and partners with groups on other events.
“For the most part, we’ve gotten a lot of support,” Ward said. “A lot of people are just really happy that a (LGBTQIA+) group exists here. … It’s just so amazing to have that space where people can feel really comfortable.”

Last fall, Pearce held an amateur drag contest and dance party in the barn at Hillside Farm — her pastured poultry operation — to benefit the Rainbow Coalition. She said around 200 people attended the event.
“Any services of support the Rainbow Coalition can provide to make this place feel safer, to take care of their peers and other queer folks, is something I want to support,” Pearce said. “And I’m happy to have a fun party to do that.”
The farmer said she grew up in a pretty progressive family and had many connections to the queer community before she came out at age 31, relatively late in life.
“I never had to grapple with what a lot of young queer people have to, especially ones in rural communities: I wasn’t affected by fear of not being able to live my life how I wanted to,” she said. “That’s a pretty big privilege.”
Pearce points to the 2022 murder of transgender woman Fern Feather — who also grew up in Albany — as a reason why having an event celebrating LGBTQ+ pride in the area is important. While attending a vigil for Feather in Morrisville, Pearce remembers thinking to herself about the NEK, that “this place creates queer people too, and it’s not just a place for us to leave.”
“There are so many queer people doing awesome things in the Northeast Kingdom, and that love living here; that want to be a part of a rural community and love all the things that make rural communities special,” she said.
The farmer said she finds it meaningful to serve as a model of a rural queer person living their life authentically and openly — something she did not often see growing up in the Northeast Kingdom in the ‘90s and 2000s.
For her part, Pearce said Hillside Farm has employed a lot of people over the past decade, and many of her long-term and best crew members have been young queer people. It’s gratifying to know she’s had success making her farm a place where “people of any background would feel welcome and accepted and valued,” she said.
“The truth is that we all are here to take care of each other,” Pearce said. “That’s one of the values of any good rural community, and queer people are part of that community.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee State University inked an operating agreement with the state Tuesday to bolster finances after nearly a year of upheaval over shortfalls.
Days after the TSU Board of Trustees approved a 6%  increase in tuition and fees for the next school year, TSU and state officials signed a memorandum of understanding allowing the university to use $96 million for operations over three years, money initially approved for campus maintenance. 
The agreement with the state’s Finance and Administration Office and the Comptroller’s Office puts into effect a state law enabling TSU to redirect unused capital funds for operations as long as it meets certain requirements. 
At the request of Gov. Bill Lee, the legislature approved $250 million for TSU three years ago for facility improvements at the historically Black college in North Nashville. The money could not be used for dormitory projects, even though the university has a campus housing shortage.
Under the new deal, TSU will use most of the money for operations and $55 million for campus projects, including electrical grids and new Food and Animal & Environmental Science buildings.
“It not only provides crucial cash flow to ensure the university’s financial sustainability but also allows us to invest in enriching the student experience and strengthening our capacity to attract both students and qualified employees,” interim President Dwayne Tucker said in a statement.

The State Building Commission approved a $43 million infusion into TSU’s operating budget last November to make payroll and prop up the university for the rest of the budget year. That included some of the capital funding allotted in 2022.
Tennessee Comptroller Jason Mumpower, who has been leading the state’s efforts to improve TSU’s financial standing, agreed with the 6% tuition and fee increase, which would raise costs by $270 per semester. 
Mumpower said he signed the agreement because he has confidence in TSU’s new leadership “and their ability to understand and navigate the institution’s challenges.”He has said repeatedly that TSU needs to set an enrollment figure and tuition rate that will help it “return to financial health.”
Last year, Mumpower went as far as to say TSU should sell the Avon Williams Campus in downtown Nashville and property at John Tune Airport to make ends meet. 
TSU officials disagreed with the proposal to sell property and under the direction of Tucker requested approval of $154 million remaining from a campus grant to keep operating. University officials wanted another $300 million in capital funding because a land grant university funding study determined the state shorted the university by $544 million over the course of a century. A subsequent federal study showed TSU was cut short by $2.1 billion over about 30 years.
Faced with a burgeoning enrollment, TSU was forced to make a last-minute request of the Building Commission three years ago to house students in hotels and a nearby church, which led to Senate hearings and a move to vacate the Board of Trustees and push former President Glenda Glover out of office.
The university ran into financial trouble after starting an aggressive scholarship program on the heels of the COVID pandemic to respond to student demand. TSU used $37 million from a federal grant to pay for scholarships when enrollment jumped to 8,026 in fall 2022 before it fell back to 7,254 in fall 2023. 
Once federal funds ran out, the university had to find other sources, such as $19.6 million in tornado insurance money. The university hit dire straits because of the increased cost of serving more students without enough revenue to balance increased expenses.
Glover stepped down last year, but the interim president who took her place – before Tucker – resigned in the fall when state leaders found out he signed two $800,000 consulting contracts with Glover.

City officials in 2023 threatened a journalist with civil and criminal penalties if he published the home address of a former police director he got through public records. The journalist challenged the city in court, and the New Jersey Supreme Court on June 17, 2025, sided with the city. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A state law that shields from public disclosure the addresses and phone numbers of police, prosecutors, and judges can be used to bar press from publishing that information, the New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously ruled Tuesday.
The high court found that New Brunswick could invoke the threat of civil and criminal sanctions against Charlie Kratovil, editor of New Brunswick Today, under a statute known as Daniel’s Law to bar him from publishing the address of the city’s police director. Kratovil discovered through public records in 2023 that Anthony Caputo, then the city’s police director, lived more than two hours south of New Brunswick and seldom attended public meetings.
“As applied to Kratovil, Daniel’s Law as written is narrowly tailored to achieve the state interest of the highest order: protection of certain public officials from harm and the threat of harm so that they can perform their public duties without fear of reprisal,” Justice Anne Patterson wrote for the court.
Tuesday’s ruling affirms lower court decisions in the case.
Three justices — Associate Justices Douglas Fasciale and John Hoffman and Chief Justice Stuart Rabner, who advocated for the passage of Daniel’s Law — did not participate in the decision. Appellate Division Judge Jack Sabatino joined the high court as a sixth member for the case.
New Brunswick officials sought to bar Kratovil, who was represented by the ACLU of New Jersey, from publishing Caputo’s address after he already had published a separate story noting Caputo’s residency in Cape May County.

The journalist had gleaned Caputo’s address from voter records obtained through an Open Public Records Act request.
Kratovil’s attorneys said city officials threatened him with civil or criminal penalties in a letter that cited the law, even though Caputo’s address was readily available online when Kratovil received the letter in May 2023. Such threats constituted an unconstitutional effort to chill protected speech, the attorneys said.
But state courts at all levels found the law did not unconstitutionally chill speech. The Supreme Court ruled the law’s purpose — to protect certain public employee from disclosures that may harm them — was a state interest of highest order that, per U.S. Supreme Court precedent, could justify curtailing speech rights.
Tuesday’s ruling is the latest to defend Daniel’s Law. The statute is named after Daniel Anderl, who was slain during a 2020 assassination attempt targeting his mother, U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas, at the family’s New Jersey home.
Unlike its federal counterpart, Daniel’s Law has no exception for disclosures made as part of news articles, editorials, or political speech.
“When the government provides information to the media, the U.S. Supreme Court instructs courts to assume that the government should use other tools to guard against the dissemination of that information and not take the extreme step of punishing truthful speech,” said Alex Shalom, an attorney for Kratovil. “We are disappointed that the New Jersey Supreme Court did not follow this precedent.”
Susan O’Connor, an attorney for New Brunswick, did not immediately return a request for comment.
The high court ruled the law was narrowly tailored enough to pass constitutional muster because it applies only to a limited group of current or former public employees, bars the publication of only their addresses and phone numbers, and threatens criminal and civil penalties only after an individual covered by the law provides notice invoking its protections.
“That strict notice requirement ensures that the statute is not a trap for the unwary,” Patterson wrote.
After receiving a Daniel’s Law notice, individuals have 10 business days to comply before facing sanctions.
Kratovil’s case drew interest from a bevy of law enforcement and civil rights groups, including the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, the County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey, and the State Troopers Fraternal Association of New Jersey, among others.
The suit did not seek to invalidate the law as a whole but asked to limit its scope as applied to reporters.
It’s not the only legal challenge to Daniel’s Law. Scores of data brokers facing suits from Atlas Data Privacy say 2023 amendments to Daniel’s Law that added mandatory monetary penalties for violations created a cottage industry for lawsuits.
Atlas has filed 178 suits to enforce the law since February 2024, according to state court records, and judges have dismissed some of them for lack of prosecution. Data brokers have charged the wave of lawsuits — including 143 filed that February and many on a single day — made compliance impossible.

(Photo via U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement)By one vote, the Maine House of Representatives passed a bill on Tuesday to restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement.
The bill now heads to the Senate, which is set to reconvene at 5 p.m. Tuesday, for an initial vote and will then need enactment votes in both chambers in order to get to the governor’s desk. The slim margin and nearly two hours of debate with dozens of legislators arguing for and against passage demonstrate that such a path is steep. 
Meanwhile, both chambers on Tuesday rejected a competing proposal that would prevent local agencies from adopting any policies that restrict them from assisting in such enforcement. 
During the House debate, Republican legislators argued restricting local police from collaborating with federal authorities on immigration matters would make Maine a “sanctuary state,” putting a target on Maine in light of President Donald Trump threatening to withhold federal funding from and conduct immigration raids in so-called sanctuary jurisdictions. 
Meanwhile, Democrats argued the bill would do no such thing. Rather, they said, adding such restrictions is necessary to ensure the rule of law is upheld since the Trump administration has violated legal norms and ignored court orders in a mass push to remove noncitizens.
LD 1971, the bill the House advanced, passed with a 74-73 vote. It would place restrictions on some immigration enforcement activities, but it is more limited in scope than originally proposed. 
Effort to restrict Maine police from carrying out federal immigration enforcement splits lawmakers

After law enforcement authorities raised concern about the proposal hindering federal partnerships that sometimes touch on some immigration issues, such as drug enforcement task forces, the amended version clarifies that only work done by local police for the primary purpose of immigration enforcement would be banned. 
“This bill does not prevent Maine law enforcement agencies from doing their job,” bill sponsor Rep. Deqa Dhalac (D-South Portland) said on the floor, pointing out that immigration enforcement is an authority generally reserved to federal authorities. “Instead, it provides clarity. Especially, it will ensure that Maine law enforcement can focus on their primary mission, safeguarding our communities and upholding the state laws.”
Consideration of these restrictions comes amid state and national scrutiny of immigration enforcement. 
Trump announced late Sunday that he was directing ICE officers to conduct immigration raids in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, the nation’s three most populous cities that are all led by elected Democrats in heavily Democratic states.
“I want ICE, Border Patrol, and our Great and Patriotic Law Enforcement Officers, to FOCUS on our crime ridden and deadly Inner Cities, and those places where Sanctuary Cities play such a big role,” Trump wrote on social media, referring to cities that don’t coordinate with federal immigration officials for civil enforcement.
The announcement escalates a week-long conflict in Los Angeles, where large protests started after immigration officials began arresting people at work sites across the city. Trump directed 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to L.A. amid the protests without California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s consent.

“I never imagined that I would be standing here questioning whether the state of Maine should regulate when and how our police officers interact with their federal counterparts,” Rep. Tavis Rock Hasenfus (D-Augusta) said on the floor. 
Hasenfus went on, “But nor could I have imagined that I’d be living in a country where federal agents would appear in our communities in unmarked vans and masks, executing orders without question, simply to meet arbitrary quotas. Nor did I imagine a time when our federal government would so routinely ignore lawful court orders instructing them to abide by basic constitutional principles.”
Pointing to other injustices in the nation’s history, Rep. Victoria Doudera (D-Camden) argued that some of the Trump administration’s actions are in line with that legacy. 
“I think it’s been all too American in our past,” Doudera said, “but I think it represents the worst of what America is and we need to stand up in this Legislature and be for the best that America has.”
Others praised the Trump administration on immigration enforcement. “We should not stand in their way when they come into our great state to do their job and arrest these criminals,” said Rep. Michael Soboleski (R-Phillips).
Soboleski is the sponsor of the immigration bill the Legislature rejected, LD 1656, which would prevent local agencies from adopting any policies that restrict them from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration law. After the House voted against passage 77-71, the Senate followed suit with a 20-14 vote against it.
“This legislation is a critical step towards ensuring that Maine remains a law-abiding partner with federal government particularly,” Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) said of LD 1656. “In the realm of immigration enforcement, the Trump administration has made it clear that states and localities that impede federal immigration enforcement risk losing significant federal funding.” 
Wells Police pauses ICE agreement in light of pending legislation that would ban it

In an executive order in late April, Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, a move a judge has since blocked. 
“I say this as someone who has often been critical of my party’s view on border security — this isn’t about border security anymore. It’s about cruelty,” Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn) said. 
Not all in the Democratic Party agreed. Rep. Dani O’Halloran (D-Brewer) argued, “Criminal networks do not stop at city or state lines, and neither should our collaboration as law enforcement agencies.”
But a violation of immigration law, the enforcement that LD 1971 seeks to ban, is a civil rather than criminal violation, Rep. Ellie Sato (D-Gorham) pointed out. 
Other legislators who voted against LD 1656 amplified concerns raised by the Maine Municipal Association during the bill’s public hearing that municipalities would be on the hook to pay for their local police taking on federal immigration enforcement work, expanding their legal risk with no compensation
“For me, that is also terribly concerning,” said Rep. Amy J. Roeder (D-Bangor).
Concerns about these costs have been raised by residents in the town of Wells, whose police force became the only in Maine to enter into an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under what’s called the 287(g) program.
After the 287(g) program was discontinued in 2012 due to the discovery of discriminatory practices such as racial profiling, Trump revived it to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants.
But Wells Police Department has since paused its agreement to see if the Legislature votes to ban such contracts. On Friday, Wells residents submitted a petition to their town manager with more than 900 signatures calling for the department to permanently terminate the agreement.
The Judiciary Committee opted to postpone until next year consideration of another bill, LD 1259, that seeks to explicitly prohibit these contracts, but LD 1971 would also have this effect.

Mike Lee of Utah took down X posts Tuesday making an apparent connection between Gov. Tim Walz and the man accused of shooting two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, and blaming “Marxists” for the murders. The change comes after blowback from Sen. Tina Smith and her staffers as well as Democratic and Republican state representatives. 
One X post said “Nightmare on Waltz Street,” with pictures of Boelter, who is accused of killing Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and shooting Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in the early morning hours of June 14. Boelter also went to the homes of two other state lawmakers that night; one house empty, and at the other, a police officer pulled up to the house shortly after Boelter arrived, so Boelter left.
Another post read, “This is what happens When Marxists don’t get their way,” with a picture of Boelter. 
Misinformation about Boelter’s apparent connection to Walz has been circulating online since the murder. Walz reappointed Boelter to the Workforce Development Board after he was originally appointed by Gov. Mark Dayton, but Walz had no personal connection to Boelter. There have also been claims online that Boelter is a leftist, though his roommate told reporters that he is a Trump supporter. 
The changes to Lee’s X feed come after a confrontation between Lee and Smith Monday at the U.S. Capitol. 
“I wanted him to hear directly from me about how painful that was and how wrong that was,” Smith told the Star Tribune. Smith, who was a friend of Hortman’s, said Lee did not apologize during their conversation. 
Ed Shelleby, Smith’s deputy chief of staff, sent an email to Lee’s staff condemning the senator’s posts. 
“You exploited the murder of a lifetime public servant and her husband to post some sick burns about Democrats. Did you see this as an excellent opportunity to get likes and retweet? Have you absolutely no conscience? No decency?” a copy of the email obtained by Semafor said. 
Several Minnesota Republicans also condemned Lee’s posts. 
“I have tremendous respect for Senator Mike Lee, but it doesn’t mean he is immune from the base impulses social media incentivizes. People say stupid stuff on the internet all the time. The best they can do is admit they shouldn’t have and be better,” Rep. Nolan West, R-Blaine, wrote on X. He later responded to his post saying, “Respect rescinded.” 
“This has nothing to do with Governor Walz,” Rep. Walter Hudson, R-Albertville, posted on X. 
In separate press conferences Monday, both state and federal officials addressed the misinformation that has been circulating online about the assassination.

Also seen are Florida TaxWatch's Dominic Calabro (center) and Jeff Kottkamp (right).A day after the Florida Legislature approved a $115.1 billion state budget, Florida TaxWatch released its annual “Turkey Watch Report” on Tuesday, identifying 242 projects totaling $416.1 million that its members believe Gov. Ron DeSantis should veto.
The Tallahassee nonprofit lists $800 million in additional projects that “merit extra scrutiny.”
Dominic Calabro, Florida TaxWatch’s longtime president and CEO, acknowledged at the beginning of a press conference held at the organization’s office that the 105 day-long session was “one of the most unique sessions” that he’s observed in more than four decades with the organization.
That’s primary because of the divisive battles between Gov. DeSantis and House Republicans, including Speaker Daniel Perez. But Calabro added that “a lot of very, very, good productive things were accomplished on the behalf of the hardworking taxpayers of Florida.”
One of those wins as far as TaxWatch goes was the elimination by lawmakers in the budget of the business rent tax, which is projected to reduce state revenues by nearly $905 million. Florida is the only state that has had such a tax.
TaxWatch officials define a budget turkey as a project that circumvents the regular review and selection process, such as appropriations inserted in the budget during conference committee meetings that originally did not appear in the final House or Senate budgets.
Appropriations that may have originally been in the House or Senate budgets that were initially removed by agreement in conference but ultimately listed back via “sprinkle” lists — goodies including member projects added late in the budget process — also qualify.
TaxWatch turkeys also tend to serve local areas and not the entire state, and “are often not core functions of state government” that would be more appropriately funded with local and private donors, said former Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, Florida TaxWatch’s executive vice president and general counsel.
Member projects
Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch’s senior vice president for research, said that while the 2025 legislative session was atypical in that it took more than 100 days to complete and actually reduces spending from existing levels, the budget continues to contain “a lot” of member projects, which are appropriations that individual lawmaker submits for their local districts.
The report says that the FY 2025-2026 budget includes more than 1,600 local member projects worth more than $2 billion. All told, House and Senate members submitted more than 5,100 project requests totaling $11.7 billion, an average of 32 projects per lawmaker.
The report lists 18 local parks (totaling $13.2 million) as turkeys because they didn’t go through the competitive grant programs administered by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, which allow local governments to apply for financial assistance to develop and/or acquire land for public outdoor recreational use.

The new budget, which will move to DeSantis desk for consideration (and potential vetoes), does nothing specific on property taxes — not yet, anyhow. The legislation passed on Monday night includes nearly $1 million for a study of property tax reduction proposals, and how they could affect local governments.
And a select House committee studying the potential for property taxes has already been meeting and will continue to do so throughout the year. The goal is likely to result in legislators approving a constitutional amendment on cutting property taxes going before the voters in November 2026.
Florida TaxWatch also intends to study the issue.
“We’ll be having a workgroup looking at different ways of offering structural changes for property tax reform that are fair, comport with our due process and equal protection under the law, and really are sustainable and something that we can afford over a long time period of time, and still respect the functions of supporting our local governments in their core functions of police, fire, healthcare, and other things like that,” Calabro said.
DeSantis is in Paris and has not immediately responded to the newly passed budget. He has just two weeks to sign it, but he also has line-item veto power. A year ago he vetoed nearly $1 billion in the state’s $116.5 billion state budget.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said Monday that it had shared information leading to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest of a Utah college student, which unintentionally violated a state law prohibiting cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.
Caroline Dias Goncalves was stopped by a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy on Interstate 70 near Fruita on June 5. She was let go with a warning but was pulled over again a short time later near Grand Junction and detained by federal immigration enforcement.
The sheriff’s office said it had discovered that federal law enforcement officers have begun using information shared in a multi-agency “communications group” for the purposes of immigration enforcement.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“This use of information is contradictory to Colorado law and was initially intended for the purpose of reducing illegal drug trafficking in Colorado,” the statement said. “Unfortunately, it resulted in the later contact between ICE and Miss Dias Goncalves.”
The information was shared via the secure communications app Signal, to a group organized by Homeland Security Investigations, Molly Casey, public information officer for the sheriff’s office, told Newsline on Tuesday. HSI, a separate branch of the Department of Homeland Security, works closely with ICE to identify targets for enforcement operations.
A Colorado law passed in 2019 generally prohibits cooperation and information-sharing between local law enforcement agencies and federal immigration authorities.
“We would like to reiterate that we were unaware that the communication group was used for anything other than drug interdiction efforts and that we have since removed all Mesa County Sheriff’s Office members from the communication group,” the sheriff’s office added.
Dias Goncalves’ arrest was first reported last week by the Salt Lake Tribune. A nursing student at the University of Utah, she was born in Brazil and brought to the United States as a 7-year-old. She and her parents applied for asylum three years ago and subsequently received temporary work authorizations, driver’s licenses and Social Security numbers, the Tribune reported. She is being detained at the ICE facility in Aurora, operated by private prison firm GEO Group.

Body-worn camera footage released Monday shows Dias Goncalves was pulled over just after 1:30 p.m. on June 5 by Mesa County Sheriff’s Office Investigator Alexander Zwinck, who said she was driving too close to a tractor-trailer.
“Where are you from? You’ve got a little bit of an accent,” Zwinck said to Dias Goncalves shortly after telling her he would give her a warning.
“I’m from Utah,” she replied. After Zwinck asked if she was born and raised there, she said she was born in Brazil.
ICE’s Denver field office did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday on Dias Goncalves’ arrest or its use of the “communications group” for immigration enforcement.
Tensions over immigration enforcement have risen across the country in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s administration, seeking to fulfill its promised mass-deportation campaign, has ordered ICE to dramatically broaden the scope of its operations. Agents have undertaken high-profile raids at restaurants, farms and other workplaces following a directive from top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, and have begun arresting individuals and families outside federal immigration courts, reversing a longstanding policy that avoided such arrests so as not to deter immigrants from going through lawful court proceedings.
Contrary to claims by the Trump administration that its efforts are targeting violent criminals, the share of people held in ICE detention with no criminal record has risen sharply since January.

Reid Rasner lost by 43 points in a U.S. Senate race and has offered few details in support of his multibillion-dollar bid, but has won over the Rushmore State’s governor.
The post Man who says he can move TikTok to South Dakota is a bust in Wyoming politics appeared first on WyoFile .","This article originally appeared on South Dakota Searchlight.
Excluding the money he loaned himself, Reid Rasner raised less than $35,000 for his failed attempt to unseat a U.S. senator last year.
This year, the 41-year-old Wyoming Republican says he’s assembled more than a million times that amount to buy the social media app TikTok and potentially move its operations to South Dakota.
South Dakotans following the story on his $47.45 billion bid since mid-April, through traditional media channels or on social media outlets like Instagram or TikTok, have likely seen the term “billionaire” attached to Rasner’s name. 
But his background offers no definitive proof to support that descriptor. Instead, disclosures filed during his Senate campaign show a self-employed financial adviser who owns some real estate, sells used goods on eBay for a sizable portion of his income, and is more than $1 million in debt due to a loan he received from a family trust.
Even so, he’s won over South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, who’s sung Rasner’s praises in press releases and television appearances.

Rhoden appeared with Rasner on May 23 at Dakota State University in Madison, where Rasner said South Dakota is the “front-runner” for the U.S. headquarters of TikTok. 
“South Dakota is lucky to have such a visionary governor,” Rasner said.
Meanwhile, the Cowboy State Daily news outlet in Wyoming reported earlier this month that Rasner “has maintained he would bring the company to Wyoming.” The outlet quoted Rasner saying, “I’m from Wyoming and have always championed Wyoming.”
Wyoming lawmaker calls effort ‘self-promotion’
TikTok’s Chinese parent company is under congressional order to sell the app or be banned from the United States, due to concerns about the Chinese government’s potential access to Americans’ data. President Donald Trump has delayed the ban and is encouraging a sale, while reportedly considering another extension beyond Thursday’s deadline.
Rumored or confirmed bidders include Oracle and Amazon, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.
South Dakota Searchlight messages sent to TikTok on its interactions with Rasner Media — or lack thereof — were not returned.
Rhoden and his lieutenant governor are the only high-level politicians in South Dakota so far to have publicly voiced support for Rasner, but some other officials outside of the political sphere have followed the governor’s lead. The Board of Regents, South Dakota Retailers Association, and South Dakota Chamber of Commerce and Industry have each endorsed Rasner’s vision.
Rasner has gathered less support for his TikTok bid in his home state. 
A spokesperson for Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon told South Dakota Searchlight that the governor wants to “respect the president’s deliberative process to procure the organization he feels is best-suited to operate the platform.”
John Bear, a Republican state lawmaker from Gillette and a leader of Wyoming’s Freedom Caucus, said he doesn’t think Rasner’s bid is legitimate.
“It seems to me that this is a publicity stunt, just like his last run for Senate was,” Bear said. “I went and listened to him speak one time, and I didn’t get a feel that he was doing anything other than self-promotion.”
Little information forthcoming on TikTok bid
Rasner calls his TikTok bid the most Trump-friendly, pointing to a post on Trump’s Truth Social as proof. In it, Trump, without offering any comment, shared a link to a story about Rasner from a site called JustTheNews.com with the headline “TikTok’s highest bidder is also its most Trumpian.”
Rasner Media, the company Rasner says will buy TikTok, was founded on Feb. 17, exactly one month after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law forcing the social media site to be sold. Two days later, the Rasner Media website announced the $47.45 billion bid. Rasner posted his first video to his personal TikTok account in early March.
His media company’s website posted a press release in mid-April headlined “South Dakota Leaders Back Rasner Media’s TikTok Deal, Urge Trump Administration Support.”
Rasner has disclosed little about who his investors are but said during his Madison visit that he’s lined up “more than” $50 billion.
He’s also still asking for money.
Rasner’s FoundersTok website — which recently still said an American TikTok would be headquartered in Wyoming — sells hats and T-shirts, and asks people to invest in advance of the sale at differing support levels. 
Pledge $12,000 a year, and you’ll be a “Founding Father” who gets content boosts, early access to new features, discounts on premium features and a blue verification badge.
“No payment will be requested until after Rasner Media acquires TikTok,” the site promises. 
Rasner Media has also issued a press release about a “major financial and strategic partnership” with Adaly, a company founded last year. 
The press release calls Adaly “a leading organizational intelligence platform.” But in reality, Adaly appears to be in its formative stage.
A January story from a publication called Marketing Brew said Adaly was “pitching to indie agencies and brands” and had raised $1.2 million in seed funding to launch its AI marketing venture.
When reached via text message, Adaly co-founder Kyle Csik did not respond to questions and referred South Dakota Searchlight back to the Rasner Media press release on the partnership.
Rasner Media also recently announced support for its TikTok bid from “a coalition of over 50 conservative content creators with a combined audience of more than 15.5 million followers” who say they’ve had their voices silenced on the platform. 
Neither the press release on the influencers’ support nor a TikTok video announcing it mentions a financial commitment from the influencers.
Questions about billionaire status
When asked in Madison about the gulf between his fundraising clout on the campaign trail and the multibillion-dollar offer he’s presented for TikTok, Rasner told South Dakota Searchlight that the bid is “business, not politics,” while declining to disclose details.
Earlier, in a mid-April phone interview, Rasner said, “it’s called ‘private equity’ for a reason.”
A press release on the Rasner Media website about Trump’s Truth Social post refers to Rasner as a “Wyoming billionaire,” and several media outlets have referred to him as a billionaire since. Dakota State University’s marketing office referred to him as a “Wyoming billionaire” in a press release on his visit to the school with Gov. Rhoden.
Rasner is not on the Forbes list of billionaires. 
When asked in April if he is a billionaire, Rasner told South Dakota Searchlight, “I guess you’ll have to get my financial statements.”
“Everything’s going to be disclosed soon, who the investors are and how much the investments are,” Rasner said. “I will certainly provide all of that very soon, as soon as we get the deal taken care of.”
The Select Committee on Ethics requires U.S. Senate candidates to file financial disclosure statements. In one of the reports he filed during his failed Senate campaign, Rasner reported $108,000 of self-employment income from Omnivest Financial, the company name under which he offers wealth management services. He reported earning another $70,000 through eBay, an auction site on which he sells goods such as vintage police badges, cowboy boots and aluminum beach chairs under the name “Omnisellers.”
Rasner’s disclosure forms also list commercial real estate, from which he collected between $15,001 and $50,000 in rent, a mutual fund worth less than $100,000 and unimproved land in Casper, Wyoming, worth less than $15,000.
Owes more than $1 million to a family trust
Rasner additionally disclosed a liability of between $1 million and $5 million, due to a loan he received from a family trust at a rate of 5% interest over a 20-year term. 
Meanwhile, his reports to the Federal Election Commission show that he loaned $1.2 million to his own Senate campaign.
A September letter from the commission to the Rasner campaign approved a request to terminate the 2024 campaign committee, but noted the campaign treasurer had failed to submit the required letter from Rasner signaling forgiveness of the loan.
The commission asked the campaign treasurer to submit the missing information. The information has yet to be filed.
Rasner’s Senate financial disclosures divulge little about the trust that loaned him the money, listing it only as a “family trust” in Casper. South Dakota Searchlight found public records of trusts registered under Rasner’s name and his mother’s name, but the values of the trusts are not public records. 
Both trusts are listed as owners of property in Natrona County, according to the county assessor’s office. 
The trust under Rasner’s name owns a dental office whose address appears on his Senate financial disclosures as his rental property. 
The trust under his mother’s name is listed as the owner of a handful of properties in the county. The properties include the building that once housed her former family business, Wyoming Glass, and properties owned by her deceased former husband, who was a gravel contractor.
South Dakota politicians skeptical
Multiple South Dakota state lawmakers either declined to speak on the record about Rasner, or did not return calls and texts seeking comment.
Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, said he’s unfamiliar with the details of the TikTok pitch from Rasner, but said he has his doubts. Efforts to bolster employment opportunities for Dakota State graduates who’ve developed and honed high-tech skillsets are welcome, he said, but he’d want to see a firmer business plan to be convinced the Rasner deal is a real opportunity.
“Until we see an actual plan and some actual investment, I’m not holding my breath,” Muckey said. 
Former longtime lawmaker Lee Schoenbeck, a Watertown Republican who retired as president pro tempore of the state Senate, told South Dakota Searchlight that his knowledge of Rasner’s TikTok bid is limited. Schoenbeck suggested that Rasner’s position as a maker of promises in the economic development sphere, however, is not a unique one in South Dakota history. 
He pointed to examples, including a hoped-for aquaculture facility in the city of Madison that received state assistance in 2019 but has never been constructed. While he can’t speak to Gov. Rhoden’s motivations or level of due diligence in the TikTok bid, Schoenbeck said economic development work requires a governor and his team to do the necessary homework to avoid too-good-to-be-true pitches.
“These kinds of people are all over,” Schoenbeck said.
Wyoming politicians ‘incredulous’ about Rasner claims
Rasner’s U.S. Senate campaign wasn’t his first run for public office. In the 2010s, he ran unsuccessfully for the Las Vegas City Council. He and his then-husband — they’ve since divorced — were living in the city at the time. Rasner sold real estate.
As an 18-year-old, Rasner ran unsuccessfully for city council in Casper, his hometown. 
His Senate campaign website’s biography says he “landed his first job sweeping floors at Wyoming Glass” at age 13 — without mentioning that the company was his family’s business — and that he began investing at age 16.
“These formative experiences laid the groundwork for his entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to financial independence,” the website reads.
Bear, the Wyoming state lawmaker, said he hasn’t spent time looking into Rasner’s background because “he was never a serious candidate.”
In the U.S. Senate primary last year, Rasner presented himself as the most conservative option on the ballot. He said incumbent Republican Sen. John Barrasso wasn’t a strong enough supporter of Donald Trump.
Trump endorsed Barrasso, and Rasner lost by 43 points.

On the way to his Senate primary loss, Rasner was served a cease-and-desist letter by Wyoming Republican U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman. The letter asked that he remove photos he’d taken with her from his campaign social media sites, because, according to Hageman, the photos erroneously suggested she’d endorsed him. Rasner told the Cowboy State Daily it was an attempt to stifle his free speech.
A representative from Hageman’s office did not respond to Searchlight requests for comment. Barrasso’s office also did not respond.
Bryan Miller was recently elected chairman of the Wyoming Republican Party, and said he couldn’t comment for the party. That said, he personally was “not impressed” with Rasner during their interactions last year, when Miller led the Sheridan County GOP.
Miller said he asked Rasner who was funding his U.S. Senate campaign, but Rasner wouldn’t tell him.
“I said, ‘Well, because you can’t tell me, you’re not likely to ever get my personal support, or anyone else I know’s support, because we want to know where money comes from,’” Miller said.
The situation with the Hageman photograph turned Miller off, as well.
“The thing he did with Harriet, trying to get pictures, he tried to do that with me at the state convention, but I wouldn’t do it,” Miller said.
From where Democratic state Rep. Mike Yin sits, it appeared that the opposition party got “annoyed” with Rasner’s efforts on social media. 
Yin said a lot of people in Wyoming were “utterly incredulous” when Rasner first announced his TikTok bid, especially after he raised so little for his U.S. Senate campaign from sources beyond his family.
“So the idea that he could convince people to give $50 billion?” Yin said. “It seems like he’s trying to raise his own profile.”
Rasner hasn’t announced his intention to challenge Wyoming’s other Republican U.S. senator, Cynthia Lummis, in 2026. Rasner has created a new fundraising committee, though, and loaned it a little more than $48,000. His disclosure forms identify it as a U.S. Senate campaign committee.
South Dakota comes along for the ride
It’s unclear how much South Dakota’s governor knows about Rasner. 
Rhoden’s spokesperson, Josie Harms, confirmed that Rasner reached out to South Dakota first, not the other way around, about the TikTok bid. Rasner told South Dakota Searchlight he’d done outreach with governors from all the surrounding states.
Rhoden has since appeared on news segments with Rasner, which Rhoden has shared on his own X (formerly Twitter) page. After the press conference at Dakota State University, Rhoden said on The Scouting Report podcast that Rasner’s team is “ready to go,” but that South Dakota may need to offer incentives to data centers if it hopes to land technology companies.
Lawmakers rejected a bill that would have offered tax breaks to data centers during this winter’s session of the South Dakota Legislature. Rhoden could offer assistance in other ways without needing legislative approval, such as offering a grant or loan from the Future Fund for economic development, which is under the governor’s control.
Among Rasner’s other supporters, the Retailers Association and Chamber offered their support at the same time as Rhoden first did, in mid-April. Nathan Lukkes, head of the state Board of Regents, sent a letter of support for the Rasner bid just over a week later.
“We are ready to position South Dakota as the launchpad for the next generation of secure, ethical, and impactful digital media,” the letter reads.
David Owen, president of the South Dakota Chamber, told South Dakota Searchlight he got a call from Joe Fiala, deputy director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, shortly before the first press release mentioning South Dakota was issued by Rasner Media.
“It was, ‘Here’s an opportunity. You’ve got 12 hours,’” Owen said.
Owen said his organization had nothing to lose. 
“What’s your risk by suggesting publicly it would be a good thing?” he said. “And if it doesn’t come about, what are you out?” 
Northern State University Government Professor Jon Schaff said there could be reputational damage to the governor “if Rasner turns out to be something of an empty suit.”
“To the extent they are depicting themselves as partners rather than mere supporters-encouragers, yes, there is potential backlash,” Schaff said.
Rhoden’s spokesperson, Harms, declined to comment about Rasner’s financial disclosures, political aspirations and TikTok investors.
Rasner declined to respond directly to a dozen questions on his companies, political ambitions, investors and personal life. He sent a statement through a spokesperson that accused South Dakota Searchlight of approaching this story with a “tone and accusatory nature” that is “completely unprofessional.”
“Your biased attacks will not deter Rasner Media’s mission to free TikTok from Chinese control,” the statement said, in part.


Reid Rasner statement
In response to a dozen questions from South Dakota Searchlight about his finances, his bid for TikTok and other topics, a representative of Reid Rasner sent an emailed statement.
Here is that statement in full:

“While we respect the media’s role and have cooperated with credible outlets, the tone and accusatory nature of your questions toward Mr. Rasner are completely unprofessional. Rasner Media’s TikTok acquisition efforts are a business transaction, not a political campaign. Mr. Rasner is unapologetically one of the most pro-Trump, MAGA businessmen in America, dedicated to protecting conservative voices on platforms like TikTok. This has naturally drawn opposition from Communist China and parts of the Democrat machine, including outlets like yours. Your biased attacks will not deter Rasner Media’s mission to free TikTok from Chinese control, support President Trump’s efforts to establish a United States sovereign wealth fund, and protect conservative influencers who are being censored by foreign adversaries and woke leftists behind keyboards.”

Gabe Vasquez, who in May launched a bipartisan public lands caucus, decries new GOP efforts to sell off public lands.","U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, the Democrat representing New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District, held a news conference June 17, 2025 in Las Cruces to denounce new GOP efforts to sell off public lands. (Leah Romero for Source NM)U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) condemned a second Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of federal public lands in New Mexico and other western states, citing the benefits of outdoor space to community, culture and youth.
“Our public lands are under attack,” Vasquez said during a news conference Tuesday at the Organ-Mountains Desert Peaks La Cueva Groupsite. “But we will stand strong, and together, we will win.”
U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-U.T.) introduced an amendment to the Trump administration’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” last week that would require the U.S. Department of the Interior and Department of Agriculture to sell off .5 to .75% of the public lands they manage under the Bureau of Land Management and National Forest System. This translates to between 2.2 and 3.3 million acres of public lands. 
GOP bill makes 14 million acres of public land in NM ‘eligible’ for sale, according to new analysis

However, three New Mexico national monuments were identified in April as possible candidates for losing protected status, including Organ Mountain-Desert Peaks in Las Cruces, Rio Grande del Norte in Embudo and Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks in Cochiti Pueblo. 
Lee’s amendment, which states the sold public land will be used for housing development and “associated community needs,” comes after a similar effort in the U.S. House of Representatives was thwarted a few weeks ago. 
“It’s like a bad dream that’s come back to haunt us, and we won’t stand idly by as the wealthiest in this nation seek to make a quick buck and destroy the lands and experiences that are sacred to all Americans,” Vasquez, who in May launched a bipartisan public lands caucus, said. “It’s this administration’s desperate hunger to feed millionaires and billionaires with endless wealth at the expense of lands that belong to we, the people.”
Vasquez added that he led “hundreds of young people” on hikes within the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument before he became a congressman, helping children experience and learn “about the natural world and about the history of this land.” 
State Sen. Carrie Hamblen (D-Las Cruces), CEO of the Las Cruces Green Chamber of Commerce, noted during the news conference that visitation to the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks monument supported 305 jobs in 2022 and contributed nearly $13 million in taxes to the state government over the past decade. 
Executive Director of Friends of the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks Patrick Nolan said Tuesday that the monument is “the site of family gatherings, celebrations of life, weddings,” as well as an introduction to the outdoors for young New Mexicans. 
“These places help bring us together as a community. They help gather, they help build connections and they’re special. And the idea that we can sell these places off to the highest bidder, I think, is a grave mistake,” Nolan said. “These places hold the history of our indigenous brothers and sisters.  They hold the history of our culture, of our people and the uniqueness that is New Mexico.”
Centennial High School Senior Gavin Elfman added that and his fellow outdoors club members and other young people in Las Cruces enjoy hiking, biking and camping on the monument. He said the misconception of there not being anything to do in Las Cruces is “extremely wrong. When we have a monument like this, there’s literally always something to do.”
Vasquez encouraged the Trump administration and his Republican colleagues to look to President Teddy Roosevelt’s stance on public lands, rather than remove protections and sell acreage.
“If the president and his administration is intent on making this a partisan land grab, then I suggest that he take a page out of Teddy Roosevelt’s book – a Republican president singlehandedly responsible for creating the largest system of the majority of protected public lands that we enjoy today,” Vasquez said. “We’ve said it too many times already:  Our public lands are not for sale. Not now, and not ever.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/vasquezlands1-1024x683.png,,,2025-06-17 15:12:25.951935

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Excluding the money he loaned himself, Reid Rasner raised less than $35,000 for his failed attempt to unseat a U.S. senator last year.
This year, the 41-year-old Wyoming Republican says he’s assembled more than a million times that amount to buy the social media app TikTok and potentially move its operations to South Dakota.
South Dakotans following the story on his $47.45 billion bid since mid-April, through traditional media channels or on social media outlets like Instagram or TikTok, have likely seen the term “billionaire” attached to Rasner’s name.
But his background offers no definitive proof to support that descriptor. Instead, disclosures filed during his Senate campaign show a self-employed financial adviser who owns some real estate, sells used goods on eBay for a sizable portion of his income, and is more than $1 million in debt due to a loan he received from a family trust.
Even so, he’s won over South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, who’s sung Rasner’s praises in press releases and television appearances.
Rhoden appeared with Rasner on May 23 at Dakota State University in Madison, where Rasner said South Dakota is the “front-runner” for the U.S. headquarters of TikTok.
“South Dakota is lucky to have such a visionary governor,” Rasner said.
Meanwhile, the Cowboy State Daily news outlet in Wyoming reported earlier this month that Rasner “has maintained he would bring the company to Wyoming.” The outlet quoted Rasner saying “I’m from Wyoming and have always championed Wyoming.”
  Wyoming lawmaker calls effort ‘self-promotion’ 

TikTok’s Chinese parent company is under congressional order to sell the app or be banned from the United States, due to concerns about the Chinese government’s potential access to Americans’ data. President Donald Trump has delayed the ban and is encouraging a sale, while reportedly considering another extension beyond Thursday’s deadline.
Rumored or confirmed bidders include Oracle and Amazon, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian.
South Dakota Searchlight messages sent to TikTok on its interactions with Rasner Media — or lack thereof — were not returned.

Yin said a lot of people in Wyoming were “utterly incredulous” when Rasner first announced his TikTok bid, especially after he raised so little for his U.S. Senate campaign from sources beyond his family.
“So the idea that he could convince people to give $50 billion?” Yin said. “It seems like he’s trying to raise his own profile.”
Rasner hasn’t announced his intention to challenge Wyoming’s other Republican U.S. senator, Cynthia Lummis, in 2026. Rasner has created a new fundraising committee, though, and loaned it a little more than $48,000. His disclosure forms identify it as a U.S. Senate campaign committee.
  South Dakota comes along for the ride 

It’s unclear how much South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden knows about Rasner.
Rhoden’s spokesperson, Josie Harms, confirmed that Rasner reached out to South Dakota first, not the other way around, about the TikTok bid. Rasner told South Dakota Searchlight he’d done outreach with governors from all the surrounding states.

Rhoden has since appeared on news segments with Rasner, which Rhoden has shared on his own X (formerly Twitter) page. After the press conference at Dakota State University, Rhoden said on The Scouting Report podcast that Rasner’s team is “ready to go,” but that South Dakota may need to offer incentives to data centers if it hopes to land technology companies.
Lawmakers rejected a bill that would have offered tax breaks to data centers during this winter’s session of the South Dakota Legislature. Rhoden could offer assistance in other ways without needing legislative approval, such as offering a grant or loan from the Future Fund for economic development, which is under the governor’s control.
Among Rasner’s other supporters, the Retailers Association and Chamber offered their support at the same time as Rhoden first did, in mid-April. Nathan Lukkes, head of the state Board of Regents, sent a letter of support for the Rasner bid just over a week later.
“We are ready to position South Dakota as the launchpad for the next generation of secure, ethical, and impactful digital media,” the letter reads.
David Owen, president of the South Dakota Chamber, told South Dakota Searchlight he got a call from Joe Fiala, deputy director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, shortly before the first press release mentioning South Dakota was issued by Rasner Media.
“It was, ‘Here’s an opportunity. You’ve got 12 hours,’” Owen said.
Owen said his organization had nothing to lose.
“What’s your risk by suggesting publicly it would be a good thing?” he said. “And if it doesn’t come about, what are you out?”
Northern State University Government Professor Jon Schaff said there could be reputational damage to the governor “if Rasner turns out to be something of an empty suit.”
“To the extent they are depicting themselves as partners rather than mere supporters-encouragers, yes, there is potential backlash,” Schaff said.
Rhoden’s spokesperson, Harms, declined to comment about Rasner’s financial disclosures, political aspirations and TikTok investors.
Rasner declined to respond directly to a dozen questions on his companies, political ambitions, investors and personal life. He sent a statement through a spokesperson that accused South Dakota Searchlight of approaching this story with a “tone and accusatory nature” that is “completely unprofessional.”
“Your biased attacks will not deter Rasner Media’s mission to free TikTok from Chinese control,” the statement said, in part.
 



  Reid Rasner statement 




In response to a dozen questions from South Dakota Searchlight about his finances, his bid for TikTok and other topics, a representative of Reid Rasner sent an emailed statement.
Here is that statement in full:
“While we respect the media’s role and have cooperated with credible outlets, the tone and accusatory nature of your questions toward Mr. Rasner are completely unprofessional. Rasner Media’s TikTok acquisition efforts are a business transaction, not a political campaign. Mr. Rasner is unapologetically one of the most pro-Trump, MAGA businessmen in America, dedicated to protecting conservative voices on platforms like TikTok. This has naturally drawn opposition from Communist China and parts of the Democrat machine, including outlets like yours. Your biased attacks will not deter Rasner Media’s mission to free TikTok from Chinese control, support President Trump’s efforts to establish a United States sovereign wealth fund, and protect conservative influencers who are being censored by foreign adversaries and woke leftists behind keyboards.”

This story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra of The 19th.  Meet Shefali and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Adriana Smith, the pregnant Georgia woman who has been brain-dead since February, gave birth by emergency Caesarean section Friday and is set to be taken off life support this week, her family told a local NBC News affiliate.
The case made national headlines. Smith’s mother said her daughter had to stay on life support until she gave birth because of Georgia’s six-week abortion ban, which has narrow exceptions for rape, incest, or the life or health of the pregnant person. Smith was nine weeks pregnant when she was declared brain-dead.
Smith’s mother told local news that the baby weighs 1 pound and 13 ounces and will require care in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit.
Emory Hospital, where Smith has been kept, has declined to comment on the case beyond telling the Associated Press that they considered “Georgia’s abortion laws and all other applicable laws.” The Georgia law holds that after six weeks of pregnancy, embryos and fetuses deserve the same legal protections as people.
The case has sparked broad outcry, with national Democrats denouncing the Georgia law and some state lawmakers calling for clarifications about what is permitted under the law. State Attorney General Chris Carr has said he does not believe that the abortion ban compels health providers to keep a pregnant person on life support until they can give birth. Still, he has not issued a legal opinion asserting as much, despite calls from Democratic state lawmakers.
Some abortion opponents have argued the law would mean Smith should stay on life support. Ed Setzler, a state senator who co-sponsored Georgia’s six-week ban, told the Associated Press that it was “completely appropriate” to keep Smith on life support until she could give birth. Students for Life, an influential anti-abortion group, has said the same.
Georgia is one of four states with a six-week abortion ban; Florida, Iowa and South Carolina have similar laws, including with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life or health of the pregnant person, along with some exceptions for pregnancies with fetal anomalies. Another dozen states ban abortion throughout pregnancy.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-dv2181054-2048x1331-1-1024x666.jpeg,,,2025-06-17 15:12:25.951935

(Getty Images) (This photo cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — A measles exposure occurred at the Oklahoma City airport during Memorial Day weekend, state health officials said Tuesday.
The exposure lasted from 11:15 p.m. May 27 until 1:30 a.m. May 28 at the Will Rogers World Airport.
Another exposure happened the same weekend in Guymon at a Walmart Supercenter, 2600 U.S.-64, from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. May 28.
Individuals who were at an exposure location outside of the specified timeframe are not at risk, the Oklahoma State Department of Health said.
Health officials advise that individuals who might have been exposed and have no immunity from vaccination or previous infection should isolate themselves from public settings for 21 days from the date of their potential exposure.
Measles is contagious four days before the onset of a rash and until five days after the rash appears, according to the Health Department website.
Oklahoma so far has recorded 20 measles cases in 2025. That includes 17 test-confirmed infections and three probable cases in which a person was symptomatic.
Seventeen of the 20 cases involved people who were unvaccinated for measles. One person had received two doses of the measles vaccine, and two others’ vaccination status was unknown.
Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are 97% effective against measles and 86% effective against mumps, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One dose is 93% effective against measles, 72% effective against mumps and 97% effective against rubella.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision Tuesday that the Legislature’s Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee (JFC) doesn’t have the authority to approve settlement agreements made by the state Department of Justice (DOJ) in certain types of cases. 
The Legislature gave itself that authority as part of the lame duck laws it passed when Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul were elected in 2018, taking powers away from the executive branch offices once they were no longer held by Republicans. A previous challenge to the law giving JFC authority over settlements failed because the Court found there are some cases when the committee does have the authority to control how settlement money is spent. 
In a statement, Kaul said the decision will allow the DOJ to more efficiently do its job. 
“This unanimous ruling finally puts an end to the legislature’s unconstitutional involvement in the resolution of key categories of cases,” he said. “As a result, the Wisconsin Department of Justice will be able to more efficiently resolve the cases that are impacted by this decision, including civil actions enforcing our consumer protection laws and civil actions enforcing our environmental protection laws.” 
This second challenge to the law was filed by Evers and Kaul, arguing that it is unconstitutional for the Legislature to give itself the authority to weigh in on settlements in civil enforcement actions and actions that state agencies request DOJ to pursue. The case was initially brought in Dane County Circuit Court, where a judge sided with Evers and Kaul. The Court of Appeals overturned that ruling and the Supreme Court has reversed the appellate decision. 
These types of cases include the enforcement of environmental, consumer protection, financial regulation and medical assistance laws and lawsuits over the breach of a contract with the state or damage to state property. 
In Tuesday’s decision, authored by Justice Brian Hagedorn, the Supreme Court ruled that these types of cases are “core” executive powers and while the Legislature can pass laws giving the attorney general and DOJ guardrails over how to apply the law, it can’t intervene in the settlement process. 
22AP790 Mandate
“Thus, DOJ’s litigation in these categories of cases is, rather straightforwardly, the execution of laws enacted by the Legislature,” Hagedorn wrote. “Just as the pursuit of these claims is unequivocally an executive function, so is the settlement of them. When the Legislature gives authority to the Attorney General to pursue these claims, it necessarily confers discretion on how to pursue the claims to completion, through settlement or otherwise.” 
The Legislature had argued that because the state’s Constitution requires it to account for all “sources of income” to the state so it can determine tax levels, it must have the authority to determine the amount of money awarded to the state in the settlement of a lawsuit. 
Hagedorn wrote that the Legislature has given the attorney general the authority to bring these lawsuits and resolve them as he sees fit, including the amount of money in a settlement. 
“The Legislature’s argument seems to rest on the notion that the Legislature must be able to account ahead of time for how much money will come into the state’s coffers in the upcoming year, and therefore be allowed veto power over settlement agreements in the event its math may be off,” he wrote. “This doesn’t make sense. While undoubtedly the Legislature would be wise to account for all sources of income when determining the amount to tax in the coming year, it does not follow that the Legislature has a constitutional interest in controlling every executive function involving the collection of revenue, or even taxes.” 
“We fail to understand why the power and duty to levy taxes allows the Legislature to control the execution of the law,” he continued. “If the Legislature wishes to know the amount of any settlements, it may prescribe that by law. If it wishes to establish more specific direction regarding settlement revenues, it may do so by law, and it already has in some areas. The Legislature simply has not connected the dots for why the taxing power gives it a constitutional role in litigation involving the receipt of monies into state coffers.” 
Hagedorn added that by this logic the Legislature could insert itself into basically any executive branch function involving money. 
“If the Legislature has a constitutional interest in the execution of the laws every time an executive action involves money, there would be virtually no area where the Legislature could not insert itself into the execution of the law,” he wrote. “The constitution cannot and does not mean that.”
The Legislature also argued that provisions in the settlement of a given lawsuit could have policy implications and, as the law-making branch of government, it should have the authority to determine those aspects of a settlement agreement. But Hagedorn wrote that the executive branch’s duty to enforce the laws the Legislature passes inherently requires the exercise of some discretion and that discretion will undoubtedly have policy impacts. 
“In executing the law, executive branch officials must decide how to effectuate the law’s policies, and those decisions will necessarily have policy implications,” Hagedorn wrote. “The Legislature’s argument that it can step into the shoes of the executive when executive action impacts policy would eviscerate the separation of powers.” 
Exercising the discretion given to the executive branch will have a policy impact, he wrote, and “it is the Legislature that has given this authority and discretion in the first place, including any limitations on how settlements are to be spent. When the Attorney General, therefore, decides where settlement proceeds are to be directed, he is acting within the scope of the authority the Legislature gave him. If the Legislature is dissatisfied with the discretion it left to the Attorney General, it may amend the laws accordingly.”

(Photo: Getty Images)In a political climate in which Republicans and Democrats rarely find themselves on the same side, House Bill 328 provided a vehicle for common ground on Tuesday. Lawmakers praised the bill to regulate hemp-derived consumables as something that was long overdue in North Carolina.
The new proposed “committee substitute” rolled out in the Senate Health Committee defines hemp-derived cannabinoids to include Delta 9 THC, Delta 8, cannabidiol (CBD), and a variety of other synthetic products derived from hemp. The bill would limit sales to adults 21 and older.
While hemp may legally have 0.3% or less THC, lawmakers said some unregulated products may be delivering a more potent hit than advertised.
THC, or Tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main ingredient in marijuana that provides users with a high.
Senator Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe) praised Sen. Amy Galey (R-Alamance) for shepherding the bill through the Senate.
“I wish we had done this back in 2021 when we figured out the whole hemp problem,” said Mayfield. “The genie is pretty far out of the bottle now, so we’re trying to stuff it back in.”
HB 328 would also ban hemp-derived consumables on educational property, requiring local boards of education to have a written policy barring the products from school grounds along with electronic cigarettes and other vaping products.
Bill Croft, executive director at NC Respiratory Care Board, joined those urging regulation of the products that increasingly appear in vape shops.
“I would highly support this simply because vaping is destroying lungs. We already have a huge problem in North Carolina,” Croft said.

Attorney General Jeff Jackson attended Tuesday’s hearing with his 10-year-old son, Owen.
“While I would trust him with many things, the notion that he can go into one of these shops and be presented with what is branded as candy by the misappropriation of actual brands that he’s familiar with like Oreos, like Sour Patch Kids to try and sell him an intoxicating substance…the notion that that is somehow lawful in North Carolina is very difficult for parents,” said Jackson.
Jackson said even as the legislation evolves with time, his office supports this initial step forward.
“We have been meeting with Alcohol Law Enforcement (ALE) over the last several months in anticipation of a bill like this to talk to them about what enforcement would actually look like on the ground. They are very well positioned to move on this,” the attorney general told lawmakers.
Jackson said the Department of Justice was also ready to work with ALE to aggressively enforce this law to protect kids.
  Sen. Benton Sawrey, chairman of the Senate Health Committee (Photo: NCGA video stream)
Sen. Benton Sawrey, chairman of the Senate Health Committee, said it was ‘bizarre’ the state had not placed restrictions on these products in prior sessions.
“I’ve been shocked by the pictures and the packaging that I’ve seen that these products are sold in,” said Sawrey in acknowledging the colorful graphics were intended to catch the eye of young consumers.
“It’s not something we would permit [with] anything else.”
Under the legislation, retailers would be prohibited from selling THC-infused candies and drinks to anyone under 21. Retailers would also be required to have a valid license to sell hemp-derived consumables.
Producers selling their products illegally could face an initial civil penalty up to $500. Repeated violations within a three-year period would result in a $2,000 fine and the revocation of the seller’s license.
A separate section of the bill would add Kratom to North Carolina’s list of controlled substances.
Kratom is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia whose leaves are generally smoked, brewed with tea, or placed into gel capsules. In low doses it can provide a stimulant effect, but it high doses it has a sedative effect. Kratom is currently not a controlled substance and is unregulated and legal under state and federal law.
Sen. Sawrey said he believes there is finally broad consensus to raise the age and place restrictions on the packaging of these consumables that come with a potent punch.
“I hope that we’re able to achieve that in this session and get that across the finish line.”

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The legal dispute between the Arkansas Board of Corrections and Attorney General Tim Griffin deepened this week, even as the board acted to try to resolve it.

Griffin filed a lawsuit against the board in 2023, after the board hired attorney Abtin Mehdizadegan, saying the attorney general would have a conflict of interest representing the board in its own lawsuit against the governor. 
The board voted Monday to send Griffin a letter reasserting its right to hire its own attorney, and some members said the move was an effort to settle that lawsuit.
Griffin didn’t comment specifically on the letter, but Mehdizadegan’s comments during the meeting triggered a vehement reaction from Griffin.
Mehdizadegan told the prison board he’d made preliminary contact with Griffin’s office about a possible resolution to the lawsuit since the state Supreme Court sent it back to a lower court for further consideration last month.
He said he had not made any settlement offer to the attorney general because the board had not authorized him to do so.
Griffin disputed that, saying Mehdizadegan “failed to accurately describe his actions.”
“The Board of Corrections’ illegally retained counsel called my office last week, and while he prefaced his call acknowledging that he was not authorized to negotiate terms of a settlement, he proceeded to lay out terms for settlements in both lawsuits,” Griffin said in a statement.
The board is suing the governor over two state laws it says usurp its  constitutional authority by making the secretary of corrections and directors of two corrections divisions answerable to the governor instead of the board. The state Supreme Court on June 5 dismissed Griffin’s appeal of a lower court’s temporary halt to those laws, meaning the case remains unresolved.
Griffin’s lawsuit against the board alleges it violated the state Freedom of Information Act by meeting improperly in executive session before hiring Mehdizadegan. The lawsuit also claims the board violated the FOIA by not providing him requested documents.
“In any event,” Griffin said in his statement, “the illegally retained counsel’s suggested settlement terms would require me to excuse the Board’s violations and effectively stop defending the Governor against litigation filed by illegally retained counsel,” Griffin said.
The issues at stake in both cases ultimately require the Supreme Court’s involvement, he said.

The letter the board approved sending Monday also says it wishes to continue having Mehdizadegan and his firm, Hall Booth Smith, represent it and would object to any effort to designate a different law firm.
The board voted 4-0 with two abstentions to send the letter. McCastlain and Grant Hodges abstained. 
In another split vote Monday, the board voted 4-1 to approve its official response to a critical state audit report. McCastlain was the lone no vote. 
Among other things, the audit determined that the Board of Corrections doesn’t have any power to appropriate funds. Mehdizadegan has not yet been paid for his work, which as of February totaled more than $230,000, according to the audit.
Watson and board Chairman Benny Magness said they felt the full board needed to accept the response and to affirm that they had reviewed the audit report. The board then voted unanimously to acknowledge receipt of the audit report.

Rossy Alfaro stood in front of the Vermont Statehouse Monday evening and, in a voice choked with emotion, told hundreds of onlookers about the despair and rage she felt since immigration authorities detained her daughter and partner two days earlier. 
“It is an injustice that they have been taken from me and it has shattered my heart into a million pieces,” said Alfaro, who is also spokesperson for Migrant Justice, a Burlington-based advocacy organization for migrant workers. “We want them back with us because no one should have to feel the pain that I am feeling now.” 
On Saturday morning, her partner, 29-year-old Jose Ignacio De La Cruz, known as Nacho, and her daughter, 18-year-old Heidi Perez, drove to farms in Franklin County to deliver food, according to Will Lambek, a spokesperson for Migrant Justice.
“They were bringing food to members of their community who didn’t want to put themselves at risk leaving the farm to drive the streets and backroads of this state,” said Lambek. Many farm workers rely on people to bring them food in order not to leave their farms, he said in an interview earlier that evening.
They were driving home to Chittenden County on VT Route 105 in Richford when they were pulled over by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. De La Cruz asked why they were pulled over and when the agent didn’t provide a reason, they exercised their right to remain silent, Lambek said Monday. 
Within ten minutes of stopping them, around 12:30 p.m., officers shattered the glass of the driver’s seat window, opened the door, and forcibly detained them, according to Lambek.

Ryan Brissette, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson, said the arrest near the U.S.–Canada border stemmed from “suspicious border activity.” He did not clarify what the suspicious activity was by the time of publication.
“The vehicle’s occupants refused to answer the agents’ questions, would not roll down the vehicle’s windows, and refused to comply with the agents’ lawful orders,” Brissette wrote in an email Tuesday. “Agents were forced to break a window to remove both occupants.”
They were brought to Richford Station and processed. De La Cruz is currently held in the Northwest State Correctional Facility in Swanton and Perez is being held at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, according to the state prisoner locator. 
Brissette said it was determined that both De La Cruz and Perez were citizens of Mexico and did not have a legal immigration status in the U.S., and therefore remained in custody pending removal proceedings.
“Border Patrol will continue to enforce the law,” Brissette wrote. “Those illegally present in the United States will be apprehended and will face consequences.”

Marita Canedo, a Migrant Justice spokesperson, was on the phone with De La Cruz when he was arrested, she said at the rally Monday night. 
“Nacho did everything that he knew to defend his rights,” Canedo said. Under every administration, she said, the treatment of immigrants is the same. “They want to put us in fear. They want to hide us,” she said. 
Both De La Cruz and Perez are prominent leaders within Migrant Justice.
De La Cruz served on the Coordinating Committee, the principal leadership body of the advocacy organization. He was a leader in the Milk With Dignity campaign, a program demanding fair working conditions for dairy workers, after spending years working in the dairy industry, sleeping on wooden pallets and on tractors, according to friends and co-workers who spoke at the rally. His work has been central to immigrant rights legislation that passed through the Vermont Legislature, according to Migrant Justice, including a new law increasing housing access for immigrant families that was signed by Gov. Phil Scott on Thursday.
He now works as a worker-owner at New Frameworks, a Vermont-based sustainable construction company. 
Perez was a frequent attendee at migrant rallies and marches and used her voice in the legislature to push for a 2024 law that ensures all students, regardless of immigration status, could access in-state tuition and need-based financial aid. She graduated from Milton High School a week before she was detained. She planned to attend Vermont State University in the fall, using the expanded opportunities and protections from the law she helped pass. 
Pete Wyndorf, a teacher at Milton High School, said he and his colleagues strongly condemned her arrest, which they called “a kidnapping of a community member and the unjust treatment of individuals who have every right to be here.”

De La Cruz and Perez filed petitions in federal district court, which accepted jurisdiction of their case, and issued temporary restraining orders against the government to prevent their transfer out of Vermont, Lambek said Monday. 
“They’re asking for the judge to grant their release because of the unconstitutional nature of the detention,” Lambek said. “We certainly believe they have a strong claim and that that claim should prevail.” 
Arrests of migrant residents have ramped up since President Donald Trump took office in January, including detainment of nine farm workers in April and the deportation of four. In May, four landscape workers and ten construction workers were also detained by Border Patrol agents in northern Vermont.
Rebecca Sheppard, a Montpelier resident retired from the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, was among the ralliers on Monday. 
“I’m worried about their safety, and I think they have the right to be here,” Sheppard said. She’d attended the No Kings Rally at the Statehouse Saturday in the capital city, the day De La Cruz and Perez were arrested.
The Saturday rally drew more than 1,000 people to the Statehouse, while 16,000 more showed up at the Burlington waterfront. They were part of more than 40 events held across Vermont to protest the Trump administration’s immigration policies, budget cuts, assault on medical rights, and protect democracy as President Trump held a military parade in Washington, D.C. on his 79th birthday.
This spring, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials boosted arrests through workplace raids in cities like Los Angeles that led to anti-ICE protests. In response, the Trump administration deployed U.S. Marines to one of the country’s biggest cities and commandeered the California National Guard. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is challenging the takeover in federal court. 
The Trump administration has set a goal for immigration arrests at 3,000 per day, according to Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff. Over the past week, arrests by immigration officials shot up to 2,000 a day, detaining workers at restaurants, factories, farms, and other businesses like Home Depot. 
Pushback from industry leaders led President Trump to abruptly pause raids this weekend, according to The New York Times, until Sunday night, when he again called on ICE to increase mass deportations in Democrat-led cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the administration’s plan to overhaul the federal budget including massive cuts to social services like Medicaid, would also increase immigration enforcement. Reconciliation provisions under the bill include funding one million annual migrant removals, hiring 10,000 new ICE personnel, and creating centers to detain at least 100,000 people per day. The bill would also create an asylum application fee. Instead of applying for free, individuals would need to pay $1,000. 
In Montpelier, the personal impact of these policies could be seen as 10-year-old Regina, a friend of Perez, struggled to speak through her tears.
“Heidi is my friend, she is an inspiration to me,” said Regina, whose last name was withheld by organizers because she is a minor. “I hope one day I can grow up to be a fighter for rights like her.”

LSU spokesman Todd Woodward confirmed both employees have been fired from the university. 
According to arrest and warrant documents the Illuminator obtained in a public records request, the alleged thefts were discovered during a random audit of the bursar’s office, which collects student tuition and fees and disperses student aid. It discovered money missing from cash bags assigned to the two employees. 
Knight admitted to taking the money to pay her son’s bail from a recent arrest, according to the documents. She attempted to return the cash after learning of the audit, the documents noted, when she was discovered with a wad of cash in her hand. 
Harvey is in a pre-trial diversion program for first-time offenders, according to court documents. Both are out on bond and a trial date has not yet been set.

Shri Thanedar in next year’s primary has been given a boost in that effort.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) on Tuesday announced that he is endorsing state Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit) in his challenge to Thanedar, also a Detroit Democrat, in the August 2026 Democratic primary for Michigan’s 13th Congressional District.
“I’m proud to support Donavan McKinney for Congress in Michigan’s 13th district. Donavan is exactly the type of leader we need in Washington right now,” Sanders said in a press release. “A former union leader, he has dedicated his life to standing with working people, and is ready to lead the struggle against Donald Trump, the oligarchy, and the corporate interests who prioritize profits over people.  I’m urging all Michiganders to join me in supporting Donavan’s campaign.”
McKinney, who has also been endorsed by Thanedar’s congressional colleague, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), has tried to position himself as a progressive alternative, saying during his campaign kickoff that Thanedar had “more in common with Donald Trump and Elon Musk” than with residents in the 13th District.

Thanedar, who is also being challenged for the 2026 Democratic nomination by former state Sen. Adam Hollier (D-Detroit), spent $10 million of his own funds seeking the governor’s seat in 2018. He then served a single term in the Michigan Legislature before being elected to Congress in 2022. McKinney’s campaign pointed to fundraising records that show Thanedar has so far spent $17 million of his own money on his congressional campaigns.
McKinney said Sanders’ endorsement cemented his status as the “clear progressive” in the race.
“Senator Sanders has long been a progressive champion for working class Americans and I am honored to receive his endorsement,” McKinney said. “His political courage and his commitment to doing the right thing — even when it’s unpopular, even when it’s hard, even if he’s alone — are a true inspiration to me, as is his commitment to fighting for a more just, more equal America.”
Thanedar made headlines in April when he said he intended to file articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, making that announcement just hours after McKinney launched his campaign. On Monday, Thanedar also said he was among Michigan members of Congress whose name appeared on the reported hitlist of the man charged with assassinating a Minnesota legislator and her husband in their home.

Santiago/Getty Images)More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.
In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

(Stock photo via Getty Images)Three years ago on June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, stripping women of the fundamental right to make decisions about their own bodies.
In South Carolina, we are seeing the harmful effects firsthand and are actively living with the devastating consequences.
Not long after the Supreme Court ruling, South Carolina enacted a six-week abortion ban, a clear and present danger to women’s health, autonomy, and dignity — forcing women to suffer and endure emotional and physical trauma just to access essential healthcare.
In South Carolina, women are denied life-saving medical care
Earlier this year, at nine weeks pregnant, a Greenville mother learned her baby had stopped growing at six weeks — there was no heartbeat. But a procedure to remove the nonviable fetus was denied. She was forced to wait, suffering severe pregnancy symptoms and emotional anguish, until the threat of infection escalated. Even then, she was refused care again.
This is not medicine. This is cruelty masked as policy. This mother’s story is one of many in a state where women are no longer able to make decisions about their own bodies.
In South Carolina, women are forced to flee
In late 2023, a Charleston resident found herself pregnant despite using an IUD. She knew immediately what was right for her, but South Carolina’s ban meant the clock was ticking. She couldn’t get an appointment in time.
Her only choice? Drive more than 20 hours to North Carolina, twice, to get the care she needed.
No one should be forced to leave their state just to exercise bodily autonomy.
She later sued the state in an effort to reset the ban at nine weeks, but a state Supreme Court ruling in May kept it at six.
In late 2024, a Charleston mother was forced to leave South Carolina after receiving a fatal fetal diagnosis during her second trimester. Despite her doctors’ efforts to confirm the condition in which infants rarely survive, state abortion laws blocked her from getting care.
Separated from her support system and young son, she had to travel out of state to get the care she needed and begin grieving a deeply wanted pregnancy.
She stated the experience has even made her question wanting to try and get pregnant again.
In South Carolina, providers are leaving, and new doctors won’t come
The abortion ban is not only harming patients, it’s driving medical professionals away.
Doctors are leaving South Carolina, citing ethical concerns and the inability to practice without fear. Some are even taking their fight to court. And the future doesn’t look brighter:
• Senior OB-GYN residency applications have dropped 5.7% in South Carolina.
• Overall senior residency applications have dropped 6.7% in the state.
This “brain drain” is happening in real time. And in a state already struggling with provider shortages, the long-term consequences for maternal and reproductive health care are alarming.
In South Carolina, entire counties have no maternal care
In South Carolina, 13% of counties are classified as maternity care deserts.
That means no OB-GYNs. No midwives. No prenatal care. In 15 counties, there are zero OB-GYNs per 10,000 women. For 28 counties, zero midwives, according to the latest report from the state Office for Healthcare Workforce.
For those in rural communities, the ban exacerbates already devastating gaps in care. It puts pregnant people at risk simply because of where they live.
In South Carolina, Black women bear the brunt
The maternal mortality crisis is magnified for Black women in our state. They are 4.2 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women.
And 94.4% of all pregnancy-related deaths in the state are preventable, according to the latest report from the state Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Review Committee.
South Carolina’s abortion ban does not solve a problem. It compounds a deadly one.
Systemic inequities are deepened when people are denied access to reproductive care.
These abortion bans are immoral, unsafe, and unsustainable. They hurt women, communities, and our healthcare system as a whole.
At WREN, we are actively working every single day to restore reproductive freedom for South Carolina’s women and girls. We must bring compassion, dignity, and autonomy back to health care in South Carolina.
We invite you to join us for our Abortion Access Webinar in partnership with Palmetto State Abortion Fund on Wednesday, June 18, at noon EST as we discuss the future of abortion rights in our state and beyond. You can register here.
They’re working hard to take our rights away.
We’re working harder to fight back.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The federal budget reconciliation bill making progress in the United States Senate this week makes more than 21,000 square miles of public land in New Mexico “eligible” to be sold to private buyers, according to the Wilderness Society.
The group, which opposes efforts to sell off public lands, geographically analyzed lands across the West that could be subject to a land sale, based on criteria laid out in the bill. 
Across the West, several hundred million acres of land would meet the criteria, according to the group, though only a tiny fraction of that would be sold, per the bill text. The bill mandates the “disposal” of between .5% and .75% of all United States Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land across the West, which means up to 3.2 million acres or 5,000 square miles. 
According to the Wilderness Society’s analysis, about 6.5 million acres of U.S. Forest Service land in New Mexico would be eligible, in addition to about 7.8 million acres of BLM land. According to a map the society created, huge swathes of BLM land east of Las Cruces also would be eligible, along with areas of the Gila National Forest and Santa Fe National Forest. 


The mandate does not apply to national parks, monuments or other “federally protected land” like historic sites, wildlife refuges or fish hatcheries. It also excludes land that is “subject to valid existing rights.” 
But it’s no longer clear what that last provision means, said Wilderness Society spokesperson Max Greenberg in an interview Tuesday with Source New Mexico. Until this weekend, “valid existing rights” applied to federal lands with grazing leases, but lawmakers struck the definition, according to Politico and leaked drafts the organization obtained.
‘A huge victory’: Vasquez touts nixing of public lands sell-off in Congressional bill

After lawmakers removed that definition, the Wilderness Society revised its estimate to 250 million acres of federal land eligible for sale, up from 120 million acres, Greenberg said. The figure reflects the sheer amount of federal land now leased for grazing across the West, he said, and also the secrecy in the legislative process. 
“This played out with kind of secret updates over the weekend and this very non-transparent, strange process where we have to work out what is actually implicated in the bill,” Greenberg told Source. “All of this argues for just [a] better process and better transparency… It’s been misleading the way the bill was initially framed by Republicans as this kind of very surgical effort to dispose of a few marginal parcels here and there.”
U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), chair of the Senate Natural Resources Committee, has said the mandated selloff would serve as a way to discard remote and difficult-to-manage public lands and turn them into housing developments. He made the pitch last week in a video he released, featuring Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner.
“Washington has proven time and again that it can’t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands,” Lee said in the video. 
A previous version of the bill in the House contained about half a million acres of specific parcels of federal land to lose federal protections, but House lawmakers removed that language after pushback, including from U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM). Vasquez called it a “huge victory” at the time.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9622-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-17 14:05:48.614805

(Jeremy Stevens for Louisiana Illuminator)LAKE CHARLES – Police sources report federal, state and local law enforcement took part in an immigration raid Tuesday morning at Delta Downs Racetrack, Casino and Hotel near Vinton.  
Vinton Police Chief Scott Spell confirmed his department was notified Tuesday morning of an operation being conducted by Louisiana State Police, Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Spell said Vinton Police were not involved in the operation, as Delta Downs is not within city limits.
ICE has not responded to questions about Tuesday morning’s raid or disclosed the number of individuals questioned, detained or arrested.
State Police representatives confirmed that they assisted with federal partners this morning but would not provide specific details. In an email to the Illuminator, they provided a statement from ICE Homeland Security Investigations that said the agency “does not confirm or discuss ongoing operations.”
Delta Downs, owned by Boyd Gaming, said it would provide a statement in response to a reporter’s questions.
Calcasieu Parish Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Kayla Vincent said fewer than 10 CPSO deputies assigned to the Calcasieu Combined Anti-Drug Taskforce (CAT) were on hand to “provide limited support by helping search the premises.” She referred questions about the arrested individuals to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who she said led the investigation.
Vincent said CPSO is not aware of any prior complaints or investigations related to unauthorized workers at Delta Downs or any other local businesses or companies. CPSO does not conduct immigration enforcement or investigations, but they “do partner with our federal agencies, just as we do with local and state, when requested in order to support operations aimed at public safety,” she added.
This is not the first time federal immigration agents have carried out enforcement actions in southwest Louisiana this year. Eleven employees of a Port of Lake Charles contractor were arrested in March as part of an investigation into the “illegal hiring of unauthorized workers,” according to ICE.

Blake Miguez presents his bill to a committee. (Allison Allsop / Louisiana Illuminator)State Sen. Blake Miguez, R-New Iberia, officially launched his bid to unseat fellow Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy next year, taking aim at Cassidy’s vote to convict President Donald Trump in an impeachment trial after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection attempt at the U.S. Capitol. 
“I’m running for the U.S. Senate because Bill Cassidy sucks,” Miguez said in a video announcing his campaign. “Phony politicians like Bill Cassidy can’t shoot straight, but I can.” 
Miguez, a champion competitive sharpshooter and staunch 2nd Amendment advocate, heavily features guns in his video. He brandishes a firearm to literally take aim at targets bearing the words “Marxism,” “taxes” and “food dyes,” the latter a reference to legislation he’s sponsored to regulate food dyes and other additives that have fallen out of favor with conservative Republicans. 
Also targeted is “trans crap,” seemingly a reference to anti-transgender legislation Miguez has supported. 
Miguez has served in the Louisiana Senate since 2024. Before that, he served three terms in the state house. His legislative focuses have been staples of conservative politics, including firearm legislation. Miguez sponsored a measure that allows individuals to carry concealed handguns without a license.  
Cassidy’s support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s pick for secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is widely seen as an effort to curry favor with Trump and his base. Cassidy is a medical doctor who has vocalized his disagreement with Kennedy’s anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. 
Cassidy is already facing an announced challenge from GOP Treasurer John Fleming, who previously worked in Trump’s first administration. Fleming ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 2016. Prior to that, he was a congressman representing the district currently U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson currently holds. 
Several lesser-known candidates are also seeking to unseat Cassidy. They include Sammy Wyatt, a university administrator who is at odds with one of Gov. Jeff Landry’s appointees to the LSU Board of Supervisors. 
Congresswoman Julia Letlow, R-Start, is also rumored to be considering running against Cassidy, though she is also a rumored candidate to be the next president of LSU. 
What’s different about the 2026 election is the introduction of closed primaries. 
Gov. Jeff Landry supported legislation in 2024 to close Louisiana’s relatively unusual open “jungle” primaries, in which all candidates face each other in an initial election, and the top two vote-getters — assuming no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote — proceed to a runoff the following month. 
Louisiana’s new closed primaries apply to seats in Congress and on the Louisiana Supreme Court, Public Service Commission and Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. They will be held in March of each election year, with the majority vote-getter from each party advancing to a fall election. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in March, a second party primary will be held with the top two candidates. 
In states with closed primaries, voters tend to be more polarized than in the general election, meaning a conservative challenger could have a better chance in unseating their more moderate intraparty rival.

Free.,U.S. senators call for security funding boost after Minnesota assassination,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senators-call-security-funding-boost-after-minnesota-assassination,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. senators emerged from a briefing with federal law enforcement officials Tuesday saying they’ll likely boost funding on safety and security for members and their families in an upcoming government funding bill.The hour-long briefing by U.S. Capitol Police and the Senate sergeant-at-arms followed the weekend assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband as well as the attempted murder of a state senator and his wife.The gunman had a list of Democratic elected officials, including members of Congress, and their home addresses, which renewed long-standing security concerns among lawmakers.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., spoke about the shootings during a floor speech shortly after the meeting, pressing for an end to political violence.“I'm profoundly grateful to local law enforcement that the alleged shooter is in custody and I look forward to seeing him prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" Thune said. ""There is no place for this kind of violence in our country. None.""Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, said that California Democrat Adam Schiff and Pennsylvania Republican Dave McCormick suggested during the closed-door meeting that Congress bolster funding for member safety.“The Capitol Police and the sergeant at arms gave a very detailed discussion of how they can protect members here, back in our states, at our homes, in our offices,” Schumer said. “The violence, threats against elected officials, including people in the Senate, has dramatically increased, and that means we need more protection. We need more money.”The USCP and other law enforcement agencies, Schumer said, are taking some immediate steps to bolster security, though he said “there are other things that will take a little while with more resources.”Schumer also called on political leaders to be more cautious about how they discuss policy differences.“The rhetoric that's encouraging violence is coming from too many powerful people in this country,” Schumer said. “And we need firm, strong denouncement of all violence and violent rhetoric — that should be from the president and from all of the elected officials.”Minnesota Democratic Sen. Tina Smith called the meeting “very productive,” but didn’t want to elaborate.“I'm not going to comment any more,” Smith told reporters. “I think it's important for members’ safety that we don't talk a lot about what is being done to keep us safe in order to keep us safe.”Support for funding increaseSenate Appropriations ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., said she expects the panel will increase funding for USCP in the bill that covers the upcoming fiscal year.“I believe we need to do that,” Murray said.Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons said the current situation is “incredibly concerning, gravely concerning.”“And I appreciate the prompt and thorough bipartisan response,” Coons said.Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who is running for governor in Alabama, said USCP will increase its security measures for members of Congress.“They’re going to try to do as much as they can, that’s about it,” he said after the briefing. “You know, security at home and here.”Asked whether there’s a legislative solution or anything lawmakers can do, Oklahoma GOP Sen. James Lankford told reporters “there’s a cultural solution.”Sen. Martin Heinrich did not go into details about the meeting but said “everybody is having a very robust discussion about the sort of heightened security, dangerous environment we’re all operating in right now and what to do about that, both tactically to meet some of that threat, but also how to reduce the volatility of the environment that we're in every day.”The New Mexico Democrat is the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Legislative Branch Subcommittee, which funds USCP and the sergeant at arms.Asked about boosting USCP funding, Heinrich said this is “an obvious place that lawmakers will look,” but added that senators should be strategic about funding.“We also just need to be smart and targeted about this,” he said. “There are a lot of things that can be done that don’t require a lot of funding that would reduce the scale of the target that is on the backs of anybody in public office these days.”",,,,2025-06-17 14:05:48.614805

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Erin Johnson is scheduling as many doctor’s appointments as she can before the end of the year.
The James Island resident is among an estimated 142,000 South Carolinians expected to lose their health insurance with the end of an expanded federal subsidy that helps pay their premiums. The aid is set to expire at year’s end unless Congress approves another extension.
That would further strain the state’s hospitals, cause people to get sicker as they delay seeking care, and increase preventable deaths, advocates are warning.
For Johnson, losing the expanded subsidies means she’ll likely skip any potential follow-up appointments she needs. If, for example, her dermatologist determines she needs more treatment after removing potentially cancerous skin spots, Johnson won’t be able to afford it, she said.
“It’s actually really scary,” said Johnson, who works as a nanny in Charleston.
Subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, often known as Obamacare, have existed for more than a decade. The subsidies help pay for private health insurance plans on the online marketplace Healthcare.gov, essentially a way of signing up for coverage not provided through an employer.
More than 630,000 people in the state signed up for coverage through the marketplace, and about 95% of them used the enhanced subsidies to help pay the premiums, according to a study by the nonpartisan South Carolina Institute of Medicine and Public Health.
The subsidies are for people who make too much to qualify for Medicaid.
Before 2021, they were available for people earning up to four times the federal poverty level — which would currently be $62,600 for a single person with no children. The sliding scale of aid depended on people’s income, with those on the low end getting their premiums fully covered.
But during the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress enhanced those subsidies as part of the American Rescue Plan Act. Instead of a set amount of aid depending on income, the expansion bases aid on the percentage of a person’s income that would be gobbled up by insurance premiums.
People making up to 150% of the federal poverty level pay nothing. Anyone earning more than that can get help for any amount of their premium beyond a certain percent of their income, according to a Congressional report on the subsidies.
The enhanced subsidies also removed the income cap to qualify, newly allowing people making more than four times the poverty level to get aid. If more than 8.5% of their income would go toward health insurance premiums, they can get a subsidy to cover anything beyond that amount.
On average, South Carolinians saved between $500 and $700 each month using the expanded subsidies, according to the public health institute study.
They can get the federal aid in two ways. If they pay monthly, based on their estimated income, the subsidy acts like a coupon that subtracts from their bill. Or people can elect to pay upfront and receive a refund as part of their taxes, which is why the subsidies are also referred to as tax credits. Either way, the subsidies must be declared when they file their income taxes, according to the public health institute.
Congress extended the subsidy once before, as part of a 2022 spending package.
But a second extension is not included in Republicans’ massive federal spending package, dubbed the “big, beautiful bill,” which passed the U.S. House last month and is under debate in the U.S. Senate.
Advocates are not hopeful it will be part of the final package.
In a state that already consistently ranks among the worst in the country for health outcomes, a rise in the rate of uninsured people could have a cascading effect, advocates said.
South Carolina had more people using marketplace plans in 2025 than all but six other states, according to data from KFF, a nonpartisan nonprofit that collects health care data.
Since the enhanced subsidies passed five years ago, the number of people using marketplace insurance more than doubled — a significant spike after years of declining participation, according to KFF data.
Losing the enhanced subsidies will make health care unaffordable again for a lot of South Carolinians, according to the report.
“If these go away, there’s going to be a lot of pain,” said Joel Lourie, a former state senator and CEO of insurance agency Lourie Life and Health.
As many as 380 more people could die each year because they no longer have health insurance, according to the report.
‘Really scary’
About 45% of South Carolinians have health coverage through their employer, according to the public health institute study.
But that’s not an option for Johnson, who’s been an independent nanny for the last decade.
She expects her premiums to be about $400 per month without the enhanced subsidy. And she can’t afford that on her salary of $52,000 per year, she said.
Before the expansion, Johnson didn’t have health insurance. She experienced excruciating pain from untreated endometriosis and uncertainty about her health, as two of her brothers had skin cancer lesions removed, she said.
“I was younger and didn’t care, but if anything were to happen, then I would have been screwed,” Johnson said. “But now I’m an adult, and I have responsibilities.”
If the expanded subsidies expire, South Carolina’s uninsured rate is expected to increase 34%. That’s more than double the expected national average of 16%. The change will most impact rural areas, with an expected 20% of people lacking coverage in some areas, according to the study.

Inflation in the years since Congress expanded the subsidy means people are even less likely to be able to afford to pay for the difference in premiums, the study found.
“We don’t want to go back to the times when people were deciding whether to feed themselves or buy their medicine,” said Sue Berkowitz, a lobbyist for Appleseed Legal Justice Center and a member of CoverSC, a group pushing for Medicaid expansion.
Risa Strauss, who oversees educational programs at Beth Shalom Synagogue in Columbia, said she won’t go without health insurance.
She worries too much about what might happen to her daughter and 6-week-old granddaughter if something were to happen to her, she said.
“I just know I have to stay healthy for them and for me and for the kids I work with here and for the families and the parents,” Strauss said. “There are things that we triage in life, personal things, and health care has to be a triage at this point.”
If the expansion goes away, Strauss makes just over the 400% of poverty cutoff, so she would lose the aid entirely.
The synagogue can’t offer its small staff health insurance, so she expects to get a so-called catastrophic health plan to protect herself in worse-case scenarios, as opposed to the plan she has now, which covers more routine care.
Even with the relatively low premium, the 63-year-old anticipates it will be double what she currently pays, racking up a bill of more than $1,000 per month for a plan that covers less, she said.
That means Strauss will have to cut back on any spending beyond the essentials, such as purchases to help the synagogue or trips to New York City to visit her new granddaughter, she said.
“Can I eat? Yes. Will I have a roof over my head? Yes,” Strauss said. “Can I live life in the modest way that I’ve been living it? No, that will absolutely change. There’s just no way.”
‘A true ecosystem’
People without health insurance are less likely to go to the doctor to address health concerns early, said Dr. Mayes DuBose, a Sumter physician and past president of the state Medical Association.
For example, someone without insurance experiencing early symptoms of developing treatable Type 2 diabetes might avoid seeking out medical treatment for fear of not being able to pay, DuBose said.
“Then, all of a sudden, you have advanced Type 2 diabetes with organ damage and all of the consequences that come from that,” DuBose said.
More severe illnesses mean more extensive and expensive treatment, DuBose said.
Providing that care, especially to people who are uninsured and can’t afford to pay, puts more of a strain on the health care system as a whole, he said.
“Health care is a true ecosystem,” DuBose said.
Hospitals will have to either absorb the extra cost or pass it onto other patients, DuBose said. If hospitals can’t make up the difference, as may be the case in rural areas, they may have to close their doors, according to the public health institute.
Fewer hospitals, or decreased demand for certain care, could mean fewer health care industry jobs. And more people with severe illnesses means more people calling in sick to work, Lourie said.
People are “going to be sick. They’re going to be unhealthy. They’re going to be out of work,” Lourie said. “It’s unfortunately going to result in a very ugly storm for the people of South Carolina, one that won’t go away quickly.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/doctor-1024x618.jpg,,,2025-06-17 14:05:48.614805

(Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)Advocates representing the group Advance Carolina and a coalition of progressive nonprofits gathered in front of the North Carolina Legislative Building Tuesday morning to raise awareness about the mental health of Black people.
Speakers from a variety of backgrounds targeted the state budget, asking lawmakers to support increased funding for mental health services in schools and communities and halt the dismantling of mental health resources in public education. Speakers also called lawmakers to demand accountability from federal leaders for failing to meet the mental health needs of vulnerable groups.
Turquoise LeJeune Parker, the media coordinator at Lakewood Elementary School in Durham, said she came to speak not just as an educator, but also as a mom, an activist, a citizen, a taxpayer, and a witness to what happens without sufficient funding in schools.
She emphasized that what’s happening to the education system is not an accident.
“We’re watching arts, music, counseling, and essential support services get cut every year — and those are not just services, but those are real people — while are prisons are fully funded and billionaire tax breaks are handed out like candy, chronic underfunding hits Black and Brown schools and under-resourced districts hardest,” Parker said.
This isn’t a new challenge, Parker pointed out. Rather, she said, it’s the continuation of an “incredibly deep injustice.”
“When educators of color or others from marginalized communities don’t see themselves reflected or supported, it sends a clear message that you don’t belong here, and that must change,” Parker said. “We must be the ones to change it.”
Drew Washington, a youth organizer with Education Justice Alliance, talked about mental health and Black youth.
He said one of the greatest challenges in addressing men’s mental health is starting the conversation.
Often, when Black men are growing up, they’re told what they should be before they’re given a chance to figure out what they want to be, Washington said, referring to stereotypes of becoming a rapper or football player instead of a doctor or lawyer.
“We aren’t given the agency on what we want to do, the person we want to be when we grow up,” he said.
Washington emphasized the importance to begin the conversation earlier, when kids are still young.
Samuel Scarborough is a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an organizer with their chapter of their NAACP chapter.
He said young people are the innovators of the future, but they’re also in a crisis.
“Since 2017, the Black youth suicide rate has risen faster than any other ethnic group in the past two decades,” Scarborough said.
The issue has deep roots, he said. But funding for mental health programs, support for K-12 schools, and jobs for working class families would make a difference.
“When our incomes don’t keep up with the ever-rising cost to live, that attributes to the Black mental health crisis,” Scarborough said. “When we’re going to schools that can get shot up any given day… that fuels the Black mental health crisis.”
Scarborough asked lawmakers for more money to support existing and future mental health initiatives for Black communities, not only across North Carolina, but across the country.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1039-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-17 13:10:26.624392

(Photo by Jim Neuter)All legislation seeking to roll back rights for transgender people in Maine has now failed after the majority of the Senate on Monday rejected a bill that would have banned transgender girls from participating in girls sports.
That means that despite pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration, Maine will continue to uphold the right for trans students to participate in sports that align with their gender identity.
The state’s policies have come under scrutiny over the past few months, with the Department of Justice launching a lawsuit against the state for allegedly violating federal anti-discrimination protections in addition to repeated threats from several agencies to cut federal funding.
Last week, House lawmakers advanced LD 233, which sought to ban trans girls from playing on girls’ teams. It was the only bill out of eight anti-trans measures that a majority of lawmakers in the lower chamber supported, with four Democrats joining with Republicans to advance the bill. During the floor debate, many argued that the bill was not intended to punish trans students, but to bring fairness to athletics and preserve girls’ spaces.
However, on Monday, the Senate voted 21-13 to reject that bill as well as other measures not supported by the House, including bills aiming to ban trans students from bathrooms, locker rooms (LD 868) and trans people from single-sex shelters (LD 1337).
Later in the evening, both the House and Senate voted to insist on their respective positions, effectively killing the measure, since the chambers could not agree.

In late 2023, New York City Education Department officials approached historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela to be the lead scholar on a new curriculum focused on Jewish American history. The project would be part of the city’s Hidden Voices initiative, centering diverse historical figures left out of typical textbooks.
Petrzela, a history professor at the New School, was initially surprised. Though a historian of American politics and culture — her book, “Fit Nation: The Gains and Pains of America’s Exercise Obsession,” is being turned into a documentary — Jewish studies is not her primary field of study. But the more she understood the goals of the Hidden Voices project, the more she realized how well-suited she was for the task.
“The work of amplifying ‘hidden voices’ who may not be central to conventional historical narratives is core to what I do as a teacher and a scholar,” said Petrzela, who began her career as a New York City classroom teacher. “Also, much of my scholarship has been about the teaching of divisive issues in K-12, particularly around identity, and the controversy that often follows.”
Education Department officials said the materials will be available to all students next school year. They are also piloting the resource in five New York City districts that will provide feedback on the lessons. City schools already have access to Hidden Voices materials focused on LGBTQ history, Asian American history, the African diaspora, and Americans with disabilities.
Officials had announced the Jewish American materials were forthcoming as well as materials focused on Muslim Americans after a rise in antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents increased following the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel and devastating war in Gaza that followed. Lessons on the Latino community are expected to be completed by the end of the school year.
Petzrela hopes that students and teachers will not only learn about a series of important individuals but also be inspired to ask new questions about the nation’s past and present. The project was also especially meaningful for Petzrela post Oct. 7.
“As a Jew, in addition to my professional roles, I have been speaking up when I think appropriate to address the unfortunate polarization that I see taking hold in many educational environments and our culture,” she said, noting that education is a critical way to get beyond this. “I hope that learning about Jewish experiences and identity across history — and not just in regards to the Israel/Hamas war — will take the temperature down on some of those conversations, and make them more informed and empathetic.”
Petzrela spoke recently with Chalkbeat New York.
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Why did it feel so important to take this project on?
It was disappointing, if not totally surprising, to me that the New York City schools did not already have a coherent set of materials to teach Jewish American history, given how important Jews are in New York City history and vice versa. For me, witnessing the disturbing aftermath of Oct. 7 in many educational environments, including, but not limited to, New York City, infused real energy into addressing that omission. That is, I think the antisemitism that we have seen flare is due, at least in some part, to ignorance.
I was horrified and depressed to see false claims and antisemitic tropes circulating unchallenged at schools and colleges, supposed bastions of enlightenment and inclusion, but I realized that despairing or engaging in an endless game of what I describe as “antisemitism whack-a-mole” was depleting and unproductive.
I remain idealistic that education can be an important part of the solution to this situation, and leading Jewish American Hidden Voices, or JAHV, feels like a valuable way to make a proactive and unique contribution.
It’s hard to discuss this project in isolation from what’s been happening in some New York City public schools since Oct. 7, not only with the high-profile incidents, like the Hillcrest High School teacher targeted by students over her support of Israel, but also a broader rise of antisemitism in schools. We recently saw the chancellor issue apologies for “offensive” communications that went out to educators and families. How do you hope the Hidden Voices materials can combat some of what’s been happening in schools?
I hope that it contributes to reducing the antisemitism that has been on display not only in NYC but in many other places, as it will be freely available online. I think JAHV adds something really important to two existing approaches to teaching about Jewish experiences: Holocaust and antisemitism education, the former is required in many states, and the latter is often introduced as the result of an incident.
Hidden Voices is complementary but very different, as it introduces Jewish-American experiences as intertwined with the long span of U.S. history, and widens the lens beyond incidents of antisemitism and the specific and seismic trauma of the Holocaust, although it of course addresses both as well.
Can you tell us about your process? How long have you been working on it? Where did your research take you? How did you decide what to keep and what to cut?
After I accepted this offer, we set about brainstorming two lists: of individuals to include as profiles and of experts we hoped would write for us. The hardest part was cutting both of those down and finessing them to be representative in a range of ways.
The idea of Hidden Voices is to highlight individuals in an identity group that has often been overlooked in history, and also to teach about people who are not only the most famous figures in a given group. So, yes, there are profiles of luminaries such as Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis and poet Emma Lazarus, but also of fascinating figures, such as Harry Lender, the entrepreneur who made frozen bagels a supermarket staple, and Nancy Lieberman, the basketball star and women’s sports trailblazer.
One way we distilled the list was to focus on people whose stories illuminated aspects of Jewish American identity and that allow teachers to make fruitful connections to broader historical themes, both to deepen and challenge them. While this is a project of the NYC schools, and New York City is clearly such an important site in American Jewish life, we also really tried to select individuals whose lives and careers took them all over the country, itself an effort to challenge the stereotype of the “New York Jew.”
As for what we decided to keep in or cut, it was important to me that we explain, in every profile, how a figure’s Jewishness related to their life. For some of the figures we profile, being Jewish is a major part of their identity and career; for others, it can feel almost incidental. To us, that difference in itself is important in understanding the different ways Jews have inhabited their identity throughout U.S. history.
We kept in mind that it was especially important to resist any simplification of figures to heroes or villains, especially if there was a risk of perpetuating stereotypes. Our contributors did a great job with this.
What were some of the most surprising things you learned while doing the research?
I am not sure about surprised, but as challenging as this sprawling project is, I was gratified at how easy it was to illuminate so many diverse realms of American culture through the experiences of Jews in this country. This tiny minority — about 2.4% of the United States population today — has made incredible contributions, from the arts to athletics to organizing to industry, and it was not all that difficult to convey this range and diversity through our materials. Now people just have to use them!
Are there any figures that you’re especially excited for students — and teachers — to learn about?
Don’t make me choose — they are all so good! But since I absolutely love using pop culture to get at deeper historical themes, I am biased to be especially excited about profiles like that of Gold Rush entrepreneur Levi Strauss, who gave us denim as we know it, and of Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the Holocaust survivor who got a generation of Americans talking openly about sex.
I’m wondering if you have thoughts about teaching Holocaust history in a post-survivor world?
When I was growing up, it was almost commonplace to learn about the Holocaust through survivors who would generously give talks at all kinds of venues, including schools. I remember their bracing accounts like it was yesterday. That era is all but over, and I think Hidden Voices will be one resource valuable in teaching about some of that history that too many people are ignorant of, or even deny. While [Jewish American Hidden Voices] is not organized around the Holocaust, this tragedy is so central to understanding modern Jewish experiences that, of course, it is addressed across our materials.
In general, what is your hope for how students and educators engage with these materials?
On the broadest level, I hope that these materials push educators and students to think about who identity-based curricula are for. Yes, of course, it is important for minority groups to “see themselves” represented in curricula, but I think that ambition is far too parochial for our current reality. We should all be curious about each other’s experiences, because when we turn inward and away from each other, we are left with an incomplete and inaccurate picture of the past and are ill-equipped to engage in our complicated present. Because Jews are such a tiny minority, I hope a curriculum like this sparks people to think about this question and invigorates them to commit to a pluralism and universalism that I personally think is the beating heart of a healthy community, in the classroom or beyond.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Excluding the money he loaned himself, Reid Rasner raised less than $35,000 for his failed attempt to unseat a U.S. senator last year.
This year, the 41-year-old Wyoming Republican says he’s assembled more than a million times that amount to buy the social media app TikTok and potentially move its operations to South Dakota.
South Dakotans following the story on his $47.45 billion bid since mid-April, through traditional media channels or on social media outlets like Instagram or TikTok, have likely seen the term “billionaire” attached to Rasner’s name.

But his background offers no definitive proof to support that descriptor. Instead, disclosures filed during his Senate campaign show a self-employed financial adviser who owns some real estate, sells used goods on eBay for a sizable portion of his income, and is more than $1 million in debt due to a loan he received from a family trust.
Even so, he’s won over South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, who’s sung Rasner’s praises in press releases and television appearances.
Rhoden appeared with Rasner on May 23 at Dakota State University in Madison, where Rasner said South Dakota is the “front-runner” for the U.S. headquarters of TikTok. 
“South Dakota is lucky to have such a visionary governor,” Rasner said.
Meanwhile, the Cowboy State Daily news outlet in Wyoming reported earlier this month that Rasner “has maintained he would bring the company to Wyoming.” The outlet quoted Rasner saying “I’m from Wyoming and have always championed Wyoming.”
Wyoming lawmaker calls effort ‘self-promotion’
TikTok’s Chinese parent company is under congressional order to sell the app or be banned from the United States, due to concerns about the Chinese government’s potential access to Americans’ data. President Donald Trump has delayed the ban and is encouraging a sale, while reportedly considering another extension beyond Thursday’s deadline.
Rumored or confirmed bidders include Oracle and Amazon, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian.
South Dakota Searchlight messages sent to TikTok on its interactions with Rasner Media — or lack thereof — were not returned.
Federal appeals court upholds rapidly approaching TikTok ban

Rhoden and his lieutenant governor are the only high-level politicians in South Dakota to have publicly voiced support for Rasner so far, but some other officials outside of the political sphere have followed the governor’s lead. The Board of Regents, South Dakota Retailers Association, and South Dakota Chamber of Commerce and Industry have each endorsed Rasner’s vision.
Rasner has gathered less support for his TikTok bid in his home state. 
A spokesperson for Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon told South Dakota Searchlight that the governor wants to “respect the president’s deliberative process to procure the organization he feels is best-suited to operate the platform.”
John Bear, a Republican state lawmaker from Gillette and a leader of Wyoming’s Freedom Caucus, said he doesn’t think Rasner’s bid is legitimate.
“It seems to me that this is a publicity stunt, just like his last run for Senate was,” Bear said. “I went and listened to him speak one time, and I didn’t get a feel that he was doing anything other than self-promotion.”
Little information forthcoming on TikTok bid
Rasner calls his TikTok bid the most Trump-friendly, pointing to a post on Trump’s Truth Social as proof. In it, Trump, without offering any comment, shared a link to a story about Rasner from a site called JustTheNews.com with the headline “TikTok’s highest bidder is also its most Trumpian.”
Rasner Media, the company Rasner says will buy TikTok, was founded on Feb. 17, exactly one month after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law forcing the social media site to be sold. Two days later, the Rasner Media website announced the $47.45 billion bid. Rasner posted his first video to his personal TikTok account in early March.
His media company’s website posted a press release in mid-April headlined “South Dakota Leaders Back Rasner Media’s TikTok Deal, Urge Trump Administration Support.”
Rasner has disclosed little about who his investors are but said during his Madison visit that he’s lined up “more than” $50 billion.
He’s also still asking for money.
Rasner’s FoundersTok website — which recently still said an American TikTok would be headquartered in Wyoming — sells hats and T-shirts, and asks people to invest in advance of the sale at differing support levels. 
Pledge $12,000 a year, and you’ll be a “Founding Father” who gets content boosts, early access to new features, discounts on premium features and a blue verification badge.
“No payment will be requested until after Rasner Media acquires TikTok,” the site promises.

Rasner Media has also issued a press release about a “major financial and strategic partnership” with a company called Adaly, which was founded last year. 
The press release calls Adaly “a leading organizational intelligence platform.” But in reality, Adaly appears to be in its formative stage.
A January story from a publication called Marketing Brew said Adaly was “pitching to indie agencies and brands” and had raised $1.2 million in seed funding to launch its AI marketing venture.
When reached via text message, Adaly co-founder Kyle Csik did not respond to questions and referred South Dakota Searchlight back to the Rasner Media press release on the partnership.
Rasner Media also recently announced support for its TikTok bid from “a coalition of over 50 conservative content creators with a combined audience of more than 15.5 million followers” who say they’ve had their voices silenced on the platform. 
Neither the press release on the influencers’ support nor a TikTok video announcing it mention a financial commitment from the influencers.
Questions about billionaire status
When asked in Madison about the gulf between his fundraising clout on the campaign trail and the multibillion-dollar offer he’s presented for TikTok, Rasner told South Dakota Searchlight that the bid is “business, not politics,” while declining to disclose details.
Earlier, in a mid-April phone interview, Rasner said “it’s called ‘private equity’ for a reason.”
A press release on the Rasner Media website about Trump’s Truth Social post refers to Rasner as a “Wyoming billionaire,” and several media outlets have referred to him as a billionaire since. Dakota State University’s marketing office referred to him as a “Wyoming billionaire” in a press release on his visit to the school with Gov. Rhoden.
Rasner is not on the Forbes list of billionaires. 
When asked in April if he is a billionaire, Rasner told South Dakota Searchlight “I guess you’ll have to get my financial statements.”
“Everything’s going to be disclosed soon, who the investors are and how much the investments are,” Rasner said. “I will certainly provide all of that very soon, as soon as we get the deal taken care of.”
U.S. Senate candidates are required to file financial disclosure statements with the Select Committee on Ethics. In one of the reports he filed during his failed Senate campaign, Rasner reported $108,000 of self-employment income from Omnivest Financial, the company name under which he offers wealth management services. He reported earning another $70,000 through eBay, an auction site on which he sells goods such as vintage police badges, cowboy boots and aluminum beach chairs under the name “Omnisellers.”
Rasner’s disclosure forms also list commercial real estate, from which he collected between $15,001 and $50,000 in rent, a mutual fund worth less than $100,000, and unimproved land in Casper, Wyoming, worth less than $15,000.
Owes more than $1 million to a family trust
Rasner additionally disclosed a liability of between $1 million and $5 million, due to a loan he received from a family trust at a rate of 5% interest over a 20-year term. 
Meanwhile, his reports to the Federal Election Commission show that he loaned $1.2 million to his own Senate campaign.
A September letter from the commission to the Rasner campaign approved a request to terminate the 2024 campaign committee, but noted the campaign treasurer had failed to submit the required letter from Rasner signaling forgiveness of the loan.
Noem’s TikTok ban kills tourism account, leaves other state entities mulling options

The commission asked the campaign treasurer to submit the missing information. The information has yet to be filed.
Rasner’s Senate financial disclosures divulge little about the trust that loaned him the money, listing it only as a “family trust” in Casper, Wyoming. South Dakota Searchlight found public records of trusts registered under Rasner’s name and his mother’s name, but the values of the trusts are not public records. 
Both trusts are listed as owners of property in Natrona County, Wyoming, according to the county assessor’s office. 
The trust under Rasner’s name owns a dental office whose address appears on his Senate financial disclosures as his rental property. 
The trust under his mother’s name is listed as the owner of a handful of properties in the county. The properties include the building that once housed her former family business, Wyoming Glass, and properties owned by her deceased former husband, who was a gravel contractor.
South Dakota politicians skeptical
Multiple South Dakota state lawmakers either declined to speak on the record about Rasner, or did not return calls and texts seeking comment.
Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, said he’s unfamiliar with the details of the TikTok pitch from Rasner, but said he has his doubts. Efforts to bolster employment opportunities for Dakota State graduates who’ve developed and honed high-tech skillsets are welcome, he said, but he’d want to see a firmer business plan to be convinced the Rasner deal is a real opportunity.
“Until we see an actual plan and some actual investment, I’m not holding my breath,” Muckey said. 
Former longtime lawmaker Lee Schoenbeck, a Watertown Republican who retired as president pro tempore of the state Senate, told South Dakota Searchlight that his knowledge of Rasner’s TikTok bid is limited. Schoenbeck suggested that Rasner’s position as a maker of promises in the economic development sphere, however, is not a unique one in South Dakota history. 
He pointed to examples including a hoped-for aquaculture facility in the city of Madison that received state assistance in 2019 but has never been constructed. While he can’t speak to Gov. Rhoden’s motivations or level of due diligence in the TikTok bid, Schoenbeck said economic development work requires a governor and his team to do the necessary homework to avoid too-good-to-be-true pitches.
“These kinds of people are all over,” Schoenbeck said.
Wyoming politicians ‘incredulous’ about Rasner claims
Rasner’s U.S. Senate campaign wasn’t his first run for public office. In the 2010s, he ran unsuccessfully for the Las Vegas City Council. He and his then-husband — they’ve since divorced — were living in the city at the time. Rasner sold real estate.
As an 18-year-old, Rasner ran unsuccessfully for city council in Casper, Wyoming, which is his hometown. 
His Senate campaign website’s biography says he “landed his first job sweeping floors at Wyoming Glass” at age 13 — without mentioning that the company was his family’s business — and that he began investing at age 16.

“These formative experiences laid the groundwork for his entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to financial independence,” the website reads.
Bear, the Wyoming state lawmaker, said he hasn’t spent time looking into Rasner’s background because “he was never a serious candidate.”
In the U.S. Senate primary last year, Rasner presented himself as the most conservative option on the ballot. He said incumbent Republican Sen. John Barrasso wasn’t a strong enough supporter of Donald Trump.
Trump endorsed Barrasso, and Rasner lost by 43 points.
On the way to his Senate primary loss, Rasner was served a cease-and-desist letter by Wyoming Republican U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman. The letter asked that he remove photos he’d taken with her from his campaign social media sites, because according to Hageman, the photos erroneously suggested she’d endorsed him. Rasner told the Cowboy State Daily it was an attempt to stifle his free speech.
A representative from Hageman’s office did not respond to Searchlight requests for comment. Barrasso’s office also did not respond.
Bryan Miller was recently elected chairman of the Wyoming Republican Party, and said he couldn’t comment for the party. That said, he personally was “not  impressed” with Rasner during their interactions last year, when Miller led the Sheridan County GOP.
Miller said he asked Rasner who was funding his U.S. Senate campaign, but Rasner wouldn’t tell him.
“I said, ‘Well, because you can’t tell me, you’re not likely to ever get my personal support, or anyone else I know’s support, because we want to know where money comes from,’” Miller said.
The situation with the Hageman photograph turned Miller off, as well.
“The thing he did with Harriet, trying to get pictures, he tried to do that with me at the state convention, but I wouldn’t do it,” Miller said.
From where Democratic state Rep. Mike Yin sits, it appeared that the opposition party got “annoyed” with Rasner’s efforts on social media. 
Yin said a lot of people in Wyoming were “utterly incredulous” when Rasner first announced his TikTok bid, especially after he raised so little for his U.S. Senate campaign from sources beyond his family.
“So the idea that he could convince people to give $50 billion?” Yin said. “It seems like he’s trying to raise his own profile.”
Rasner hasn’t announced his intention to challenge Wyoming’s other Republican U.S. senator, Cynthia Lummis, in 2026. Rasner has created a new fundraising committee, though, and loaned it a little more than $48,000. His disclosure forms identify it as a U.S. Senate campaign committee.
South Dakota comes along for the ride
It’s unclear how much South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden knows about Rasner. 
Rhoden’s spokesperson, Josie Harms, confirmed that Rasner reached out to South Dakota first, not the other way around, about the TikTok bid. Rasner told South Dakota Searchlight he’d done outreach with governors from all the surrounding states.
Rhoden has since appeared on news segments with Rasner, which Rhoden has shared on his own X (formerly Twitter) page. After the press conference at Dakota State University, Rhoden said on The Scouting Report podcast that Rasner’s team is “ready to go,” but that South Dakota may need to offer incentives to data centers if it hopes to land technology companies.

Lawmakers rejected a bill that would have offered tax breaks to data centers during this winter’s session of the South Dakota Legislature. Rhoden could offer assistance in other ways without needing legislative approval, such as offering a grant or loan from the Future Fund for economic development, which is under the governor’s control.
Among Rasner’s other supporters, the Retailers Association and Chamber offered their support at the same time as Rhoden first did, in mid-April. Nathan Lukkes, head of the state Board of Regents, sent a letter of support for the Rasner bid just over a week later.
“We are ready to position South Dakota as the launchpad for the next generation of secure, ethical, and impactful digital media,” the letter reads.
David Owen, president of the South Dakota Chamber, told South Dakota Searchlight he got a call from Joe Fiala, deputy director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, shortly before the first press release mentioning South Dakota was issued by Rasner Media.
“It was, ‘Here’s an opportunity. You’ve got 12 hours,’” Owen said.
Owen said his organization had nothing to lose. 
“What’s your risk by suggesting publicly it would be a good thing?” he said. “And if it doesn’t come about, what are you out?” 
Northern State University Government Professor Jon Schaff said there could be reputational damage to the governor “if Rasner turns out to be something of an empty suit.”
“To the extent they are depicting themselves as partners rather than mere supporters-encouragers, yes, there is potential backlash,” Schaff said.
Rhoden’s spokesperson, Harms, declined to comment about Rasner’s financial disclosures, political aspirations and TikTok investors.
Rasner declined to respond directly to a dozen questions on his companies, political ambitions, investors and personal life. He sent a statement through a spokesperson that accused South Dakota Searchlight of approaching this story with a “tone and accusatory nature” that is “completely unprofessional.”
“Your biased attacks will not deter Rasner Media’s mission to free TikTok from Chinese control,” the statement said, in part.
 



 Reid Rasner statement

In response to a dozen questions from South Dakota Searchlight about his finances, his bid for TikTok and other topics, a representative of Reid Rasner sent an emailed statement.
Here is that statement in full:

        “While we respect the media’s role and have cooperated with credible outlets, the tone and accusatory nature of your questions toward Mr. Rasner are completely unprofessional. Rasner Media’s TikTok acquisition efforts are a business transaction, not a political campaign. Mr. Rasner is unapologetically one of the most pro-Trump, MAGA businessmen in America, dedicated to protecting conservative voices on platforms like TikTok. This has naturally drawn opposition from Communist China and parts of the Democrat machine, including outlets like yours. Your biased attacks will not deter Rasner Media’s mission to free TikTok from Chinese control, support President Trump’s efforts to establish a United States sovereign wealth fund, and protect conservative influencers who are being censored by foreign adversaries and woke leftists behind keyboards.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EM8A2593-1024x813.jpg,,,2025-06-17 12:19:15.229459

DemasA federal court has denied yet another attempt to dismiss Canadian energy company Enbridge’s case against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, continuing to uphold a previous decision that the case presents an exception to the state’s immunity to lawsuits. 
Assistant Attorney General Dan Bock argued in March that Enbridge’s challenge, filed as a response to Whitmer’s decision to pull the permit allowing the company to operate its Line 5 pipeline within the Straits of Mackinac, should be dismissed. Bock argued the pipeline company’s claims were blocked by the 11th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prevents federal courts from hearing certain lawsuits against states.
However, the court ultimately determined that Enbridge’s lawsuit was not barred by sovereign immunity, denying Bock’s motion to have the case dismissed. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While Bock later filed a petition for a rehearing on the matter, Judges Karen Nelson Moore, Rachel S. Bloomekatz and Raymond M. Kethledge denied that request in an order Monday, bringing an end to the third attempt to have the case thrown out. 
Enbridge’s case against Whitmer is one of many centered around the controversial pipeline, which stretches from northwestern Wisconsin through Michigan into Sarnia, Ontario. 
Whitmer, alongside Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, several Native American Tribes and a bevy of environmental organizations have filed a number of challenges to keep the 70-year old pipeline from operating in the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet, citing environmental concerns should the pipeline rupture. 
While the company has sought to place a new segment of the pipeline into a concrete-lined utility tunnel as a measure to protect against a spill into the environmentally sensitive straits, activists have argued this plan would still bring harm to the environment, and carries the risk of a potential spill during construction. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has scheduled virtual public meetings beginning Wednesday ahead of a shortened public comment deadline of June 30 as it works to complete its long-awaited environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel project.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_6586-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-17 12:19:15.229459

Music on vinyl is a rising trend among younger generations - and for good reason.,"I collect vinyl records, like many Gen Z music lovers. Why? It started during the pandemic.
While helping my dad clean out a closet, I found milk crates stuffed with old records, along with a record player. My dad began reminiscing about collecting records as he showed me the intricate art and lyric sheets his collection came with. I was intrigued and asked him to set up his record player, but he was hesitant. I decided to force his hand by going online and buying my first record, “Mm..Food,” by MF DOOM. This kicked off my record-collecting hobby and got my dad back into it.


I’m not alone in my love for record collecting. Vinyl collecting is a rising trend. Last year’s U.S. sales broke a 40-year record, totaling over $1.4 billion. This figure represents only newly pressed vinyl and not purchases of secondhand vinyl.
One benefit to buying vinyl is that vinyl has a different sound than digital music. While there is much debate over which sounds better, there is undoubtedly a difference between the two. Vinyl has a much warmer sound compared to digital music. This gives the music a unique sound and added character that you can only get from an analog format. This combined with the excitement of buying a new record and putting it on the turntable for the first time is something tactile that you can’t get from streaming music.

Thomas Bakula
You also don’t have to worry about ads or any of the other irritations that streaming services force on you unless you pay for their premium service.
Another reason to buy vinyl is because covers can also function as artwork. This applies to the front and back covers of a record, as well as the inside of the cover on certain albums. The records themselves have also become pieces of art. Along with the traditional black vinyl, you can get vinyl in other colors, translucent vinyl and vinyl with designs printed on them. This has led to people using records not just for music, but also for decorative purposes.
The final reason you should consider buying vinyl is because it can help support artists and local record stores. Artists make fractions of a cent from steaming services, with Spotify giving them $0.00318 per stream, which their label gets a cut of. Vinyl royalties are complicated, but artists can make from nothing to $3 per record or CD sold, and this number can be even higher depending on the deal they have with their label.  If they are independent and handle their own record sales, that gives them an even larger cut. This also helps local record stores keep around 35% of the cost of the records for themselves, which helps support a local business.
But most of all, vinyl offers a unique sensory experience in an age in which everything seems locked behind a screen. Records give us a break from our screens, they give us great music and they help support the artists we love. It’s no surprise to see why records have become so popular among my generation, and they should only become more popular as time goes on.

Johnny Szlauderbach, director of communications and strategic projects at Freedom’s Frontier, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that “everything’s in a bit of a crisis state right now in terms of government funding.” Congress allocates about $500,000 annually to the organization, he said.
“If anybody really cares about preserving this history, about this region’s significance on a national level, and about building economic development in these small towns and helping these small sites thrive, I would encourage you to contact your representatives on Capitol Hill and tell them about how important Freedom’s Frontier’s continued existence is,” Szlauderbach said.

President Donald Trump’s administration has yet to release congressionally approved funding for National Heritage Areas, pending congressional action on proposed legislation to defund the program, which is administered through the National Park Service.
On Friday, Democratic U.S. Reps. Sharice Davids Kansas and Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri sent a letter to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget urging the release of funds for Freedom’s Frontier and other National Heritage Areas.
“This delay in funding is causing significant strain on our NHAs — many of which rely on small staffs and robust volunteer networks,” they said in their letter.
The 62 National Heritage Areas are supported through public-private partnerships that require local matching funds. The areas recognize historic, cultural and natural resources, with an emphasis on preservation, recreation, tourism and educational projects.
Freedom’s Frontier, which unites more than 200 sites across 41 counties in eastern Kansas and western Missouri, preserves the story of the border war that preceded Kansas’ entry into the union, the enduring struggle for freedom and the settlement of the western frontier.
“This area is interesting in that it’s served as a kind of microcosm for concepts of freedom throughout American history,” Szlauderbach said, from the abolition of slavery to the fight for women’s suffrage, to the landmark legal battle that ended segregation in public schools.
“This is a testing ground. We serve to be stewards of that nationally significant story,” Szlauderbach said.
Freedom’s Frontier encompasses sites as large as the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri, or the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park in Topeka, and as small as the Little House on the Prairie Museum in Independence, Kansas.
The National Park Service board recently designated Quindaro Townsite in Kansas City, Kansas, as a National Historic Landmark, pending approval from U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.
Szlauderbach said Freedom’s Frontier also partners with volunteer-run “passion projects” like historical societies or the preservation of one-room schoolhouses in “very rural locations.” Freedom’s Frontier is in a unique position to connect those sites and can help with grant writing, he said.
“All we want to do is make sure that people understand that these stories are nationally significant,” Szlauderbach  said. “And beneath all of that, this program really, truly promotes economic development and tourism. If somebody goes and visits one of our partner sites, they have to stop at a local gas station along the way. They’re going to eat lunch at some local diner.
“We’re trying to build these small towns and bring money to rural communities. That’s fundamentally, in essence, what we do. And so it’s disappointing when people in Washington don’t necessarily appreciate that.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Jessie Lawson made an appointment for Monday morning as soon as she heard about the Kansas Court of Appeals ruling Friday that allows Kansans to change the gender markers on their licenses.
As a trans Kansan, Lawson said, she was thrilled about the court order.
Then, she was turned away.

  Jessie Lawson, a 43-year-old trans woman, was turned away from a driver’s license office on June 16, 2025, when she tried to change the gender marker on her license. (Submitted)

“I’ve gone to great lengths to match my body to who I am, and to have this document show the wrong gender is insulting,” Lawson said. “It’s embarrassing.”
Lawson waited all morning in the parking lot of the Andover driver’s license office in hopes of getting an explanation from officials. Meanwhile, meetings in Topeka resulted in a decision to prohibit implementing the change.
Attorney General Kris Kobach instructed the Kansas Department of Revenue, which houses the division of motor vehicles, not to make gender marker changes while the matter is in litigation, said Zach Denney, a spokesperson for the department.
The Attorney General’s Office intends to appeal, and Denney said he expects it to be soon.
Danedri Herbert, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General’s Office, confirmed the stance.
“We can’t start instantly implementing those changes right now because we have some time to appeal the decision,” she said.
Parties typically have a 30-day window after a decision to appeal it. Procedurally, it is unclear whether the decision goes into effect immediately following a ruling or until the end of the 30-day appeals window.
Herbert, who is also chair of the Kansas Republican Party, said there has been no gray area in the Attorney General’s Office.
The 56-page decision from the appeals court panel Friday reversed an injunction from a Shawnee County District Court judge who ordered the state to stop allowing gender marker changes on driver’s licenses. The appeals court decision only applies to the injunction. The case itself, and its merits, were remanded to the district court to be decided by a new judge.
Kobach was quick to express in social media posts Friday his dissatisfaction with the decision and his appetite for an appeal.
In a statement, Kobach said the ruling contains “multiple factual errors” and a “deeply flawed” legal analysis. He expected the court “to be more careful,” he said.
“In addition, the Court improperly attempts to strip jurisdiction over the case away from the district court judge — which is highly unusual,” Kobach said. “We will be asking the Kansas Supreme Court to review this case in an expedited manner and overturn the Court of Appeals decision.”
The revenue department has allowed Kansans to change their gender markers since at least 2007, but a 2023 state law required vital statistics to recognize a person’s biological sex at birth, conflating the distinction between “sex” and “gender.” Kobach sued the revenue department after it continued to allow transgender residents to change their gender markers.
The constant uncertainty has been a maddening and distressing experience for Lawson. She called the legislation “bogus” and “hurtful.” Having her motives and identity questioned frequently is tiring, she said, especially when she just wants to be a regular citizen.

Sandra Baxter appeared Tuesday before Ingham County Circuit Court Judge James Jamo to accept a plea deal offered by the Michigan Department of Attorney General. She faced a charge of perjury for lying to investigators about the extent of her fundraising efforts for the Unlock Michigan ballot proposal, which sought to repeal the state’s gubernatorial emergency powers law in the early days of the pandemic.
Baxter on Tuesday pleaded guilty, instead, to one count of knowingly providing a false or misleading statement to a police officer during a criminal investigation. The charge carries a sentence of one year in jail and or a $2,500 fine.
Baxter raised money for the Michigan! My Michigan! fund associated with former Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake). It is alleged that she funneled money raised by the Shrikey-associated fund to Unlock Michigan, offering wealthy donors some cover to hide their donations to a politically-sensitive effort.
In court on Tuesday, an assistant attorney general said Baxter now admits to providing a false or misleading material statement to law enforcement, and that the state would not be seeking jail time for Baxter. It would be seeking the maximum fine.
Baxter told Jamo she understood the charges and agreed to plead guilty.

Attorney General Dana Nessel also charged Heather Lombardini, the head of Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility, or MCFR, with forgery as a result of the same probe into Unlock Michigan. Lombardini was the president of the MCFR, which also was associated with Shirkey, and was the treasurer of Michigan! My Michigan! It was alleged that Lombardini acted similarly as Baxter – that she encouraged some of Michigan’s wealthiest businesspeople and political funds associated with large businesses to donate to MCFR with the intention of moving that money to Unlock Michigan’s signature collection effort to move the initiative forward.
Either way, the prosecution was aimed at deterring others from abusing the non-profit political campaign fund system, which Nessel said was currently run amok by politicos bending the rules and without recourse because Michigan’s campaign finance law was mostly toothless and needed stronger regulation of 501 C(4) accounts.
Long-term deterrence remains an open question
A former political strategist and an attorney who jumpstarted investigations into Baxter and Lombardini both say Nessel missed an opportunity to charge Shirkey and Unlock Michigan’s political donors in a conspiracy to commit a crime.
The assertion came from Bob LaBrant, a longtime former Republican government affairs strategist and consultant, and Mark Brewer, a seasoned campaign finance and election attorney and the former Michigan Democratic Party chair, following the disclosure of donor names associated with the Unlock Michigan ballot committee scandal that resulted in criminal charges against Baxter and Lombardini.
Shirkey and the donors involved were not charged with crimes in the matter. The charges that were brought against Baxter and Lombardini were for perjury and forgery, respectively, and only in the context of Michigan’s campaign finance laws.
That said, the investigations and subsequent prosecutions of Baxter and Lombardini may not have materialized if LaBrant and Brewer hadn’t made two complaints highlighting what they believed were active attempts by the two funds to hide who was donating to Unlock Michigan for the purposes of collecting signatures.
In interviews with Michigan Advance, LaBrant and Brewer said that instead of going after Baxter and Lombardini, the attorney general should have charged Shirkey and the multitude of donors in a criminal conspiracy to launder money from the political non-profit funds to the effort to gather signatures for Unlock Michigan.
“I think there was a criminal conspiracy here,” Brewer said. “I think that they knew what they were doing was illegal. In some of the documents disclosed, Shirkey clearly knew that people were making contributions to these [nonprofit campaign funds] as conduits to Unlock Michigan. He was in charge of Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility, a [fund] set up and established by the Senate Republican Caucus, and while his name wasn’t on the board of directors, he clearly controlled it.”
Labrant said similarly, noting that although neither the consultants charged in the scheme nor the donors themselves fully understood the difference between using one nonprofit fund to raise money and use another as a “laundromat,” it was still clear to him that what transpired was a criminal conspiracy.
“If we really wanted to put a stake to the heart of dark money, [the attorney general’s office] should have charged a number of these people with criminal conspiracy,” Labrant said. “Including some of the business owners.”
A request seeking comment from the Michigan Department of Attorney General was not returned at the time of publication. Shirkey also did not respond to a request for comment.
The scheme laid bare in court
It was alleged that Lombardini actively raised funds for Unlock Michigan via Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility by telling wealthy donors and corporations that they could donate to the latter and those funds would go to the former without anyone ever knowing about it. She was charged with uttering and publishing and forgery, but the uttering and publishing charges were  dropped following a preliminary examination in Lansing’s 54-B District Court. 
Baxter was alleged to have lied to investigators about the situation when asked about her fundraising efforts for Michigan My Michigan and their association with Unlock Michigan. Baxter was given the opportunity to correct her statements under oath and chose not to do so, the department alleged. She was subsequently charged with perjury and was bound over by the same district court to stand trial.

While Baxter’s plea means she will no longer have to face trial, Lombardini’s situation is still up in the air. Although she has been bound over to face trial, a hearing before Ingham Circuit Court Judge Wanda Stokes was held on June 4 to determine if the bind over order should be thrown out. Stokes said she would have a decision soon.
It was at that hearing on June 4 in which the Michigan Department of Attorney General disclosed what was described as a treasure trove of emails showing Lombardini had allegedly assured donors to Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility that their money would be given to Unlock Michigan. There was also an alleged understanding that no one would ever know that the donors were actually funding early signature gathering operations for Unlock Michigan because the money would be moved from one fund to another. 
Also detailed during that hearing was a list of 15 donors who were initially not disclosed, which included some businesses and also Dick DeVos, the former 2006 Michigan GOP gubernatorial nominee, and husband of former U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.
The names of donors to political 501 C(4) organizations on Internal Revenue Service Form 990s are typically redacted, even as the forms are open for public inspection. In unredacted documents obtained by the attorney general’s office via subpoena, a list of 15 once-shielded political donors to Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility were finally exposed on June 4 as giving approximately $1.35 million to the fund.
According to information compiled by The Detroit News, the list includes:

Grand Rapids businessmen Dan DeVos and Dick DeVos, who both gave $50,000; 
J.C. Huizenga, the founder of Huizenga Group, who gave $25,000;
Michigan Energy First – a DTE affiliate – which gave $100,000;
Health Alliance Plan – a Henry Ford Health affiliate – which gave $20,000; and
Dan Hibma, husband of former Secretary of State Terri Land, who gave $25,000;

For Brewer, the end goal was never to have Baxter or Lombardini prosecuted – it was to disclose the political donations being made to Unlock Michigan under a cover of darkness. To that end, Brewer told the Advance that he was pleased to see those names and donations released publicly.
“The people of Michigan have a right to know who’s funding a ballot question committee [a political fund] to hide donors. It’s not only illegal, but it just serves the public,” Brewer said. “After several years of fighting, we finally have most of the disclosure. We don’t have all the donors disclosed, but we’re making progress finally.”
That said, LaBrant noted that the disclosures made in court show that Shirkey and the donors acted in concert to further an unlawful scheme.
Part of the disclosures made in court on June 4 included emails in which Lombardini and Shirkey had told donors to Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility donors that their contributions would be funneled to the ballot question committee Unlock Michigan and that they would have some plausible deniability if asked about the contributions from Democratic stakeholders, much like Whitmer’s office.
In LaBrant’s view, existing case law holds that if two or more persons make an agreement to violate the law or to do an unlawful act, it meets the definition of a criminal conspiracy. That includes making a contribution to a 501 C(4) organization – which is not illegal in and of itself, but is done to basically hide contributions from the disclosure laws – and then have that money be used with knowledge that it’s going Unlock Michigan.
“I’m not an attorney, I’m just the guy that filed the complaint,” LaBrant said. “It just seems to me that there was an opportunity lost to have a little bit more significance [in the charges].”
LaBrant said Nessel’s prosecution of Lombardini and Baxter would likely have some deterrent effect, but it was unknown if the initial sting would last years into the future for wealthy donors seeking to conceal their contributions in the same manner.
“They will probably be very reluctant to engage in that kind of behavior again,” LaBrant said. “But guess what? Five years from now, 10 years from now, who’s going to remember that? If they had gone after Mike Shirkey, every Senate majority leader in the future would say, ‘wait a second, I’m not going to do this.’”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Resized_20250617_104912-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-17 12:19:15.229459

.","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

More than two months have passed since Converge, Mississippi’s sole Title X (“ten”) family planning grantee, had its federal funding withheld — and already, communities across the state are feeling the strain.
More than 90 clinics in Mississippi receive funding from the Title X family planning program to provide care to people in need. However, on April 1, Converge, a Mississippi non-profit, was notified by the US Department of Health and Human Services that the grantee’s Title X funding was being withheld while the agency reviews Converge’s compliance with President Trump’s recent executive orders.
As a patient advocate and someone who has personally relied on Title X-funded services for care, I’ve seen firsthand the difference these clinics make. For many, they are the first—and sometimes only—place to turn to for timely, affordable reproductive health care like birth control, STI testing and treatment, cancer screenings, infertility counseling and more. Today, that care hangs in the balance. 
I still remember walking into a Title X clinic at a pivotal moment in my life — uncertain and in need. There, I received not only essential care but also compassionate counseling from providers who treated me with dignity. With Title X-funded providers already forced to stretch scarce dollars, my experience reinforced their critical role in filling a growing need for care across communities.
For so many in Mississippi, these clinics are more than a health care provider. They represent a place of safety and trust.

With Title X funding on hold across the entire state since April 1, providers are working tirelessly to stay open. But the reality is, without critical support made possible by Title X, clinics are being forced to charge for services that were once free or at reduced cost. And for patients, that often means delaying care—or going without it altogether.
These decisions have real consequences. Mississippi already faces the highest maternal mortality rate in the country, with Black women disproportionately affected. Access to preventive, affordable care can help address these disparities — but only if that care remains available.
The Title X program plays a vital role in Mississippi’s health care safety net. Clinics funded by Title X serve thousands of Mississippians every year — many of whom live in rural areas, are uninsured or face other barriers to care. When funding is disrupted or withheld, the impact is felt immediately. It becomes harder for providers to keep their doors open. Staff members face layoffs. And patients lose access to the care they’ve come to rely on. 
At Converge, so much progress has been made over the years to create reliable access points to care. The organization has built a statewide provider network grounded in excellent, expanded care into underserved areas through telehealth and clinicians trained in providing patient-centered care. But that progress has now come to an abrupt halt. 
I recently traveled to Washington, D.C., to share my story with members of the Mississippi congressional delegation and highlight the extraordinary role that the Title X program plays in people’s lives. Because behind every clinic, every program and every policy are real people — people whose lives and futures depend on continued access to care.
That’s why I’m urging Congress and the Trump administration to act quickly to restore Title X funding. Now more than ever, this program is essential to keeping our communities healthy and strong. 
Mississippians deserve reliable access to the care they need to thrive and stay healthy. I hope leaders at every level will listen and respond with the urgency this moment calls for. Lives — and livelihoods — are on the line.

Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images (file art)LINCOLN — A 25-year-old Georgia man was arraigned Monday in Atlanta on charges of making threats across state lines against Texas Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Nebraska Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, federal prosecutors announced.

A federal grand jury last week indicted Robert Davis Forney, of Duluth, Georgia, for allegedly leaving voicemails at Fischer’s office and Cruz’s. Prosecutors say he threatened “sexual violence” against both senators, Cruz on Jan. 9 and Fischer on Jan. 10. Authorities say Forney left multiple voicemails threatening “sexual violence” against Cruz and his family.
“Threatening our elected officials and their families is an act of violence that undermines our entire democracy,” said U.S. Attorney Theodore S. Hertzberg, who oversees federal prosecutions in north Georgia. “Political discourse and disagreements never justify resorting to vile attacks against our nation’s leaders.”
The Justice Department prosecution comes on the heels of the successful manhunt that ended Sunday for a Minnesota man who allegedly assassinated a Minnesota lawmaker and shot another.
The increase in political violence follows a 2024 in which violent threats against lawmakers reached a record high for the second consecutive year.
President Donald Trump, a Republican, survived two assassination attempts during his bid to return to the White House. This year, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, had an arsonist attack the Governor’s Mansion, and two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed in Washington, D.C.
Fischer offered no immediate comment Monday on the indictment. The FBI and the U.S. Capitol Police are investigating the incidents, according to the release.
Congressional staffers in recent years have reported increases in the number of angry calls from the public. Most calls from the public to congressional representatives and senators are answered by young staffers who are often college-aged.
“Targeting public officials with threatening messages is a serious federal crime,” said Paul Brown, the FBI Atlanta special agent in charge. “There is no place for political violence or threats of violence in the United States. We will not hesitate to arrest and charge others who engage in similar criminal conduct.”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)June 17 arrives here, as always, like a brooding shadow over sunny South Carolina.
On that day 10 years ago, Dylann Storm Roof brutally murdered nine worshipers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.
State lawmakers, sadly true to form, have let another legislative session expire without closing the so-called “Charleston loophole” that allowed Roof to purchase his murder weapon.
If South Carolina lawmakers can’t learn anything from this massacre after 10 years, they may be unteachable.
The loophole allows gun sales to proceed by default after three business days even if a background check has not been completed.
In the wake of the June 17, 2015, massacre, other states acted to protect their citizens by closing or limiting the Charleston loophole.
They looked at the Charleston massacre as a wake-up call, a grim teachable moment.
Some states had already fixed the problem before the Charleston shooting, recognizing the loophole as a dangerous gap in the federal background-check system — a disaster waiting to happen.
In all, 22 states have enacted pragmatic policies to give law enforcement more time to complete a thorough background check. Those states supported the ability of law enforcement, in short, to do their job.
Meanwhile, the state whose largest city gave the loophole its name has done nothing.
A red flag ignored
The Charleston loophole allowed Roof, an avowed white supremacist, to obtain a weapon in South Carolina that he should not have been able to legally purchase.
Arrested on a felony drug charge months before the Charleston shooting, Roof admitted to Columbia police to being in possession of drugs. That should have prevented him from buying a .45-caliber Glock pistol.
But the FBI didn’t complete his background check within three business days.
More than 90% of federal background checks are completed in minutes. A background check that takes longer than three days often is a red flag that something is seriously wrong.
Background checks delayed more than three days are four times more likely to result in a denial determination, according to the gun violence prevention organization Everytown.
Between January and mid-November 2020, the FBI flagged nearly 6,000 gun sales because a purchaser who could not legally possess a firearm was able to buy one due to the Charleston loophole, according to Everytown.
Among those whom Roof murdered in his racially motivated attack was Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the church’s beloved pastor and a state senator.
Protecting the well-being of South Carolinians is a fundamental responsibility of state government.
South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson in warning June 14 “No Kings” protesters against violence called South Carolina “a law and order state.”
Actually, South Carolina is one of the most lawless states in the nation: ranking eighth in the overall violent crime rate in 2023 (ninth when including Washington, D.C., which tops the list).
I reached out to the press spokesman for Wilson by phone and email twice to see if Wilson, our state’s chief law enforcement officer, supports closing the Charleston loophole. He did not respond.
On the federal level, meanwhile, there’s a glimmer of hope. U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn has launched another effort to close the loophole nationwide, according to reporting by the SC Daily Gazette’s Shaun Chornobroff.
Instead of letting a gun sale go through after three business days, the bill would give the FBI up to 20 business days to conduct a stronger background check, Chornobroff reported.
But Clyburn is unlikely to get much support from congressional Republicans, especially in gun-crazy South Carolina.
The wrong direction
On the state level, lawmakers have not only refused to address the Charleston loophole, they’ve taken the state in the wrong direction, loosening gun laws — such as the permit-less carry law.
South Carolina remains one of the worst states in the nation for gun violence. The state rose from 11th highest in the nation in the rate of gun deaths per 100,000 residents in 2021 to 10th highest in 2022, when including Washington, D.C. (in ninth place), according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
A memorial for the Emanuel 9: Close the ‘Charleston loophole’

South Carolina should not be loosening gun restrictions but tightening them up — mandating universal background checks, enacting red-flag laws and requiring the safe storage of guns.
Closing the Charleston loophole, meanwhile, should remain a top priority.
A year ago today, I wrote that state lawmakers could best honor the Emanuel Nine by finding the courage to close the Charleston loophole by the 10th anniversary of the massacre.
Now that anniversary is here, and lawmakers have chosen to dishonor the memory of the Emanuel Nine with a shrug of the shoulders.
But the fight continues, led by Clyburn and South Carolinians at the grassroots level.
We can’t change the tragic past, but we can create a safer future.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A key figure in a loan scam in which more than $45 million in credit was sought from 19 Nebraska and Iowa banks has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
Jesse T. Hill, 35, of Hickman, entered a guilty plea in U.S. District Court, federal prosecutors announced this week.
Hill was an investment adviser to Lincoln businessman Aaron Marshbanks, who committed suicide in November 2022 as word of the fraudulent loans spread within the banking community.
  Several banks issued loans of about $2 million to now-deceased Lincoln businessman Aaron Marshbanks based on a financial statement that showed he had more than $6 million in an investment account. The statement was fabricated, according to several lawsuits. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
Hill, who operated as First SOJO Capital Group, LLC, would accompany Marshbanks to banks when he applied for loans, mostly about $2 million each. Hill would produce fraudulent financial statements indicating falsely that Marshbanks had sufficient assets to obtain the loan.
Hill, according to federal investigators, knew the representations being made to the financial institutions were false and were done with the intent to defraud.
According to court records, the scam perpetrated by Hill and Marshbanks — a former star athlete at Lincoln Christian High School — began in 2020. They eventually prompted banks to seek more than $30 million in restitution from the Marshbanks estate for unsecured loans.
State investigating what could be Nebraska’s largest bank fraud

Another $22 million in loans were found to have been secured by residential rental property that Marshbanks had purchased in Lincoln, Omaha and as far away as New Orleans.
State banking officials have said that Marshbanks had suffered catastrophic losses from investments due to “a highly aggressive options trading strategy” by his financial adviser, Hill.
The Examiner first broke this story in December 2022, in what has been described as possibly the largest bank fraud case in Nebraska history.
The scheme sent shockwaves through the banking and Lincoln Christian communities over how a devout father, who was involved in charitable causes, could have fooled so many bankers.
Some of the funds obtained by Marshbanks were used to build a luxury home and barndominium east of Lincoln.
As part of the plea agreement, Hill agreed to pay restitution and forfeit his interest, if any, in a property in Puerto Rico and a PC-12/47E Pilatus Aircraft that had been purchased via a Charles Schwab account held by Marshbanks.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline DeLuca scheduled Hill’s sentencing for 3 p.m. on Sept. 11 with U.S. District Court Judge Susan M. Bazis. Hill faces up to a maximum penalty of 30 years’ imprisonment, a fine of up to $ 1 million and a mandatory special assessment of $100.
A handful of civil lawsuits have been filed against Hill as well.
Shortly after news of the scandal became public, the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance obtained an injunction that blocked Hill from disposing of assets or destroying financial documents. The department alleged several violations of state securities laws, including that Hill converted investments for personal use and lied to investors.
This isn’t the first time Hill has faced sanctions. In 2018, the state Banking Department fined Hill $7,500 and ordered him to repay investors after authorities discovered he had sold more than $4 million in unregistered securities to 47 investors through a firm called JT Equity.

Saint Francis Hospital has taken a significant step forward in cardiac care with the installation of the SOMATOM Pro.Pulse, a next-generation CT scanner from Siemens Healthineers.
The hospital is now home to the most advanced CT imaging system in Delaware — and one of only seven currently installed in hospitals across the United States.
“There has been a significant increase in the demand for cardiac CT since the Chest Pain Guideline was published, and with care equity across geographies of critical concern, expanding access to Dual Source CT will be a game-changer for many patients,” says Oleg Teytelboym, MD, chair of radiology at Saint Francis Hospital. “The Pro.Pulse is the most-advanced CT scanner within the state of Delaware, and one of only seven in the entire United States currently in hospitals.”
The new scanner comes amid a broader shift in frontline medical imaging, where cardiac CT has become the first-line recommendation for evaluating chest pain and increasingly complex clinical conditions.
The SOMATOM Pro.Pulse offers improved access to high-quality imaging, especially for patients who may have previously faced challenges with traditional CT scans — including children, those with irregular heartbeats, and individuals who require sedation.
The Pro.Pulse’s advanced features include AI-assisted scanning, spectral imaging, and patient comfort enhancements like mood lighting and visual instructions. These innovations not only improve image quality but also make the experience less stressful for patients and more efficient for technologists.
By simplifying workflow and reducing scan time, the system allows staff to focus more on patient care.
“Comfort features, in tandem with workflow technology, really simplify the scanning process. It keeps the focus on the patients while generating the best scans,” says Dr. Teytelboym.

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A North Dakota federal judge said he shares the Trump administration’s opinion that the American Bar Association is too left-wing.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the White House has revoked millions of dollars in federal funds for the association and sought to limit its status as a major regulator of the legal profession. Critics allege this is part of a larger effort by the administration to silence opposition, and to reduce transparency and accountability in government.
In a speech to State Bar Association of North Dakota members last week, U.S. District Court Judge Dan Traynor said while the merits of the White House’s actions are “certainly debatable,” he agrees that the association is politically slanted.
Traynor, a Trump appointee, claimed the American Bar Association has consistently taken a left-of-center stance on politically divisive issues despite being officially nonpartisan. The organization has supported gender-affirming health care for minors, abortion access and affirmative action, for instance.
The association has for years criticized Trump, including with respect to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and the administration’s treatment of judges and lawyers that cross the executive branch. The association on Monday filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration accusing it of bullying lawyers and law firms that take clients and cases that the president doesn’t like. 
While the American Bar Association mainly supports attorneys, judges and law students, it has also provided services to the general public, like screening nominees for federal court.
Traynor said he supports the organization’s defense of the courts, but thinks it has given outsized attention to the Trump administration and ignored other attacks on the judiciary. He criticized the American Bar Association for not commenting on the leak of a draft U.S. Supreme Court opinion in the case that overturned Roe v. Wade, and said it didn’t do enough to condemn past safety threats against Supreme Court justices.
“I am glad the ABA is refocusing on the rule of law, but its refocus seems to be, sadly, motivated more by the occupant of the White House than conviction. And the Trump administration has taken notice,” Traynor said, according to a copy of his speech shared with the North Dakota Monitor.
The White House has pulled grants to the American Bar Association that went toward services including legal assistance for immigrants and support for attorneys that work with domestic and sexual violence survivors. The organization has sued the executive branch over the cuts, and some of this funding has been reinstated.

Recently, the Trump administration said it will also no longer help the American Bar Association screen judicial nominees by facilitating access to information like bar records, which could shield appointees from public scrutiny.
Traynor’s comments came a day before American Bar Association President Bill Bay delivered his own address to North Dakota state bar members.
Bay didn’t directly address Traynor’s criticisms, but maintained that the organization is nonpartisan and its policies are decided by a majority vote of delegates at its meetings.
He also said the American Bar Association has a responsibility to speak out against conduct by the Trump administration it deems uncivil or unlawful.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Sophie and Colin Hortman, the children of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, issued a statement Monday calling on people to honor their parents’ legacy by doing “something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.”
The Hortman children are grieving following the Saturday killing of their parents, in what has been called a political assassination. Rep. Melissa Hortman was a longtime Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislator beloved around the Capitol even as she scored major legislative victories. 
“We are devastated and heartbroken at the loss of our parents, Melissa and Mark. They were the bright lights at the center of our lives, and we can’t believe they are gone. Their love for us was boundless. We miss them so much,” the release said. “We want everyone to know that we are both safe and with loved ones. We are grateful for the outpouring of love and support we have received, and we appreciate your respect for our family’s privacy as we grieve.”  
The Hortman children thanked law enforcement for their efforts, which led to the arrest of suspect Vance Boelter on Sunday night. Boelter also wounded Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, though they are on a path to recovery. 
The Hortman children emphasized the legacy that their parents will leave behind. 
“Our parents touched so many lives, and they leave behind an incredible legacy of dedication to their community that will live on in us, their friends, their colleagues and co-workers, and every single person who knew and loved them,” the release said. 
The Hortmans asked that people do an act of kindness in the memory of their parents’ commitment to service, sharing a list of suggestions.
“The best way to honor our parents’ memory is to do something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.” 
They suggested planting a tree, telling a dad joke, and baking something to share — “bread for Mark or a cake for Melissa”. 
“Pet a dog,” was on the list “A golden retriever is ideal but any will do.” 
The Hortman family’s dog, a golden retriever named Gilbert, was euthanized after he was injured in the shooting. Hortman originally trained him as a service dog before he became a permanent member of the family.
Sophie and Colin Hortman ended the statement with a call to action. 
“Hope and resilience are the enemy of fear. Our parents lived their lives with immense dedication to their fellow humans. This tragedy must become a moment for us to come together. Hold your loved ones a little closer. Love your neighbors. Treat each other with kindness and respect.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250616_0037-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-17 11:03:11.387627

Jerry Moran and U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas share concern about consequences of personnel shortages at National Weather Service offices.,"U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, urged the U.S. Department of Commerce to remedy President Donald Trump's ""indiscriminate"" personnel cuts at the National Weather Service that compromised the ability of the Goodland, Kansas, station to provide forecasting services 24/7. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of NWS forecast site)TOPEKA — U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids denounced Tuesday “indiscriminate” staffing cuts at the National Weather Service that limited operations of the Goodland, Kansas, facility serving 80,000 people in three states.
Davids, a Democrat serving the 3rd District in Kansas, said the Goodland office of NWS lost its ability to deliver regular 24/7 forecasting services due to downsizing of personnel.
“Every single person in this country relies on the NWS in their daily lives,” Davids said. “This agency is a top priority for public safety and national security, and indiscriminate cuts have only worsened the success of our nation’s weather forecasting.”
Davids said consequences of President Donald Trump’s elimination of NWS personnel prompted a plan to fill gaps at NWS field offices by reassigning employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and by hiring more than 100 meteorologists, scientists and technicians.
“This clearly demonstrates that the Trump administration’s scorched-earth approach to the federal workforce was reckless, dangerous and inefficient,” Davids said.
U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, said he secured a national exemption for the NWS from a federal hiring freeze to enable the agency to hire forecasters. The Goodland office stopped night-time forecasting during May due to staffing shortages, he said.
Moran proposed legislation exempting NWS employees from any executive order or memorandum imposing a hiring freeze.
“As we work to install new technology and modernize the National Weather Service, it is important the NWS is able to continuously fill critical public safety roles as they become vacant to make certain communities across the country receive timely, accurate weather data,” Moran said.
In a letter to U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Davids said the NWS facility in Pleasant Hill, Missouri, which served much of her Kansas City-area congressional district, also was dealing with meteorology vacancies.
Davids said the commerce department ought to outline the geographic distribution of new NWS staff and offer a timeline for restoration of 24/7 operations.
Kansas farmers rely on weather data supplied by NWS for producing agricultural crops, she said. Kansas has routinely been been hit by severe storms, damaging winds, flooding and tornadoes, she said.
“Just days after the Goodland facility ceased around-the-clock services, an EF-3 tornado touched down just one hour away,” Davids said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Goodland-radar-map-of-weather-nws-1024x560.png,,,2025-06-17 11:03:11.387627

Janet Mills (right) along with Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey convened a meeting of five northeastern governors and six Canadian premiers to discuss their shared challenges and opportunities under the Trump administration. (Photo via Gov. Janet Mills/ Facebook)Five northeast U.S. governors and six Canadian premiers and ministers on Monday met at the Massachusetts State House to grapple with taxes on imports, also known as tariffs, as well as how some workers are fleeing the U.S. as their federal research funding is cut or withdrawn, and the drop in visitors coming over the border amid President Donald Trump pushing for Canada to become the 51st U.S. state.
Gov. Maura Healey hosted her counterparts inside the library of the Massachusetts State House, saying the gathering grew out of a meeting she had with Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who traces her ancestry back to Nova Scotia, after Trump announced a new tariff strategy in April, one he has wavered on in the weeks that followed. Canada counts the U.S. as its largest trading partner, and now faces American tariffs on its goods that are expected to be passed onto U.S. consumers.
Monday’s convening of governors and premiers was an attempt at a show of unity, to offer a message that the Canadian provinces and northeast U.S. states were “open for business” with each other and see China as the common foe, despite whatever the Trump administration says in Washington.
Tariffs are already affecting Maine’s craft brewing industry, Mills said by way of example, noting that aluminum and packaging materials used by the industry come from Canada.
But they also acknowledged as the leaders of states and provinces, they have more limited powers than federal officials. The meeting came as leaders from the G7 countries — the U.S., Canada, Italy, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom – convened in Alberta. Healey and her counterparts, which also included the governors of New York and Vermont, expressed hope some comity and trade deals could emerge from that G7 gathering.
But there was still daylight between the two camps. After Healey noted that tourism numbers in the northeastern states are down anywhere between 20 to 60%, a reporter asked the Canadian officials at the meeting whether they would encourage their residents to come to America and spend money this summer, or ask people to send a message to Trump by keeping their tourism dollars out of the U.S. economy.
The Canadian officials demurred. Ontario Premier Doug Ford pitched his province, saying it’s twice the size of Texas. But he added, “We need to get through this, and we’re stronger together. And keep an eye on China. They’re laughing. They’re sitting back laughing.”
New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt said Americans have to relay to Trump that the tariffs and threats of annexation are hurting the U.S. economy. “I can’t tell Canadians to come visit the U.S. right now,” she said. “I’m going to tell them to go and see my neighbors in Nova Scotia, I’m going to tell them to spend some time at home because the relationship has been challenged by leadership. We need to get back to normal. That’s what we all want.”
Holt also indicated that Canada sees the situation as an opportunity to attract the “brightest and best” research and development workers as they face federal funding cuts in the U.S.. “Maybe we’ll borrow some of the folks, and then we’ll give them back and build the kind of connected partnerships between our research organizations that will stand through the test of time,” she said.
Rhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee said a larger group of governors and premiers should be convened. “This dialogue today has been very eye-opening to me. What’s been said from our colleagues here in Canada, we need to listen to,” he said. He then referred to Trump without saying his name, adding, “This rhetoric that is going on, creating division, needs to stop. A meeting like this helps get that message going but it needs to continue to happen.”

In a recent study, researchers found more pediatric firearm deaths in states with looser gun laws. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.

In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.










When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can't save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death.


– Dr. Marie Crandall MetroHealth medical center chief of surgery, Cleveland


In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.

“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”

And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

Stein “has failed to demonstrate … that the General Assembly’s act is unconstitutional,” a three-judge panel wrote in their Monday order.
The three judges were Justin N. Davis and Matthew T. Houston, Republicans, and R. Stuart Albright, a Democrat.
Stein has argued that the law “threatens the safety of North Carolinians” and was unconstitutional. The governor would be unable to remove the commander, he argues, even if he were to “commit serious criminal misconduct.”
Attorneys for House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) and Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) said the governor’s case lacked substance and standing.
“Gov. Stein’s lone grievance is that he has lost the power to fire Col. [Freddy] Johnson at his pleasure — a power the governor believes the constitution guarantees him,” they wrote. “The governor’s grievance does not warrant judicial relief.”
In a statement, Stein said he was “disappointed” in the ruling that allows the patrol to operate “outside the chain of command and unaccountable to voters.”
“The people elected me to protect public safety, and I will continue to do so,” Stein said.
Control of the highway patrol shifted as part of Senate Bill 382, a wide-ranging law passed last year that shifted executive power within state government.
Stein has litigated several parts of the measure. Judges sided with his suit to block changes to the state election board; that decision has been appealed by Republican opponents.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_1282-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-17 11:03:11.387627

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-17 14:21:19+00:00,CT Mirror,Housing advocates worry states can’t fill rental aid gaps if Trump cuts go through,Robbie Sequeira | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/17/housing-rental-aid-trump-cuts/,The Trump administration aims to slash spending and shift the responsibility of housing millions of people to states.,"The Trump administration is pushing to reshape the federal housing safety net by slashing spending and shifting the burden of housing millions of people to states, which may be ill-equipped to handle the mission.
President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
Trump’s hopes for next year
The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Lisa Bowman, director of marketing and communications at the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Bowman wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” she wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

Health insurers are asking Rhode Islanders to pay the steepest premium increases in over a decade for their coverage next year, state insurance officials announced Friday as part of an annual rate review process.
The Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC) released insurers’ recently filed proposals for 2026 premiums, with proposed rate hikes ranging from 21.2% to 28.9% for some individual plans — or nearly quadruple the average 7.8% increase approved last year. Employer-sponsored coverage saw rate proposals ranging from 13.5% to 26.4%, depending on the type of plan.
Cory King, the state’s health insurance commissioner, and his office will decide whether to approve, reject, or modify each rate request, with final decisions anticipated in September. But they won’t have input from the Rhode Island Office of Attorney General.
For the past three years, the attorney general’s office has hired actuaries to review the rate filings and submit recommendations to OHIC. But a spokesperson for Attorney General Peter Neronha said no such review will be conducted this year. It’s a notable departure from past practice given Neronha’s recent emphasis on rate reform to address the state’s damaged health care infrastructure. 
Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for the Neronha, offered a comment via text message Monday.
“The Attorney General’s Office will advocate on behalf of consumers during the administrative hearing on individual market rates, consistent with our statutory obligations,” Rondeau wrote. “Beyond that, based on years of experience participating in this process, we have opted to forego actuarial analyses, which we believe provide very little benefit to consumers. Instead, we’ll redirect these resources towards health care initiatives where we can make tangible impacts.”
In a statement Friday, King acknowledged the “significant additional costs” health insurers are asking working Rhode Islanders to bear.
“These costs represent a significant financial burden and OHIC will scrutinize the insurers’ requests as part of our review to determine whether they are justified,” King said.
As part of the review process, Rhode Islanders can weigh in during a series of public hearings. The two insurers with the largest requested increases for individual coverage — Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island (BCBSRI), and Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island — will be subject to separate hearings when the public can provide feedback. 
The first hearing on BCBSRI’s proposed increases takes place June 30 and July 1 with Neighborhood Heath Plan’s hearings scheduled for July 15 and 16. A virtual town hall on July 24 will cover all requested rate increases. The two insurers with the largest requested increases for individual coverage — Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island (BCBSRI), and Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island — will be subject to separate hearings which will allow the public to provide feedback. 
Premiums vary depending on how people get their health insurance. Work-sponsored coverage is further split into two groups according to employer size. This year’s proposed rates across the three different markets include:

Individual market, for people who purchase their own private insurance: Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island asked for a 28.9% increase, and Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island filed a request for a 21.2% increase. Individual plans are held by 54,339 Rhode Islanders, according to March 2025 data from OHIC.


Small group market, for smaller businesses which purchase employee coverage: Blue Cross asked for 22.2%, Neighborhood submitted 20.3%, and UnitedHealthcare submitted a range of 20.3%-21.2%. Small group plans account for 42,865 people.


Large group market, for plans purchased by large businesses, such those with more than 100 employees. Blue Cross, UnitedHealthcare, Harvard Pilgrim, Aetna, and Cigna requested hikes from 13.5% to 26.4%, averaging 24.1%. A total of 77,654 consumers get coverage through large group plans

OHIC only reviews rates for fully-insured plans, or those in which the insurer assumes financial risk for medical costs. That means the office does not inspect rates for the approximately 65% of Rhode Islanders with self-funded insurance — employer-sponsored plans in which the business, not the insurer, pays workers’ health care claims directly. These plans often contract with insurers for administrative services like claims processing and provider networks, but OHIC does not regulate these premiums. States have limited oversight over self-funded plans because of federal regulations. 
What’s behind steep increases?
OHIC relayed that insurers cited a multitude of cost factors in this year’s sometimes outsized rate requests, such as larger payments to hospitals and providers, increased use of and claims for GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy for weight loss, and tariffs and other economic pressures at the national and global levels. OHIC noted insurers are also looking to build up their reserve margins, or the money companies use to cushion finances so they can pay future claims. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island spokesperson Richard Salit recounted several of these contributing factors in an email Friday, noting that the company already cut 3% of its workforce in March to accommodate rising costs. 
“The requested rates reflect a growing number of complex factors that are making healthcare even more unaffordable for Rhode Islanders,” Salit wrote. “Among the most significant: BCBSRI has experienced an increase in healthcare spending of about 20% over the past two years due to Rhode Islanders receiving more services and costs rising, including for more expensive drugs.”
“These costs have grown faster than premiums and contributed to BCBSRI posting an unprecedented net loss of $115 million for 2024, while reserves necessary to ensure the ability to pay claims during financially challenging times have diminished,” Salit continued.
The proposed 2026 rates also reflect Blue Cross adapting to a recent OHIC requirement that insurers raise payments to primary care providers by 30% by January 2026 — a mandate which drove more than one-fifth of the requested increase for plans. Additional pricing pressure comes from federal enhanced premium tax credits due to expire in 2026 without further action from the U.S. Congress. These would affect about 30,000 Rhode Islanders and comprise about a third of the requested rate increase, Salit said. 
Salit supplied two charts that break down the cost drivers behind BCBSRI’s proposed increases. In the individual market, the biggest contributors include a 10.2% rise in health care costs, the 9.7% impact of the expiring tax credits, and a 5.1% increase tied to new primary care payment mandates. 
For large group plans, major factors include an 8.3% rise in medical costs, a 6.7% shortfall from 2025 premiums, and a 5% bump from the new rule regarding heftier primary care payments.
Similar sentiments were shared by Philip Tracey, a spokesperson for Harvard Pilgrim, in an email Friday: “Affordability challenges persist for consumers and employers. Medical and pharmaceutical costs continue to climb to unprecedented levels — higher than they have risen in decades. The rates filed for our product are a direct reflection of these unabating costs.”
Neighborhood Health Plan’s Elizabeth McClaine, the company’s vice president of commercial products, said via email Friday that the insurer is “participating in the comprehensive review process underway by the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC) as they assess rates for consumer affordability, and provider and insurer financial stability.” 
Researchers and think tanks have also cited hospital costs as one accelerant fueling health care costs. A 2024 analysis by the RAND Corporation study of more than 4,000 hospitals found that private health insurers pay hospitals on average 254% what Medicare pays for the same services, with some states’ private insurers exceeding 300% of Medicare rates. 
According to the report’s summary: “Very little variation in prices is explained by each hospital’s share of patients covered by Medicare or Medicaid; a larger portion of price variation is explained by hospital market power.”
 



  When the public can weigh in


Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island’s individual market rate filing will be reviewed in an administrative hearing on June 30 and July 1. The public can offer spoken comments on June 30, from 6-7 p.m., and on July 1, at 9 a.m., at the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission at 89 Jefferson Blvd. in Warwick.

The events – and hundreds like it around the country – were held to coincide with ceremonies later in the day in Washington, D.C., to celebrate President Donald Trump's 79th birthday and the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)A clash of contrasting political viewpoints was to be expected when hundreds of “No Kings” protests were scheduled across the country Saturday to coincide with President Donald Trump’s birthday bash and the 250th anniversary celebration for the U.S. Army in our nation’s capital. 
That all the events unfolded with relatively few violent incidents is remarkable, especially in light of poor messaging choices from groups such as the Louisiana Freedom Caucus. 
Comprising the farthest right members of the state legislature, the LAFC thought it important heading into the weekend to issue a “Public Service Announcement.” It reminded people that a state law approved last year “provides civil immunity to any driver who reasonably believes they or their passengers are in immediate danger from individuals illegally blocking a public roadway, and who uses their vehicle solely to retreat or escape the threat.”
Less than seven months since a fatal terrorist vehicle attack claimed 14 lives on Bourbon Street, this propaganda from the Louisiana Freedom Caucus could not have been more poorly crafted or timed. 
The hyperbolic statement went on to explain a national organization had “several cities in Louisiana targeted for riots June 14th,” listing all 10 locales where “No Kings” events were planned. The caucus chose to disregard that each city listed has handled parades and events far larger in scope than what unfolded Saturday.
Leaders in the Louisiana Democratic Party slammed the LAFC announcement Friday, comparing its rhetoric to that which compelled white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. to speed through a counterprotest in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, killing demonstrator Heather Heyer.   
In its response midday Saturday, the Freedom Caucus doubled down on its vapid vitriol rather than “read the room.” Its new statement came hours after news had broken that Democratic Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband had been murdered at their home overnight, and Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife had also been shot multiple times earlier in the evening. Their alleged attacker, Vance Luther Boelter, was apprehended late Sunday night.
Unswayed by those events, the LAFC chose to throw fuel on its self-ignited fire rather than soften its tenor or express remorse. The messaging was in stark contrast to that from Gov. Jeff Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill, both Republicans who expressed condolences and condemned the attacks in Minnesota. 
“The Louisiana Freedom Caucus is unapologetic in its defense of every citizen’s right to protect themselves and their families from violent, lawless mobs,” its Saturday statement began. “The LAFC affirms that this message is both timely and necessary with events targeting 10 Louisiana cities today.”
Escaping the obvious grasp of the Freedom Caucus was that each of the “No Kings” events held in Louisiana were done so with the permission of local authorities. That critical fact apparently didn’t fit the LAFC narrative that relies on divisiveness to justify its existence.
Saturday’s caucus statement also attributed current concerns to the “nationwide riots against President Trump in 2020” when “violent agitators overran cities, looted businesses, and targeted police.” Attacks on law enforcement in St. Louis, Las Vegas and Portland, Oregon, were highlighted, as were the 60 Secret Service agents injured outside the White House in May 2020 protests. 
This seems to be what the Louisiana Freedom Caucus foresaw for Saturday, conveniently omitting any reference to the Trump-inspired insurrection attempt Jan. 6, 2021. Maybe the U.S. Capitol Police are just expendable in the LAFC’s eyes. 
LAFC Chairwoman Rep. Beryl Amedee, R-Schriever, also managed to pull off some inverted dogwhistle acrobatics in Part 2 of the public service announcement.
“Instead of condemning the violence by their fellow travelers blinded by hatred for President Donald Trump, Democrats responded with their usual charges of racism,” Amedee said in the statement. “Democrat leadership in this state seems more offended by the notion of citizens defending themselves than by the violence that puts our people in harm’s way.”
Let there be no confusion. The most offensive actions Saturday weren’t from “No Kings” participants or even Trump’s Pyongyang-pretend moment in Washington, D.C. 
No, the true indecencies unfolded in the suburbs of Minneapolis early that morning, and they were also in the words of the Louisiana Freedom Caucus that – perhaps with purpose – condoned such unhinged violence by not calling it out.

Since 2020, 36 states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery department. In rural counties, the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, less prenatal care and higher rates of babies being born too early ( John Moore/Getty Images).Nine months after Monroe County Hospital in rural South Alabama closed its labor and delivery department in October 2023, Grove Hill Memorial Hospital in neighboring Clarke County also stopped delivering babies.
Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.
“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.
Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.
In rural counties the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, studies have found. The share of women without adequate prenatal care also increases in rural counties that lose hospital obstetric services.
And researchers have seen an increase in preterm births — when a baby is born three or more weeks early — following rural labor and delivery closures. Babies born too early have higher rates of death and disability.
 Births are expensive

The decline in hospital-based maternity care has been decades in the making.
Traditionally, hospitals lose money on obstetrics. It costs more to maintain a labor and delivery department than a hospital gets paid by insurance to deliver a baby. This is especially true for rural hospitals, which see fewer births and therefore less revenue than urban areas.
“It is expensive and complicated for any hospital to have labor and delivery because it’s a 24/7 service,” Miller said.

A labor and delivery unit must always have certain staff available or on call, including a physician who can perform cesarean sections, nurses with obstetric training, and an anesthetist for C-sections and labor pain management.
“There’s a minimum fixed cost you incur [as a hospital] to have all of that, regardless of how many births there are,” Miller said.
In most cases, insurers don’t pay hospitals to maintain that standby capacity; they’re paid per birth. Hospitals cover their losses on obstetrics with revenue they get from more lucrative services.
For a larger urban hospital with thousands of births a year, the fixed costs might be manageable. For smaller rural hospitals, they’re much harder to justify. Some have had to jettison their obstetric services just to keep the doors open.
“You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services,” Miller said.
And staffing is a persistent problem.
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon, Indiana, a small town on the border with Kentucky, ended its obstetric services in March after hospital leaders said they were unable to recruit an obstetric provider. It was the only delivering hospital in the county, averaging about 400 births a year.
And most providers don’t want to remain on call 24/7, a particular problem in rural regions that might have just one or two physicians trained in obstetrics. In many rural areas, family physicians with obstetrical training fill the role of both obstetricians and general practitioners.
 Ripple effects

Even before Harrison County Hospital suspended its obstetrical services, some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care, the Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. The closure means the drive could be 50 minutes to reach a hospital with a labor and delivery department, or to see providers for prenatal visits.
Longer drive times can be risky, resulting in more scheduled inductions and C-sections because families are scared to risk going into labor naturally and then facing a harrowing hourlong drive to the hospital.
Having fewer labor and delivery units could further burden ambulance services already stretched thin in rural areas.
And hospitals often serve as a hub for other maternity-related services that help keep mothers and babies healthy.
“Other things we’ve seen in rural counties that have hospital-based OB care is that you’re more likely to have other supportive things, like maternal mental health support, postpartum groups, lactation support, access to doula care and midwifery services,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, whose research focuses in part on maternal health policy with a focus on rural communities.
 State action

Medicaid, the state-federal public insurance for people with low incomes, pays for nearly half of all births in rural areas nationwide. And women who live in rural communities and small towns are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than women in metro areas.
Experts say one way to save rural labor and delivery in many places would be to bump up Medicaid payments.
As congressional Republicans debate President Donald Trump’s tax and spending plan, they’re considering which portions of Medicaid to slash to help pay for the bill’s tax cuts. Maternity services aren’t on the chopping block.
But if Congress reduces federal funding for some portions of Medicaid, states — and hospitals — will have to figure out how to offset that loss. The ripple effects could translate into less money for rural hospitals overall, meaning some may no longer be able to afford labor and delivery services.
“Cuts to Medicaid are going to be felt disproportionately in rural areas where Medicaid makes up a higher proportion of labor and delivery and for services in general,” Kozhimannil said. “It is a hugely important payer at rural hospitals, and for birth in particular.”
And though private insurers often pay more than Medicaid for birth services, Miller believes states shouldn’t let companies off the hook.
“The data shows that in many cases, commercial insurance plans operating in a state are not paying adequately for labor and delivery,” Miller said. “Hospitals will tell you it’s not just Medicaid; it’s also commercial insurance.”
He’d like to see state insurance regulators pressure private insurance to pay more. More than 40% of births in rural communities are covered by private insurance.
Yet there’s no one magic bullet that will fix every rural hospital’s bottom line, Miller said: “For every hospital I’ve talked to, it’s been a different set of circumstances.”

And it might not be enough to feed people for a day, Jim Donaldson who serves on the church’s food pantry board said, looking at the heaping load of food.
The food drive, organized by Michigan Families for Fair Care, is incredibly necessary and appreciated, Donaldson said. But with how much need he sees at the food pantry, now coupled with federal plans to cut food assistance programming for 1.5 million Michiganders, he worries how food pantries are going to be able to bridge the hunger gap.
“There’s so much need and it’s gonna get worse…with the proposed legislation… they won’t be able to survive without going to pantries,” Donaldson. “There’s not much more of a basic need for survival than food, and Christ commands us to feed the hungry.”

Congress is considering a federal spending plan approved by President Donald Trump, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which proposes various cuts to spending, including eliminating nearly $300 billion for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
About 15% of Michiganders rely on SNAP, and more than 59% of Michigan’s SNAP recipients are families with children, according to the Michigan State Budget Office.
Four days a week, a block from the Capitol building, First Presbyterian Church of Lansing feeds 80 to 100 people, including nearby senior citizens, unhoused individuals, veterans and single moms, Donaldson said. Each year, the church’s food supply gets smaller, while demand gets bigger
The pantry gets items from the Greater Lansing Food Bank, which has nearly 100,000 food insecure individuals in its service area, according to Feeding America, though food assistance groups are warning cuts to SNAP will impact every community in Michigan.
The spending plan, mixed with other policies enacted by the Trump administration, is creating a “perfect storm” for hunger that food banks and pantries will not be able to appropriately meet, Ken Estelle, president and CEO of Feeding America West Michigan said in a news release earlier this month.
“Reducing funding for SNAP as well as increased requirements will cause a significant increase in the number of Michiganders seeking food assistance from our food bank,” Estelle said. “We have experienced very high levels of need for food assistance for the past several years, and the potential increase in need because of these budget cuts could well exceed our ability to provide food to everyone in need.”
Michiganders are not in favor of federal plans that threaten to cut food resources to those who need it, Steve Lawson, executive director for Michigan Families for Fair Care, which organized the food drive, said.

Michigan aptly names the card people use to spend their SNAP benefits, the Bridge Card, because it acts as a crucial part of the state’s infrastructure to get people to a better place in their life when they need help, Lawson said.
“It’s our friends, our neighbors, our family members, veterans, people with disabilities, seniors, who depend on these programs, people who have jobs or people who cannot work because of disabilities or child care needs. It’s people we know who depend on these programs,” Lawson said.
Several cars rolled down their windows during the food drive, honking and exclaiming their support as individuals handed volunteers small bags and big boxes of food to go down the street to feed residents in the Capital city.
Lawson remarked that the food drive went well before loading up the cars with the items, but still he and members of different faith and advocacy groups are calling on Michigan elected officials in Michigan to vote against cutting food assistance and other services residents of the state rely on to help pantries continue serving communities.

Methamphetamine was involved in more than half of Alaska's fatal overdoses from 2017 to 2023, usually in combination with other drugs. (Photo provided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration)While opioids have been involved in most of Alaska’s drug overdose deaths, another drug is a frequent contributor to those outcomes: methamphetamine.
A little over half of the fatal overdoses in Alaska from 2017 to 2023 involved methamphetamine use, most commonly in combination with opioids but also sometimes in combination with other types of drugs, said a new bulletin released by the state Department of Health’s epidemiology section.
The contribution of methamphetamine can be overshadowed by effects of opioids like fentanyl, said Riley Fitting, the state epidemiologist who wrote the bulletin.
Overdose deaths in Alaska typically involve acute opioid poisoning, the bulletin noted. But the health deterioration caused by long-term methamphetamine use, with harm to cardiovascular or respiratory systems or other body functions, can exacerbate impacts of opioid use and make people more at risk of fatal overdoses, the bulletin said.
From 2017 to 2023, about 60% of Alaska overdose deaths were among people who were taking more than one drug, according to state statistics.
Fitting said the combination of opioids, methamphetamine and possibly other drugs can make it difficult to pin down exact causes of individual overdose deaths.
“It’s not always clear-cut,” he said.
It is not common for methamphetamine alone to be the cause of overdose deaths, he said. In only about a fifth of the methamphetamine-involved fatal overdoses recorded from 2017 to 2023 was that the sole drug used, he said.
Statistics about mixed drug use hold lessons for health care providers, the bulletin said.
Emergency responders administering naloxone, an overdose-reversal drug, should be aware that the patients they are treating might also be using methamphetamine and can thus “remain agitated, intoxicated, or at continued risk of adverse effects,” like heart or respiratory problems or psychological problems. That means close monitoring of patients is warranted even after naloxone is administered, the bulletin said. Naloxone, known under the brand name Narcan, rapidly reverses the effects of opioid overdoses.
Medical providers who are treating people for opioid addiction, technically referred to as opioid use disorder, should also consider the potential complications of methamphetamine, Fitting said. Those extend beyond physical damage to behavioral and psychological concerns as the drug is a stimulant that can cause agitation or other problems, he said.
“If someone comes in for a nonfatal overdose, we can’t just assume that opioids are the only substance that was being abused,” he said.
The percentages of overdoses involving methamphetamine in combination with opioids or other drugs has remained fairly constant over recent years, the bulletin said.
But absolute numbers increased. From 2017 to 2023, Alaska’s rate of methamphetamine-related deaths increased by about 25%, the bulletin said.
Those absolute numbers have recently declined.
Nationally, overdose deaths dropped by about 26% in the most recently available annual statistics, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
Declines were reported in almost every state, including Alaska, where overdose deaths hit a record in 2023.
In the 12 months that ended in January, Alaska’s reported overdose death total was more than 10% below the total for the previous 12 months, according to the CDC.
The use of naloxone is one of the factors credited with decreasing overdose deaths nationwide.

Cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, would devastate her young family, Eshawney Gaston, the mother of three, including a one-year-old with sickle cell disease, told NC Newsline outside of Lincoln Community Health Center in Durham on Monday.
Currently out of work, Gaston, who has worked mostly retail and restaurant jobs, said she uses both benefits and couldn’t afford to pay for health care or feed her family without them.

“I’m here for the help,” Gaston said. “If Medicaid is going to help, if food stamps are going to help, then I’m going to use it. I don’t use that stuff because I want to, it’s because I have to. I can’t afford it on these low wage jobs.”
 Gaston, a member of the Union of Southern Service Workers (USSW), later told the crowd that gathered at the health center that she is delaying medical treatment because she can’t afford the portion of the bill she would have to pay. “Who can afford to do that?” Gaston asked. “Rent is a $1,000. Which one am I going to do, go to the doctor or pay my rent?”
Low-wage earners desperately need the help Medicaid and SNAP provide, Gaston said.
“We’re the ones picking up your trash,” she said. “We’re the ones working in your fast food restaurants. We’re the ones in your stores. We make this world go around and I don’t feel like y’all [members of Congress] understand because y’all don’t have to be out here on the ground. You can go sleep in your beds while I’m out here trying to figure out a place to live because [even] affordable rent is too high.”
Gaston was one of three dozen people who came to Lincoln Health Center on a hot and humid June afternoon to protest proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. Lincoln provides comprehensive health care to more than 36,000 patients each year, many of whom are low-income and uninsured.
Pleading with senators
Monday’s rally comes ahead of a larger one scheduled for Wednesday in Raleigh, where activists, union members and supporters plan to march to Sen. Thom Tillis’ and Ted Budds’ offices to demand they vote against President Donald Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which contains the controversial Medicaid and SNAP cuts. The bill has been approved by the House and is now before the Senate.
“The vast majority of people on Medicaid are working and their [the Trump administration] idea that they’ll make things more efficient is just nonsense,” Rob Stephens, a chief organizer for the Poor People’s Campaign of North Carolina and its sibling organization, Repairers of the Breach, said during a brief interview with NC Newsline.
  Rev. Rob Stephens speaks during a press conference in Raleigh last year. (Photo: Greg Childress)
Stephens aded: “They [the Trump administration] are literally going to cut health care to people who qualify for it so that they can give tax cuts to billionaires and fund ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] at unprecedented levels. It will be the largest increase to ICE funding — it’s almost unlimited because they’re already busting the bank.”
Here’s what protesters said is at stake if Trump’s budget bill becomes laws:

255,000 people in North Carolina could lose Medicaid coverage due to new requirements designed to make it harder to get benefits.
Another 470,000 North Carolinians could lose health insurance if Congress lets ACA (Affordable Care Act) subsidies expire.
Medicaid cuts will cost North Carolina $27 billion over the next decade and cut 35,500 jobs in 2026.
Changes to how healthcare providers are paid could cause cuts to programs, services, and healthcare access for low-income people.
With more uninsured patients, safety net healthcare providers like community health centers and hospitals will struggle to stay open.
North Carolina will lose $700 million in SNAP food assistance, at a time of rising food prices.

The proposed $800 billion cuts to Medicaid over the next 10 years would be the largest to the federal program that provides health care to low-income adults, children, pregnant women, seniors and people with disabilities, said Jamila Headley, executive director of Be A Hero, a nonprofit that fights for health justice.
Headley said she asked a group of USSW workers Monday morning how many had been uninsured, unable to afford their medication or hesitated to take a child to the doctor because they couldn’t afford it and every one in the room raised a hand for every question.
“They’re planning to make our health care system even worse,” Headley said. “Across the country, due to cuts to Medicaid and not extending the subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, we’re talking about 16 million people would lose coverage.”
In North Carolina, Headley said nearly 700,000 people could lose health care coverage if the Trump bill is approved.
“People in North Carolina fought hard for years to expand Medicaid and won it just a year and a half ago, and in that year and a half, you’ve had historic numbers of people coming on to Medicaid, 650,000 people added to Medicaid,” Headley said. “We’re talking about erasing that progress if this bill passes.”
 Gov. Stein weighs in

Gov. Josh Stein has sent letters to Tillis and Budd to share his concerns about the impact of proposed cuts to Medicaid and the SNAP on North Carolinians who receive the benefits.
Stein said that under the U.S. House reconciliation bill and impending expiration of health care marketplace subsidies, nearly a half-million North Carolinians could lose their health care.
  Gov. Josh Stein (Photo: Greg Childress)
The governor said recent modeling estimates show that 255,000 North Carolinians are at risk of losing coverage under the Medicaid provisions alone in the House bill and a Kaiser Family Foundation study projected that the combination of Medicaid and Marketplace changes in the House Bill would increase the number of uninsured North Carolinians to an estimated 470,000 if Marketplace subsidies expire at the end of 2025. Marketplace subsidies help individuals and families afford health insurance purchased through the Health Insurance Marketplace.
“North Carolina has taken bipartisan steps to strengthen our health system and protect working families,” Stein said in a news release. “I urge the Senate to continue that progress by opposing these unprecedented cuts to SNAP and Medicaid that would leave North Carolinians, especially those in rural communities, without food assistance and health care.”
Last month, Stein noted in a similar letter to Congress that SNAP benefits help 1.4 million North Carolinians put food on the table. If the federal cuts are enacted, he said, the state would be would forced to spend more than $700 million to continue current benefits.
In addition, Stein said, SNAP benefits are an economic driver that adds nearly $2.8 billion to the state’s economy and supports farmers, grocers and retailers.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4430-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-17 09:04:56.370093

It’s been more than a week since President Donald Trump deployed the California National Guard in Los Angeles without the consent of state officials, and the battle over who has control of the troops is still winding its way through the courts, report CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn and Ben Christopher.
Three judges from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals are expected today to hold a hearing on whether to let the troops stay in L.A. under Trump’s command, or uphold a federal judge’s ruling that would have suspended the deployment and returned the troops to Gov. Gavin Newsom.
The president deployed 4,000 troops from the National Guard — which has a dual chain of command with one leading the president and the other to the governor — by invoking a statute in federal law that details specific conditions when the National Guard can come under federal authority. But the state argues that the clashes between federal immigration enforcement agents and demonstrators protesting against immigration sweeps do not meet those conditions.

In response to some raids carried out by masked immigration enforcement agents, two Democratic Bay Area state senators introduced a bill that would bar, with some exceptions, local law enforcement officers from covering their faces. The measure would also require officers to be identifiable, such as having a badge number or other information, readily accessible.
The bill’s authors, Sens. Scott Wiener of San Francisco and Jesse Arreguín of Oakland, introduced the measure Monday at San Francisco City Hall. They said the bill seeks to ensure public safety by curbing people’s ability to impersonate masked officers, and increase accountability for law enforcement. The bill would make it a misdemeanor to violate the policy, and would not apply to federal law enforcement.

Wiener: “Law enforcement officers are public servants. People should be able to see their faces, see who they are, know who they are. … We’re really at risk of having, effectively, secret police in this country.”

In the last few months, there have been reported instances of people impersonating immigration officers to kidnap or sexually assault others, including in North Carolina, New York and Florida. The suspect in Saturday’s shooting of two Minnesota lawmakers, which left two dead and two others seriously wounded, also impersonated a police officer during the attacks.

Newsom steered work to Villaraigosa

In 2022 Newsom brought on former L.A. Mayor and current gubernatorial candidate Antonio Villaraigosa for a 10-month stint to advise the governor on how to overhaul California’s approach to major infrastructure projects. 
But the nonprofit tasked with overseeing Villaraigosa’s work, California Forward, could not cover his salary alone, and it turned to previously undisclosed corporate donors to shore up funds, write CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff and Byrhonda Lyons.
In total, the nonprofit raised $118,800 from a dozen donors to pay Villaraigosa’s salary. Most of the donors, such as the Port of San Diego, SoCalGas and Southern California Edison, had a vested interest in state infrastructure projects.
State law requires elected officials, including Newsom, to disclose so-called behested payments, which are contributions they solicit for governmental or charitable purposes. But California Forward does not have to, and it provided a list of donors only at CalMatters’ request. 
Some good governance advocates say this financial arrangement is an “ethically suspect” way of using behested payments, since it doesn’t make explicitly clear what the true sources of funding are. But Villaraigosa, who earned more than $380,000 for his work, said he has no problems about how much he earned, and that “it was a huge return on investment for the state.”

After tech mogul and billionaire Elon Musk gave out $1 million checks to voters in swing states last year, one California lawmaker wrote a bill to prohibit people from offering cash “with the intent to induce” others to vote or to register to vote.
As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow explains, in addition to the presidential election, Musk offered $1 million checks in the lead up to this year’s Wisconsin Supreme Court race, as well as $100 to voters who signed a petition opposing “activist judges.” In lawsuits filed against Musk and his political action committee related to the giveaways, Musk’s attorneys argue he was exercising his right to free speech.
Out of a concern that wealthy people will hold more lotteries to boost voter turnout, Democratic Sen. Tom Umberg of Santa Ana has a bill that would make it illegal to pay people, including through lotteries or other prize-drawing contests, based on “whether the person voted or the person’s voter registration status.” The bill sailed through the Senate with bipartisan support and is now before the Assembly.

Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to lead a state infrastructure project paid for by an outside nonprofit. The nonprofit relied on fundraising from special interests to cover the costs, but did not have to disclose the identity of those donors because of how the arrangement was structured.


At the request of Gov. Gavin Newsom, a nonprofit paid former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa more than $380,000 to advise the governor for about 10 months on how to overhaul California’s approach to major infrastructure projects.
Touting his new infrastructure czar back in 2022, Newsom framed the partnership as a way to save taxpayers money. But California Forward, a nonprofit focused on economic development that was tasked with overseeing Villaraigosa’s work, could not cover the cost alone. As the project stretched on and initial costs more than doubled, California Forward turned to corporate donors to fill the gap — funders that have not been publicly disclosed until now.
Elected officials in California can solicit contributions, known as behested payments, to outside entities for a governmental or charitable purpose. Under state law, Newsom had to disclose that he asked California Forward to pay Villaraigosa.
But that disclosure requirement did not extend to California Forward, whose donors ultimately included organizations with an interest in state infrastructure projects. The nonprofit provided a list when CalMatters requested it, but the information was not otherwise available and is still not on any public disclosure forms.
California Forward said it raised $118,800 from a dozen donors to pay Villaraigosa’s salary and for events and travel for the project, including $30,000 from the Port of San Diego, $17,500 from SoCalGas and $10,000 each from Doordash, Disney, Southern California Edison, AT&T and the California Communications Association.
Many questions remain about why the Newsom administration took this approach, how the financial arrangement with Villaraigosa and California Forward came together, and if this approach upholds the spirit of disclosure rules for behested payments.
Sean McMorris of California Common Cause, a nonprofit that advocates for government in the public interest, compared California Forward’s role to a “clearinghouse” that allowed special interests to pay for the project without the usual disclosures that would have been required if Newsom had asked the organizations for the funding himself.
“It’s a loophole in the behested payment law,” McMorris said, “because it’s relevant information that the public and the press have a right to know.”
Newsom’s office won’t answer questions
The governor’s office, representatives from the nonprofit and Villaraigosa all praise the project as a win for California, which led the state to streamline construction of multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects.
But the governor’s office declined to make anyone available to speak with CalMatters about the project and refused to answer a list of questions, including:

Where did the idea come from to hire Villaraigosa? The governor’s office refused to answer. 
Was anyone else considered for the role? The governor’s office refused to answer. 
Why did the governor feel that someone within the Newsom administration could not perform the same function? The governor’s office refused to answer. 
How did they settle on an outside funder to pay Villaraigosa? The governor’s office refused to answer. 

Villaraigosa is now a candidate for governor pledging to “jumpstart” home, energy and transportation construction in California. His stint as infrastructure adviser is his most significant public service since he left the Los Angeles mayor’s office in 2013.
In an interview, Villaraigosa said he has no qualms about how much he earned for the position: $35,000 per month, plus expenses, to travel from the Oregon border to the Mexico border meeting with stakeholders and then produce a report with recommendations for speeding up infrastructure development.
Though he did not stop his other consulting work through the global firm Actum during that period, Villaraigosa said his role as infrastructure adviser was close to full-time and “pretty much took a front seat.”
By the time he stepped down 10 and a half months later, California had a glossy report and five new laws on the books, and Villaragoisa had earned $381,820 for his work. That’s more than California Forward paid its chief executive officer that year, tax filings show, and nearly $160,000 more than the governor’s own state salary.
“I think it was a huge return on investment for the state. And that’s what they offered,” Villaraigosa said. “I know I can say that California Forward and the governor’s office felt like I went above and beyond.”
How the deal came about
In the wake of the passage of the federal infrastructure bill in late 2021, the Newsom administration was looking to maximize California’s access to an expected $550 billion in newly authorized spending over the next few years.
So in August 2022, the governor brought on Villaraigosa to “design strategies to advance the State’s priorities and interests,” “serve as the key State liaison for local elected officials interested in federal infrastructure funding,” “provide input for and assist in development of messages” and “maintain regular contact” with federal policymakers, among other duties, according to a memo prepared that September by Newsom’s then-chief of staff Jim DeBoo.
It’s not entirely unusual for Newsom to turn to outside consultants for state government projects. In 2020, he notably convened a star-studded task force of business leaders, led by the former hedge fund manager and presidential candidate Tom Steyer, during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic to help guide his reopening strategy. The participants were not compensated.
But the Villaraigosa appointment raised eyebrows because Newsom was pulling a former political rival into his orbit. They had faced off during the 2018 gubernatorial primary, where Villaraigosa finished third, which Newsom alluded to during a joint press conference announcing his role.
“I remember running against this guy saying, the one thing I can’t run against is how effective he was on drawing down federal funding as mayor of Los Angeles,” Newsom said.

Villaraigosa was also notably not formally joining the Newsom administration or volunteering his time. Rather, he would be paid for his work, at the governor’s request, by California Forward.
Villaraigosa said he was approached about the infrastructure adviser position by DeBoo — who once served as chief legislative representative in his mayoral office — after the governor’s office had gone through a number of other people. Villaraigosa said he was told that all states had somebody to coordinate their relationship with the federal government on infrastructure and he had the best experience to guide California. DeBoo did not return multiple calls and emails requesting an interview.
Despite his contentious relationship with Newsom during the 2018 gubernatorial campaign, Villaraigosa immediately accepted the job. 
“We both had a dream. We wanted to be governor. But it wasn’t personal,” Villaraigosa said. “We had a long relationship.”
He said he was not surprised to be asked, because of his past accomplishments on infrastructure projects in Los Angeles, which had even led him to be considered for transportation secretary in President Barack Obama’s second term.
Villaraigosa said the governor’s office offered to pay him and he agreed, without much negotiation over his fee. The compensation was always going to come from an outside group, he said, which Villaraigosa preferred, because being employed by the state would have involved too much bureaucracy.
“I didn’t want those complications,” he said. He did not elaborate further. 
‘That’s where the ick factor sets in’
California Forward is best known for its annual economic summit bringing together California elected officials and civic leaders, which has featured Newsom as a speaker nearly every year since he became governor.
Villaraigosa led “stakeholder engagement” and gave “strategic advice” to the nonprofit as he worked on the infrastructure project, according to details from the financial records filed with the state.
Former California Forward CEO Micah Weinberg called the arrangement a “fantastic success,” with Villaraigosa’s recommendations leading to new laws to speed up the construction of green infrastructure in the state.
“In an era of people questioning government expenditures, this is just about one of the best deals that the government has ever gotten, because it didn’t cost the government and the California taxpayers anything at all,” Weinberg said.
California Forward’s fundraising and other revenue dropped by nearly two-thirds, to about $2.7 million, during the 2022-23 fiscal year, its federal income tax filing shows. Still, the nonprofit paid Villaraigosa more than Weinberg — who made $303,214 in that period — pulling from its reserves to cover most of the former mayor’s salary. 
Both the governor’s office and California Forward said Newsom had no role in soliciting corporate donors for the project, meaning there was no legal obligation to report the fundraising to the state.
Taxpayers consequently had less insight into who was paying for a project with significant implications for the future of major public works in the state.
Weinberg defended the financial arrangement for creating a separation between California Forward’s fiscal sponsors and the final recommendations. He said Villaraigosa did not know which donors were funding the project and there was no quid pro quo.
“It was an initiative that was paid for by a nonprofit organization that has hundreds of supporters, which I think is a better way of doing this,” he said.
But McMorris, the transparency, ethics, and accountability program manager for California Common Cause, argues that this is an “ethically suspect” way of using behested payments, because it buries the true sources of funding. 
“It looks better politically if an innocuous nonprofit is giving the money,” he said, even though it’s really special interest groups that are paying. “They don’t even have to report that they’re giving money to the third party. That’s where the ick factor sets in.”
McMorris said it’s important for the government to use taxpayer money for its priorities, because it holds elected officials accountable to do things that they believe are defensible to their voters.
“This is what taxpayer money is for,” he said. “I don’t understand this idea that we’re just going to outsource government to the private sector, because now you introduce all this conflict of interest and the possibility for conflict of interest, which then results in the end result potentially being tainted.”

‘He helped set the tone for the conversations’
During his year as Newsom’s infrastructure adviser, Villaraigosa participated in more than 180 meetings, tours, roundtables, events, calls, and Zooms for the infrastructure report, his spokesperson said. That included a trip to Washington, D.C. in September 2023, after he was no longer being paid for his work, to meet with congressional leaders such as then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and California’s Democratic delegation about infrastructure funding.
Villaraigosa consulted with former advisers from Los Angeles, who volunteered their insights for the project, and got the Boston Consulting Group to help write the final report pro bono.
But he was primarily assisted by California Forward staffers, including Ismael Herrera, who joined Villaraigosa on a statewide listening tour throughout the final months of 2022, coordinating with the governor’s office about who to invite to the sessions and taking notes. Herrera said the project consumed about half his work time during that period, traveling to rural communities with Villaraigosa, then sitting for hourslong listening sessions, plus making site visits and doing prep work.
Those conversations — which also focused on the impacts of infrastructure projects for the workforce and the environment — involved public transportation agencies, local and regional government officials, water districts, universities and community colleges, community organizations and nonprofits, faith-based and environmental justice groups, labor unions and more, Herrera said.
“I thought (Villaraigosa’s) involvement was very valuable and he put a lot of time and effort into this,” Herrera said. “He helped set the tone for the conversations, and also did a lot of listening, a lot answering questions that people had.”
The governor’s office said the listening sessions were not considered open meetings subject to California’s public records laws.
The recommendations ultimately informed a package of bills, introduced by Newsom in May 2023, aimed at speeding up construction of big infrastructure projects by streamlining the state approval process. After facing pushback from environmental groups, a version of the package passed the Legislature about a month later.
“I was given great latitude,” Villaraigosa said. “Obviously these were recommendations. I was doing this on behalf of the governor. But the governor and his staff made almost no changes to our proposals.”
The governor’s office cited Senate Bill 149 — which sets a 270-day limit for wrapping up environmental lawsuits for water, energy, transportation and semiconductor projects that are certified by the governor — as the most significant change.
Since then, four projects have received certification for this expedited review, including Sites Reservoir, a controversial plan to build the state’s first new reservoir in more than 50 years in Colusa County.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/081122_NEWSOM-WATER-PRESSER_MHN_CM_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-17 09:04:56.370093

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s legal team calls President Trump’s arguments for deploying troops to Los Angeles “terrifying.” The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals today is hearing the case.


Gov. Gavin Newsom had a fleeting win against President Trump last week when a federal judge handed down an order that would have halted Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles. Within hours of that decision, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals suspended the ruling, allowing the troops to remain under Trump’s control.
Today, the appeals court is scheduled to pick up where it left off in Newsom’s challenge to Trump’s order.The narrow focus of the hearing — and the expected order from the judges sometime this week — has massive implications for California. Namely: Can Newsom reclaim command of the National Guard against Trump’s wishes?The tenor of the legal arguments is fierce, mirroring the growing intensity in the quickly devolving relations between Trump and Newsom.
Last week, Newsom likened Trump to “failed dictators.” Trump’s legal team’s arguments “are terrifying,” Newsom’s team wrote to the panel of judges overseeing the hearing today.On Sunday, Trump denounced “radical left Democrats as “sick of mind” who “hate our country” on social media. “We must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside,” he declared.
The arguments will play out in front of a three-judge panel, two of whom were appointed by Trump and one by former President Joe Biden, a Democrat.This isn’t the only hearing that’ll determine who gets control of the 4,000 guard members Trump deployed since June 7, after protests in the Los Angeles area erupted in response to federal immigration officers raiding work sites and arresting individuals they say are in the U.S. without authorization. Those protests were in full force over the weekend.
On Friday, the lower court judge who initially sided with Newsom’s lawyers is expected to hold a hearing on whether to issue a preliminary injunction blocking Trump’s deployment of military personnel, including the Guard, to Los Angeles. For Newsom’s legal team to prevail in that hearing, they’ll have to clear a higher threshold of scrutiny. That’s because anyone seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate that the merits of their arguments will likely prevail in the full trial.But while the hearings this week and last are occurring before different judges in different courts, the arguments are similar. Trump’s team says there’s rebellion in the streets. Newsom’s team says local police can handle protesters and that sending in federal forces further inflames tensions.
Trump’s lawyers say this isn’t even a subject the courts can weigh in on, since the president has full discretion on when to use the military. Newsom’s lawyers — and the lower court judge, Charles Breyer — say “that argument fails.”The attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice who are representing Trump have so far argued that the president was in his right to order the National Guard under the law that he cited last Saturday. Trump wrote last week that “incidents of violence and disorder” occurred in L.A. in his message to call up the National Guard. His lawyers continue to maintain that the Los Angeles protesters represented “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority” of the U.S. government — the very language in the law that permits a president to federalize a state’s National Guard. 
Much of this week’s hearings rests on what powers the president has under that specific federal law. But Trump hasn’t invoked the full suite of his legal powers to send in the military to California. That would mean triggering the Insurrection Act, which would permit the armed forces to act as law enforcement. Presently, the National Guard is supposed to protect federal property and officers.That’s why Newsom’s legal team tossed in a footnote in their argument to the appeals court that even if the National Guard isn’t returned to Newsom’s control, Trump should still be blocked from having the Guard perform “law-enforcement activities beyond the protection of federal buildings and personnel at those facilities.”The White House legal team also argues that contrary to what Newsom’s team says, a president under this federal law doesn’t need the formal approval of a state governor to call up the National Guard.Lawyers from the California’s Department of Justice who are representing Newsom argue that only once before has a president invoked this law to call up the National Guard; President Richard Nixon did so in 1970 to deliver the mail during a U.S. Postal Service strike.
The National Guard in the Nixon era stepped in to effectively replace the 200,000 workers who were withholding their labor. But in Los Angeles, thousands of law enforcement from local and county agencies patrolled the streets during the protests and arrested hundreds of people, Newsom’s lawyers wrote. There’s no shortage of law enforcement to quell the pockets of unrest in Los Angeles, they wrote.
According to a Trump filing, “the crowd of protestors outside the federal building on June 6 that prompted the initial federalization order …had fully dispersed within about four hours of LAPD’s arrival,” Newsom’s legal team wrote in a filing Sunday.
“As the district court found based on the record evidence, the circumstances here do not remotely amount to a ‘rebellion or danger of a rebellion,’” Newsom’s legal team wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825_SEIU-ICE-Protest_TS_CM_26.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-17 09:04:56.370093

A teacher says anti-immigrant hardliners may feel different if they could see these families up close.,"Guest Commentary written by

Glenn Sacks
Glenn Sacks is a government and economics teacher in Los Angeles Unified School District.


“Where are the rest of them?” As about 400 soon-to-be high school graduates stood behind us ready to march out onto the field last week, teachers surveyed the crowd with disappointment as we realized some families were missing.
It’s not hard to understand why.
Roughly a quarter of all students in Los Angeles Unified School District lack legal status. The student body at our school consists almost entirely of immigrants, many of them lacking citizenship themselves or have parents and relatives that are undocumented.
Outside, school police patrolled to guard against a potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid. There were rumors that a school about four miles away would be targeted. A day prior, district officials decided that this year the graduation would be broadcast on Zoom.
For many immigrant parents, graduation day is the culmination of decades of sacrifice, and many braved the threat of an ICE raid and came anyway. Others, perhaps wisely, decided to watch from home.
They deserved better.
While President Trump says he is defending Los Angeles from a “foreign invasion,” the only invasion we see is the one he is leading. Unfortunately, many Americans are cheering him on and vilifying immigrants, Angelenos and Californians. Perhaps I’m naive, but I believe that if they could see these families and their struggles up close, they would change their views. 
At my school, we don’t see a dystopia of lawbreakers and freeloaders. We see an often heroic generation of immigrant parents working hard to provide for their children, while also sending remittance money to family members in their native countries. We see students who are (usually) a pleasure to teach, and parents who are grateful for teachers. 
When I looked at the names on the graduation program, there were so many stories I wish our critics could hear: like the student in my AP U.S. government class who from a young age worked weekends for his family’s business but made it into UCLA on a scholarship; the girl who had faced homelessness this year; the boy with learning issues who powered through my AP class thanks to an effort so obsessive that his friends would tease him over it. He got an ‘A,’ which some of the students ribbing him did not.
Many students have harrowing, horrific stories of how they got here — stories they almost never volunteer.
Like the girl growing up in an apartment complex in San Salvador, where once girls reached a certain age, they were obligated to become the “girlfriend” of a member of whatever gang controlled that area. They came for her when she was 14, but she was ready, shooting a gang member, then slipping out of the country. She migrated through Guatemala and Mexico, desperate to find her father in Los Angeles. 
She told me this story at parent-teacher conference night, as tears welled up in her father’s eyes. It’s touching to watch their loving, long-running argument — he wants her to manage and eventually take over the small business he built, but she wants to become an artist instead. 
To this day she does not know whether the gang member she shot lived or died. 
At the graduation ceremony, our principal asked all those who will be joining the armed forces to stand up and be recognized. These bright, hard-working young people are a windfall for the military. Were they born middle class, most would have gone to college. Instead, they often enlist, most commonly in the Marines, for the economic opportunity — the so-called “economic draft.” Also, one of the benefits of enlisting is that they can help family members adjust their immigration status.
One Salvadoran student who came to this country less than four years ago knowing little English managed to get an ‘A’ in my AP class. He’d sometimes come before school to seek help parsing through the latest immigration document he’d received. Usually, whatever I read did not provide much encouragement.
He earned admission to a University of California school, where he’ll be studying biomedical engineering. Perhaps one day he’ll help develop a medicine that will benefit some of the people who don’t want him here.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/060524_Mt.-Eden-HS_LE_CM_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-17 09:04:56.370093

California lawmakers want to ban that,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/california-elon-musk-voting-lotteries/,"Elon Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, gave out $1 million checks to gin up support for Donald Trump. California lawmakers want to ban big cash payments to registered voters.","In summary
Elon Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, gave out $1 million checks to gin up support for Donald Trump. California lawmakers want to ban big cash payments to registered voters.


California Sen. Tom Umberg had one person in mind when he drafted a proposal this year that would prohibit offering big cash incentives to turn out voters in hotly contested elections.
“There’s a fellow named Elon Musk,” Umberg, a Democrat representing the Santa Ana area, told his colleagues earlier this year. “You might have heard of him.”
Umberg’s bill would close what he calls a loophole in California election law that he fears Musk and other wealthy people will exploit by hosting lotteries to boost voter turnout. Musk gave out $1 million checks to swing state voters in the presidential election last year and then in Wisconsin a few months later.
Umberg’s bill is among at least a dozen other pending measures in the Legislature aimed at California’s voting and election rules, according to a CalMatters analysis of the Digital Democracy database. The proposals include one that would require high schools to provide voter registration information to students. Another aims to improve voting for overseas service members. Another seeks to help address one of biggest critiques about California’s elections: That it takes officials weeks longer than other states to issue final vote counts.
But only one of the measures takes aim at the world’s richest man and his controversial voter-registration tactics. Neither Musk nor his political action committee have taken a position on Umberg’s Senate Bill 398, which easily advanced through the California Senate and is now pending in the Assembly.
Musk exploited legal loophole
The bill is in response to how Musk and his political action committee tried to gin up support for President Donald Trump last fall. Musk announced in seven contested swing states that he would be giving away $1 million daily to those picked out of a group who signed a petition to support gun rights and free speech. The only requirement was that those signing the petition be registered voters. Musk and his attorneys argued the giveaways weren’t true lotteries since the winners were not chosen by chance, and the awardees became Musk’s “spokespeople.”
A few months later, in the lead up to a contentious Wisconsin Supreme Court race, Musk awarded $1 million checks to at least two voters. He also offered $100 payouts for registered voters who signed a petition opposing “activist judges.”

It’s already a crime in California and under federal law to offer cash in exchange for votes or to persuade people to register to vote. Legal experts told NBC News that since Musk and his super PAC weren’t specifically paying people to register to vote or to vote a certain way, it fell into a legal grey area. Plaintiffs in pending lawsuits later alleged that the giveaways amounted to fraud, a claim Musk and his lawyers deny, or that they weren’t paid A Wisconsin government watchdog group filed suit last week, seeking to prevent Musk from offering future payments. 
Umberg’s measure would take it further by making it a crime in California to pay people, including via lotteries or other prize-drawing contests, “contingent on whether the person voted or the person’s voter registration status.”
Violators would face up to three years in jail and $10,000 fines. The bill’s supporters, such as Trent Lange, executive director of the California Clean Money Campaign, say there must be penalties to prohibit what Musk did.
“One of the cornerstones of our democracy is a principle that no one should be allowed to buy votes,” Lange told the Senate committee on elections and constitutional amendments in April. “These are transparent attempts to give major financial inducements to people to register to vote. So far, they have gotten away with it.”
Umberg’s bill advanced from the Senate late last month unanimously, including with all 10 Republican senators voting for it. No Republican discussed the bill during the brief floor vote.

Ah Loo himself shared a lot of his gowns’ nature, his friends say, as a soft spoken, yet strong presence in his family and the Utah Pacific Islander community.
His friends and family haven’t recovered from the shock of hearing that self-described peacekeepers at the Salt Lake City “No Kings” rally shot three rounds at an armed man at the protest, unintentionally killing Ah Loo. Some still use present tense when speaking about him, and many of them wish they could wipe away the widespread images of his fatal wounds to substitute them with memories of his life. 
Richard Wolfgramm, Ah Loo’s close friend, got to witness many of the moments that built his reputation. He saw Ah Loo’s many late nights in his studio working on a gown, videocalling his two children while his wife Laura put them in bed. There was also constant talk about art and how seriously Ah Loo took his civic duties as a new American citizen.

“We read about gun violence in this country all the time. It’s just really shocking that it happened to someone that you know and someone that you love, that it happened so fast,” Wolfgramm said. 
Wolfgramm also saw Ah Loo saying goodbye to his wife and kids at his studio before taking a Lyft to the protest together on Saturday, their final moments together. As they marched, he heard his friend speak about how this was the third protest he had attended in a week.

Then, Wolfgramm heard gunshots and screams just steps away on State Street that sent him running. 
They were separated, Wolfgramm didn’t see what happened, but realized something was wrong after Ah Loo didn’t answer multiple calls. It was afterwards, when looking at a video he had been recording when the shots were fired, that he saw images of his friend laying on the ground.
“I was horrified, because that’s the last image I saw of him,” he said. “Was him laying in the street with a bullet hole to his head.”
The shooting happened just before 8 p.m. At about 3:30 a.m. in the hospital he and a group of family and friends were told that Ah Loo hadn’t survived.
“We all just left in a state of shock,” Wolfgramm said on Monday. “You know, I’m just really getting over my shock right now.”
‘A loving soul’
Ah Loo’s name is recognized internationally, whether for being the first Samoan to be featured in “Project Runway,” or for dressing many in his distinct flowy pieces — including red-carpet looks of “Moana 2” stars. He was born and raised in Samoa and moved to the U.S. after making a name for himself in the fashion industry. 
But, many in Utah also know him for being an involved member of the community, finding ways to empower the next generation of Pacific Islander artists. Ah Loo co-founded the nonprofit Creative Pacific with his friend Benjamin Powell, an organization that promotes culture, creativity and innovation, especially among Pacific Islander communities. 
While Ah Loo had a specific style for his pieces — and a signature hat look for himself —  he was also open to designing any type of wardrobe, Powell said. He served on boards and mentored people on their design efforts.
“Afa was a loving soul, very giving of his time, very giving of his service and the work that he did,” Powell said, “and just an all-around, really, just genuinely, a good soul.”
Ah Loo may have had a very public-facing career, but he wasn’t one to speak in front of crowds. According to Powell, he was more of a “quiet mover and shaker.” 
“He wasn’t a loud person. His work really would speak for itself, which I think, is what set him apart in many ways,” Powell said. “Because his quiet ways of doing things were still very effective and impactful with people that he came across.”

Taylorsville Democratic Rep. Verona Mauga, who is also Samoan, also remembers Ah Loo with fondness after knowing him for over 10 years. She describes him as someone who could create anything from scratch.
“He was able to connect people and reach people in ways that other people just weren’t able to do,” she said about Ah Loo. “It was a gift of his to gather and to connect people.”
Before the shooting, the rally protesting President Donald Trump’s second-term policies was peaceful and beautiful, Mauga said. “It was great until it wasn’t.”
“It’s very sad and unfortunate that Afa passed away violently when he was someone who stood up for others and cared about equity and equality and people being treated fairly,” Mauga said. “(He) also often said things like, it’s important to stand on the right side of history. And I know that’s why he was marching.”
After the assassination of Minnesota lawmakers Saturday and the shooting at West Valley City’s WestFest carnival that ended in three deaths, Mauga says there needs to be an important conversation about public safety.
“This is a conversation that needs to happen with community and with government,” she said. “Too much has happened this weekend, and we need to re-evaluate things and see what we need to do to make Utah safer.”
‘Sick to my stomach’
Thinking about all of those details that made Ah Loo the person his community loved, and then the situation in which he died, angers Wolfgramm. 
“I am so sick to my stomach (with) the revelation that’s just coming out right now,” Wolfgramm said, referring to a peacekeeper shooting his handgun after seeing Arturo Gamboa holding an AR-15 style rifle at the protest.
Before the shots rang out, nonviolence and unity defined ‘No Kings’ protest

Wolfgramm is conflicted, however, because he doesn’t know what he would have done as a peacekeeper in their situation. Utah is an open carry state, but Gamboa’s intentions for having a rifle during the protest are unclear. Still, he wishes the event peacekeepers had left trained law enforcement to deal with the situation.
“When I look at their actions, I see the actions of amateurs, and I see panic,” Wolfgramm said. “And I don’t know what I would have done in that situation, but my brothers in law enforcement, they are people that are trained specifically for things like this.”
Like many, Wolfgramm met Ah Loo through his art, and then formed a friendship that lasted over 10 years with their shared Pacific Islander heritage and interests. He found in Ah Loo a warm, kind, talented and generous friend, but also someone who was fun to hang out with.
“People don’t know this about him, but Afa has a beautiful singing voice, and we go to karaoke a lot. I think people are often surprised when he’s up there singing,” he said.
Wolfgramm also remembers Ah Loo as a devoted father and husband, present even when his job obligations kept him out of his house. 
“When we went to the rally, I drove and parked my car at the studio, and we took a Lyft over to Pioneer Park. When I got over there, his wife and his two kids were there. They were leaving the studio. We were all saying our goodbyes and hugging outside. And then they left, and we waited for the Lyft,” Wolfgramm said. “Those were his final moments with his family.”

We’re back up above pandemic levels and again tied for second highest […]","State Superintendent Eric Mackey speaking to members of the Alabama State Board of Education at its work session on June 12, 2025, in the Gordon Persons Building in Montgomery, Alabama. The most recent data shows that about 91% of high school students graduated in 2024, which is tied for the highest graduation rate in the state's history, according to Mackey.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)About 91% of high school seniors around the state graduated in the 2023-24 school year, according to numbers released last week by the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE). 
“We, of course, hit this mark before the pandemic. Then we took a dip. We’re back up above pandemic levels and again tied for second highest graduation rate in history,” Mackey said after the Alabama State Board of Education (SBOE) meeting.
The highest reported graduation rate was 91.7% in 2020, but those numbers are not complete due to a waiver the board sent to schools that did not require them to report their accountability numbers.
The state’s reported graduation rates in the past have sometimes brought skepticism and controversy. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Education said the state’s graduation rates had been inflated due to poor oversight and improper calculations of graduation rates among students with disabilities.  
Two years later, the U.S. Department of Education asked questions about sharp improvements in the graduation rates of students with disabilities.  
Messages seeking comment from ALSDE on the prior controversies were left Friday and Monday. 
Mackey also said that the state has a college and career readiness rate (CCR) at 87%. He said the gap between the two indicators has closed in recent years, but the gap is due to schools not requiring CCR indicators.
“So our gap between graduation and college and career readiness right now is only about 5% as we move toward requiring CCR for graduation in just a couple of years,” he said.
There are nine indicators that determine a student’s readiness for life after high school, according to ALSDE. Some of those indicators are earning a benchmark score in any subject area on the ACT exam; earning a qualifying score of three or higher on an Advanced Placement exam; enlisting in the military before graduation; and earning college credit while in high school.
Starting with the class of 2026, every student must complete one of the indicators in order to get their high school diploma.
School and district-level data, usually released in the fall with the state and federal report cards, is not yet available.  
In 2023, 88.21% of students graduated and 79.07% of students were college and career ready. 
According to a Thursday American Enterprise Institute report, Alabama ranked first in the nation for the lowest chronic absenteeism in the 2023-24 school year. 
“We’ve been in the top five for several years, but we’ve kind of bounced it back and forth with some others,” Mackey said. “So we’re really glad to see that again, our schools are taking this seriously. They are reaching out and working with families, parents and community agencies, and now we have the best attendance rate in the country.”
Chronic absenteeism peaked during the pandemic, and according to the report, states have struggled to get the number to its pre-pandemic status.
“Beyond absenteeism’s toll on students are the burdens it creates for teachers and administrators. Teachers face more demands to reteach content and differentiate instruction for students who are frequently absent,” Nat Malkus, the author of the report, wrote. “School and district leaders must divert more of their scarce resources to reengage students. Focusing on curbing absenteeism is surely not what teachers and leaders want to be doing—nor is it the best use of their time.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9537-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-17 08:07:11.017846

Attempts to authorize red light cameras and roll back previous sessions’ justice reforms failed. And policies seeking to protect unhoused people and sex workers were vetoed. 
The session saw a mixed bag of proposals, and outcomes, among the numerous bills dealing with the criminal legal system. 
Nick Shepack, the Nevada state director of the Fines and Fess Justice Center, describes the strides made by the state on justice related polices as an “overall net positive,” partly because of what legislation ultimately failed.
“I don’t think it was any sort of major victory like we saw last session, which had 11 pieces of legislation that reformed just prisons themselves, which was a huge deal,” Shepack said, referring to the swath of reform bills passed in 2023. “Given the context of the country right now, I think we came out ahead.”
Despite data showing a decrease in crime both in the state and nationwide, there has been a push for lawmakers to return to “tough-on-crime” approaches. 
Over the last several sessions, state lawmakers have passed reforms to the justice system, including decriminalizing low-level traffic offenses, lowering penalties for non-violent theft and drug crimes, and increasing access to diversion programs
Many of those advocating justice reforms, which includes legal groups and prisoners advocacy organizations, were surprised by “the amount of defense that we had to play this session” against many proposals that sought more punitive approaches to justice, Shepack said.
But most of the policies were held off.
Bills that survived
One of the reforms enacted this session prohibits charging defendants fees for legal representation from public defenders.
Senate Bill 120, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Melanie Scheible, prohibits a court from ordering a defendant for whom an attorney is appointed at public expense to pay any part of the expenses incurred in providing that defense.
It goes into effect Oct. 1. 
The Nevada Fines and Fees Justice Center found fees assigned for indigent defense were assessed inconsistently across Nevada. 
There were five Clark County judges who in 2023 “assessed fees for over 75% of the defendants before them” and another “eight judges who assessed fees on less than 5% of the fees who came before them,” according to data the center presented to lawmakers.
Nevada was one of more than 40 states with laws allowing the assessment of fees to defendants who are represented by public defenders, according to the National Legal Aid & Defender Association.
“It’s been a really hard issue to move.” Shepack said. “It’s a fairly significant amount of money. The fact that it got signed will lead to a lot of financial relief to individuals in the criminal justice system.” 
Another positive bill Shepack pointed to is Senate Bill 88, which discharges medical debt from those incarcerated once they leave prison.
The Fines and Fees Center told state lawmakers there is about $13 million in outstanding debt currently owed by formerly incarcerated individuals released from Nevada prisons. People released in 2024 accounted for roughly $2 million of that debt. 
Those debts can be crippling to people who are leaving prisons and attempting to restart their lives. 
Democratic Assemblymember Jovan Jackson, the first formerly incarcerated person elected to the legislature, also was able to successfully pass legislation to establish a pathway for formerly incarcerated people to work as firefighters with the Nevada Division of Forestry once they are released. 
The Nevada Department of Corrections and the Division of Forestry are required to establish a transitional housing program for those incarcerated who are “within 18 months of parole eligibility to live and participate in skills development training in forestry management and conservation.”
The bill goes into effect Oct. 1. 
Bills that were vetoed
Among the 87 bills Lombardo vetoed this session were some reforms to the legal system. 
Assembly Bill 320, another one of Jackson’s bills, sought to prevent a court from turning away defendants from hearings solely because they aren’t wearing professional attire.
Public defenders told state lawmakers stories of unhoused clients, who had successfully entered court diversion programs and were on track to complete requirements of the program, but were often turned away by judges during check-in hearings because they weren’t wearing “professional” attire. 
“These dress codes impact individuals from low-income backgrounds who may lack the resources to afford formal attire,” Jackson said during the bill’s hearing in March. “This creates barriers to accessing justice and undermines the principle that the court should be open to all, regardless of social status.”
The bill passed unanimously in the Assembly and then mostly party lines in the Senate, with Republican state Sen. John Steinbeck joining Democrats.
Lombardo wrote the legislation “creates significant practical and legal concerns” in his veto message on June 10.
“It is unclear whether court staff would be expected to report such denials to the judge or whether individuals deemed inappropriately dressed would be allowed into the courtroom simply so the judge could deny them access but then decline to penalize them,” the governor wrote. “This ambiguity undermines consistent application of the law.”
Shepack said the veto message was confusing, but more importantly, not signing the bill will hurt unhoused people, especially as cities have increasingly criminalized homelessness. 
“We’re talking about people who don’t have access to professional clothing,” he said.
Assembly Bill 209, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember David Orentlicher, would have granted sex workers immunity from criminal liability from prostitution-related offenses if they called 911 seeking medical assistance.
The bill passed both chambers in party-line votes. 
In his veto message, Lombardo said the legislation would codify mistrust of law enforcement “by assuming that sex workers fear prosecution more than they trust officers to prioritize their safety and the investigation of violent crimes.”
Reseachers who recently surveyed sex workers in Nevada had told state lawmakers that nearly all those interviewed lack confidence in the criminal legal system and feel law enforcement doesn’t take sexual assault allegations seriously. 
Lombardo also said the legislation would have provided “immunity for violations of prostitution laws any time medical assistance is sought, without requiring that a violent crime has occurred.”
“This disconnect creates a significant policy loophole. In practice, a sex worker acting in bad faith could report any crime, no matter how minor or unrelated, and still claim immunity from prosecution,” he wrote. 
Orentlicher heavily amended the legislation to specifically focus on protecting sex workers seeking medical assistance to appease law enforcement.
But law enforcement still opposed the legislation.
Bills that died
Multiple proposals sought to authorize automated traffic enforcement, such as red light cameras, which proponents said would reduce traffic fatalities. 
Senate Bill 415, which would have allowed local jurisdictions to use automated traffic enforcement, such as red light cameras, if they chose to do so died early in the session when it didn’t advance out of committee. 
A more targeted version of automated enforcement, Assembly Bill 402, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett, limited authorized traffic monitoring cameras to construction work zones when workers are present. 
The bill passed the Assembly 27-15 in the last days of the session but failed to advance in the Senate. 
One of the only traffic bills to survive this session was Assembly Bill 111, sponsored by Republican Assemblymember Brian Hibbetts, which makes driving the wrong way a misdemeanor crime. The bill takes effect Oct. 1 
Though it was looking like it was on track to pass in the last hour of the session, the governor’s wide-ranging crime bill, which sought to stiffen penalties for DUI offenses, retail theft, and crimes on the Las Vegas Strip, ultimately failed. 
“I was the most surprised with the way that the governor’s crime bill went, and much more so with the last minute amendments coming from gaming and Culinary, than I was with the governor’s original proposal,” Shepack said. 
Echoing complaints made while Lombarod’s bill was heard by lawmakers, Shepack said a bill with so many components required supportive data and should have been discussed for months starting in the interim session. Neither condition applied to Lombardo’s legislation. 
Some of the bills criminal justice reformers and legal groups were pushing also died, including second look laws.
Assembly Bill 91 would have created an avenue for those incarcerated to have sentences reviewed by the State Board of Parole Commissioners after they’ve served extended periods of time. 
The bill passed the Assembly on party lines, then died in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Shepack said that while he was sad to see it fail, he understands “any reform of that size tends to take more than one session.”
Senate Bill 323, which passed the Senate unanimously,would have created a pilot program to provide free phone calls at Florence McLure Women’s Correctional Center, with an eye to extending the policy throughout the system.
But in the waning hours of the session, it wasn’t able to get the final vote it needed. 
“The fact that they ran out of time and it didn’t get voted on on the Assembly floor was very disappointing,” Shepack said. “Those women in Florence McClure and those families are really going to be hurting due to the lack of action on that piece of legislation.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1483489085-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-17 08:07:11.017846

Peter Salem became a hero in the American Revolution. He had been born into slavery in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 1750 and was freed to fight in the revolution. 
After Americans began to battle the British army, British Maj. John Pitcairn demanded that the Americans surrender. When they didn’t, he waved his sword and rallied the British troops to counterattack. He led the charge over the hill, reportedly yelling out, “The day is ours!” As he did, a Black soldier stepped forward and shot Pitcairn, according to eyewitnesses. 
“As news of Pitcairn’s death spread, the morale for the American cause skyrocketed,” according to the American Battlefield Trust. Salem, who was generally credited with shooting Pitcairn, survived the battle and continued to serve in the Army for another five years. 
Following the war, he married Katy Benson and worked as a cane weaver. He was buried in a pauper’s grave in Framingham, but in 1882, the townspeople erected a monument to honor him. He is also depicted in John Trumbull’s famous painting of the Bunker Hill battle.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06104316/June17-Peter-Salem.jpg,,,2025-06-17 09:04:56.370093

In a flurry of media interviews keyed to anti-Donald Trump demonstrations in Los Angeles and elsewhere, Newsom has acknowledged what everyone in and around national politics had already assumed — that he’s entertaining a White House bid.
The most explicit of several hints was published in the Wall Street Journal. Responding to a question about his presidential ambitions, Newsom said, “I’m not thinking about running, but it’s a path that I could see unfold.”
That’s in keeping with the time-worn playbook for politicians who look in the mirror and see a president staring back. They shun naked ambition and portray themselves as reluctantly offering to serve the nation in its moment of crisis, whatever that might be.
It was no coincidence that Newsom, in an address broadcast live by CNN, warned that Trump’s sweeping campaign to arrest undocumented immigrants was such a crisis, saying “other states are next.”
 “This is about all of us. This is about you,” Newsom said. “It’s time for all of us to stand up.”
Newsom uttered a similar theme in his Wall Street Journal interview. “I have a responsibility to combine passion with action, to stand tall and firm and defend the values that I hold dear, that I think the vast majority of Americans hold dear, and assert myself in this moral moment,” he said.
Trump’s anti-immigrant drive is a political gift to Newsom, providing a springboard for him to fill a vacuum and claim leadership of the opposition to Trump. The Democratic Party has been unable, in the seven months since losing the White House, to curb its internal power struggles. Nor have political media anointed any of the potential candidates to succeed Trump as the frontrunner.
It would be fair to say that Newsom, who has been cultivating a national image ever since winning re-election in 2022, would probably start ahead of most would-be rivals for the Democratic nomination.
Whether he would finish ahead, and go on to win the presidency, is another matter. The road to the White House is long and winding, with plenty of opportunities to stumble — as the career of another Californian, Kamala Harris, attests.
Assuming that Newsom’s hints mean he’s a candidate, in the final 18 months of his governorship he’ll be juggling a day job and a side gig, which is likely to diminish his standing in California, which is mediocre at best.
A recent poll by UC-Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies found that by a 2-1 margin, California voters already believe Newsom is more focused on running for president than in fixing the state’s problems.
 “People kind of look at him as being very ambitious,” poll director Mark DiCamillo said about Newsom.
A Newsom presidential campaign would be something of a referendum on California. Its serious social and economic problems, which have not markedly improved during Newsom’s governorship, would be campaign fodder for Democratic rivals and, if he were to win the nomination, for the Republican candidate.
Video clips of California cities’ squalid encampments of the homeless, the smash-and-grab robberies and the sometimes violent demonstrations against Trump’s immigration sweeps would bolster the sour image that those in other states already have of California. Elect Newsom, his rivals would say, if you want the nation to emulate California.
Being a Californian was one of the burdens Harris could not overcome last year. An ad featuring her advocacy of giving conversion surgery to transgender prison inmates was, it’s widely believed, the single most effective spot of the campaign.

The Markup and CalMatters found multiple ways consumers can block the trackers quietly sending your data to tech companies, including those used on state-run health exchange websites.


In April, The Markup and CalMatters found that Covered California, the state of California’s healthcare exchange, was sending the personal health information of its users to LinkedIn. The news triggered a class-action lawsuit and questions from federal lawmakers. In June, a Markup investigation further revealed that exchanges maintained by four other states have also leaked visitors’ sensitive health data. 
Readers have asked: Is there anything I can do to stop my information from being leaked this way? 
The answer is yes.
The trackers we found on health exchanges are extremely common and are used by the world’s most popular websites. We’ve found them on websites people use to prepare for college, do their taxes, get a mortgage, or report a mental health crisis. Good news is, you can block many, if not all of these trackers with just a few steps.
What’s happening with our health data?
The owners of the health exchange websites use services provided by tech companies like LinkedIn, Google and Snapchat to track user activity and to target advertising. To make this possible, website owners install and configure code provided by the tech companies on their pages. This code is called a “tracker.”
When you load a page, the tracker code runs, collecting data and sending it to the tech companies’ servers. This data can be anything from a profile of the device and browser you’re using to every word you type into a form. The tracker can also read and write cookies, which can follow you across multiple websites. 
How can I protect my data from these trackers?
Because the data is being collected and sent by your browser, you can exercise some control over it. Here are the options we’ve tested that have successfully blocked the trackers:
1. Change your settings to block more trackers
Some browsers block many trackers by default, and are capable of blocking more. 

If you’re using Safari, using “Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection” will block the trackers we found. 
In desktop Firefox, upping your “Enhanced Tracking Protection” level from “Standard” to “Strict” will do the trick. 
In Chrome and other browsers, blocking third-party cookies won’t stop the trackers from sending your data, but it will make it harder to link that data to you.

2. Install a privacy-protecting browser extension
If you’re using a desktop browser, one straightforward solution is to install a privacy-protecting browser extension. We tested Privacy Badger and uBlock Origin Lite and confirmed that they both blocked the trackers from LinkedIn, Snapchat, and Google that we examined in our stories.
3. Switch to a new browser
Chrome and Safari, the browsers most people use, don’t stop all the trackers we found from sharing your data out of the box. If you don’t want to change your settings as suggested above, installing a new, privacy-focused browser is what we recommend. In our tests, the Brave and DuckDuckGo browsers blocked the trackers we profiled. (Full disclosure: DuckDuckGo has donated to The Markup.)
What doesn’t work to block these trackers?
Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) will not block these trackers. VPN services are handy for obscuring your location, which is a key detail that data brokers use to identify individuals. Unfortunately a VPN won’t stop the trackers from reading and writing cookies and sharing details about your device, browser, and activity on the site. Also, VPNs can have their own issues with data sharing.
Browsing in “private” or “incognito” mode will not block these trackers. Using these modes will stop cookies from tracking you to other sites, but won’t protect you from having your location, device, browser and activity shared.
How else can I protect my personal data?
The steps we’ve recommended above go a long way towards allowing you to choose when and with whom you share your private information while you’re getting things done on the web. But a browser is not the only place your data is being harvested; tracking is everywhere from video game consoles to smart TVs.

Health care exchanges in Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island shared users’ sensitive health data with companies like Google and LinkedIn.


State-run health care websites around the country, meant to provide a simple way to shop for insurance, have been quietly sending visitors’ sensitive health information to Google and social media companies, The Markup and CalMatters found. 
The data, including prescription drug names and dosages, was sent by web trackers on state exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act to help Americans purchase health coverage. 
The exchange websites ask users to answer a series of questions, including about their health histories, to find them the most relevant information on plans. But in some cases, when visitors responded to sensitive questions, the invisible trackers sent that information to platforms like Google, LinkedIn, and Snapchat. 
The Markup and CalMatters audited the websites of all 19 states that independently operate their own online health exchange. While most of the sites contained advertising trackers of some kind, The Markup and CalMatters found that four states exposed visitors’ sensitive health information.
Nevada’s exchange, Nevada Health Link, asks visitors about what prescriptions they use, including the names and dosages of the drugs, to help them find their best options for health insurance. When visitors start typing, it suggests specific medications, including antidepressants, birth control and hormone therapies. 
As visitors answered the questions, their responses were sent to LinkedIn and Snapchat, according to tests conducted by The Markup and CalMatters in April and May.



When an individual indicated that they took Fluoxetine, commonly known as Prozac, on Nevada Health Link, the information was sent to LinkedIn.
On the other side of the country, Maine’s exchange, CoverME.gov, sent information on drug prescriptions and dosages to Google through an analytics tool. It also sent the names of doctors and hospitals that people had previously visited. 
Rhode Island’s exchange, HealthSource RI, sent prescription information, dosages, and doctors’ names to Google. 
Massachusetts Health Connector, another exchange, told LinkedIn whether visitors said they were pregnant, blind, or disabled.
After being contacted by The Markup and CalMatters, Nevada’s health exchange stopped sending visitors’ data to Snapchat and Massachusetts stopped sending data to LinkedIn. Additionally, The Markup and CalMatters found that Nevada stopped sending data to LinkedIn in early May, as we were testing. 
The Markup and CalMatters discovered the sharing after finding that California’s exchange, Covered California, told LinkedIn when a visitor indicated they were blind, pregnant, or a victim of domestic violence. 
Experts said state health exchanges’ use of advertising trackers was troubling if not entirely surprising. Such tools can help organizations to reach visitors and tailor ads for them. Google Analytics allows website operators to better understand who is coming to their site and to optimize ad campaigns. The LinkedIn and Snap trackers, like a similar offering from Meta, help companies target their social media ads.
How to stop data trackers from sucking up your health dataThe Markup and CalMatters found multiple ways consumers can block the trackers quietly sending your data to tech companies, including those used on state-run health exchange websites. Read the article.
Nevada uses the trackers to help target marketing at uninsured residents, according to Russell Cook, Executive Director of the state agency that operates Nevada’s exchange, Silver State Health Insurance Exchange.
But health care services need to be especially careful with those tools, said John Haskell, a data privacy attorney who has previously worked as an investigator for the Department of Health and Human Services.
“It doesn’t surprise me that organizations that have these massive tech stacks that rely on third party-resources don’t have a full understanding of what the configuration is, what the data flows are, and then once they go to somebody, what that data is being used for,” Haskell said. “It’s something that needs to be addressed.”
How was state exchange data tied to users’ identities? 
After The Markup and CalMatters reported on Covered California’s sharing of health data with LinkedIn, the exchange removed its trackers and said it would review its data practices. The news triggered a class-action lawsuit and questions from federal lawmakers. 
The Markup and CalMatters then examined websites operated by 18 states other than California, as well as Washington, D.C., to see what information they shared as users navigated them. The sites were established under the Affordable Care Act, which requires states to offer health insurance either through their own exchanges or one operated by the federal government. 
To test them, we first ran the sites through Blacklight, a tool we developed to reveal web trackers. We then reviewed network traffic on the sites to see what data the trackers received when visitors filled out forms. The results showed that 18 used some sort of tracker. Some were filled with them. Nevada, for example, used nearly 50. By contrast, Blacklight found no tracker of any kind on Washington, D.C.’s exchange. Popular websites use on average seven trackers, according to Blacklight scans of the 100,000 most trafficked sites on the web.

Many of the sites used trackers in relatively innocuous ways, like counting page views. 
The four exchanges we found sharing sensitive health data sent varied responses to questions about the tracking.
Cook said in a statement that trackers placed by his Nevada agency were “inadvertently obtaining information regarding the name and dosage of prescription drugs” and sending it to LinkedIn and Snapchat. 
Cook acknowledged such data was “wholly irrelevant to our marketing efforts” and said it had disabled tracking software pending an audit. 
Jason Lefferts, a spokesperson for Massachusetts Health Connector, said in a statement that “personally identifiable information is not part of the tool’s structure and no personally identifiable information, not even the IP addresses of users of the tool, has ever been shared with any party in any way via this tool.” But LinkedIn’s tracker documentation makes clear that it correlates the information it receives with specific LinkedIn accounts so companies can use the data for features like retargeting website visitors. The company’s documentation also states it later obscures this information and eventually deletes it.
Spokespeople for the Rhode Island and Maine health exchanges said that they pay a vendor, Consumers’ Checkbook, to run a separate site that allows visitors to explore what plans are available to them through their states’ exchanges. It was from these sites that sensitive information was shared to Google. Consumers’ Checkbook’s sites are at different web addresses than the exchange sites, but are prominently linked to on the exchange sites and display identical branding like the state health exchange’s logo, making it unlikely that an average visitor would realize they were no longer on a state-run domain.Christina Spaight O’Reilly, a spokesperson for HealthSource RI, said the company uses Google Analytics to study trends but not to serve ads, and “disables Google Signals Data Collection, ensuring that no data is shared with Google Ads for audience creation or ad personalization, and no session data is linked to Google’s advertising cookies or identifiers.” HealthSource RI’s terms of use mention the use of Google Analytics, she noted. A spokesperson for CoverME.gov made similar points, saying that the agency “does not collect or retain any data entered into the tool.” 



When an individual selected a doctor on HealthSource RI, the doctor’s name was sent to Google Analytics.
Consumers’ Checkbook declined to comment beyond the exchanges’ statements.
All of the exchanges said that individually identifiable health information, like names and addresses, wasn’t sent to third parties. But the point of the trackers is to enhance information sent about a user with data the platforms already have on that user, and every tracker found by The Markup and CalMatters logged details about individual visitors, such as their operating system, browser, device, and times of visit. 
In response to requests for comment, the tech companies whose trackers we examined uniformly said they do not want organizations sending them potentially sensitive health data, and that doing so is against their terms of use.
Steve Ganem, Director of Product Management for Google Analytics, said that “by default any data sent to Google Analytics does not identify individuals, and we have strict policies against collecting Private Health Information or advertising based on sensitive information.” A spokesperson for LinkedIn, Brionna Ruff, said that advertisers are not allowed “to target ads based on sensitive data categories,” such as health issues. A spokesperson for Snapchat owner Snap said the same, noting that sending purchases of supplies like prescriptions would run afoul of the company’s rules about sensitive data.
A Google Analytics information page specifically discusses how organizations that use the company’s tools should comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which protects health data. The page notes that “Google makes no representations that Google Analytics satisfies HIPAA requirements.”
“It is important to ensure that your implementation of Google Analytics and the data collected about visitors to your properties satisfies all applicable legal requirements,” the page reads.
(Full disclosure: CalMatters uses Google Analytics on our website. Read more about how.)
More incidents
State exchanges aren’t the only health sites that have sent medical information to social media companies. 
In 2022, The Markup revealed that dozens of hospital websites shared information with Facebook’s parent company, Meta, through a tool called the Meta Pixel. The hospitals faced scrutiny from Congress and legal action. Another Markup investigation found trackers logging information about online drugstore visitors purchasing HIV tests and Plan B. 
In 2023, a New York hospital agreed to pay a $300,000 fine for violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.
In response to a series of incidents, the Department of Health and Human Services said in 2023 that use of social media trackers to log health information could violate HIPAA, although recent court decisions have narrowed how the law can be applied against companies that use those trackers. 
Some plaintiffs have used state laws, like those in California, to argue that they should be compensated for having their health data sent to third parties without consent. Others have argued that this kind of tracking runs afoul of wiretapping or even racketeering laws. “Organizations aren’t investing enough time and resources into properly vetting everything,” said Haskell, who advises clients to be very careful about the information they track on their sites. “When organizations are saying, ‘we didn’t understand that there’s a certain configuration of this tool that we’re using,’ well, I can’t really not put that on you.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061125-HEALTH-EXCHANGE-LEAKS-GH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-17 08:07:11.017846

The two contracts awarded to the law firm pertain to two separate cases that involve the Alabama Department of Corrections.
Capell & Howard will represent the state in a lawsuit filed by Marcellus Williams, currently in the custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections. Williams filed the lawsuit in July 2021 after he was stabbed multiple times by another individual during August 2019 while incarcerated at St. Clair Correctional Facility.
“Defendants’ actions and omissions made this attack foreseeable,” the lawsuit states. “The attack resulted from a systemic, top-to-bottom, lack of oversight, security, and protocol at St. Clair, where stabbings, beatings, murders, and rapes are commonplace and much of the prison population possesses contraband weapons.”
The law firm will be paid $195 per hour for two years.
“A new contract is necessary to protect ADOC employees’ interests in this matter,” the agenda states.
The second contract will pay the firm to represent the state in another case stemming from the Northern District.
The lawsuit was filed by Jamal Wilson in March 2021 after he was stabbed by another individual in March 2019 while also incarcerated at St. Clair Correctional Facility.
“For years, egregious levels of violence, high volumes of contraband, irresponsible housing assignments, inadequate security protocols, insufficient training, indifferent management, failures to design and implement corrective action plans, and general inattention to remedying known, recurring, and substantial risks of serious harm to people incarcerated at St. Clair Correctional Facility in Saint Clair County, Alabama (“St. Clair”) have resulted in preventable injuries and deaths,” the lawsuit states.
According to the terms of the contract, the state will pay the firm $195 per hour over two years and is a new contract.
The contract awarded by the Alabama Attorney General’s Office is $200 per hour for two years and is a new contract given by the agency.

BESSEMER — A newly identified species of fish in central Alabama is already endangered due to human development, experts say. Now, plans to build a massive hyperscale data center could turn an already dire situation into an extinction event.
“This would nuke this creek,” Yale University biologist Thomas Near said of the data center project and its potential impact on the Birmingham darter, the species his research team recently discovered.
The darter has been found in both Valley Creek and waterways that flow from there, but recent samplings suggest that it’s gone locally extinct in Five Mile Creek, likely due to industrial development along its banks. Near said in an interview that Little Blue Creek, which flows parallel to Five Mile Creek into the now-pristine forest slated for the data center development, is likely one of the only survivable areas of the Birmingham darter’s habitat left.

If the development goes through, Near said, that habitat won’t be survivable for long.
Nearby residents fighting the proposed data center site said they’re determined to ensure that the new species isn’t made extinct by what they view as a costly and unnecessary development that could take up to  a decade to construct and cost as much as $14.5 billion.
Public officials, some of whom have signed nondisclosure agreements with the proposed developer, have remained silent on the project and its impact, citing ongoing litigation and the NDAs.
Despite a recent win in court, residents are now facing the prospect of a zoning meeting Tuesday that could pave the way for the development process.
They hope for their sake—and for the Birmingham darter’s—that’s not the case.

New species, familiar risks

The newly identified Birmingham darter—a small, colorful freshwater fish—faces threats to its existence that are familiar to people studying similar species in the southeastern U.S., a biodiversity hotspot like few in the world.
Primary among the largely human-caused problems are impacts from land development, researchers have said.
“Within the extremely restricted range of the Birmingham darter, 52% of the area is developed,” the 2025 study that first identified the species said. “And the species faces severe threats from multiple sources: water quality degradation from domestic, urban and industrial pollution; sedimentation from agricultural run-off and urban development; and habitat destruction from strip mining for coal.”
Because the Birmingham darter is a micro-endemic species, meaning its habitat covers only a small geographic area—in this case the upper portion of the Valley Creek system—its risk of extinction is already higher, according to Near, who contributed to the paper in the Biology Letters journal.
Near, a Chicago native, was a researcher at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, where he came enamored with darters, before moving to Yale University.
One of the only remaining survivable habitats for the Birmingham darter may be Little Blue Creek, according to Near. The creek flows into the site of the proposed data center, feeding a wetland located on the 700-acre property that may soon face up to a decade of construction.

Until now, the creek has been largely undisturbed by urban development, avoiding the fate of Five Mile Creek. Near said it’s “very likely” that the Birmingham darter can be found in Little Blue Creek, where lack of public access has so far limited researchers’ ability to conduct a census.
Near said in an interview that based on what he’s learned about the proposed data center project, its construction and use would be devastating for the Birmingham darter and for other aquatic wildlife in the area.
These “dramatic” negative impacts, he said, could include increased river temperature for a fish attuned to inhabit cool, spring-fed streams. Significant water runoff and water extraction for cooling purposes would also fundamentally alter the ecosystem. And Near is concerned about how the data center development might affect the delicate limestone substrate habitat unique to the Birmingham darter.
The proposed data center campus would be the largest in state history and one of the largest such developments in the country. If built to full capacity, the Bessemer data center campus could consume around 10.5 million megawatt hours of energy per year.
That’s more than 90 times the amount of energy used by all residences in Bessemer and more than 10 times the amount of energy used by all residences in Birmingham annually, according to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
A recent regulatory filing by county officials estimated the water usage by the facility could amount to 2 billion gallons per day, an amount more than five times the entire state’s daily residential usage, according to government figures.

Evans & Evans, a law firm representing the data center developer, has not responded to a request for an interview or a list of questions about the project.
Cindy Lowry, executive director of Alabama Rivers Alliance, said the water usage estimated for the development is staggering.
“Nobody’s looking cumulatively at what this will do to the entire watershed, the entire system, and we need that kind of level of decision-making and scrutiny before we should be considering a huge increase like that,” Lowry said. “It’s very shortsighted to consider this kind of increase. Economic development can’t just be about the perceived upside. We have to look at the negative impacts, too, and weigh those out.”
Proponents of the development have argued that the project will create jobs and increase tax revenue, but those opposed to the proposal point to analyses showing that such claims by data centers are overblown.
Alabama law contains tax carve outs for capital projects, including a specific, 30-year tax abatement meant to attract large data centers. If approved by Bessemer officials, that could amount to a tax cut of more than $500 million over 30 years.
Just the construction necessary for the buildout of this proposed data center could take between seven and 10 years, according to figures from a representative of the proposed developer, Logistic Land Investments LLC, a company first formed in May 2023.
That lengthy construction, paired with the lasting environmental impacts of the data center’s operation, could spell disaster for the newly identified darter, Near said.
“There’s going to be so much effluence—so much runoff,” he said. “Seven years of construction will have an impact, and then its operation is likely going to increase the temperature of the river. The impacts are going to be dramatic.











This is something that is wholly unique on the planet—a species and an ecosystem that we can’t find anywhere else on Earth.


– Thomas Near, Yale University biologist



Because the Birmingham darter was only recently identified by Near’s research team, it does not yet have the protections of the Endangered Species Act, though Near said he believes the species warrants it.
“The Birmingham darter (E. birminghamense) warrants the highest conservation concern status due to its critically imperilled condition and high extinction risk,” Near’s paper concluded. “An urgent systematic survey is needed to assess the status of remaining populations throughout the restricted range of E. birminghamense.”
Near said that it’s common sense that residents would want to protect the newly identified darter from the impacts of a project of this scale.
“Almost everyone has pride in where they’re from or where they live, and this is something that is wholly unique on the planet—a species and an ecosystem that we can’t find anywhere else on Earth,” he said.
Listing a species under the Endangered Species Act can be cumbersome. Though the law outlines a process that should take around two years, the average time to listing is now over a decade, according to researchers.

No matter how slow, it’s a process that nearby residents have said they’re ready to begin.
Mary Rosenboom, who lives in unincorporated Jefferson County near the proposed data center site, said she believes that residents should do all they can to protect the natural environment God blessed them with.
“That is biblical,” she told Inside Climate News. “We’re supposed to be stewards. There’ll be a reckoning for people that destroy God’s land. What God creates, we’re not supposed to destroy. He created it for His purpose—whatever purpose that be.”
Near said he spoke with a local representative of the agency about the darter and its potential position in ESA purgatory. It wasn’t a heartening conversation, he said. Officials pointed to a backlog of species that have yet to be assessed for listing, a commonly cited reason for the long wait time before a species can even become a candidate for listing.
“They didn’t seem particularly enthusiastic,” he said.

Marshalling a one-man protest

  Bessemer police confront Marshall Killingsworth, who planned to stand with his sign outside City Hall until the mayor agreed to meet with him. He was forced to remove the sign. (Lee Hedgepeth/Inside Climate News)
It can be difficult to secure a meeting with a mayor who’s signed a non-disclosure agreement, but Marshall Killingsworth had a message and a plan.
The message was hard to miss. The 80-year-old grandfather had worked to paste it boldly onto a homemade sign nearly as tall as he was:
“MAYOR GULLEY,” the sign said, “TALK TO THE PEOPLE! DATA CENTERS KILL!”
Killingsworth is one of dozens of residents who vocally oppose the proposed 4.5 million-square-foot data center that they say will destroy their rural way of life. Officials in Bessemer have been mum on the specifics of the massive project, citing the non-disclosure agreements they’ve signed with developers as one reason for their silence.
So though Mayor Kenneth Gulley, bound by the NDA, had so far chosen not to speak with Killingsworth and other concerned residents, Killingsworth thought a sign in front of City Hall might help get the job done. He intended to sit in a camp chair by the sign and read his copy of Billy Graham’s “Angels.”
But soon after his arrival around 8 a.m. last Wednesday, his plan was cut short. Killingsworth had set up his sign near his parking spot and was heading toward the entrance of City Hall to ask for a meeting when a police officer exited the building to intercept him.
Killingsworth would not be permitted inside City Hall without an appointment, the officer said. The officer then turned his attention to the sign, located in plain view, a stone’s throw from where the two men spoke.
“You have to take it down,” the officer said in a video captured by Inside Climate News. Killingsworth asked why. “Because it’s on public property,” the officer said, heading on foot toward the sign.
In the few moments it took the men to reach it, several additional Bessemer police vehicles arrived on scene. Killingsworth continued to ask why he was being asked to take down the sign.
“Where’s the First Amendment?” Killingsworth asked one of the officers.
Then Bessemer Police Sgt. Gantman Hoof arrived and ordered him to remove the sign immediately.
“Take it down, and we can do all that talking later,” Hoof said. “I’m here to handle business. Take it down. You just want to talk, but I’m just asking you to take your sign down, or we’re going to take it down for you.”
Killingsworth obeyed. “We were ordered to do it, and we follow orders,” Hoof said after that. “We were ordered to take it down, and it’s gotta come down.”
Hoof wouldn’t say whether the mayor ordered the sign’s removal.
“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “It came from my supervisors [at the police department]. Where that came from, I’m not sure. But it came to us, and so he’s going to take it down.”
Killingsworth said he believes his First Amendment right to free speech and protest were violated that day. He said he was shocked by what he viewed as an unnecessarily aggressive response to a single-man protest.
“It’s un-American,” he said.

Renee Griffin, staff attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, reviewed video footage of Killingsworth’s interaction with police and said in an email that holding a sign in a public space outside a city hall garners a high level of constitutional protection.
“A public sidewalk is the quintessential public forum, where a citizen’s right to speak and express opinions receives maximum protection under the First Amendment,” she wrote.
Public officials signing NDAs related to major development projects is also concerning, she said: “There is a significant public interest in how private companies plan to use public land and public resources, and transparency into those proposals is valuable.””
A secretary for Gulley, who’s serving his fourth term in the city’s top office, said he was unavailable for an interview Wednesday. The mayor did not respond to a list of questions about the data center, its impact or the incident with Killingsworth outside City Hall.
Killingsworth, Rosenboom and other residents interviewed by Inside Climate News said that whether they’re able to secure a meeting with the mayor or not, they’re gearing up for the Tuesday zoning meeting scheduled at 4 p.m. inside City Hall that could be the first step toward approval of the project.
Following a court intervention that reset the rezoning process over claims of inadequate public notice, city officials appear to be battening down for a fight.
New language added to the public notices now limits comments during the meeting not to any concerned residents, but only to residents who received a copy of the notice—those living within 500 feet of the proposed project site. Despite that limitation, a change in the zoning ordinance allowing data centers in areas zoned for “light industrial use,” supported by the city, could impact many more residents in the future, not just those living near this particular site.
Rosenboom said she hopes Gulley and other public officials are present for Tuesday’s meeting—and that they listen to residents’ fears. She said if those in power take the time to look at the potential impacts of the development project, God will do the rest.

Joe Lombardo could change the way regulators set rates for natural gas utilities  in Nevada, primarily Southwest Gas, and in a way critics say will lead to higher costs for customers. 
Alternative rate-making, which has been adopted  in a number of other states in various forms, and in Nevada for electric utilities, gives the Public Utilities Commission the option to abandon standard cost-of-service rate setting in favor of other variables.  
Southwest Gas currently files a general rate case every three years, in which the PUC analyzes the utility’s expenses and revenue requirements, and adds in a permitted rate of return for the company. 
Alternative rate-making allows the utility to submit a rate plan determined by factors other than cost of service, like performance metrics. For instance, rates could be based on a utility’s success in reducing carbon emissions, or increasing efficiency. 
Formula rates, another form of alternative rate-making, allows utilities to extend the time between general rate cases.  Rates could be automatically adjusted based on a predetermined formula for longer than three years, the current lifespan of a rate case.
Utilities suggest formula rates streamline the lengthy and complicated process of a general rate case. 
But in Arizona, where the Arizona Commercial Commission adopted alternative ratemaking in December, the expert witness who appeared on behalf of regulators testified that formula rate plans “have resulted in large rate increases with very few rate decreases and no measurable improvement in reliability of service.”
Southwest Gas was among the earliest supporters of the Arizona effort to establish alternative ratemaking. 
“We can’t rely on the 100 year-old utility construct,” Southwest Gas Senior Vice President Amy Timperley of Las Vegas said during a panel discussion on spurring economic development through expanded gas service at a trade association meeting in February, according to an audio recording provided to the Current. “We have to think differently… We can’t hinder growth because we’re not creative and we don’t evolve…and I think the regulatory construct absolutely has to change.” 
Another speaker on the same panel, David Lapp of the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, said the job of regulators’ “is to stand in the shoes of competition. But right now in Maryland and many states, utility regulation is doing the opposite. It is protecting gas utilities from decisions that disregard the competition that gas utilities face from electrification, specifically from modern, highly efficient electric technologies that will ultimately drive customers away from gas service…” 
Lapp added that utilities in Maryland and other states “have been spending on gas distribution infrastructure on a massive scale, causing huge rate increases that are crushing households…” 
Ernest Figueroa, Nevada Consumer Advocate and Chief Deputy Attorney General of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, testified against SB 417. 
The inclusion of provisions regarding formula rates, Figueroa said, “unfairly tips the scales in the utility’s favor to the detriment of the ratepayer.”
Another bill, Assembly Bill 452, which was also approved by Lombardo, ensures customers receive full refunds with interest for overcharges assessed by utilities. 
NV Energy acknowledged it overcharged as many as 80,000 customers in the last two decades. The company’s initial effort to make good on the overcharges resulted in just 12 percent of the money due customers being paid back. 
The bill also extends regulatory timelines for rate case reviews. 
Lombardo also signed a bill that mandates utilities report the number of accounts disconnected as a result of non-payment.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gas-meter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-17 08:07:11.017846

I refuse to partake in education reform that continues to support taxpayer-funded entitlements in a cash-strapped state.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Martine Larocque Gulick: I am voting no on H.454.","This commentary is by Sen. Martine Larocque Gulick, D-Chittenden Central.


The die was cast from the first day of the legislative session and its ultimate fate was sealed with the formation of the committee of conference: true education transformation would not occur this year, even if H.454 passes. Stacking the Senate Education Committee and then the Committee of Conference with lawmakers who are strident in their support of private schools was never going to end well for reform. 
In the last week of the regular legislative session I voted for an education reform bill that I thought would do some good in improving our expensive system with its unnecessarily complex governance structure. The provisions of that bill were passed by the Senate but did not hold once negotiations started between the House and Senate and were instead sidelined for special interests, and in a strange maneuver the Senate conferees moved away from the very provisions they had voted on. These sections of the bill were important and many were negotiated away from the final reform package. 
There are those to blame for this failure who made it clear that it is no longer about maintaining the four historic academies; there have been ample opportunities to carve them out of reform as they play a role in education delivery. It is now about a “mosaic” or “ecosystem” of private schools. These were terms used over and over during negotiations.
But supporting the “mosaic” was never what education reform was about. It was about lowering education costs, improving quality and increasing equity. This “mosaic” needs to stop relying on Vermont taxpayers to do its fundraising. Vermont is simply too small to maintain this expensive and complex system.
Sadly, Democratic and Progressive voters in certain parts of Vermont ardently support the “choice” that our current system offers and refuse to see the harm it does to the entire system. 
They refuse to see that public education is a tenet of democratic values and should be supported and encouraged to the greatest extent possible. The entitlement programs that allow these Vermonters to send their child to a ski school at a reduced cost are more important than fighting for statewide reform.
If we believe a public education system is a common good, this bill does not underscore that belief, and in fact it opens up the very real possibility that we someday face litigation that could lead to universal choice and the privatization of education — expensive propositions that favor the elite.  
The “mosaic” of publicly funded private schools will be happy whether or not the bill fails. If it fails, these schools continue to benefit greatly from the status quo, and if it passes, there are enough protections that they will continue to thrive at the expense of the system as a whole. 
Regardless of the outcome, true systemic education reform is not an “unsolvable problem” rooted in a philosophical difference. It is a very real issue of economics and equity that is very solvable and that requires political courage.

That was, until a landmark ruling in their case in 2018 expanded the state’s responsibility beyond the period when officials have custody of foster children.
In the years since, the decision has provided a path for numerous people wronged by the foster care system to seek justice. 
It’s also part of what’s contributed to a sharp rise in the state paying out huge sums of money in response to a deluge of lawsuits alleging a range of misconduct. Washington state taxpayers have covered about half a billion dollars in legal claims in the past year alone.
Beyond foster care, these cases trace everything from wrongful termination and employment discrimination to deaths in prison to negligence investigating child abuse claims. The conduct alleged goes back as far as the 1950s.
Washington’s payouts — known as tort liability — have skyrocketed from $72 million in fiscal year 2018 to more than $281 million last fiscal year. Washington’s fiscal years run from July 1 to June 30. With over two weeks left this fiscal year, Washington had spent nearly $502 million on tort liability claims as of Friday.
Unlike many other states, Washington has no cap on the damages that can be paid out in these cases.
“FY 2023 was a record. FY 24 is a record,” said Scott Barbara, of the state attorney general’s office. “FY 25 is going to be bigger than FY 23 and FY 24 combined.”
Darrell Cochran, a high-profile personal injury attorney, told lawmakers this month that the data on lawsuits and payouts “represents the human misery index involved.”
“There is an obligation, both morally, societally and legally, to atone for the wrong,” Cochran said.
“The children in the foster care system, some of the most vulnerable children in our entire state who were in state custody, who were chained essentially to decisions by state agency caseworkers sent off to what we know to have been houses of horrors,” he added.
Legal defense costs have risen in kind, to nearly $50 million in fiscal year 2024. Over a third of that sum went to outside law firms. This fiscal year, legal costs have increased to more than $56 million, according to the state Department of Enterprise Services.
The state is self-insured, meaning the legal payouts come from agency coffers that would otherwise go toward state services.
This legislative session, state Senate Republicans proposed requiring hearings after each payment over $1 million to force agencies to explain what went wrong. The bill didn’t get a hearing.
The spike has largely been driven by claims against the state Department of Children, Youth and Families, a wide-ranging agency tasked with overseeing everything from child welfare and foster care to juvenile detention. 
And a state Supreme Court ruling last month that expanded the statute of limitations for some claims could potentially open the state up to more liability. Last year, lawmakers also eliminated the statute of limitations for civil claims of childhood sexual abuse that occurs after June 2024, potentially leading to even further litigation going forward.
After the pandemic, the state also saw an uptick in claims from workers challenging the state over the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. 
Now, complaints over the state’s youth prison system are spiking. One law firm alone has filed about 800 claims over sex abuse in state-run juvenile detention centers, going back decades, Barbara told lawmakers.
“I hear, on the radio, advertisements almost every day encouraging people who may have been harmed in juvenile facilities to reach out to whatever legal company is running the ads,” said Sen. Keith Wagoner, R-Sedro-Woolley. “So it seems like it’s sort of become a cottage industry. Not that that isn’t probably a good thing if people have been harmed.”
These cases, sometimes dealing with conduct from decades ago, are particularly difficult for the state to defend, as any records are lost to time. Nearly two-thirds of the claims filed against the Department of Children, Youth and Families in fiscal year 2024 were from incidents before 2000, said Allison Krutsinger, the agency’s public affairs director.
“We are seeing that sort of historic look back, making atonement, reconciling wrongdoing, frankly, on behalf of the state when appropriate,” Krutsinger told the Senate Law and Justice Committee.
Perhaps the one bright spot is a dramatic drop in claims filed by people incarcerated in the state’s prisons as the Department of Corrections has worked to improve conditions.
To help deal with the hefty court penalties, Democrats in the Legislature this year turned to a creative budgeting maneuver to free up money that would go otherwise toward the state’s legal fees.
And the payouts, both from court settlements and jury verdicts, aren’t expected to end anytime soon. Last June, an actuary estimated the state faced $2.5 billion in liability from pending claims, straining an already-reeling state budget. 
In total, as of Friday, the state has faced more than 3,800 claims since last July.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/money-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-06-17 07:03:08.490998

Decades ago, the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act anticipated that it would be hard for small, largely rural districts to effectively educate students with disabilities.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lauren Morando Rhim: Revisiting the potential of BOCES to solve some of our most challenging education issues.","This commentary is by Lauren Morando Rhim of Norwich. She is a public school parent, former school board member and an advocate for students with disabilities.


I have closely followed the discussion on transforming Vermont’s education system and wholeheartedly agree that change is necessary. I loved growing up here, and I hope it will be viable for my children and grandchildren to call Vermont home. But, for the state to remain attractive for generations to come, we must figure out how to improve the quality and affordability of our public schools.
To continue to operate an expensive system that does not generate the outcomes our students deserve is a lose-lose scenario, and nowhere is this more apparent than for our students with disabilities.
Luckily, the legislature and the Agency of Education already have a tool to leverage to improve outcomes and reduce costs — Boards of Cooperative Education Services, or BOCES.
Rather than merging schools, districts, or supervisory unions, we should invest our energies in creating BOCES to centralize specialized resources and expertise and realize economies of scale for educating students with disabilities regionally. It is an approach leveraged by dozens of other states, and we can implement it in a way that can work for our unique context while also learning from the experiences of states like Massachusetts and New York.
Multiple factors drive education costs, but some of these, such as our wonderful small towns and schools, make Vermont special. However, as a school board member, I witnessed the inefficiencies of small schools and boards navigating the complexities of special education, especially for our students who require significant support. And, across the state, the percentage of students qualifying for services is increasing rapidly, exceeding national averages.
For instance, we identified more students as eligible for special education services relative to national averages before the pandemic (17.9% compared to 14.4%), and the trajectory has continued post-pandemic, climbing to nearly one in five students. Today, Vermont ranks seventh in the nation in terms of the highest proportion of students with disabilities. Not counting local dollars, we spent $437.5 million on special education in fiscal year 2023.
If these services and expenditures led to strong outcomes, I would be first in line to vociferously defend Vermont as an exemplar, but unfortunately, this is not the case. While researchers estimate that the vast majority of students with disabilities (~85%) can achieve grade-level standards when provided appropriate supports, we generally see a 30-40% point average gap between our students with and without disabilities.
We are in the bottom third of all states for grade four reading and math on this subgroup’s most recent National Assessment of Education Progress. Given what I have always perceived to be a deep commitment to education by Vermonters, these outcomes are incredibly disheartening, especially given the quality and experience of our teachers and low student-teacher ratios. 
Even more concerning, far too many of our students with disabilities are being referred to private placements in which they have little opportunity to access the general education curriculum, interact with peers without disabilities, and for which there are few quality controls.
Last year, nearly 5% (792 of 16,152) of Vermont’s students with disabilities qualified for extraordinary cost reimbursement. A disproportionate number of them are educated in independent or therapeutic settings. Recent scandals at the LiHigh School in Poultney and the I.N.S.P.I.R.E. school for Autistism located in Brattleboro, which revealed egregious academic and fiscal control failures, demonstrate that, as currently structured, the state is ill-equipped to monitor these programs effectively. 
Luckily, there is a better model, and I was encouraged when the legislature passed a bill during the last legislative session supporting the creation of BOCES. Decades ago, the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act anticipated that it would be hard for small, largely rural districts to effectively educate students with disabilities, especially those who would require more intensive supports.
The IDEA encourages states to create regional intermediaries to, among other functions, centralize aspects of special education to ensure small districts can access highly specialized support that a small number of students require while introducing efficiencies across regions.
BOCES can take on different characteristics depending on the needs of the member districts but examples of the types of functions they can coordinate include professional development, applying for federal and state grants, addressing special education teacher and related services personnel shortages, providing or ensuring access to high-quality regional therapeutic settings and procuring and providing training related to assistive technology.
They could also provide critical guidance to parents navigating tuitioning options, a challenging proposition for many parents of students with disabilities. As the U.S. Department of Education shifts more responsibilities to states, it will become increasingly crucial for the AOE and districts to intentionally build and sustain their technical capacity to deliver on the requirements of federal statutes such as the IDEA.
I hope the Legislature and the AOE lean into the tools at their disposal to address some of Vermont’s most pressing problems rather than creating a whole new set that will inevitably arise in an ill-informed and rushed effort at wholesale consolidation and mergers.

New Mexico weather will be hot and dry through the week, but some monsoon relief may come as soon as early next week. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM).High winds will crank up the heat across New Mexico on Tuesday, prompting major heat risk stretching from the Middle Rio Grande Valley in Albuquerque, through the Lower Rio Grande in Las Cruces. Risk from extreme temperatures will include parts of Socorro and the state’s southeastern region, as Roswell is expected to reach 110 degrees. The winds will make that heat index, or “feels like temperature,” even hotter, said Michael Anand, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Albuquerque.
“We have high confidence that we’ll see temperatures around 110 degrees in Roswell…hence why we upgraded that heat watch to a warning,” Anand said.
Last week, the heat levels prompted warnings from NM health officials and raised concerns for nonprofits and providers serving people experiencing homelessness.
The reality is that heat doesn’t have to reach triple-digits to pose dangers to people’s health, said Chelsea Eastman Langer, who leads NMDOH’s Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau, in an interview last week with Source NM.
She pointed to New Mexico Department of Health data showing that emergency room visits jump when the temperatures outside rise above 90 degrees, but that may not match up with expectations.
“If it’s 90 degrees, people say ‘it’s not that hot, it gets worse,’” she said. “It is a challenge. And I would say it’s when we’re still kind of figuring out how to message and get the word out.”
Langer said that health officials are working with employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  on a proposal to lower the thresholds for issuing weather-related advisories below triple-digits.
“What we see is that we start to get people coming in with heat-related illness at temperatures much lower than when they would issue [a warning],” she said. “We start to see people coming in to [emergency rooms] at 80 degrees and then there’s a pretty sharp increase at 90 degrees.”
Dr. Emily Bartlett, an emergency physician in Gallup, said numerous groups of people face risk from heat: children; the elderly; people without home cooling equipment or shelter; outdoor employees; and anyone with health risks.
“It’s not just the maximum heat, it’s the duration,” Bartlett told Source NM. “If it doesn’t cool off enough at night between days of high heat, it raises the risk of illness.”
Bartlett said in hot weather, heat stroke, a potentially deadly condition which is usually exhibited by a fever of 104 degrees and neurological symptoms, represent the highest concern.
“If someone is expressing altered mental status, acting confused, lethargic, not answering questions correctly — that should be presumed to be an emergency,” she said. “Just like with stroke or heart attack patients, we want to start early treatment, as well as getting that patient to a hospital.”
Less serious conditions can include heat exhaustion and heat rash, which can be mitigated through cooling and hydration, Bartlett said.
The winds also whip up fire danger concerns across the entire Western and Central portions of the state, as officials battle two southern New Mexico fires north of Silver City.
Chances for the seasonal monsoon rains are increasing and may arrive as soon as the weekend, Anand said, offering chances of thunderstorms and rain for most of the state.
“It’ll be hot and dry until the monsoon plume kicks in on Sunday and Monday of next week,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Heat_Prokop_2-1024x751.jpg,,,2025-06-17 08:07:11.017846

(Photo by Rachael Pope/Douglas Forest Protective Association)Desperate for money to get through the next two wildfire seasons and with few proposals on the table that could meet costs and get passed by the Oregon Legislature, Gov. Tina Kotek is proposing to skim some money off of the state’s “rainy day” fund.
Kotek at a news conference Monday proposed taking $161 million of interest income from the state’s nearly $1.9 billion budget reserve fund — meant to help the state smooth out revenue or expense fluctuations in times of economic downturn or recession — to provide funding for wildfire response and mitigation for the 2025-27 biennium to mitigation readiness.
“We have only just weeks left in the session — days —  without an immediate path for an ongoing funding mechanism. I urge the Legislature to identify as much one-time funding as they can,” she said. “I see no reason why they can’t get that at least done.”
The 2025 fire season has already started, and Kotek last week declared a conflagration for the Rowena Fire near The Dalles, which has burned more than 3,500 acres and destroyed 56 homes. And federal aid for fires remains in doubt, as the Trump administration has pushed for states to shoulder more of the costs of responding to natural disasters.
Kotek asked the Legislature for more than a year to come up with a reliable and consistent funding mechanism to support statewide wildfire work but has so far not received any proposals that come close to meeting her desired target of an additional $150 million per year and can get the bipartisan support needed to pass.
She recently began signaling her support for using a portion of the expected $1.64 billion “kicker” tax rebate for wildfire funding, despite declining to consider it in the past. The rebate is sent back to Oregonians when actual revenue the state collects, including income taxes, exceeds the two-year revenue forecast by 2% or more.
But any bill to change the kicker requires a two-thirds supermajority vote in each chamber, meaning at least two Senate Republicans and four House Republicans would need to approve along with all legislative Democrats.
A recent proposal from Sen. Jeff Golden that would use $1 billion of the kicker for wildfire funding and send the remaining $650 million to Oregonians earning less than $95,000 a year would meet Kotek’s desire for sustained funding. The $1 billion would be put into an interest-bearing account that could, if earning 5% each year, send $100 million each biennium to the state for wildfire — covering about one-third of the total $300 million the state hopes to budget each biennium.
But Kotek said she doubted Golden’s measure was feasible
“I don’t think legislative leaders have the votes to take a portion of the kicker,” Kotek said.

Bob Menendez (D-NJ) gives a brief statement after sentencing at Manhattan Federal Court on January 29, 2025 in New York City. Menendez, who was found guilty on bribery and corruption charges last year, was sentenced to 11 years in prison. His co-defendant Fred Daibes was sentenced to seven years in prison and fined $1.75 million. A second co-defendant, Wael Hana, was sentenced to more than eight years in prison and fined $1.3 million. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Barring any last-minute surprises, Bob Menendez, New Jersey’s former senior senator, will report to a federal prison in Pennsylvania Tuesday to begin serving an 11-year sentence for selling his political power to two foreign governments and three businessmen in exchange for gold bars, cash, a luxury car, and other riches.
Menendez, 71, will be donning a prison jumpsuit 11 days later than U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein initially decreed when he sentenced him in January, after successfully seeking a delay so he could attend his stepdaughter’s wedding last weekend.
Menendez, a longtime Democrat who served in Congress from 1993 until he resigned last August, tried for another reprieve this month, asking the courts to allow him to remain free on bail pending the outcome of an appeal. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said no.
Similarly, Menendez’s overtures to President Donald Trump for a pardon, both on social media and behind the scenes, have not proven persuasive with the White House or the public.
“Shut up,” wrote one X user, after Menendez posted a thread on June 11 complaining of prosecutors “weaponizing” the criminal justice system.
Menendez had long been a popular leader, comfortably winning reelection in 2018 even after a separate bribery indictment ended in a 2017 mistrial.
But his July conviction and impending imprisonment sent shock waves through political circles in New Jersey and nationally, given how slippery public officials have historically been in being brought to justice for corruption.
He became the first sitting senator to be convicted of acting as a foreign agent, arguably the most alarming of 16 charges prosecutors filed against him, due to its national security implications. He was chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee when federal prosecutors in New York indicted him and his wife Nadine in September 2023 for accepting bribes to take actions that benefitted Egypt, Qatar, and New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana, Fred Daibes, and Jose Uribe.
“I think Sen. Menendez had a long career in which he did a lot of good for the country and the state. It’s always sad to see somebody like that do things that merit this kind of accountability,” said Tom Malinowski, a Democrat who represented New Jersey’s 7th District in Congress for two terms when Menendez was a senator.
Still, Malinowski, who now leads the Hunterdon County Democrats, noted that Menendez likely would not be headed to prison today, had Trump instead of former President Joe Biden been in the White House when prosecutors first set their sights on him.
“They’ve stopped enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,” Malinowski said. “I don’t think that Bob Menendez would have been prosecuted under the Trump administration. I’m proud, as a Democrat, that an administration led by my party was even-handed in its pursuit of public integrity.”
Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette of the Project on Government Oversight, a D.C.-based national nonprofit watchdog, agreed that Menendez might be “part of a bygone era,” as a politician locked away for corruption.
Corruption will not only go unpunished but it will flourish under Trump, who has used his position to vastly expand his fortune, said Hedtler-Gaudette, the group’s vice president of policy and government affairs.
“The fish is rotting from the head down, because the President clearly does not care about these issues as principles,” he said. “He and his family are violating every possible principle or precept of ethical government — their stablecoin and the dinners they’re having and what amounted to direct payments through crypto assets. They’re just doing all of this stuff right out in the open. And so it creates an environment where it’s going to incentivize other people to keep doing things that are unethical and corrupt.”
Still, Menendez won’t be the last politician in prosecutors’ crosshairs, he added.
“They will selectively use the apparatus of the state to go after political opponents,” he said. “They’ve got no problem charging Congresswoman LaMonica McIver for essentially trying to do her job at an ICE detention facility. So the thing that really concerns people like me, an organization like mine, is that you may actually see an increase in members of Congress being targeted or investigated by the Department of Justice on the basis of political, partisan targeting.”
Malinowski and Hedtler-Gaudette agree that Trump seems unlikely to pardon Menendez as he has so many others.
Still, Malinowski predicted a pardon will come. But it won’t likely be Menendez who walks out of prison, he said.
“There’s a very active effort to secure a pardon” for Hana, Malinowski said.
Hana, who’s Egyptian-American, was convicted alongside Menendez of bribing the senator to help him secure a halal meat-exporting monopoly in Egypt.
Malinowski co-chaired the Egypt Human Rights Caucus in Congress, served in the Obama administration as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights, and labor, and was the Washington director of Human Rights Watch.
“We tend to see this case as a corruption case. It was also a foreign influence and espionage case,” Malinowski said. “The President of Egypt has been lobbying very, very hard to get Hana a pardon, and I think that’s more likely to happen. From General (Abdel Fattah) Sisi’s point of view, it’s an opportunity to show that if you do something for the motherland, the motherland will stand by you.”
Attorney Lawrence Lustberg, who represented Hana at trial, did not respond to a request for comment.

 ORL National Committee at their meeting on May 29, 2025 in Washington, DC.Although the Republican Party in Florida and across the country has evolved into the Donald Trump Party over the past decade, there remains a share of “Never Trumpers” who are determined to provide a safe place for Republicans who refuse to embrace the MAGA agenda.
Spurred by former GOP senators John Danforth, William Cohen, and the late Alan Simpson (who died on March 14), the group Our Republican Legacy was formed a year ago, and now is working on getting out their message.
“What gives me hope is it was impossible [for a Republican] to beat Donald Trump in 2020 or 2024, but he will not be the Republican nominee in 2028,” said Chris Vance, national senior adviser for Our Republican Legacy, in a video call with the Phoenix on Friday.
“And people just don’t seem to be able to appreciate that in a couple of years, everything is going to look different — the Republicans will probably have lost the House. Trump will be a pathetic, weak lame duck with a bunch of other Republicans running for president and drawing all the attention. There’s going to be a wide-open war for control of the Republican Party, and we are mobilizing now to fight that war.”
The organization has chairs in 17 states and is working to establish a presence in all 50. It is not a political committee and won’t take financial contributions. Nor do they intend to endorse candidates. Their mission as a 501(c)(4) group is to “advocate that the party change back to traditional conservative values and building a grassroots army to help win that battle,” in Vance’s words.
  Greg Wilson (Photo from Our Republican Legacy)
Greg Wilson, a former U.S. Treasury Department official in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, is serving as Our Republican Legacy’s Florida chairman. A co-chair of the Republicans for Harris campaign in Florida last year, he wrote an op-ed in the Miami Herald warning that the trade tariffs Trump was touting in his campaign were dangerous.
“He was going to do a better job on the economy than Vice President Harris was going to do,” Wilson tells the Phoenix.
“And where are we today? The ‘Big Beautiful bill’ is going to boost the deficit. It’s already spooking the bond market, which is quite important to Treasury financing. All the uncertainty and the chaos he’s creating — I’m predicting that’s going to be untenable for our economy. If we’re lucky, we’ll avoid a recession. If we’re not lucky, we’re on the skids to a depression and global trade wars.”
Our Republican Legacy held its first national committee meeting last month in Washington. D.C., with guest speaker former Republican National Committee Chairman and Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele. Among its founding members are former Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez, according to its website.
Somewhat of a bust
Ever since Trump entered the Republican race for president a decade ago, the “Never Trump” movement has been somewhat of a bust. Some Republicans left the party. Some became independents; others, like former Pinellas County U.S. Rep David Jolly, have now become Democrats.
So, whether this particular movement will gain traction seems questionable.
Vance acknowledges the skepticism. The former chairman of the Washington state Republican Party and the GOP candidate for U.S. Senate in Washington in 2016 (he lost to Democratic incumbent Patty Murray), Vance says that his group is for people who want to remain Republicans and fight to change the party eventually over time.
“I think no matter how difficult or unlikely that sounds, it has to be done,” he said. “This country cannot long endure if one of the parties is an authoritarian threat to the Constitution. So, we have to take on this fight. And it is not going back to George W. Bush, it’s applying classic, core conservative principals to today’s problems.”
The organization won’t weigh in on every political battle that surfaces, Vance said. Instead, its North Star is laid out in “Five Core Principles” — The Constitution; Unity; Fiscal Responsibility; Free Enterprise; and Peace Through Strength.

Although overall state spending was trimmed, K-12 schools avoided deeper cuts, securing a 2% increase over the biennium — equal to about $640 million in new funding. And in the budget’s second year, Indiana will drop remaining income limits and move to a universal taxpayer-funded “school choice” voucher system.
It’s still unclear, though, how budget shortfalls could affect public school funding. Senate Enrolled Act 1, for example, altered property tax rules with the goal of giving two-thirds of Hoosier homeowners relief — potentially at the expense of local governments and school corporations. The law also limits school referenda to general election ballots only.
Federal spending cuts, expiring COVID-19 aid and national changes to education policy have added to schools’ budget uncertainties, too.
To help local leaders navigate state-specific policy changes in the meantime, the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) released its annual legislative guidance last week.
Secretary of Education Katie Jenner described the document — currently about 20 pages — as a “living” resource that will continue to evolve: “It will still require a bit more time and collaboration with stakeholders to finalize,” she emphasized.
The annual guidance is meant to answer common questions and serve as a “one-stop shop” for schools, Jenner said. IDOE plans to update it throughout the summer, ahead of the 2025-26 school year.
More focus on math, plus other curriculum changes
Following a high priority literacy overall during the 2024 session, House Enrolled Act 1499 will give students at least two chances to retake the state-mandated IREAD exam over the summer to avoid retention.
Current statute requires that — if after three attempts — a third grade student is unable to pass the IREAD assessment, they must be held back a year in school.
The new policy also exempts some English language learners from reading retention, depending on the school’s student population.


The full 2025 education legislative guidance can be viewed on IDOE’s website.


But Indiana lawmakers mostly shifted focus this year to math performance improvement. 
Similar to the state’s literacy requirements, House Enrolled Act 1634 lays out a new statewide effort to boost foundational math skills by requiring schools to annually screen students in kindergarten through second grade for math readiness, beginning in 2026-27.
IDOE officials said the goal is earlier identification of students at risk of falling behind in key numeracy and computation skills, while also ensuring students are prepared for high school coursework and postsecondary success
The agency expects to provide a complete list of approved mathematics screeners by Spring 2026, along with guidance on both the frequency and timing of assessments, according to IDOE.
Students identified through the screener will receive support through a multi-tiered system of interventions spanning grades K–8. Per the state’s preliminary guidance, schools will need to implement evidence-based instructional strategies, regularly monitor progress, and ensure staff are trained to respond to a range of skill levels.
The law also requires automatic enrollment in advanced math courses for eligible middle school students. Starting in 2026–27, students who score “above proficient” on the ILEARN math assessment and earn a C or better in their previous math course must be placed in a more rigorous class the following year. Schools will be expected to identify qualifying students based on 2025–26 data and update academic planning accordingly, according to IDOE.
Starting in the 2025–26 school year, Indiana schools will additionally face stricter rules when teaching about human sexuality and sexually transmitted infections.
After pushback, requirement for Indiana schools to teach consent in sex education returned to bill

Although school boards already have the authority to review and approve curricular materials, Senate Enrolled Act 442 clarifies that boards must formally approve all human sexuality instructional materials used in grades four through 12 and to publicly post a list of those materials on the district’s website.
The new law also mandates that parents receive written notice at least 14 days before instruction begins. That notice must include the instructional dates, a summary of content and information on how to opt their child out.
The introduction of sex education usually starts in the fourth grade, according to state guidelines. But Indiana does not require the course, and schools that do teach sex education are expected to focus on abstinence.
IDOE advised that participating schools must “incorporate in the instruction that (the) best way to avoid sexually transmitted infections and other associated health problems is to establish a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in the context of marriage.” It also has to include “age appropriate instruction concerning the importance of consent to sexual activity between two individuals.”
Students attending in-person classes are required to view a fetal ultrasound video “that is medically accurate and age appropriate” and includes:

a high definition ultrasound video, at least three minutes in duration, showing the development of the brain, heart, sex organs, and other vital organs in early fetal development; and
a high quality computer generated rendering or animation showing the process of fertilization and each stage of fetal development inside the uterus, noting significant markers in cell growth and organ development for every week of pregnancy from fertilization to birth.

If a school provides online human sexuality instruction, students will still need to view a virtual presentation on human growth and development that meets the same requirements, according to IDOE.
State officials said the changes are meant to increase transparency and parental involvement while still allowing local control over curriculum details.
Teacher pay, licensing and workforce flexibility
Indiana lawmakers approved a hard-lobbied teacher pay bump in Senate Enrolled Act 146, which raises the minimum teacher salary to $45,000 starting in the 2025–26 school year and increases the share of state tuition support that districts must spend on teacher compensation from 62% to 65%.
If a school corporation does not meet the minimum salary or compensation thresholds, it must submit a justification form to the state and is required to adopt a compliance plan, according to IDOE guidance. Those submissions will be publicly posted on the agency’s website.

The General Assembly additionally revamped the state’s Teacher Appreciation Grant (TAG) program to focus on performance and impact in high-need areas. Updated state law specifically outlines three stipends that a teacher could be eligible for, beginning this year:

 a “recognition” stipend of $3,500 for teachers who demonstrate high performance in improving student outcomes. 
 an “exemplary” stipend of $5,000 for teachers who demonstrate high performance in improving student outcomes and serve as a mentor for their colleagues or teach in a high-need area. 
 an “exemplary plus” stipend of $7,500 for teachers who demonstrate high performance in improving student outcomes, serve as a mentor for their colleagues, and teach in a high-need area. 

Schools can nominate up to 20% of their educators for TAG stipends. IDOE officials said more guidance — like a detailed scoring rubric, eligibility rules and deadlines — will be released by Sept. 1. Applications will then open in the fall, with funds distributed in early 2026.
Other workforce-related changes are impending in Senate Enrolled Act 255, which establishes new alternative licensure pathways for middle school and STEM teachers, and in Senate Enrolled Act 366, which drops the master’s degree requirement for superintendents, making it a preferred — but not mandatory — qualification.
Cracking down on absenteeism
Following years of concern over rising chronic absenteeism across the state — a trend that spiked during the pandemic and has been slow to recover — new efforts are on the way to ensure K-12 students show up to class.
Senate Enrolled Act 482 takes a more aggressive stance on student attendance by requiring IDOE to issue clearer statewide attendance definitions, guidance for monitoring student participation, and a new list of best practices for local districts to put in practice.



Under the law, “chronic absenteeism” is now clearly defined as missing at least 10% of instructional days in a school year for any reason, regardless of whether it is excused. 
Absences now fall into three official categories:

Excused absences include illness with a note, funerals, religious observances, college visits, court appearances, and other reasons permitted by district policy. Schools must document these absences with appropriate verification.
Unexcused absences include skipping school, family vacations not approved in advance, or failing to provide documentation for otherwise excusable reasons. These absences count toward truancy thresholds and may trigger interventions.
Exempt absences are those required or protected by state or federal law and do not count against a student’s attendance record. These include jury duty, election service, military obligations, foster care court proceedings, or serving as a legislative page. House Enrolled Act 1660, passed during the 2025 session, further excuses student absences for participation in educational events organized by Future Farmers of America or 4-H.


IDOE recommends tracking student attendance monthly, with intervention triggers at five total absences, excused or unexcused. Suggested supports include attendance contracts, staff mentoring, family outreach, and referrals for addressing barriers like transportation or health care.
The new law allows local prosecuting attorneys to hold “intervention meetings” with parents to help improve a student’s attendance before any legal action is taken. 
Until July 1, 2026, K-8 students also can’t be expelled “solely because the student is chronically absent or habitually truant.” After that date, however, students could be removed from school once again if they miss too many days of class.

The goal of the effort, led by Kansas-City-based hemp business American Shaman and announced on an industry call Monday, is to repeal the 41-page constitutional amendment that legalized recreational marijuana in 2022. It would replace it with language that instructs Missouri lawmakers to create regulations that are “no more burdensome than what we already have for alcohol and tobacco,” industry lobbyist Eapen Thampy said on a call with about 30 business owners and cannabis activists Monday morning.
“Part of the idea here is to remove that regulatory mandate in the Missouri Constitution,” he said. “We devolve regulatory authority back to the Missouri General Assembly, the elected representative of the people where it belongs.”
The petition language hasn’t been finalized yet, Thampy said, but it will ensure that cannabis remains legal until state lawmakers come up with laws regulating marijuana and intoxicating hemp products. It would take out criminal offenses for possessing too much marijuana but retain all the current taxes on the products. 
It would also allow businesses to obtain licenses to sell the products through a similar process as they do with alcohol and tobacco products. Currently marijuana facility licenses are limited and highly regulated, but businesses don’t need a license to sell intoxicating hemp products — despite numerous legislative attempts to outright ban them. 
The group is aiming, he said, to have the initiative petition language drafted in the next week, submitted to the Missouri Secretary of State by August with enough signatures by May to appear on the November 2026 ballot. It’s being organized under a new political committee called Missourians for a Single Market, formed last week.
The group’s announcement is the latest in the showdown between the marijuana industry — which has operated legally in Missouri since 2018 but is outlawed federally — and the hemp industry, whose products were legalized by the 2018 Farm Bill.
Thampy acknowledged the hemp industry’s feeling of uncertainty after Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey sent several cease-and-desist letters to companies selling a hemp product called THCA flower that looks exactly like marijuana flower sold at dispensaries.
Bailey’s letters threaten legal action, including injunctions, civil penalties and attorney’s fees if the companies continue to sell the products. 
“When purchasing products, Missourians deserve to know if they are being exposed to dangerous side effects like psychotic episodes, hallucinations or other life-threatening risks,” Bailey said in a statement to The Independent last week. “We have issued 18 cease and desist letters so far, and more are forthcoming.”
Thampy claims the initiative petition campaign will bring more unity between the two industries after being at odds for several years over legislation that could potentially ban intoxicating hemp products in Missouri. 
“We want to give the marijuana operators an opportunity to pursue the consumer dollar in the mass market, as the hemp side already does,” Thampy said. 
However, Andrew Mullins, executive director for the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, called the idea a “bait and switch.”
The state’s regulated marijuana industry, he said, generated $241 million in state and local tax revenues last year alone and is regarded as one of the most successful marijuana programs in the country, citing a Wall Street Journal article.  
Voters have twice voted for cannabis regulation, he said, and any effort to roll back those constitutional protections would be a “spectacular failure.”
“Missourians aren’t about to take hundreds of millions away from local communities, veterans and our justice system, all in hopes that politicians will eventually replace it with something down the road,” Mullins said.  
Thampy said that tax revenue wouldn’t go away. The taxable market would increase by about a third, he said, “meaning tens of millions in new revenue for public defenders, substance abuse prevention, and the Missouri Veterans Commission.”
Steve DeAngelo, a California-based marijuana advocate involved in multiple successful legalization campaigns, said during Monday’s call that the effort also will help unify those currently working in the “legacy” market, more commonly referred to as the black market.
“When you bring down the barriers to entry, all of the legacy folks who are right now out of the legal system would be able to come in,” he said. “So you create one single, unified market for cannabis across all sectors. That’s the proposal that I have to advance now.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_5805-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-17 07:03:08.490998

One of my stops was in Virginia City, and as I was leaving town the next morning, I decided to see if there was a golf course nearby where I could play nine holes.
I was happy to find a course called Madison Meadows just a few miles from town, where I stopped and got my gear. Although it was a Saturday morning, I just assumed that it wouldn’t be difficult to play on a course that is essentially out in the middle of nowhere. But the golf pro frowned when I told him I didn’t have a tee time. 
“Dangit, it’s too bad you didn’t show up about fifteen minutes ago. I sent a threesome out and you could have joined them.” He studied his computer and asked “Can you come back in about a half hour?”
“Nah, I’m on my way to Helena, so I can’t stick around.”
Now if you’ve spent any time around golf courses, it’s not unusual for a golf pro to show only a mild interest in you if you’re a stranger, but this guy was clearly disappointed in not being able to help me out, and after thinking for a minute, he said “Hey, I have a golf cart out there that’s a little faster than most of them. Would you be OK with grabbing that cart and catching up to those guys on the first green?” 
“Sure!” I said. 
So the next thing I knew, he was waving his arms, giving me directions for where to go to catch up to these guys, and when he wasn’t satisfied with that plan, he followed me out and grabbed a cart of his own and drove me halfway there so I wouldn’t get lost. 
I pulled up to the first green, where three guys who were probably in their early thirties were just finishing.
“Hi guys, the pro said I could join you if that’s OK.”
“Sure,” one of them said. “But we’re terrible golfers.”
He wasn’t lying. But that’s never bothered me. What I did notice, though, was something that’s been a troubling trend I’ve noticed in recent years. I spent two hours with these guys, who were very nice, very friendly guys. And I asked them a lot of questions about their lives. They all worked in mines, two of them in Butte and the third in a mine near Sheridan, Montana. But during that entire two hour period, none of them asked me a single question. 
I have noticed this often with people from that generation and younger. It’s not that I find it annoying so much as it makes me very concerned about what it says about younger generations in America. There has been a lot of talk about how COVID impacted young people, and I’m guessing that’s one factor. There’s also no question that social media has had a huge impact on peoples’ ability to connect with others. But what I find most bothersome about this is trying to understand what’s behind this lack of curiosity. 
When I meet someone, my natural tendency is to wonder what their story is: Where did they grow up? What do they do for a living? How did they meet their spouse? Are they a parent?
When someone shows none of that interest in me, I always assume that they have the same attitude toward anyone they meet, and I don’t understand that. Deciding you know all you need to know about other people is also going to translate to knowing all you need to know about the rest of the world as well. And that kind of closed-mindedness doesn’t foster growth. Or more importantly, empathy for other people. How can you possibly know whether you share any interests or opinions or even shared history without asking questions?
Today I went to a funeral for a young man I met about 10 years ago, when he was still in his early twenties. He was a good example of a young man who showed exactly that kind of curiosity. When I met Brian, he was working in a sporting goods store, running the machines that stitch the lettering on jerseys and hats. He enrolled in college, and completed his bachelor’s degree in three years, then went directly into the master’s program for business, and also completed that. 
He was interested in joining or running a business consultation firm, so his father set up a meeting with a local businessman. Knowing Brian, he came into this meeting overly prepared, and not just prepared to tell the man about himself, but prepared to ask many questions. He made such an impression on this man that the man told him that he not only wanted to hire him, but that he wanted to train him to take over the business once he retired. They came to an agreement, and during the course of the next few years, Brian slowly took over. 
But his approach to this venture was not to come in and tell everyone how things were going to be. Brian chose to consult with other businessmen and coaches so he could be the best possible boss he could be. 
Brian became a husband and a father, and he had the same attitude toward those duties. He wanted to do things right. He met with various people asking their advice. He was endlessly trying to improve. And it may have been this desire to be perfect that was his downfall. Brian stumbled a couple of times, and his inability to forgive himself plagued him. He got caught in a mental loop that he couldn’t seem to escape. It was painful to watch, and even more painful when he came begging for help, and it felt as if there was no easy answer. 
I have not been able to stop thinking about Brian since I found out about his passing last week. He was 34 years old. He was one of the smartest young men I’ve ever met. He had a wonderfully dry sense of humor, and a wisdom that was rare for a man so young. It is never easy to try and understand where things go wrong with people you love. But I know in Brian’s case, his downfall was not the result of lack of effort, or lack of willingness to ask for help. All of which makes his death that much more baffling and tragic.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/question-mark-key-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-06-17 07:03:08.490998

Effective immediately, he was pulled off of his assignment and told not to have any contact with the project going forward. 
It was all due to millions of dollars in AmeriCorps grant cancellations made by President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, as part of largescale cuts and reductions to the federal government. 
In Idaho alone, the cancellation of AmeriCorps grants and zeroing out of remaining grant fund balances totaled $1.9 million, according to the America’s Service Commission, which represents governor-led service organizations in all 50 states, including Serve Idaho.

Alvarez had been bracing for cuts to nonprofit organizations, but he didn’t understand why. In two years with AmeriCorps he had helped at the St. Vincent de Paul food pantry in Boise, done outreach with people facing homelessness in Caldwell and helped the Idaho Youth Ranch with communications and marketing. At the time the grant was terminated, he was helping a Boise nonprofit organization develop a strategic plan and public outreach campaign. 
Alvarez said he never had any reason to expect there was waste, fraud or abuse in the programs he worked with.
“I have skepticism that a program such as AmeriCorps falls into the category of waste, fraud or abuse,” Alvarez said in a phone interview Thursday.
“When I think of the (Trump) administration’s America First policies, I can’t think of any organization that epitomizes that more than AmeriCorps because they are going into communities and helping out in ways nobody else is,” Alvarez said. 
The cancelled AmeriCorps grants are among a growing number of nonprofit organizations and arts organizations that have told the Idaho Capital Sun this year that they have had grants cancelled or zeroed out at the state or federal level.
 What does AmeriCorps do in Idaho?

Founded in 1993, AmeriCorps is an independent U.S. government agency that supports public service and volunteerism by working with individuals and nonprofit organizations. 
AmeriCorps provides grants to local and national organizations for programs to reduce poverty, expand access to health services and technology, mentor students and more. 
In Idaho, the terminated AmeriCorps grants affected funding and programs across the state, from Moscow, to Boise, Pocatello, Salmon and Clayton.
The University of Idaho’s Positive Youth Development AmeriCorps program, which offers a 4-H STEM program for youth; the Student Conservation Association’s Idaho Corps program; Teach for America; White Clouds Preserve and the Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute all saw grants terminated this spring.
“AmeriCorps programs really include a wide range of activities to support and address the community’s needs by supporting youth mentoring, after school programming, financial literacy, teachers shortages, conservation efforts and other work to make the land accessible to community members,” America’s Service Commissions Chief Engagement Officer Rachel Bruns said in a phone interview Friday. “There are a wide range of issues and needs AmeriCorps members are addressing, and we are starting to see the impact of those services being halted. But the real concern is the infrastructure for these service organizations is being completely upended, and not everybody is going to be able to bounce back from having federal funding unexpectedly pulled out from under them.”
 AmeriCorps members abruptly told to immediately walk away from their projects

Beginning in November, Alvarez took an assignment to develop a strategic plan and work on public outreach for Idaho Smart Growth, a Boise-based nonprofit organization that works on sustainable growth, promotes safe routes to school and supports affordable housing.

After the presidential election in November, Alvarez said a rumble of uncertainty passed through the nonprofit community and folks started wondering if their funding was in jeopardy. Alvarez said he was told that funding was in place in this year’s federal fiscal year budget, which runs through September.
But on April 28 Alvarez said he got an email informing him he had been pulled off of the Smart Growth project immediately and was not to have any other contact with the project. Initially, Alvarez thought the email could be a scam because the message told him he could reach out with any questions or concerns, but it wasn’t signed and didn’t have a person’s name at the bottom like all of the other AmeriCorps emails he had received.
People all across the state had a similar experience. 
Darlene Carnopis, communications and research bureau chief for the Idaho Department of Labor, said AmeriCorps notified Serve Idaho (which is part of the Idaho Department of Labor) on April 25 that seven awards totalling nearly $1.4 million were cancelled immediately.
“This impacted 133 AmeriCorps members, 69 currently serving and 64 summer members,” Carnopis said in an email on Thursday. “The remaining balance of $420,635 for one Serve Idaho grant and a $60,000 VISTA grant were also terminated. All award activities were to be ceased immediately. Serve Idaho communicated this information to the impacted programs and is working with the subrecipients to close out the programs.”
The news frustrated and confused Alvarez. He joined AmeriCorps as an adult after working as a photojournalist and contractor because he wanted to work with nonprofits, where he found his level of job satisfaction and the rewards of working hard to be the highest. 
Although Alvarez said he was able to finish the bulk of his strategic plan and submit it in the days before the grant termination, he is frustrated by not being able to refine the plan and then work to implement it.
“Overall I feel it’s unfinished business,” Alvarez said.

Then at 20 weeks they got devastating news from their doctor.

The infant, upon being born, would have no chance of surviving. He lacked critical internal organs and his brain and heart were both abnormal.
“Our baby would die, either in utero or within hours after birth,” Kling told reporters Monday morning. “We were in a situation with no good outcome.”
To carry him for another four months, knowing that he would not live, “seemed inhumane,” Kling said.
The diagnosis was confirmed at 22 weeks — and by then, Kling said, her doctors were unable to help her because of an 1849 Wisconsin law that at the time was still being interpreted as a near-blanket ban on abortion.
Kling and her husband, residents of western Wisconsin, traveled to neighboring Minnesota. There, doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester confirmed that, if born, their baby would not be viable. At her request, the medical team induced labor at 23 weeks. Kling gave birth and the couple’s son died in their arms an hour later.
Kling told her story Monday at a news conference held by advocates to draw attention to next week’s third anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling ending a national right to abortion.
Dr. Nike Mourikes of the Committee to Protect Health Care said from the moment the ruling was issued, “I realized how this cruel decision would cause harm to so many lives and undermine the ability of physicians and other health care providers to care for their patients.”
Abortion was a legal right throughout her medical training and practice until the 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Mourikes said. 
The Court’s 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in the first 20 weeks while placing some limits on the procedure later in pregnancy. Although Mourikes had heard “the horror stories” of what women had experienced before that decision, she said, “I never imagined that we would ever, ever go back to those days again.”  
  Dr. Nike Mourikes speaks about the impact on her patients of losing the right to abortion after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)
As a physician, she has cared for many women who sought abortion to end a pregnancy. “Each woman had her own unique history, her own unique reasons and circumstances that led her to make this complex decision,” Mourikes said. “But that choice was her choice, not the government’s, not a politician’s. It was her body and it was her right.”
The 2022 ruling effectively reinstated Wisconsin’s 1849 law, which at the time was widely seen as a near-blanket abortion ban.
A September 2023 Dane County Circuit Court ruling reversed that assumption, with the judge holding that the law applied to feticide, but not to elective abortions. A decision on that ruling is now pending in the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
Nevertheless, the law “casts a shadow over our state,” Morikes said. Republican lawmakers have been unwilling to repeal the law, and even when Roe v Wade was still in effect, enacted laws “that force doctors to practice medicine not for the good of their patients, but to satisfy anti-abortion politicians.”
Those include a requirement for “an invasive, sometimes painful and medically unnecessary ultrasound” before an abortion, she said, as well as “a medically unnecessary 24-hour waiting period” that requires women to visit a health provider two days in a row before having an abortion.
Sydney Andersen, a government relations specialist for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin, said Planned Parenthood has succeeded in returning abortion services to Wisconsin since the Dane County ruling.
But the organization faces new challenges, she said. Those include the budget reconciliation bill  that passed the U.S. House last month and is now in the Senate. A provision in the bill prevents Planned Parenthood from accepting Medicaid coverage for low-income patients.
Planned Parenthood at risk of closing hundreds of clinics, drastically limiting abortion access

If the U.S. Senate enacts the provision and it becomes law, “more than 1 million patients across the United States could lose their access to birth control, wellness exams, vaccines, STI [sexually transmitted infection] testing, and cancer screenings, including over 50,000 patients in Wisconsin alone,” Andersen said. Black women, other people of color, rural residents and other low-income families would experience “the most significant impact,” she said.
Kling, who is 34 and described herself as a working mother, said she was telling the story of her third pregnancy to make the point that “abortion restrictions can impact anyone who can become pregnant.”
In an interview, Kling told the Wisconsin Examiner that she had not been politically engaged before the experience.
“I was always pro-choice, but after going through this experience I wanted to utilize my story to help people understand that this can impact anyone,” she said.
Despite the current circuit court ruling, the current state of Wisconsin law is such that hospitals “will always create policy that is more restrictive than what the law allows,” Kling said. “There’s a lot of gray area in our law right now with the politics.”
In the news conference, Kling described the emotions that washed over the couple in the hour that she and her husband held their dying infant.
“Our son only knew love,” she said. “But as parents, those were the most helpless and traumatic moments that we have ever had to endure.”
Kling said she tried to contact her Republican state lawmakers in hopes of raising their awareness about the effect of the current state of abortion restrictions. Her state representative has not responded to her calls or email messages, and her state senator’s aide said he was “too busy to schedule a 10-minute meeting to hear my story,” she said.
“Are they unwilling to understand what real women are going through or do they simply not care?” Kling said. “Is this the reality you want the women of Wisconsin to face? Forcing us to flee our state for care?”

The first months of North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein’s administration have been marked by a striking lack of hostility and conflict. To his credit, Stein has worked diligently to build bridges and find common ground with Republicans – both in Raleigh and Washington. He’s yet to veto a bill.
Unfortunately, this move toward the center has won little reciprocation from the GOP and this fact is evidenced in a bill approved by the General Assembly last week.
Senate Bill 50 would, with few exceptions, allow any person in the state 18 and older to carry a concealed weapon without a permit of any kind.
Yes — you heard that right. Under the bill, most high school seniors would be entitled to carry a loaded, hidden handgun virtually anywhere they choose. No training of any kind would be required.
And you really can’t make this up.
The bottom line: The bill was approved by a large margin, but there were enough ‘no’ votes to indicate lawmakers can sustain a gubernatorial veto. Gov. Stein should issue such a veto and work to make it stick.

Wyoming offers 12 parks, more than 20 historic sites and plenty of opportunities to get off the beaten path.
The post Go somewhere new this summer with these hidden Wyoming gems appeared first on WyoFile .","Most Wyomingites have soaked in the Thermopolis hot springs and have likely camped, fished or biked at Glendo State Park. 
But how many of us have visited Names Hill Historic Site near LaBarge or stopped to look at the Ames Monument at the highest point on the original transcontinental railroad route? 
Chances are, not many of us. In fact, most of us likely visit the same places year after year, returning to our favorite campsites at our favorite state parks, national forests or reservoirs. 
But just as the national park system offers far more than Yellowstone and Yosemite, Wyoming’s state parks supply some pretty remarkable hidden gems, including 12 parks and more than 20 historic sites. Each is steeped in history and adventure, culture and beauty. And as the national parks face a summer with diminished capacity in the face of federal workforce cuts, consider spending these hot months visiting Wyoming’s overlooked sites. 
To help you on your journey, WyoFile talked with Wyoming State Parks and Historic Sites Director Dave Glenn about his top five overlooked state gems.
Seminoe State Park: Solitude with a side of fishing
“It takes quite a bit of work to get there,” says Glenn about Seminoe State Park. “Which means you can always get a site.”
He’s not exaggerating. Nestled against the Seminoe Mountains, the park sits about 35 miles north of Sinclair off Interstate 80 in southern Wyoming. 
The park boasts a reservoir full of trout and walleye with nearby sand dunes perfect for exploring. It also provides easy access to the Miracle Mile section of the North Platte River for anyone interested in floating or wade fishing. 
But for Glenn, solitude is the real draw.

“There just aren’t a lot of people there,” he says. “You can wander around the nearby wilderness study area or watch bighorn sheep.”
Bring binoculars for a chance to see hawks and eagles along with migratory birds, ducks, pelicans and geese. Go for the day or stay the night. You likely won’t need a reservation. 
Medicine Lodge Archeological Site: Thousands of years of history

Tucked into the Bighorn Mountains in north-central Wyoming rests an archeological site with 10,000 years of stories. And learning about those stories became easier with the site’s new interpretive center, Glenn says. 
“It’s really one of a kind,” he says. “You walk from season to season and through time, including interviews with tribal members.”
The Medicine Lodge Archeological Site includes a 750-foot-long sandstone cliff with hundreds of petroglyphs and pictographs. 
The area also offers a campground in iconic red rock country, a cottonwood river bottom and a creek running through. Fish from your campsite or bring your horses and leave them in the corrals when you’re not riding.
“It’s a great mix of outdoor recreation with past human history.”
Piedmont Charcoal Kilns: Perfectly preserved heritage
Glenn will take just about any excuse to veer off Interstate 80 while traveling across the bottom of the state. And in the southwest corner, that reason is the Piedmont Charcoal Kilns. 
The 30-foot-tall cones look like beehives rising from the prairie. They were built in 1869, and used wood gathered in the Uinta Mountains to produce charcoal shipped to Utah. While charcoal kilns exist in other areas, the Piedmont site is one of the country’s most intact and preserved.

“For years, I’d driven by and never stopped to see them,” Glenn says. Once he did, he realized they were more than worth the stop, available to the public to view, explore and learn more about for free.
Wyoming Territorial Prison: See where Butch Cassidy did time
On Laramie’s western edge sits one of the state’s oldest buildings: The Wyoming Territorial Prison. You won’t miss it if you drive by. “It looks like an old prison,” Glenn says. 
While the architecture is impressive, as are the surrounding old West buildings — including a church, a mercantile and cabins — the real intrigue rests inside. 
Cells fill the inside of the prison, including ones you can walk into and imagine what life was like in a territorial prison. Large plaques hang on the walls featuring headshots of inmates with their backstories, including tales of murder and mayhem, shootouts and cattle rustling.

The prison also contains a small museum dedicated to Butch Cassidy’s story including artifacts from his life. 
“It’s a powerful piece of Wyoming history,” Glenn says. 
Oregon Trail Ruts: Retrace a journey
Imagine what pioneers must have felt as they traveled through Wyoming’s harsh, high desert landscape on their way west. They hit blizzards and thunderstorms, crossed raging rivers and tangled with rattlesnakes and bears. 
And in eastern Wyoming, right outside Guernsey State Park, you can see where those wagons coursed across the landscape. Ruts sometimes up to five feet deep cut through soft sandstone, visible a short walk from the site’s parking lot.

“You look at that sandstone, and go ‘holy cow, how many horses and wagons had to go over this to create grooves that deep?’” says Glenn. 
The site has a picnic shelter and restroom. Anyone interested in camping in the area can head over to Guernsey State Park.

Gillette City Council has a clear choice, columnist Kerry Drake opines. Govern according to the truth or be misled by righteous indignation.
The post Gillette health clinic’s funding fate shouldn’t be tied to abortion lies appeared first on WyoFile .","A critical decision with consequences for Gillette’s access to health care is about to be made based on religious and political leaders’ false claims that city funds are being used for abortion services.

Opinion

The possibility of Gillette Reproductive Health, a popular low-cost health care clinic, losing funding for the second time in five years has supporters once again on the defense, emphatically denying that any abortion services have been provided or recommended. 
The only question the Gillette City Council should consider is if the clinic — which it has funded for the past 15 years — has done a good job providing health care to people who can’t afford it. Righteous indignation about something the clinic doesn’t even do should not be part of the conversation.
As many supporters who use the clinic testified at the city council’s hearing, it provides services to low-income residents who are either uninsured or pay high deductibles for insurance coverage. It’s an important part of the community, providing STD testing and treatment for women and men, plus pregnancy testing, pap smears, breast cancer screening, birth control and sex education.
Such health services are needed by more women than ever. A new national Ipsos poll commissioned by the Alliance for Women’s Health and Prevention found that 42% of women are forgoing preventive care services such as annual check-ups, medical tests or treatments, and vaccines, or had trouble getting an appointment with a provider in the last year.
The latter issue is a problem for many women in Wyoming due to a severe lack of practicing OB-GYNs. So is the high cost of tests and other services. City and county money have been used directly to subsidize patient costs. A $25 woman’s wellness exam at Gillette Reproductive Health can cost as much as 10 times that amount elsewhere.
“We do pull people out of poverty,” Julie Price Carroll, the clinic’s executive director, told the city council, speaking of the positive impact of providing low-cost health care. “If we don’t have the funds, [then] women go back into poverty and we create that cycle of poverty.” 
Watching a June 3 public hearing online about the controversy made me think about the words of philosopher Henry David Thoreau: “It takes two to speak the truth — one to speak and another to hear.”
Key decision-makers on the council, which has twice voted 4-3 in preliminary action to remove all $30,000 budgeted for the clinic, clearly aren’t listening to constituents who would otherwise go to emergency rooms at hospitals that won’t get paid for providing medical care. Those costs will be passed on to taxpayers and people who can afford insurance.
An online petition in favor of continuing the funding had 1,086 signers by last Friday, and supporters have a goal of 2,000 by Tuesday. 
No matter how many signatures are submitted, council members who voted to eliminate funds appear more focused on claims by a group of pastors who want to defund Gillette Reproductive Health. Also wading into the controversy is Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, chairman emeritus of the far-right Freedom Caucus that controls the state House of Representatives.
Rev. Zachary Viggers of Trinity Lutheran Church, the leader of the clergy group, said it objects to taxpayer dollars being used to fund “an organization that advocates for abortion, and I would add to that Plan B.”
Plan B is emergency contraception, also known as “the morning-after pill.” It prevents a pregnancy from developing and is used within 72 hours of unprotected sex.
“This stance is in direct conflict with Natural Law, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the entirety of Scripture and the deeply held beliefs of many in our community,” Viggers said.
Dr. David Beck, voluntary medical director of Gillette Reproductive Health for the past two decades, said unequivocally that he and the nonprofit organization “do not perform abortions, dispense medications that would cause abortions or support the termination of life.”
After the hearing, Beck posted on Facebook that he isn’t conceding any of the moral high ground to a group of “uninformed, misled individuals” who don’t tell the truth. 
“The Bible consistently encourages the caring for the poor and vulnerable,” the physician added. “We encourage [the city council] to continue helping us help others.”
Bear said he wrote the council a letter warning them that, because of the statewide 25% property tax cut — which he didn’t bother to say was supported by the Freedom Caucus — Gillette and other cities will have less money to spend. He said people who want to support abortion can donate to Gillette Reproductive Health.
“There are other places that provide the same type of other services without the abortion portion, and they are completely privately funded,” Bear added.
Pastor Ed Sisti continued down the same road, ignoring Beck’s testimony.
“We are not stopping abortion, we are just not supporting it, and you [the council] are supporting it,” Sisti said. “Even if one referral is made, you are supporting it. And I would say that is not your job and not your responsibility. I would encourage you to not do it, and I would encourage you to vote for life. Vote for life, which is why we voted you into office.”
Councilwoman Heidi Gross strongly defended Gillette Reproductive Health, stating the rumors spreading throughout the community for years about the clinic providing abortions and referring people for the procedure are “absolutely not true.”
She said she talked to her pastor, who was not part of the anti-clinic group, about the controversy. He provided an essential part of the debate I didn’t hear anybody else address.
“His take was that religious leaders should not be telling government what they should be doing with their money. I agree with that,” Gross said. “We have to have a separation of church and state. And for people to believe council should take a stance on this is highly inappropriate.” 
It will take political courage for any of the four councilmen, who have so far relied on demonstrably false claims about the clinic, to change their vote today. But if they were listening to the truth-tellers, it should make their jobs easier.

Thirty prominent professional health organizations signed an open letter urging insurers to continue covering vaccinations during pregnancy. (Justin Sullivan | Getty Images)The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is urging insurers to continue covering vaccinations during pregnancy in an open letter signed by 30 prominent professional health organizations.
Pregnant patients and their infants are vulnerable to complications from COVID-19. In the letter to payers and insurance companies released this week, ACOG stressed the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations and how they protect babies and pregnant people. It was signed by prominent professional groups including the American College of Physicians, Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Public Health Association.
The letter follows U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to eliminate the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy children and healthy pregnant patients, sidestepping an established decision process by scientists. Kennedy, who has made false claims questioning vaccine safety, earlier this week fired all 17 experts on the federal vaccine advisory committee panel, replacing them with eight new members, four of whom have spoken out against vaccines.
The Trump administration’s moves have alarmed health experts, who worry about coverage and access to the shot amid the agency’s dismissal of science.
“We are deeply concerned about the recently adopted HHS policy to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,” the letter reads. “Given the historic gaps in research, investment, and support for women’s health, it is essential that all aspects of obstetric and gynecologic care — including COVID-19 vaccination — be grounded in the best available scientific evidence.
Studies have shown babies born following a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have a higher risk of low birth weights, stillbirth and respiratory distress, and data demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.
Pregnant women who contract COVID-19 are also at higher risk of complications such as blood clots, are more likely to be hospitalized in intensive care units or to need ventilators, and are at a higher risk of death, the letter notes.
Payers should make the vaccine available to “pregnant people without undue utilization management or cost-sharing requirements,” the letter reads. Without insurance, a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 shot can cost roughly $140 for adults.
Following the recommendation rollback, public health officials in some states have emphasized their support of COVID-19 vaccines.
The Wisconsin Department of Health Services, for example, said it “continues to recommend the current COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and for every person 6 months and older,” noting that newborns “depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection.” Wisconsin Medicaid will also continue to cover the shot, the department said in a media release.
Officials in Georgia also said they expect continued coverage of the shot.
In Washington, a spokesperson for the state health agency told local media that the department is advising pregnant people to speak with their provider “to determine if receiving a COVID-19 vaccine is best for them.”
During this year’s legislative sessions, at least seven states introduced legislation aiming to ban or limit mRNA vaccines. Instead of using a weakened or dead version of the actual virus to stimulate an immune response, mRNA vaccines use a genetic code created in a laboratory to tell the body’s cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology.
“The COVID vaccines were a remarkable scientific accomplishment, and they remain the best tool that we have to prevent severe outcomes associated with COVID infection,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, ACOG president, wrote in a statement. “Ob-gyns know that COVID infection during pregnancy can be incredibly dangerous for our pregnant patients — and we know that the vaccine can protect both them and their infants after birth.”
When patients are “forced to pay out of pocket, or to cover high cost sharing,” he wrote, “they are less likely to be able to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”

(Jordan Gale/Oregon Capital Chronicle)It is a common phrase in treaties between the U.S. government and Indigenous American tribes: “Each tribe or band shall have the right to possess, occupy and use the reserve allotted to it, as long as the grass shall grow and the waters run, and the reserves shall be their own property like their horses and cattle.”
But as Angie Debo pointed out in her 1940 book “And Still the Waters Run,” grass still grows, waters still run and all the treaties have been broken by the federal government for mining, grazing, land for settlers and other reasons. Tribes are protected people under federal law even though they are sovereign nations within the United States.
Trump breaks historic Columbia River deal between U.S. government, tribes, Northwest states

Now, the Trump administration continues that federal tradition by breaking yet another treaty, this one between the feds, four Indigenous tribes and the states of Washington and Oregon. The 2023 agreement to restore fish runs is being revoked so corporations can generate electricity in the Columbia Basin. Prior to the agreement, salmon, steelhead and other native fish were being killed by hydroelectric dams along the Columbia River.
For the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Nation and the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs of Oregon this is not a minor inconvenience. Fishing – especially salmon – is a sacred right, a duty for the tribe to protect the fish which feeds the people. Removing the fish protections from the damns erases a major part of the tribe’s identity and culture.
A major issue for the tribes is because of the dams, the salmon are disappearing at an alarming rate. Shannon Wheeler, Nez Perce tribal chairman, told the Oregon Capital Chronicle to eliminate the treaty is to deny the truth of what is happening.
“This action tries to hide from the truth,” Wheeler said. “The Nez Perce Tribe holds a duty to speak the truth for the salmon, and the truth is that the extinction of salmon population is happening now.”
Because Congress has the final say about dams, U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, in January introduced legislation protecting the Lower Snake River Dams, an action which erases the treaty with the tribes. Risch applauded Trump’s move, calling it “common sense.”
What would be more common sense is encouragement of other forms of electrical generation. Sources such as wind power, solar and geothermal are now being discouraged by the “big, beautiful bill” now in the Senate. There are alternatives out there, electricity could be generated using other renewable resources beyond hydropower.
By using these other resources, the U.S. could help tribes protect their cultures while still generating power for all citizens.
For anyone who would say the tribes no longer matter, think of it this way: How would it feel to have someone erase the Fourth of July saying it is no longer important? That it no longer matters for Americans to celebrate their independence from King George III? It represents something that happened 250 years ago, so why should anyone care?
To tribal members, their cultures are not just a symbol, it is their way of life, the essence of their soul. It is their belief systems, their history and how they see and interact in the world. Erasing part of that does more than simply reduce the salmon population, it destroys the center of tribal culture.
The U.S. needs to honor their treaties – promises – to people they are legally required under federal law to protect. Congress should insist on keeping the treaty. Otherwise, why should the government be trusted to keep their word?

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s forensic audit of Memphis Shelby County Schools will delve into allegations by key Republican lawmakers that the school district is destroying information in advance of a state audit.
Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton contacted Comptroller Jason Mumpower about the allegations as the state prepares to start a $6 million forensic audit of the school July 17, according to spokesman John Dunn.
“We certainly take them seriously, and we’ll consider them as we move forward with evaluating and selecting the firm that will do the forensic audit of MSCS,” Dunn said.
Tennessee planning $6 million audit of Memphis Shelby schools

In a statement posted Friday on X, formerly Twitter, Sexton and Lt. Gov. Randy McNally said, “Hearing Shelby County Schools is destroying documents ahead of the forensic audit – this is a crime! @TNCOT (Comptroller) has been notified. Those tampering with or destroying public records will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” 
Sexton and McNally provided no specific details of the accusations. McNally spokesman Adam Kleinheider said they made the statement “after reliable sources indicated that the system may be destroying or deleting documents.”
Memphis Democratic lawmakers were leery of the leaders’ allegation.
Sen. Raumesh Akbari said “no verified” evidence exists that documents are being destroyed and added that Superintendent Rod Richmond has said the district is cooperating fully with the audit.
“I trust that if any issues arise, they’ll be handled the right way with the auditors and the proper authorities,” Akbari said.
Memphis Shelby County Schools did not respond to a phone call seeking comment.










If you’re making accusations and they don’t bear out, then you’re damaging the reputation of the school system.


– Rep. G.A. Hardaway, D-Memphis


Democratic Rep. G.A. Hardaway of Memphis questioned the fairness of the statement and said Sexton had not contacted him or his colleagues to discuss any possible wrongdoing before the audit. Hardaway said legislative leaders should present any evidence of destroying or deleting documents to state and law enforcement agencies. The comptroller’s auditors will be able to detect it, he said.
“If you’re making accusations and they don’t bear out, then you’re damaging the reputation of the school system. You’re creating more trauma and drama for our staff, teachers, our school children who have a right to be proud of their system,” Hardaway said.
The Tennessee legislature approved funding for the audit this year as some Republican lawmakers floated the idea that such an investigation into the district’s finances could lead to criminal charges against Memphis Shelby County Schools officials for financial wrongdoing.
Lawmakers hit a wall, though, in trying to pass legislation creating a state management board that would supersede the elected Memphis Shelby County School Board, giving it control over most major decisions. The Senate version of the bill would have allowed Tennessee’s education commissioner to remove the schools director or school board members and allow the county commission to replace them. In case of three straight years of school district director changes, the county mayor could appoint a new director for a four-year term.

The state ranks 44th in overall health outcomes and has the highest rate of rural hospital closures per capita. And since the Republican supermajority that runs Tennessee refused to expand Medicaid, the poorest Tennesseans have difficulty accessing care. 
Even though a majority of Americans believe that the government should guarantee health care for all people, politicians and profiteers exploit the working class in America in pursuit of power and fatter wallets. As a result of this failed system, Tennessee is now in the top 10 states for medical debt. 
Instead of addressing these real problems, the Tennessee legislature has passed at least 21 anti-LGBTQ+ laws since 2015.
Lawmakers have spent time and money targeting schools and libraries with legislation about “obscenity,” “critical race theory” and other imaginary bogeymen. They’ve made it a felony to be homeless while also letting corporations continue to financially wring the necks of working people. (This is of course besides the multiple ethical and criminal investigations, various scandals and DUIs our representatives keep catching.) 
It’s in this context that Queers United In Liberating Tennessee (QUILT) decided to launch their “Burn Debt, Not Books” campaign. 
“Even the potential threat of medical bills will make people avoid getting the care they need,” said Mina Parkison, QUILT member and co-founder. “We’ve constructed a punitive healthcare system — people are forced into impossible situations where they have to gamble with their health, a gamble they will eventually lose.” 
Through ‘Burn Debt,’ QUILT raised enough money to purchase and abolish more than $4.8 million in medical debt for some of Tennessee’s poorest residents.

A campaign of the Middle Tennessee Democratic Socialists of America, QUILT launched in 2023 with a goal of organizing, educating, and building community among LGBTQ+  folks in the state. Organizers said that, while QUILT centers LGBTQ+ people and “queer issues,” part of the point is to connect those things to the wider struggles of the poor and working class. 
“[QUILT] wanted to train a new generation of queer organizers, so they can take what they learn and organize their workplaces, apartment complexes and communities,” said Arden Ingleheart, another QUILT founder. “Class is a huge part of the way queer people are oppressed — so things like universal healthcare, affordable housing and a living wage are queer issues, too.”
“Burn Debt, Not Books” is the first major organizing effort that QUILT has undertaken since its founding. Using the Undue Medical Debt platform, which leverages donations to buy bundled medical debts at steep discounts and then cancel what’s owed, QUILT raised more than $26,000 — enough to abolish nearly $5 million. 
That may seem unlikely or even absurd but the financialization of health care in America makes this bizarre scenario possible. 
Broadly speaking, when you owe — even if you have insurance — care facilities like hospitals and emergency rooms pester you to pay the balance until they believe they’re not getting any more, or they’re convinced you’re simply not going to pay. Once that happens, they’ll usually either sue you or send the bill to collections. What the latter actually means is that the company sells your debt to a collections company for pennies on the dollar. That agency then starts pestering — and threatening — you all over again, with the goal of getting as much as they can before selling your debt to someone else. 
Undue Medical Debt disrupts this cruel cycle by purchasing the collateralized debt, like a collections agency would. But instead of trying to squeeze money out of working people, they cancel the bills with no strings attached. 
QUILT’s campaign launched during PRIDE 2024, and was set to run for four months. Members hoped to raise $10,000. When they exceeded their goal in less than one month, they decided to increase it, eventually surpassing their initial mark by more than 2.5 times.
During the campaign, QUILT members hosted booths, events, appeared as guests on podcasts and radio programs, hosted benefit concerts, solicited donations online, published op-eds and partnered with Nashville-based Daybreak Arts for a gallery exhibit showing work by LGBTQ+artists. 










Class is a huge part of the way queer people are oppressed — so things like universal healthcare, affordable housing and a living wage are queer issues, too.


– Arden Ingleheart, cofounder, Queers United in Liberating Tennessee


The effort was inspired by the work of Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM), who raised tens of thousands of pounds to support striking union members during the UK Miners’ Strike of 1984-85. In the end, Undue used the donations raised by QUILT to purchase debt from 10 Tennessee counties spanning all three grand divisions, comprising more than 3,300 individuals, with an average debt cancellation of $1,459 per person.
Undue Medical Debt is a nonpartisan organization, and many different nonprofits, places of worship, community organizations, and others have used the platform to alleviate medical debt for their neighbors as well. 
Recipients of the “Burn Debt, Not Books” relief will not have applied or inquired, and there’s no way of knowing how many of them are LGBTQ+. In fact, most will be completely unaware of the campaign until they receive a letter in the mail telling them that their medical bill has been cancelled by some of their LGBTQ+ neighbors. 
“We continue to recognize the need for a united working class — whether they be queer or not, whether they be transgender or cisgender,” said Parkison at a symbolic debt burning celebration hosted by QUILT. “As our government seeks to divide us, as the violent rhetoric of the right-wing in this country escalates, as the attack on the queer community heightens, so do the attacks on unions, workers and families.”
“The biggest fear of our oppressors is a united, strong, and fearless working class,” she said.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7556.jpeg,,,2025-06-17 06:04:08.810845

Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order on his second day in office to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs in West Virginia, and now he’s said that state employees will not get the Juneteenth holiday off.
Juneteenth, celebrated on June 19, marks the end of slavery in the United States. Although the Emancipation Proclamation took effect on Jan. 1, 1863, it took until June 19, 1865 for that news to reach Galveston Bay, Texas. 
When WOWK 13 News asked the governor’s office if state employees would be given the day off, the governor’s Deputy Press Secretary Drew Galang said no.
“Here is our statement on Juneteenth activities, which you can attribute to me: Gov. Morrisey will be formally recognizing Juneteenth with an official proclamation recognizing the significance of the day and will encourage all West Virginians to take a moment to commemorate the end of slavery in the U.S. Due to the continued fiscal challenges facing West Virginia, state government will not be sponsoring any formal activities.”
Is a moment all it’s worth to acknowledge such an important part of our country’s history?
On June 17, 2021, former President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act which established Juneteenth as a federal holiday. 
In 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, former Gov. Jim Justice issued proclamations declaring Juneteenth a state holiday. Is Justice really more woke than Morrisey?
Herbert Henderson Office of Minority Affairs, which deals with all underserved citizens across West Virginia, hosted a Juneteenth celebration last year.
I reached out to the office to ask if it would host any events this year for Juneteenth, and if not, did they have a statement. I received the exact same exact statement that the governor’s office released. No additional comment.
Juneteenth is followed by West Virginia Day on June 20. When asked by a West Virginia Watch reporter if state employees will still get West Virginia Day off, Galang wrote in an email, “Juneteenth is not a state holiday. West Virginia Day is a state holiday. Therefore, state employees will have West Virginia Day off.”
Now governor, I know you’re not from here, so you might not know that West Virginia became a state after it separated from Virginia because West Virginia wanted slavery to end and Virginia did not. On June 20, 1863, West Virginia joined the Union. We were not part of the Confederacy, despite all the flags some people here like to fly. 
If any state should be celebrating the end of slavery, West Virginia sure should be. 
There’s already been precedent set that Juneteenth was celebrated as a state holiday. Why take it away now after celebrating for four years? It sounds like you don’t want to give state employees a four-day weekend.
No excuse has been given, other than the reasoning for the state not sponsoring any formal activities — the “continued fiscal challenges.”
If money is that tight, perhaps the Legislature should have done something to fix the Public Employees Insurance Agency during the regular session instead of planning to spend thousands on a special session in July. 
In April, Morrisey proclaimed Good Friday as a half day holiday for state employees.
“Good Friday is a day of reflection and prayer, and I am encouraging West Virginians to take time to be with their family and church community,” Morrisey said in a statement.
Shouldn’t West Virginians also have time to be with their families and church communities on Juneteenth? 
West Virginia has 12 official state holidays, including the day after Thanksgiving, which is Lincoln’s Day. State code also states that legal holidays, include “Any day proclaimed or ordered by the Governor or the President of the United States as a day of special observance or Thanksgiving, or a day for the general cessation of business, is a holiday.” 
I’m trying to think of an actual legitimate reason why the governor may not want to have the state recognize the holiday, but I don’t know why I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt. It comes off as racist because, well, it is. 
Juneteenth was treated like an official state holiday for four years, and now that we have a governor who doesn’t think diversity or inclusion is important, it’s no longer treated as such. It’s disappointing to have a governor who doesn’t put any thought or consideration into Black West Virginians’ lives.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)Kentucky’s Republican statewide office holders have teamed up in the partisan struggle over who will choose the Executive Branch Ethics Commission, as both sides accuse the other of trying to “weaponize” ethics enforcement.
At issue is a 2022 law enacted by the legislature’s Republican supermajority that enlarges the commission from five to seven members and allows each of the constitutional officers (with the exception of the lieutenant governor) to appoint a member. The governor, who now appoints all five members, would have only two appointments under the contested law.
After the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the law, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear appealed to the state’s Supreme Court. 
The Republican constitutional officers joined together to file a brief with the Supreme Court last week calling the law “a good-government measure to ensure that the Commission is beholden to no one.” 
A spokesperson for Beshear on Monday said the Republicans are trying to “politicize and even weaponize” the commission that enforces the ethics code governing executive branch employees.
Cameron says ‘Democrat-controlled’ ethics commission charged him with violation over fundraising

Meanwhile, former Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican who is facing an ethics charge before the commission, commended the Republican office holders for filing their brief. In a post on X Friday evening, Cameron said: “This is a critical step toward ending the weaponization of government against political opponents.” 
Last month, Cameron criticized the commission for charging him with an ethics violation stemming from donations collected by his 2023 campaign for governor. At the time, Cameron chalked it up to the work of a “Democrat-controlled Executive Branch Ethics Commission.”
Beshear, who challenged the GOP law and won at the circuit court level, and Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman are the only Democratic state-level constitutional officers. The lieutenant governor would not appoint any ethics commissioners under the GOP law. The constitutional offices that would gain the power to appoint the majority of the Executive Branch Ethics Commission are currently all held by Republicans: Attorney General Russell Coleman, Auditor Allison Ball, Secretary of State Michael Adams, Commissioner of Agriculture Jonathan Shell and Treasurer Mark Metcalf. 
Ball in a Friday statement said Beshear “continues to place politics above fairness” by pressing his appeal.
“Kentuckians deserve an Executive Branch Ethics Commission that upholds good governance and serves the public interest, not one beholden to partisan control,” she said. “I remain committed to standing up for the rule of law and serving the people of the Commonwealth.”
Adams voiced  similar sentiments in a separate statement, adding that Beshear’s “unconstitutional power grabs and contempt for the rule of law have fared poorly in court time and time again, and they should now too.”
“While Governor Beshear claims he is ‘not involved in actions of the ethics commission, as it is fully independent under state law,’ he is telling the Supreme Court in his lawsuit against us that he must personally control the ethics commission,” Adams said. “Both cannot be true.” 
According to the biographies of current commission members listed online, at least two members were appointed by Beshear on the recommendation of two former Republican constitutional officers, Cameron, when he was attorney general, and state Auditor Mike Harmon.  
Jefferson Circuit Judge McKay Chauvin sided with Beshear. But the Court of Appeals’ three-judge court panel disagreed, ruling that the General Assembly has the power to distribute powers of the governor among constitutional officers.
Notably, in her concurrence with the appellate decision, Court of Appeals Judge Sara Walter Combs raised concerns about a chipping away of gubernatorial powers and called for the Supreme Court to reexamine the precedent on which the Court of Appeals based its decision. She pointed to a “proliferation of cases” regarding the General Assembly’s power to limit a governor’s authority, saying the questions raised involve “the very heart of the sacrosanct doctrine of separation of powers.” 
Crystal Staley, a spokesperson for Beshear, said Monday afternoon that the governor has asked to “continue to ensure that all state government runs in an ethical and efficient manner.”
“Our constitution is clear: The Governor has the duty to ensure our laws are followed,” she said. “The other constitutional officers support the General Assembly having the ability to strip the Governor of this authority and give it to others based on partisan politics. Those other officers don’t have the same constitutional duty to uphold our laws.
“Gov. Beshear should have the same authority as every governor before him. This was an attempt by the General Assembly to politicize and even weaponize the Executive Branch Ethics Commission.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/240103StateoftheCommonwealth128-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-17 06:04:08.810845

Ties are yellow (All maps by Nick Field via Dave’s Redistricting).It was one of the most momentous upsets of the 2024 election.
The Senate battle between Democrat Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick was also one of the closest contests of the 2024 campaign cycle. The race was decided by just 0.22% or 15,115 votes. Whenever the results are so razor-thin, any and every development could well have been the one that ultimately determined the outcome. 
Over the past few cycles, I’ve formulated a method to examine elections comprehensively, starting back to the earliest campaign developments all the way through to November’s precinct-level results. So let’s dive into 2024’s PA Senate contest and see what we can learn.
The Nominees
Bob Casey
Bob Casey went into the campaign with high name recognition in Pennsylvania politics. He had served 28 years in elected offices on the state and federal levels. His father and namesake was part of the state’s political world for 22 years, as governor, state senator and state auditor general. Yet, Casey didn’t seem to leave much of an impression on his fellow citizens. 
In contrast to John Fetterman’s hoodie populism or Josh Shapiro’s ‘get s**t done’ motto, Casey hadn’t built up his own recognizable brand. In recent years, he frequently appeared with maps of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. The idea was that the long-time pol knew the commonwealth better than anyone, and had used that expertise to bring projects to every corner of the state.

While political science majors like myself appreciated Casey’s gambit, voters didn’t seem to grasp the desired point. As McCormick campaign adviser Brad Todd noted, “[Sen. Casey] was a mile wide and an inch deep. A lot of people were familiar with his name, but nobody was familiar with anything he had done or was working on doing.”
Without an easy-to-remember brand to fall back on, Casey was particularly vulnerable to Republican attacks. On top of that, Casey does not possess the kind of charisma that seems so vital in the current TikTok Era. The Democratic incumbent was widely regarded as a kind and effective public official, but couldn’t electrify an audience. 
Dave McCormick
Dave McCormick entered the 2024 campaign cycle at a particularly low point. After all, he’d managed to lose a 2022 Senate primary to Dr. Mehmet Oz by a painfully small 950-vote margin (0.07%). So if Oz was a failure in losing to Fetterman after the 2022 midterms, McCormick was the guy who somehow couldn’t manage to defeat him. 
Back then, the Oz forces were easily able to mock McCormick as a pretender who adopted the persona (and even the vest) of Virginia GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin. In early 2022, he was the often imitated patron saint of private equity Republicans. Furthermore, like Bob Casey, McCormick is far from a firebrand, notably having trouble generating enthusiasm from the MAGA crowd well into the 2024 campaign.

Oz had earned the endorsement of then-former President Donald Trump. Even after he was labeled by Bloomberg Businessweek as “the hedge fund CEO who went full MAGA” (complete with unflattering cover photo), Trump still felt McCormick was insufficiently loyal. Some mildly anti-Trump comments McCormick made after the Jan. 6 insurrection were brought to the former president’s attention and upset him. Trump made this displeasure known during a rally for Oz, calling McCormick a “liberal Wall Street Republican”.
Invisible Primary
For McCormick, the number one lesson he took from that 2022 campaign was to make up with Trump, and hug him as closely as possible throughout the 2024 cycle. First off, he needed Trump’s support to ensure he didn’t face a primary challenger this time around. The effort proved successful, and Trump officially endorsed McCormick in April of 2024.
On top of that, McCormick always had the crucial backing of then-GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell made it clear way back in the spring of 2023 that Pennsylvania would be one of the Republicans’ top four targets alongside contests in red states like Montana, Ohio and West Virginia. McCormick came from the hedge fund world and accordingly had a long list of wealthy supporters. By the end of the campaign, $110 million had been spent on negative advertising against Casey by outside groups, almost $34 million more than on attacks against McCormick.
The Republican used his early ads to try to erase the impression he left on voters in 2022, as well as to fill in the blanks on Casey. So out went McCormick’s Youngkin-style vest, and in came an emphasis on McCormick’s military service and high school wrestling background; portraying him as a tough, strong leader, while Casey was painted as too weak and subservient to Biden. “My opponent is a nice guy, he’s just not a leader,” McCormick asserted in his announcement speech.
Meanwhile, the Casey team stuck to a consistent three-pronged attack against McCormick: abortion, China and Connecticut. The Democrats frequently hit McCormick for an answer he gave during a 2022 primary debate, in which he said he only supported exceptions for the life of the mother, rejecting those for rape or incest. Casey also targeted McCormick’s investments in Chinese companies, tarring him as a man getting rich off outsourcing and foreign fentanyl. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Finally, the incumbent continually poked fun at McCormick’s Connecticut mansion, aiming to repeat John Fetterman’s success mocking Dr. Oz’s New Jersey residence. This effort probably peaked early in spring 2024, with a particularly damning Philadelphia Inquirer story on McCormick jetting back to Connecticut after kick-starting a Pennsylvania bus tour.  
But one of the top Casey campaign regrets may be the senator’s insistence on standing by the unpopular incumbent President Joe Biden. Since the two Scranton pols go back decades, Casey truly felt like he owed Biden his loyalty. After all, when Casey hit his low point in political life after losing a 2002 gubernatorial primary to Ed Rendell, the one Democrat to call him and offer encouragement was then-U.S.Sen. Joe Biden.
Even as Biden’s numbers fell and failed to bounce back, Casey still enthusiastically stuck by his friend. Conversely, Biden was ever eager to invoke ‘his friend Bobby Casey’ on numerous occasions, including during the 2024 State of the Union, when he called for Congress to pass one of Casey’s bills. The senator had made food companies slyly reducing their portions a pet campaign issue for himself; it was the kind of populist argument that could’ve broken through over the course of the year, but now it was tainted by association with what was becoming a toxic top of the ticket.
The dynamic only got worse after Biden’s disastrous debate performance in June. Casey was one of the few Democratic officials up for re-election who stood by Biden, even campaigning with him in the weeks afterward. Tammy Baldwin and Elissa Slotkin, the Democratic U.S. Senate nominees in the blue wall states of Wisconsin and Michigan, avoided being seen with Biden during this time.
As late as October, Biden was still making surrogate campaign appearances in the commonwealth. Long after it was clear he wasn’t getting any post-withdrawal bump, Biden held a fundraiser for Casey outside Philadelphia. That same day, meanwhile, Senator Baldwin steered clear of Biden during his trip to Milwaukee.  
The Fall Campaign
Unlike the 2022 Senate match-up between Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz, there weren’t many twists and turns in the final weeks of this race. The candidate debates were largely uneventful.  
Throughout 2023 and into the summer of 2024, the Democratic incumbent kept a more or less consistent lead over his Republican challenger. In the aftermath of the switch from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris, Casey got a noticeable bump as Harris rode a wave of popular momentum. Depending on the polling average used, Casey’s advantage was in the high single digits or and may have reached the double digit threshold. 
But as the calendar flipped to September, Casey began to slip a bit as McCormick rose. As the fall progressed, Casey’s numbers would stay more or less static while McCormick’s continually grew. Yet on Election Day, Casey still led in all the polling averages by about two points. To illustrate the degree to which McCormick’s performance caught observers off-guard, two separate prediction models – those by the Split Ticket crew and DDHQ’s Zach Donnini – correctly predicted 33 of 34 U.S. Senate races, the sole exception for both was the Pennsylvania contest.
In those final weeks, the Casey campaign asserted in their television advertising that they were the more Trump-like candidate on tariffs, gaining some national media coverage. On the other hand, their efforts to spotlight a report on Dave McCormick’s intimidation of women who experienced sexual harassment failed to get the desired traction. Finally, the team’s closing message focused on Casey’s most popular accomplishments in office, like capping the cost of insulin.

McCormick shifted from tying Casey to Biden to tying Casey to Harris. The campaign was particularly proud that they produced one of the first videos connecting a Democratic senate candidate to various positions Harris took during her first presidential campaign in 2019. They closed by doubling down on Trump’s message of crime and the border, and a final spot focused on McCormick’s West Point history worked to seal the deal. 
As for their respective campaign surrogates, Casey eschewed appearing with Harris and instead chose to stick by his Senate colleague John Fetterman as well as popular Gov. Josh Shapiro. McCormick, conversely, rarely missed an opportunity to associate with the top of his ticket, although he did have some other prominent surrogates. The most notable was an October town hall with Elon Musk in Allegheny County.

While Casey tended to outperform Harris throughout the commonwealth, there were some pivotal outliers, particularly Philadelphia. It turns out that Harris outran Casey in places like north and west Philly, which are the areas with the highest Black populations in the city. So while Harris’ county-wide margin over Trump was 424,260, Casey’s own advantage over McCormick was only 412,469 votes. 
Another area where Casey struggled was in the white-collar areas of the Philadelphia suburbs – Central Bucks, Eastern Chester, Northern Delaware and Southern Montgomery – where Democrats gained significant ground in 2018, 2020 and 2022. Among these four counties, Harris cobbled together a 243,386 vote margin, while Casey’s advantage stood at just 234,114. As a result, Casey trailed Harris’ pace by 21,063 votes in Philly and its suburbs, larger than McCormick’s 15,115 vote statewide margin of victory.
To put these stats into historical perspective, Casey’s margins were far behind his 2018 margins in the city (414,814) and suburbs, (289,614) despite far fewer people coming out to vote. Of course, 2018 was a Democratic wave in the midterm election cycle, yet Casey’s showing even trailed his pace from the last time he shared a presidential ticket. 
Let’s look at the 2012 election, when Casey (159,111) managed to outperform Barack Obama (123,327) in the collar counties, while they were both on the ballot. Obama’s Philly advantage (a still-record 492,339) over Casey (480,425) was nearly identical to Harris’ over Casey last year. The difference is that the senator simply wasn’t able to keep pace in the suburbs, where McCormick made some crucial inroads.

Here we find two of the three counties Bob Casey won in 2018 but lost in 2024: Berks and Northampton. Additionally, Northampton was the one and only county which John Fetterman won in 2022 that Dave McCormick carried two years later. Among the factors there, as well as in Lehigh County (where Casey also lost ground), was the Democratic Party’s continued deterioration with Hispanic voters.
Allentown, Bethlehem, Easton and Reading are all home to appreciable Hispanic populations; particularly Puerto Ricans, who Democrats poured so much hope into during the final days of the campaign. The results, however, proved to be a devastating disappointment for the party.
To take just one example, consider Allentown’s 8th Ward, 6th District, where 78% of the voting age population is Hispanic. In 2012, Casey received 400 out of 467 votes, or 85.6%, from that precinct. Twelve years later, Casey got just 292 out of 465 votes cast, or 62.8%. At the same time, McCormick secured 152 votes (32.6%), while 2012 GOP nominee Tom Smith received just 58 votes (12.4%)

Cumberland has been one of the few blue-trending counties in the commonwealth over the  past few years, with Democrats benefitting from the growing Harrisburg suburbs crossing over the Susquehanna River. After Tom Wolf and Josh Shapiro both won the county during their respective gubernatorial races in 2018 and 2022, the Casey team was surely hoping that they could be the first senate Democrat to win Cumberland since Joseph Guffey did it back in 1934.  
Instead, Casey managed to perform worse than Fetterman in Cumberland, and the story was the same in neighboring Dauphin County too. This must’ve been particularly galling, as these white-collar voters were a far more natural constituency for Casey than they were for someone with a working-class image like Fetterman. Conversely, with some help from Trump at the top of the ballot, McCormick racked up his best (56,319) and third-best vote margins (43,525) in nearby York and Lancaster counties.

Historically, Bob Casey was one of the strongest performing politicians among ancestral Democrats in the Appalachian region of the state. He dominated in this corner of the commonwealth against native son Republican Rick Santorum in 2006, hung on to win Beaver and Fayette counties in 2012, and even prevailed in Beaver again in 2018. The ongoing slide culminated in 2024 when Casey was shut-out of Allegheny’s surrounding counties, with McCormick easily carrying Beaver County by nearly 16 points.
It’s important to consider the possible electoral ramifications of the assassination attempt against Donald Trump in Butler County. Sen. Fetterman, for example, cited the outpouring of support he saw for Trump in western Pennsylvania as a contributing factor in his victory. McCormick was at Trump’s rally that day and frequently spoke to the media afterward about his experience.  
But in the presidential race, Harris actually narrowly improved on Biden’s performance in Butler, as the county has gradually gotten bluer over the past few years.
While McCormick made several trips to this region with Trump, Casey brought his own biggest surrogate, former President Barack Obama, to Pittsburgh in October. Old friends going back to their Senate days (Casey supported Obama over Hillary Clinton in the 2008 primaries), Obama gave an extended endorsement of Casey as the senator sat by his side. Given Casey’s aforementioned struggles in Philadelphia and its surrounding suburbs, however, it’s worth considering whether the campaign made a mistake by holding this event in Pittsburgh instead of Philly.

In November, Bob Casey managed to win three counties that every national and statewide Democratic nominee he shared a ticket with lost: Bucks, Erie and Monroe. His victory in the commonwealth’s only lakeside county particularly stings, as Erie has recently acted as a bellwether for the state. Yet whereas Fetterman won here by almost 9,900 votes two years ago, Casey’s advantage fell to only 2,265. It was the same case in Bucks and Monroe, as Casey’s small victories in traditionally pivotal counties couldn’t make up for disappointing results in other once-solidly Democratic areas.

Now, consider Lackawanna County, where Scranton-born Bob Casey put up one of his best overperformances upon Kamala Harris, given that he won by 8.38% (or 9,709 votes) while Harris prevailed by only 2.78% (or 3,249 votes). But, Casey’s numbers weren’t nearly good enough. His 53.2% share was far less than the 61.1% he secured in this county back in 2018. It even pales in comparison to the 56.8% Fetterman got in 2022, when he carried Lackawanna by 13,955 votes over Oz.
Casey fell even further behind in neighboring Luzerne, a more populous county filled with tons of Trump’s white working-class voters. Once again, Casey ran ahead of Harris (a 22,553 vote deficit compared to a 29,940 vote deficit), yet fell way behind the pace set by Fetterman in 2022 (a 10,474 vote deficit). All the while, McCormick continued to ride Trump’s coattails just closely enough in nearly every corner of the commonwealth to prevail statewide.
Conclusion: Party Unity Made the Difference
In a close election where both Democratic and Republican nominees failed to reach 49%, third-party candidates made an impact. Libertarian Party nominee John Thomas finished with 89,653 votes (1.29%), Green Party nominee Leila Hazou received 66,388 (0.95%), and Constitution Party nominee Marty Selker got 23,621 (0.34%).
By the final days of the campaign, the Casey forces sought to raise the profile of Thomas and Selker, in the hopes that they’d pull away enough votes from McCormick for the incumbent to prevail. But, the 1.63% that Thomas and Selker combined took in wasn’t enough, as McCormick’s “Hug Trump” strategy paid off. 
What stands out is the Green Party nominee’s total of 66,388 votes was far larger than McCormick’s winning margin of 15,115. Hazou also nearly doubled the votes given to presidential Green Party nominee Jill Stein (34,538), meaning that there were thousands of Pennsylvanians who cast a ballot for Kamala Harris, yet still spent their senate vote on a protest. 
Remember, Casey was a slight consensus favorite going into election night. Meanwhile, throughout the 2024 campaign, there were many young, non-white voters upset over America’s role regarding the War in Gaza, and they were especially angry at President Biden and Senator Fetterman. This predicament created a real Catch-22 for Casey, who had to weigh the left-wing anger at Israel against the hundred of thousands of Jewish voters who live in Philadelphia and its surrounding suburbs. 
Casey decided to stick by Israel, although that didn’t stop his opponent from connecting him to progressive Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, who McCormick repeatedly called an anti-Semite over her criticism of Israeli policy. As a result, it’s entirely plausible that protest voters seeking to send a symbolic message unintentionally cost Casey his seat and elevated a much more hawkish candidate to the Senate.
Such a dynamic is emblematic of the entire 2024 election, as unity played a pivotal factor in these results. Dave McCormick and the rest of the Republican ticket collectively bet on Donald Trump’s cult of personality and an anti-incumbent mood among the electorate. Conversely, Bob Casey could not separate himself from an unpopular Democratic president and the chaos at the top of his own ticket. Such headwinds proved just powerful enough to take down a legend of Pennsylvania politics. 
Now Casey must weigh a comeback bid in 2030, when he’ll be 70 years old. While that’s not so old for a senator, there’s already a deep bench of Democrats eager for their own opportunity. McCormick, on the other hand, will find his Senate race at the top of the ticket in 2030. With Trump barred constitutionally from running for a third-term, he’ll be left to sink or swim on his own merits,

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Jane Dean recalled the urgent phone call on Feb. 13, 2024, from Amazon about a possible fraud by someone trying to purchase a MacBook.
The retired 72-year-old nurse doesn’t have an Amazon account, but the caller was convincing. He knew the name of Dean’s local bank and the correct phone number for its fraud department.
The scammer convinced Dean to send $25,600 to a specific address and said her money would be protected as part of a federal investigation into a man from Mexico who was reportedly trying to open an account in her name to launder up to $300,000. If she didn’t help “nab the bad guys,” Dean was told ominously, she could be convicted for money laundering.
The scam unraveled when Dean went to the bank to withdraw more money, but was told by the teller that the bank did not have enough cash on hand for what she wanted. When she spoke to a branch manager, he told her, “‘I think you’re being scammed.’
“If it hadn’t been for him, I would be still under the ether,” Dean said of her experience.

Dean shared her story Monday as part of AARP Maryland’s annual week of free workshops, webinars and other activities to combat financial exploitation against older Americans. The initiative coincides with World Elder Abuse Awareness Day on Saturday.
Dean was joined by representatives of AARP, federal and state agencies and other advocates urgiong the public to help senior citizens from being exploited.
According to AARP, older Americans reported nearly $4.9 billion in losses due to fraud in 2024, a 43% increase from the previous year. The average loss for those 60 and older was $83,000.
Federal Trade Commission data showed that there were 44,195 fraud reports from Maryland residents in 2024 for a total loss of nearly $202 million, up from the 44,168 fraud reports in the state in 2023 that cost $168 million.
Marylanders age 60 and older were increasingly victimized by scammers, according to the FTC data. While the number of victims fluctuated, the cost of those crimes rose steadily, from $9.8 million in 2020 to $46.9 million in 2024. And 2025 is on pace to eclipse that number, recording $16.4 million in losses in the first quarter of the year alone.
Karen Morgan, who serves on the AARP Maryland Executive Council, said the state ranked fifth in the nation last year in terms of all fraud and eighth in identity fraud.
Morgan said there’s one main reason why scammers target Maryland.
“We have a large percentage of people that get pensions. We have a large percentage of federal, state and local government employees concentrated in this area and scammers target those funds,” she said after Monday’s news conference. “Scammers use your emotions as a weapon. That’s why they can be successful.”
Tony Salazar, commissioner of financial regulations within the state Department of Labor, said Senate Bill 305 should help to decrease the number of scammers, especially when it comes to advanced technology.

The legislation, sponsored by Sens. Pam Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) and Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), will require the operator of a virtual currency kiosk to register with the state. Although the law goes into effect July 1, registrations of virtual kiosks will not start until Jan. 1, 2026.
Salazar’s office will oversee and enforce all regulations that include consumer protections, reimbursements and disclosure requirements.
“Despite our collective efforts, the scams [are] not slowing down. They’re actually increasing,” he said. “There’s a great and urgent need for continued vigilance education to protect Maryland seniors.”
Salazar and others offered advice on how Marylanders can avoid scammers, such as not making financial decisions under pressure and regularly checking their financial accounts and credit reports.
Morgan said individuals can have a “frâuad buddy,” or a person they trust with whom they can talk if a financial situation doesn’t sound right.aDean yelled one word of advice for Marylanders: “Stop!”
“Do not respond or react to any heightened emotional state that you are in because of an email, a text or phone call,” she said. “You should not carry that burden alone. You should talk to somebody, trust someone. You can’t go through this by yourself.”
For more information or to report a possible scam, speakers Monday pointed to a number of resources that include the Commissioner of Financial Regulation at 410-230-6100; visit AARP’s Fraud Watch Network, or call the fraud hotline at 877-908-3360.

(Getty image)In March 2025, more than $700,000 worth of benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) were stolen from Rhode Island beneficiaries using a scam called skimming. 
Skimming happens when criminals place a device on card readers in stores used by shoppers to swipe their (Electronic Benefits Package) EBT cards. This skimming device allows criminals to capture EBT data, duplicate EBT cards, and steal the benefits in the SNAP beneficiary’s account. Debit and pre-paid cards may also be skimmed if they do not have tap or chip technology, but these cards are protected by the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) and Regulation E.
This federal law protects consumers against losses from this type of scam. Unfortunately, the EFTA expressly excludes EBT cardholders from its protection. While the federal government used to permit states to use federal funds to replace stolen SNAP benefits, it terminated this practice in December 2024 — leaving skimming victims in Rhode Island with no recourse when their benefits are stolen.
Approximately 1,800 customers in Providence, Cranston, and Pawtucket were affected — the majority of these victims were children. East Bay Community Action Program and Comprehensive Community Action Inc.  are among the organizations in Rhode Island that, along with the fraud victims themselves, are bearing the brunt of this.
Since the incident in March, more than $50,000 in benefits have been stolen, and low-income Rhode Islanders who rely on SNAP and cash assistance to meet their basic needs continue to be vulnerable to theft via skimming. 
The state has the discretion to use some of the $84 million in unspent federal funds from the TANF block grant to reimburse victims of theft, so long as there is a child in the SNAP beneficiary’s home. However, the state has chosen not to use any of those funds, nor any state funds, to make skimming victims whole. 
Community Action Agency partners who administer the RI Works program have seen firsthand how this issue has caused hardship for clients, as well as organizations. Children, families and seniors may have gone hungry, local stores lost revenue, and Rhode Island Community Food Bank member agencies and other local food pantries were left to try to mitigate the damage.










Since the incident in March, more than $50,000 in benefits have been stolen, and low-income Rhode Islanders who rely on SNAP and cash assistance to meet their basic needs continue to be vulnerable to theft via skimming. 


To address and prevent skimming, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) recommends states convert EBT cards to cards with chip and tap technology, like most debit and credit cards we use today; this is the most secure way to protect benefits from theft. In January 2025, California became the first state to issue EBT chip cards; Oklahoma, Maryland, Alabama, and New Jersey are currently in the process of converting them to chip cards. 
The total cost of converting EBT cards to chip and tap technology is $3.6 million; the federal government will pay half of the total cost, contributing $1.8 million. The state would need to contribute an estimated $1.6 million in general revenue. Despite the available matching funds and the magnitude of benefits stolen in March, no legislation or budget amendments have been introduced this legislative session to allocate the funds necessary to facilitate this conversion, reimburse victims of theft, or protect Rhode Islanders and their benefits from the threat of skimming. 
Skimming fraud not only harms the people who rely on SNAP to meet their basic food needs, it also hurts our local markets and the state’s economy. Doing all we can to protect low-income Rhode Islanders from this type of criminal activity is essential. While the Rhode Island Department of Human Services (DHS) has been proactive in advising SNAP participants about steps they can take to protect their EBT cards, the current strategies are not sufficient to protect them from harm. Furthermore, many beneficiaries may not have the capacity to frequently change their PINs or freeze benefits on a regular basis, as DHS suggests.
The Rhode Island General Assembly should move swiftly to protect Rhode Islanders and their benefits from theft by allocating at least $1.6 million in general revenue for EBT card conversion in fiscal year 2026 budget. The state should also make every effort to reimburse victims of skimming, including using some of the state’s more than $84 million in unspent TANF funds to reimburse TANF eligible victims. 
Legislators are making tough decisions as they work to finalize the FY 2026 budget. But this investment seems like a small price to pay given the near certainty that Rhode Islanders will continue to be victimized without recourse if the state does nothing. 
We should not expect our lowest-income children, families, and seniors to almost exclusively shoulder the burdens of Rhode Island’s fiscal challenges. They deserve better, and the state can, and should, do better.

Approximately 1,000 people attended the event. (Photo: Rob Schofield/NC Newsline)Ashe County in far northwest North Carolina would seem like an unusual place for a large and energetic protest march – especially one that targeted the actions of a recently elected Republican president. Like the counties around it, Ashe has long been a GOP stronghold. In last November’s election, the 16,000 or so county residents who voted favored Donald Trump over Kamala Harris by 44 points.
And so it was that, on a sunny and warm morning this past Saturday, an out-of-town visitor was surprised to encounter an energetic crowd of more than 1,000 people gathered in picturesque downtown West Jefferson (population 1,346) to participate in a “No Kings Day” rally sponsored by an array of progressive advocacy and organizing groups.
The event, of course, was one of more than 1,500 that took place across the nation in response to Trump’s decision to hold a large, Putinesque military parade in Washington to commemorate his own birthday and the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.
News reports indicate that, with a few notable and frightening exceptions in which pro-Trump counter-protesters attacked “No Kings” demonstrators, the overwhelming majority of the demonstrations were peaceful, and even celebratory.
That was certainly the case in West Jefferson, where organizers made a point of kicking off the event by publicly thanking local law enforcement officers for helping to arrange for permits and offering protection to marchers as they took part in a 30-minute-or-so walk though some of the town’s main streets. Demonstrators were also urged not to engage with a handful of Trump supporters – a few of whom shouted epithets from nearby sidewalks.
Like many other anti-Trump demonstrations, the West Jeff event featured a dizzying array of causes and scores of creative, often humorous, signs. Attendees expressed their anger at the national immigration crackdown and the arrest tactics being employed by ICE officers. Other marchers blasted cuts to education, healthcare, clean energy and voiced their support for abortion rights, racial justice, and LGBTQ+ equality. Many, not surprisingly, directed their anger directly at Trump and his autocratic pretensions.
But if there was an overarching, unifying, and most heartening theme to the event – one that helped draw together a broad and somewhat unusual group of political bedfellows – it was the simple idea that our nation is and should remain a constitutional democracy.
This fact was made especially evident in the presence of numerous military veterans who drew cheers and handshakes from progressive demonstrators – many of whom likely held differing views on some matters of American foreign policy, but who also shared a commitment to the U.S. remaining a nation of laws and due process.
This included veterans like James Jones, a retired veteran of the Gulf War and current National Park Service employee who addressed marchers proudly about his service in repelling Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait under Saddam Hussein. While it seemed likely that many attendees – which featured a goodly number of seniors – may have held different views and memories about the wisdom and ultimate impacts of the Gulf War and the U.S. involvement in Iraq that followed, Jones drew loud applause when he described his service as part of a long and rich American tradition of resisting dictators and fascism.
Jones also made a point of sharing and describing a tragic situation that occurred on a cold, dark and rainy night during the war in which several of his comrades were lost to mistaken friendly fire while attempting to erect a temporary structure that was to house Iraqi prisoners of war. Their heroic sacrifice, he said, was emblematic of the kind of commitment to justice and the rule of law, rather than loyalty to any single leader, that are and should always be – even in times of war – the true hallmarks of the American military.
Jones’ remarks were echoed by U.S. Airforce veteran John Parsons, who attended the event with his wife Val while still looking trim and fit in the old uniform that he had worn while serving as a B-52 crew member decades before. When I asked him why he was there, he cited the need to stand up for “due process and the Constitution” to which he had sworn an oath while serving.
And it was in the presence and comments of these two men and several other vets in the crowd that one could sense one of the most encouraging aspects of the No Kings movement, and indeed, the first few months of the second Trump presidency.
Donald Trump clearly has the support of many Americans – a maddening percentage of whom appear ready to acquiesce, sheeplike, to his embrace of a brand of dictatorial one-man rule. But as a thousand or so ordinary Americans in a small town in western North Carolina and millions more across the country demonstrated Saturday, he also has a very obvious Achilles’ heel in this quest – the opposition of a diverse and even larger group of his fellow citizens.
These Americans may disagree on a lot of policies and priorities, but they’re united on one basic principle: that the United States is a nation of laws that no individual is above. And if Saturday is any indication, this is not a principle that Trump, try as he might, will ultimately succeed in destroying.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Kings-West-Jefferson-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-17 06:04:08.810845

Earl Jones said Monday that Republicans’ plan for congressional districts in Greensboro looked like a glass smashed against the pavement.
Jones testified on the first day of the federal trial of North Carolina’s congressional and state legislative districts. He is a plaintiff in one of the two lawsuits claiming the election districts Republicans enacted for the 2024 elections are racial gerrymanders that dilute Black voting power in violation of the U.S. Constitution and federal law. 
Republicans stressed during debates on their way to approving the new district plans that no racial data was used to create them. In court filings, lawyers for Republican legislators suggested that the lawsuits dress partisan gerrymandering claims “in racial garb.”
Both the U.S. Supreme Court and the North Carolina Supreme Court are shut off to people and advocacy groups that want to sue claiming partisan gerrymanders. 
The two lawsuits challenging the redistricting plans were combined for the trial in front of a three-judge panel in Winston-Salem.
Lawyers representing Republican legislators and the lawyers representing voters and voting rights groups did not make opening arguments, so the trial launched directly into testimony by plaintiffs’ witnesses. 
All together, six of 14 congressional districts, nine of 120 state House districts, and five of 50 state Senate districts are being challenged.
Much of the testimony focused on the Piedmont Triad, which includes Greensboro, Winston-Salem and High Point. 
Republicans cut heavily Democratic Guilford County into three pieces. The individual pieces were melded into districts with Republican counties that are more rural.
“I’m concerned about the carving up and cutting up of my community, and I’m trying to get that changed somehow,” said Jones, who is Black. 
Under a court-ordered congressional district plan used for the 2022 election, Guilford County was not divided and incumbent Democrat Kathy Manning was elected to represent it as part of the 6th Congressional District.
The redrawn district is heavily Republican. Manning did not run for reelection, and no Democrat opted to run there. 
Overall, seven Democrats and seven Republicans were elected to Congress from North Carolina in 2022 using the court-ordered map. The 2024 map yielded 10 Republican and four Democratic winners. 
Jones, a Democrat, said he was drawn into the 5th Congressional District, which extends west to include Ashe and Watauga counties in the mountains. Republican U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents the district. 
While Manning supported the Black community, Foxx has been absent and doesn’t have an office in Greensboro, Jones said. 
“It hurt my community,” Jones said of the district lines. “We don’t have anyone who will address issues important to us.”
Jonathan Rodden, a redistricting specialist at Stanford University, testified that the 2024 districts “are not especially compact,” and “the Black community in the Triad is divided among several districts by splitting municipalities.”
Rodden said he couldn’t see good evidence that sorting voters in and out of districts is entirely driven by party. 
Questioned by a lawyer for Republican legislators, Rodden said he did not know what election results legislators used to make the maps. 
“I can’t make conclusions about that,” Rodden said. “I wasn’t there in the room.”
The judges also heard testimony about congressional districts 12 and 14 in Mecklenburg and counties west, about state Senate districts 1 and 2, which divide eastern North Carolina’s Black Belt counties, and about state Senate District 8, which is dominated by Columbus and Brunswick counties, with a sliver of Black neighborhoods in Wilmington added for 2024. 
“Inner city Wilmington is purposely cut and sent over to rural Brunswick County,” state NAACP President Deborah Maxwell testified. 
Three federal judges appointed by Republican presidents are hearing the case. The trial is expected to end in early July.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG-3697-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-17 07:03:08.490998

Jackson speaks with reporters in Largo on Dec. 4, shortly after taking over the county's top job on a temporary basis. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Acting Prince Geroge’s County Executive Tara H. Jackson appeared to be out of a job with the election this month of State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy to fill out the remaining 18 months of the county executive term that Jackson has been caretaker of since December.
But it turns out, to paraphrase the old expression about doors, when one job closes, another job opens.
The Maryland Judiciary announced in an email Monday night that the county’s circuit court judges have selected Jackson to serve as acting state’s attorney, filling out the remaining 18 months in Braveboy’s term as the county’s prosecutor.
Jackson had been serving as the county’s chief administrative officer when then-County Executive Angela Alsobrooks was elected  last fall to an open seat in the U.S. Senate. The county charter says that in the event of a vacancy in the executive’s office, the job is to be filled on an interim basis by the chief administrative officer, the No. 2 official in the county.
Jackson immediately said she was not interested in running for the position permanently. But a return to her old job appeared to have been be foreclosed by Braveboy’s announcement, less than a day after the election, that Maxene Bardwell, an administrator in Montgomery County, would serve as chief administrative officer in a Braveboy administration.
County Councilmember Wanika Fisher had indicated an interest in pursuing the interim appointment as state’s attorney, but released a statement Monday morning saying she would not seek the temporary job. Fisher said she will run for state’s attorney in 2026.
Fisher cited the cost of a special election to fill her District 2 council seat if she moved into the state’s attorney job now. She estimated such a race could cost $500,000 to $800,000.
“In recent years, Prince George’s has experienced a significant number of special elections. These elections come at a considerable cost to taxpayers and often occur with limited voter engagement,” she said in her statement “That’s not something I believe serves the public well at this time.”
Prince George’s Superintendent House is out; Braveboy wastes no time naming interim

Special elections are over — it’s official
The Prince George’s County Board of Elections officially declared Braveboy the winner of the county executive race and Shayla Adams-Stafford the winner of the special election for the District 5 County Council seat that was held on the same day.
Certification of the two June 4 votes brings to a close almost a year of special elections for county government seats that began last year with the conviction of Jamel “Mel” Franklin, a former at-large council member, for a theft scheme relating to his campaign accounts.
Official results released Friday showed Braveboy and Adams-Stafford, both Democrats, with overwhelming margins of victory in the heavily Democratic county.
Braveboy received 82,062 votes, or 91.2% of the vote to 7,185 votes, or 8% for Republican challenger Jonathan White. Adams-Stafford, a former county school board member, got 8,091 votes to 559 votes for Republican Fred Price Jr., a margin of 92.8% to 6.4% in the race for race to fill the District 5 seat left vacant by the election of Jolene Ivey to fill Franklin’s at-large seat.
Braveboy, who’s scheduled to be sworn in at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Samuel Riggs IV Alumni Center at the University of Maryland, College Park, will not have much time to savor the win. In addition to naming Bardwell, she named Shawn Joseph as interim superintendent for the county’s public schools on Friday, to replace current Superintendent Millard House II. House, who was pushed out after a vote of no confidence by the county teachers union, will leave on Wednesday.
And Braveboy may also need to seek a new county police chief, after news broke that Malik Aziz is a finalist for the same position in Phoenix. She said Friday, when introducing Joseph, that she would like to look within the department for a repacement if Aziz leaves.
“We have one of the best, most professional police departments in the country,” she said. “I want every man, woman who serves on our department to know that they are being seen, their experience is valued, and they have an opportunity to rise to the top ranks of their department.”
Director named for new Tenant and Landlord Affairs office
Alyce Thompson, a former attorney with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, will lead a new state office to help renters navigate their rights as tenants in disputes with landlords, Maryland housing officials announced Monday.
The Department of Housing and Community Development said Thompson will serve as the first director of the Office of Tenant and Landlord Affairs, created from 2024 legislation as part of Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) package of housing bills that year.

	“Making sure tenants and landlords alike are well informed about their rights and responsibilities … will go a long way towards helping families maintain stable housing, in turn strengthening communities across Maryland,” Thompson said in a written statement.
“I’m excited to be here at the inception of the Office of Tenant and Landlord Affairs to work with partners across the state to achieve this vision for Maryland’s future,” her statememt said.
A native of Decatur, Georgia, Thompson received her law degree and a master’s degree in urban planning from the University of Michigan, according to a Monday statement from the state housing agency.
Thompson served 12 years with HUD where she “she supervised a team of attorneys who advised housing and community development grant programs that funded states, local governments, tribes, and nonprofit organizations,” the announcement said. There, she also played a part in launching programs such as a housing program for Native American veterans experiencing homelessness.
‘Bill of Rights’ come to tenants
Maryland housing officials also announced the first Tenant’s Bill of Rights Monday, which was also part of the 2024 housing legislation package.
Starting July 1, landlords will be required to provide renters a list of their rights as tenants when they agree to residential leases, as part of the Renters Rights and Stabilization Act of 2024.
That law prompts the Office of Tenant and Landlord Affairs to create and publish a Tenants’ Bill of Rights that summarizes existing rights and remedies available to renters under Maryland and federal law. Landlords are to include a copy of the Tenants’ Bill of Rights each residential lease agreement. The Bill of Rights will be updated annually to keep up with changes in state and federal law.
“I’m proud that Maryland is the first state in the nation to create and require such a lease attachment,” Housing Secretary Jake Day said in a written statement. “While we work to tackle Maryland’s housing shortage, we still need to protect vulnerable tenants in a challenging rental market.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Acting-CE-Tara-Jackson-12-4-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-17 06:04:08.810845

Though majority of anti-trans bills rejected, Maine House narrowly advances trans girls sports ban

That means that despite pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration, Maine will continue to uphold the right for trans students to participate in sports that align with their gender identity. The state’s policies have come under scrutiny over the past few months, with the Department of Justice launching a lawsuit against the state for allegedly violating federal anti-discrimination protections in addition to repeated threats from several agencies to cut federal funding.
Last week, House lawmakers advanced LD 233, which sought to ban trans girls from playing on girls’ teams. It was the only bill out of eight anti-trans measures that a majority of lawmakers in the lower chamber supported, with four Democrats joining with Republicans to advance the bill. During the floor debate, many argued that the bill was not intended to punish trans students, but to bring fairness to athletics and preserve girls’ spaces. 
However, on Monday, the Senate voted 21-13 to reject that bill as well as other measures not supported by the House, including bills aiming to ban trans students from bathrooms, locker rooms (LD 868) and trans people from single-sex shelters (LD 1337). 
Later in the evening, both the House and Senate voted to insist on their respective positions, effectively killing the measure, since the chambers could not agree.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)A prescription opioid manufacturer and the family running it have preliminarily agreed to pay out billions to states to settle litigation involving their alleged contribution to the opioid crisis — with Maryland in line to get $90 million of that amount.
The tentative agreement was announced Monday by attorneys general representing 55 states and territories, imcluding Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown. He said the attorneys general had signed on to a preliminary agreement with Purdue Pharma, which could bring an end to not only multiyear, multistate litigation on the issue, but also an end to the Sackler family’s ownership of the company.
“The Opioid Crisis is responsible for thousands of deaths across Maryland, forever changing the lives of countless families who have lost a loved one to addiction,” Brown said in a written statement Monday. “The money from this settlement could be a lifeline for those struggling with addiction and could provide Maryland communities with millions to help Marylanders recover from this deadly disease.”
The company called the preliminary agreement a “critical milestone” to help ease the opioid crisis and compensate victims, according to a written statement Monday.
“Today’s announcement of unanimous support among the states and territories is a critical milestone towards confirming a Plan of Reorganization that will provide billions of dollars to compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives,” according to the statement.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We appreciate the extraordinarily hard work of the state attorneys general and our other creditors in getting us to this point, and we look forward to soliciting creditor votes on the Plan after the disclosure statement is approved,” the statement said.
Purdue is known for manufacturing prescription opioid products such as OxyContin. Litigation against the company claims that its aggressive marketing of prescription opioids contributed to increases in addiction and overdose deaths.
The Purdue settlement could reach up to $7.4 billion paid out over 15 years to the states and territories in the preliminary agreement. Maryland’s cut could potentially exceed $90 million depending on the final agreement, though the exact figures have not yet been decided.
The settlement “will end the Sacklers’ control of Purdue and ability to sell opioids in the United States,” according to New York Attorney General Letitia James, one of the attorneys leading the case as it moved through the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
There’s a bankruptcy court hearing on the disclosure statement scheduled for Wednesday.
Maryland has already secured millions in opioid settlements. In February 2024, Brown announced Maryland would be receiving $238 million in opioid settlements from four pharmacies, including Walmart and Walgreens. Those funds go towards the state’s Maryland Opioid Restitution Fund to help combat the opioid crisis.
While the states’ lawsuit proceeded, Baltimore decided to pursue legal action on its own, a gamble that appears to have paid off. The city, which has been particularly hard hit by the opioid crisis, had already received $252.5 million in settlement agreements as of August from a number of different pharmaceutical companies.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_feb10_anthonybrown2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-17 06:04:08.810845

López in a file photo from December in the State House. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Moore administration officials were trying to put DUI charges against Human Services Secretary Rafael López in the past, with López and the governor both saying the secretary has taken “full responsibility” for his actions.
They were responding to reports that López was charged in Washington, D.C., with driving under the influence and operating a vehicle while impaired on the evening of Jan. 18.
Court documents in the case name the driver as Ralph Lopez, but list a home address that is the same as a property Rafael López lists in his Maryland financial disclosure forms as one that he owns. The charges were first reported on Friday by Fox45.
According to a police report in the case, López was driving in the unit block of Louisiana Avenue NW about 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 8 when an officer noticed his car crossing the center line several times. After stopping for a red light at D Street NW, the car sat for 10 seconds after the light turned green, forcing another car to go around before it started moving.
The officer pulled the car over on North Capitol Street, where the driver said he was returning from a friend’s house where he had had two drinks — he later said one — between 3 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. But the police report said the driver’s face was flush, he had “red, watery eyes” and a “strong odor of alcoholic beverage” coming off him.

López was wearing a walking boot for a previous foot injury, so the officer did not administer walking sobriety tests, but did administer other tests including eye-tracking, reciting part of the alphabet, counting backwards and touching his finger to his nose. After those tests, the office administered a breath test and recorded a breath alcohol content of 0.097. The legal limit in the District is 0.08.
López was scheduled to take leave for a medical procedure this spring, but was put on administrative leave from his job after “after immediately reporting a charge for driving under the influence” to the administration, according to a statement released by the department.
“I take full responsibility for my actions,” López said in that statement. “I have taken the appropriate corrective measures and appreciate the support I have received from my family, friends, and colleagues.”
He returned to work on April 15, his office said.
López’s statement was echoed by Gov. Wes Moore (D) when he was asked about it Friday.
“The secretary has taken full accountability and responsibility for his action and I would just refer people to his statement,” Moore said.
López has a status hearing scheduled in his case on Aug. 13 before D.C. Superior Court Judge Tyrona DeWitt.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/DSC_0298-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-17 06:04:08.810845

It’s the culmination of a long and bitter legal battle over the company’s role in fueling the nation’s opioid epidemic.
Attorney General Jason Miyares announced Monday that Virginia is one of 55 states and territories backing the historic agreement, which would resolve all outstanding litigation against Purdue and its once-powerful owners, the Sacklers. The deal is now headed to bankruptcy court for final approval.
“The Sacklers spent years fueling an epidemic that shattered families, wrecked communities, and cost hundreds of thousands of American lives,” Miyares said in a statement. 
“Though no amount of money will ever bring back those we’ve lost or undo the incomprehensible level of harm caused, these settlement funds will be invested in treatment, prevention, and recovery efforts across Virginia, helping our communities heal and saving lives.”
Virginia stands to receive up to $103.8 million over 15 years as part of the agreement, with most of the funds arriving in the first three years. The money will go toward community-based efforts to prevent addiction, expand treatment services and support long-term recovery programs statewide.
The opioid crisis has taken an especially heavy toll in the state. A 2021 Virginia Commonwealth University and Virginia Department of Health analysis found nearly 150,000 Virginians living with opioid use disorder that year, and “at least six Virginians died of an opioid overdose every day on average.”
By 2022, roughly 1,951 Virginians — more than double the number a decade earlier — died from fentanyl alone.  Still, there’s been recent progress: preliminary CDC data indicate over 1,500 overdose deaths in Virginia in 2024, a decline of 44% in fentanyl-related deaths and the nation’s second-largest drop of its kind, as Miyares reiterated in a recent interview with The Mercury. 
The agreement announced Monday comes nearly a year after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down an earlier $6 billion settlement, rejecting legal immunity for the Sackler family. In response, the family increased its financial contribution, helping to pave the way for the larger $7.4 billion proposal that all states and territories have now embraced.
Alongside Virginia, a coalition of states including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and West Virginia helped negotiate the final terms of the agreement — marking it as the largest opioid-related settlement involving individual defendants to date.
Under the proposed plan, the Sackler family will pay $1.5 billion up front, and Purdue Pharma will contribute about $900 million. Additional payments — $500 million in the second and third years and $400 million in the fourth — will follow.
Once finalized, the settlement will dissolve the Sacklers’ ownership of Purdue and prohibit them from making, selling, or marketing opioids in the U.S.
The litigation stems from Purdue’s development and aggressive promotion of OxyContin, a powerful prescription painkiller introduced in the 1990s. 
The company filed for bankruptcy in 2019 after facing thousands of lawsuits accusing it of downplaying the drug’s addictive properties while reaping billions in profit. The lawsuits argued that Purdue and the Sacklers knowingly contributed to one of the deadliest drug epidemics in American history.
“This is a critical milestone,” Purdue Pharma said in a statement Monday. “Today’s announcement of unanimous support among the states and territories is a critical milestone towards confirming a Plan of Reorganization that will provide billions of dollars to compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives.”
The bankruptcy court is expected to hold a hearing on the agreement in the coming days. If approved, the settlement will mark the latest in a series of major opioid-related legal wins for the Virginia Office of the Attorney General, which has now secured more than $1.1 billion in total opioid settlements.

Those numbers are in sharp contrast to Republicans, with 61% supporting the bill and 72% of those who identify as MAGA supporters.But those views fluctuated when the people surveyed were asked specific questions about certain elements of the package and the real-world impacts of the legislation:The overall percentage of those surveyed with an unfavorable view of the bill increased from 64% to 67% when they were told it would lower federal spending on Medicaid by more than $700 billion, an estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Dislike of the legislation rose to 74% when those polled were told policy changes would lead to 10 million people losing their health insurance coverage, another estimate from the CBO analysis.Opposition rose to 79% when people were told the legislation would reduce funding for local hospitals.“The public hasn't had much time to digest what's in the big, beautiful, but almost incomprehensible bill as it races through Congress, and many don’t have a lot of information about it,” KFF President and CEO Drew Altman wrote in a statement. “Our poll shows that views toward the bill and its health-care provisions can shift when presented with more information and arguments about its effects, even among MAGA supporters.”Senators wrestling with what to doThe House voted mostly along party lines to approve its 11-bill package in late May, sending the legislation to the Senate.GOP senators have spent weeks internally debating which parts of the House legislation to keep, which to change and which to remove, while also conducting closed-door meetings with the parliamentarian to determine which parts of the bill comply with the rules for the complex reconciliation process.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., plans to bring his chamber’s version of the package to the floor next week, though that timeline could slip. Before the Senate can approve the rewritten bill, lawmakers will spend hours voting on dozens of amendments during what’s known as a vote-a-rama.Significant bipartisan support for MedicaidThe KFF poll released Tuesday shows that 83% of Americans support Medicaid, slated for an overhaul and spending reductions by GOP lawmakers.That support remains high across political parties, with 93% of Democrats, 83% of independents and 74% of Republicans holding a favorable opinion of the state-federal health program for lower-income people and some with disabilities.Those surveyed appeared supportive of a provision in the House bill that would require some people on Medicaid to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month.The change is supported by about two-thirds of those surveyed, though the numbers shift depending on how the question is asked.For example, when told that most adults on Medicaid already work and that not being able to complete the paperwork associated with the new requirement could cause some to lose coverage, 64% of those polled opposed the new requirement. Planned ParenthoodThere was also broad opposition, 67% overall, to language in the House bill that would block any Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood for routine health care. There is a long-standing prohibition on federal funding from going toward abortion with exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient.Opposition to the Planned Parenthood provision increased to 80% when those polled were told that no federal payments to Planned Parenthood go directly toward abortion and that ending all Medicaid payments to the organization would make it more challenging for lower-income women to access birth control, cancer screenings and STD testing.Republicans are more supportive of that change, with 54% backing the policy and 46% opposing the new block on Medicaid patients going to Planned Parenthood. But 78% of independent women and 51% of Republican women oppose the change.Food assistance programThose surveyed also had concerns about how changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would impact lower-income people’s ability to afford food, with 70% saying they were either very or somewhat concerned.Democrats held the highest level of concern at 92%, followed by independents at 74% and Republicans at 47%.Overall, Republicans hold the highest share of people polled who believe the dozens of GOP policy changes in the “big, beautiful bill” will help them or their family.A total of 32% of Republicans surveyed believe the legislation will benefit them, while 47% said it will not make much of a difference and 21% said it will hurt them or their family.Thirteen percent of independents expect the legislation will help them, while 39% said it likely won’t make a difference and 47% expect it will harm them or their family.Of Democrats polled, just 6% said they expect the GOP mega-bill to help them, while 26% said it wouldn’t matter much and 66% expected it to hurt them or their family.When asked whether the bill would help, not make much of a difference, or hurt certain groups of people, the largest percentage of those polled expect it to help wealthy people.Fifty-one percent of those surveyed said they expect wealthy people will benefit from the bill, 21% believe it will help people with lower incomes and 20% said they think middle-class families will benefit.Seventeen percent think it will help immigrants, 14% expect it to help people who buy their own health insurance, 13% believe it will help people on Medicaid, 13% think it will help people on SNAP and 8% expect it will benefit undocumented immigrants.KFF conducted the poll June 4 - 8, both online and by telephone, among a nationally representative sample of 1,321 U.S. adults.

The candidate said his campaign would also focus on three other issues: improving third grade reading outcomes, addressing Michigan’s mental health crisis and “bringing real accountability to state government.” That includes subjecting the executive branch to the Freedom of Information Act – which other candidates have promised before but to no avail – and increasing the budget of the Office of the Auditor General to hold Lansing accountable.
“Less than 40% of our third graders can read proficiently. We are sleepwalking through an educational crisis that is robbing our children of their futures,” Leonard said. “We are losing a generation of kids because the political class has continued to focus on appeasing special interests over children. It’s time to stop making excuses and start delivering results for parents and students.”
His campaign announcement also noted that Bill Stepien would manage his campaign. Stepien is a former political director with the White House and campaign manager for President Donald Trump.
Also in the race for Michigan governor on the Republican side are Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), former state attorney general Mike Cox, U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson and Traverse City native Evan Space.

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)A landowner in Louisa County is tangled up in disputes over how her land should be developed, reflecting an ongoing debate over the state’s role in solar energy development in rural areas. She wants a solar project to be built on her property, but local authorities want her land to stay agricultural use-only. Two years into the process she’s still waiting for a resolution, as legislation addressing solar ordinances, which could help mitigate the situation, failed again in the General Assembly this year. 
“Really it is about land rights and landowner rights within the confines of still protecting the rural character of Louisa,” Amanda Lloyd said.
Lloyd inherited her husband’s family land when he died ten years ago. His grandparents had run a dairy farm on it until the 1980s and after that, the land was zoned partial residential and forestland. After building a home for her children, she researched how her property could be used to turn a profit.

“I worked with farm services. I had different people come out and look at it. I took classes at Virginia State University to try to figure out an agricultural use, and was just doing that over the years to see if there was a way I could use the land and bring it back and economically, I just never found a solution,” Lloyd said.
In 2020, the solar energy company Clenera approached her with a proposed solar project that would sprinkle panels through the timberland. It was a project that interested her. With trees that could act as natural buffers, which the county requires for these projects, and railroad tracks that separate her property from neighboring plots, Lloyd felt it would be a reasonable way to bring money in for her children’s futures and make use of the land.
In 2022, the county passed a new ordinance with several conditions for solar applications including buffer zones, environmental impacts and a cap on how much of the land mass may be used for solar projects. In 2023, county officials said there were already 590MW worth of approved solar projects that took up about 5,200 acres. Two projects had already been built with others in the pipeline to either start construction or the permitting process.

Llyod’s project was tabled in a 2023 Louisa County Planning Commission meeting, with a 4-4 vote. 
In the meeting, a recording of which was viewed by the Virginia Mercury, Chairman John Disosway said that Llyod’s application was one of the best they had seen by that time, in terms of following the conditions laid out by the county and having natural barriers planned. He was concerned, however, about the loss of agricultural land, which would be changed into industrial land by solar and other projects. He said that type of zoning change had been happening at an “alarming rate” and cited it as a reason he could not support the project. Clenera and Llyod have been trying to work with the county ever since to find an agreement to move the project forward.
This sort of discussion is not a new one in Virginia. Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, said that solar and agriculture do not need to be pitted against each other and it’s possible to marry the two industries to make land like Llyod’s even more profitable and useful in tackling the state’s energy needs.
“There is a way for us to honor and continue our agricultural history and the importance of agriculture as part of our economy and pair that with what everyone agrees is all of our energy needs” Sullivan said.
State Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, brought SB 1190, a companion bill to Sullivan’s HB 2126, that would have created the Virginia Energy Facility Review Board to review and analyze local solar ordinances. The board would not override local ordinances, but rather assist local leaders by making recommendations on how to implement specific projects. The bill failed in the Senate and was left in the House’s Labor and Commerce committee this year, and faced fierce pushback from local governments and the solar industry.
“The reality is we’ve got this Clean Economy Act, whether you like it or not, it’s the law,” Deeds said, speaking of Virginia’s landmark legislation that mandates Virginia decarbonize its electricity sources by 2050. “We’ve got a requirement to produce power through renewable means to decarbonize our electric production system, and we’re not going to meet our goals if we don’t move forward with solar.”

The rights of local governments and landowners are being weighed against some legislators and citizens’ calls for consistent regulations across the state, an issue also playing out across the country as states consider solar regulations.
The goal of the review board his bill sought to create, Deeds said, would be to provide localities with guidance on the best ways to implement solar projects in their areas, especially areas with smaller staffs and limited resources. It would be a small step toward addressing a big problem, Sullivan said.
“We’ve got a growing statewide energy demand without really any statewide strategy on how much and where in relation to data centers. We need to have a strategy to meet generation needs,” Sullivan said.
Deeds said he fully intends to bring back a version of his legislation again in the future. Meanwhile, other state leaders and candidates are speaking up about how to fulfill the state’s energy needs. A group of GOP House members slammed Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger’s plans to expand solar, framing it and other renewable energy sources as insufficient to meet the energy demands of the commonwealth.
“Of course it’s not, it’s not enough, but you’ve got to do it. It’s got to be part of a solution. We need a multi-faceted approach to our energy needs,” Deeds said.
Like Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Republican governor candidate Winsome Earle-Sears has advocated for an “all-of-the-above” approach to fueling Virginia’s future, saying both renewable and fossil fuel energy sources should be used.
Lloyd’s proposed project would have been a 20MW energy producer encompassing 100 acres total spread over 300 acres of her land. She said the project would have benefitted the area beyond energy production through taxes, even more so than if the land were to remain in agricultural use.
There is no word yet of when Lloyd’s project will be back in front of the Louisa commission for a new vote. County officials did not respond to requests for comment.
“I am actively growing timber on that property. That’s an agricultural use. I am paying less in taxes because of that agricultural use. Turning it into a solar opportunity, or solar farm increases the tax base,” Lloyd said.

Santiago/Getty Images)More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.

In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.

In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

Anti-abortion advocate Austin Beigel, who works for End Abortion Ohio, told WEWS/OCJ exclusively that new legislation is about to be introduced to overturn the state’s 2023 constitutional amendment to protect access to abortion, fertility treatments, contraception, miscarriage care, and the decision to continue a pregnancy.
“All it does is simply identify the preborn human being as a person under the law,” Beigel said.
This is an effort we have been following through on for years, as Biegel has pushed legislators to introduce his bill. He is working with Republican state Reps. Levi Dean, R-Xenia, and Jonathan Newman, R-Troy, on a total abortion ban using the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause to supersede Ohio’s constitutional amendment.
Dean, a plumber, and Newman, a pastor, are both freshman lawmakers.
Beigel says they have several other cosponsors.
“We are currently denying human beings of their personhood of the equal protection of the law,” Beigel said.
He believes the Constitution would designate life at conception. The legislation, one that doesn’t have a number assigned to it yet, would ban all forms of abortion, regardless of rape or incest. It would outlaw IVF and some forms of contraception like IUDs. If passed, women who have abortions would be charged with homicide.
The only exception would be if there was an immediate life-saving emergency or if there was a spontaneous miscarriage.
As we have covered this effort through the years, nonpartisan legal experts have cast doubt on the legitimacy of the 14th Amendment being used to outlaw abortion.
Asked whether this would be going against the voters, Beigel said, “It goes against the majority opinion of the people of Ohio, and that is something that we are proud of, because there have been many times in our country’s history where the people have asked for something evil — slavery was once legal in this country.”
Impact
This legislation is “devastating,” Ohioan Beth Long said.
Trying for years, Beth and Kyle Long’s dreams came true after a successful round of IVF.
“We did the scans, and she had a strong heartbeat,” she said. “Everything was great.”
But it was short-lived.
Their daughter Star had a rare birth defect called limb body wall complex, and doctors told Long that her daughter wouldn’t survive. Plus, she would be in danger.
“I didn’t want her to be born and feel pain, and abortion was a mercy to her,” she said through tears. “She never felt pain because we were able to access that care. I was able to live because I had access to that care.”
She likely would have “bled out,” or had to have an emergency hysterectomy, she said, citing her doctor. In the worst case, she could have died if there was one mistake, she said.
It took her three weeks to find affordable services. She works in a public hospital, so the state wouldn’t allow for her insurance to cover the procedure. In Ohio, to have her husband present at the appointment, an abortion would have cost $25,000.
So the family drove to Pennsylvania to get an abortion in 2023.
“The amount of suffering that we put people who are pregnant, who don’t want to be pregnant or can’t be pregnant anymore, through is just despicable,” she said.

Months later, in November 2023, 57% of Ohioans voted to enshrine abortion access into the state constitution, ensuring that families like Long’s could get the care they needed.
Long said that this bill is clearly unconstitutional, and that pro-family is pro-health care choices. Following Long’s abortion, she was able to conceive through IVF again. She had baby Felix in 2024.
“I’m pretty confident I would not have Felix (if she hadn’t gotten an abortion),” she said, tearing up. “It’s making me physically feel the same way that I did in 2023 when I was in that situation.”
The bill will be heard in the upcoming months by the Republican controlled legislature.
Beigel hopes lawsuits surrounding the legislation will reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

We asked.,Kat Struhar,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/17/gen-z-living-in-ct/,"Connecticut is known as a nice place to settle down, rather than start out. But do members of the Gen Z labor force agree?","Connecticut has a reputation of being a nice place to settle down. It’s not as well-known as a place for starting out. 
State and local leaders have been working to retain young talent, in part by promoting economic development and adding new housing in city centers. But what do members of the Gen Z labor force actually want from the places they live?
To find out, The Connecticut Mirror spoke with five recent graduates from both public and private universities in the state about their hopes for life after graduation, and whether Connecticut fits into that vision.
While their paths diverge — some planning to stay, others preparing to leave — they share a common concern: affordability. Whether dreaming of bigger cities, warmer climates, or simply more walkable neighborhoods, each of them is weighing the cost of staying in a state where housing is expensive, public transit is limited, and opportunities can feel unevenly distributed. 
Yet their stories also reveal what makes Connecticut worth holding onto — and what might convince them to stick around. Here’s what they had to say.
A community that’s easy to navigate

Ruby Clarke cited three things as most important to her when deciding where to live after college: “friends, affordability and the potential for community.”
Originally from a rural town in California, Clarke came to Connecticut to attend Wesleyan University. She’d only been to campus once, and was unable to visit again due to the pandemic. But she said she fell in love with the idea of going to Wesleyan by watching videos of people hiking the Appalachian Trail in Connecticut. 
“It didn’t occur to me that Connecticut could have nature,” Clarke said. “Now I do a lot of hiking in the state, which I really love.”
Clarke lives in Middletown, near her alma mater. She praised the city’s walkability and its abundance of easily accessible small businesses.
“I keep on being astounded by how Middletown has so many things I want a town to have,” Clarke said. “I love that in Middletown, if I want to, I can just walk to basically all the things I need. In a lot of other towns in Connecticut, you don’t necessarily have it being super walkable from your home unless you’re willing to pay a lot of money in rent.”
Though Clarke’s job pays for her transportation and health care, she said the cost of living in the state is still “heinous,” and she said she thinks lawmakers should institute rent control and increase the minimum wage to mitigate the issue. She said affordability could be pushing many young people out.
“I’m able to navigate the state with so much less of a financial burden,” Clarke said, but “it’s all about having a certain type of job that provides me with a certain amount of financial security that makes being a resident of the state possible.”
Leaving ‘cow town’

Lilah Moley has lived in Connecticut her whole life, but after graduating from the University of Connecticut this spring, she’s heading to Boston to start work as an audit associate at an accounting firm.
“I’m not in love with Connecticut,” she admitted. “There’s not really much to do, or not stuff that I love.”
Moley grew up in Harwinton. She chose an in-state school for the tuition benefits but she said she’s ready for a change both personally and professionally.
“That’s more how my parents feel, that I’m deserting them,” she said. “They’re like ‘You know, everything’s here,’ and I’m like, ‘Not really.’ I don’t feel a reason to stay and I’m excited to go somewhere else.”
Calling herself “someone who comes from cow town,” Moley said her view of Connecticut might have been different if she’d spent more time in places like Stamford or New Haven. While she sees potential in those cities, she’s more excited by the energy and public transit options available in Boston.
“That’s the thing that [Connecticut] is missing,” she said. “In Connecticut I can’t just hop on a bus and get to Hartford. There’s just a lot of ways to get in and out of the city in Boston.”
Though Boston is one of the most expensive places to live in the country, Moley doesn’t see Connecticut as being all hat much more affordable. It’s “way too expensive for what you get,” she said. 
“It is like the sandwich. It’s in between two really nice, better options, so it’s like, why would you choose Connecticut?… It’s a state you drive through. It’s not a state you live in.”

Originally from southern Texas, Luciel Sanchez moved to Connecticut to attend Wesleyan University seeking a fresh start. However, they quickly found that the cold winters and humid summers did not agree with them. Sanchez said they were able to withstand the recent winters through “just sheer force of will, and also I just didn’t go out much.”
Despite the freezing temperatures, Sanchez decided to stick it out in Connecticut for another year after graduating last year, doing freelance theater electrician jobs. Looking to the future, Sanchez is interested in moving to California because of the state’s warmer climate and liberal politics. 
“As of recently, Texas has had some interesting laws coming up that have made me go… ‘Let me go somewhere where I can actually be myself.’” Sanchez said. 
Though they wouldn’t want to move back to Texas, Sanchez did appreciate the lower housing costs in the Lone Star State, noting that they could afford a nicer place in Texas for the same price they pay to live in Hartford. Sanchez said the housing market in Connecticut is “brutal” and that navigating it has been “very, very stressful.”
Though Sanchez’s current trajectory is to eventually leave Connecticut, they said they could be convinced to stay if the state “contributed more to public transportation, walkability, the arts, things to do here, cost of living.” 
“It’s hard to live here because everything makes it hard to live here,” they said. “It’s not necessarily that we don’t want to try.”

After Vance Morris graduates from Central Connecticut State University this spring, he’s considering attending trade school to learn more about the construction field and how to apply his mechanical engineering degree. The two main options he’s looking at — Lincoln Tech and Porter and Chester Institute — both have campuses in Connecticut, so it’s likely he’ll remain in the state if he chooses to go this route. However, Morris’ long-term plan is to eventually leave Connecticut.
“I kind of want to pull some pages from some of my family members who lived in Connecticut all their lives [then] moved down south… Because the difference, when it comes down to cost, is pretty staggering,” Morris said.
Morris’ ideal place to live would be a suburb of Atlanta. He has cousins in the area that have vouched for the vibrant community and beautiful scenery — two factors that are important to Morris when deciding where to live. 
“I really prefer seeing more greenery versus more concrete. It kind of just makes me feel, as corny as it may sound, a little bit more connected to the earth. It kind of brings me a little bit more of a peaceful mind.”
Morris said he enjoyed attending high school in New Haven because of the convenience, walkability, and public transportation available in the city. But now, Connecticut’s taxes and housing costs are pushing him to consider other options.
“It comes down to taxes,” he said. “Connecticut is known for its high tax rates, especially when it comes down to income tax…. So I feel like, if Connecticut can find a way to drive down its prices a little bit —” he paused. 
“Will it happen? I feel like most likely not, unfortunately, but I don’t know.” 
Following his dreams

After Kevin Baffour graduates from UConn this spring, he hopes to get a job in sports journalism, do some modeling and work toward his goal of eventually becoming an actor. 
“You gotta leave your hometown to seek the opportunity,” he said. “At the end of the day, I really just want to make it.”
Baffour grew up in East Hartford, but his family now lives in South Windsor. He said one of his favorite things about Connecticut was growing up in a community surrounded by people with shared backgrounds.
“My parents are from Ghana. I’m a Ghanaian. So I’d probably say like, community, you know, some people — they’re from home. So I know people that are like me.”
Though he could see himself staying in Connecticut short-term after graduation, Baffour hopes to eventually move to New York City because of the opportunities for acting and modeling  he could pursue there. He’s also looking forward to the social life in New York City. 
He said events in Connecticut tend to be “a little bit small, not too big, not too exciting,” and he wants to be in a place with seasonal events like the Big E, a fair that takes place in Massachusetts.
“I feel like people have to leave Connecticut in order to have some fun,” he said.
Baffour said he would consider staying in Connecticut long-term if he was able to get a job at WWE, headquartered in Stamford, or ESPN, headquartered in Bristol. Ultimately, though, he doesn’t see Connecticut offering the kinds of professional opportunities he’s seeking. 
“You have this, ‘Connecticut is boring,’ this and that, this and that. What makes it boring? What do you want to see? Ask yourself that question. 
“What I want to see is probably just more opportunities in different areas…. If there was acting [opportunities] here that could elevate me, I would stay here.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GenZ_collage-1024x819.png,,,2025-06-17 06:04:08.810845

It stayed on overhead from 6:30 in the morning until 11:30 at night. Which was a surprise for the 34-year-old New Hampshire resident because he always thought of prison as a dark place, like in the 1999 movie “The Green Mile.” His cell wasn’t fully dark at night either. Guards with flashlights regularly checked on everyone held at the Wyatt Detention Facility.
Schmidt was housed among other Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees apart from the larger inmate population held by the U.S. Marshals Service awaiting federal court proceedings. Yet he learned other ICE detainees faced serious charges, including murder, sexual assault, and drug-dealing. The mission of the Wyatt — a quasi-public maximum security facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island’s smallest city — is to “protect the public from people who pose a threat to society.”
Schmidt never committed any violent crime.
Instead, he got off a plane at Boston’s Logan International Airport on March 7 on his return from a 10-day trip to visit family and friends in his native Germany. Schmidt obtained his green card as a teenager and became a U.S. permanent resident. But for some reason, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents pulled him aside.
They aggressively asked him about past misdemeanors from 10 years ago when he lived in California — including a charge of drug possession that had been adjudicated. They asked about his annual income, where his parents lived, and what they did for a living.
He was held for hours, which turned into days during which he was denied the chance to speak with a lawyer, his family, or the German Consulate. At one point, Schmidt said he was strip-searched and thrown into a cold shower. He was given only a thin mat to sleep on and fed a cold cup of noodles. He collapsed after developing flu-like symptoms and was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where he was handcuffed to the bed.
After being discharged from the hospital, Schmidt was taken back to the airport. On March 11, four days after his return from Europe, CBP agents came to get him.
“That’s the first time I went to Rhode Island,” he recalled in a recent interview at a coffee shop near his home in Nashua. “In hand shackles, feet shackles, in the back of an SUV going like 80 miles an hour.”
He speaks softly, with a faint accent, sometimes pausing to note the surreal facts of the 58 days he spent inside the Wyatt.
In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Rhode Island Current, “When an individual is found with drug related charges and tries to re-enter the country, officers will take proper action. In this case, the conviction was dismissed, and the individual was released.”
In several posts on the platform X , McLaughlin has called clips from news reports on Schmidt’s treatment by CBP at Logan “blatantly false,” “straight-up false,” and “flat-out FALSE.”
Schmidt is readjusting to life back home. He said the ordeal cost him tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, lost wages from his job as a master electrician, and expenses for food, clothing, and phone calls home to his worried girlfriend. He is considering filing a lawsuit, though he doesn’t have details to share about that yet.
“This whole experience feels like a movie,” he said.

Not knowing why
Schmidt’s story is one of dozens of accounts of hyper-aggressive immigration enforcement since the start of Donald Trump’s second term. There’s the Canadian woman with a U.S. work visa detained by ICE for two weeks who wrote she felt like she had been “kidnapped;” the visiting scholar at Georgetown University with an academic visa held without charges at an ICE detention facility in Texas; the pair of Georgia newlyweds separated after the bride, an asylum seeker from Colombia, was detained by ICE.
According to the Syracuse University-based public records database, Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), 19,125 people were booked into ICE detention in March, when Schmidt was first detained. His case drew headlines because it initially made no sense.
New Hampshire Democratic U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan described the case as “very concerning,” while Massachusetts Democratic State Rep. Mike Connolly called Schmidt’s detention “outrageous” and “unlawful.” On X, a Canadian law professor’s post about Schmidt was shared more than 2,000 times.
His case also highlighted the Wyatt’s role at the center of a yearslong political firestorm. Several public officials, including Rhode Island General Treasurer James Diossa, previously the mayor of Central Falls, have called for its closure. State lawmakers have introduced bills to close it down or, in the case of active bills in the House and Senate sessions, to stop ICE’s ability to do business with Wyatt for civil immigration violations. Community members regularly hold protests outside the Wyatt’s walls to draw attention to people detained inside. Since Trump’s inauguration, there have been at least six such rallies.

One, on March 18, was for Schmidt. Outside the Wyatt, people chanted his name and held signs that read “FREE FABIAN” and “DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION.”
Schmidt heard them from inside. It gave him a surge of adrenaline. And a realization.
“Whoa,” he recalled thinking at the time. “This is bigger than myself.”
Schmidt spent his childhood traveling with his mother and stepfather, who worked as a tech consultant. He has lived in Denmark, South Africa, and England; he can read and write in four languages. When he was 16, his stepfather’s work brought the family to Palo Alto, California. His stepfather’s visa was for people with extraordinary abilities in their field — often called a “genius visa” — and granted Schmidt legal entry as a dependent. Schmidt rode horses, played football, and embraced his new home.
In 2022, he moved to Nashua to be closer to his mother, who had moved there. After a stint as a bartender, he found work as an electrical project lead at two affiliated companies: Greenerd Press & Machine Co., in Nashua, and Diamond Casting, in Hollis.
Ian Wilson, a process engineer at Diamond Casting, called Schmidt a crucial member of the company. “He’s upstanding, friendly, gregarious, and very energetic,” he said.
While bartending, Schmidt met and fell in love with Bhavani Hodgkins, who is now his fiancée. (Schmidt has an 8-year-old daughter from a previous relationship who lives with her mother in California.) He and Hodgkins have a black Lab named Django.
“This is where I’m from,” he said. “I love this country.”
Low-quality food, high fees
The Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility opened in 1993 on the site of a former textile factory. At the time, it helped address a shortage in pre-trial federal jail space in New England. During the search for a suitable Rhode Island site, a few cities and towns opposed the facility. But long-struggling Central Falls saw an economic opportunity.
Shortly after the facility opened, then-Mayor Thomas Lazieh called the Wyatt “a win now and a much bigger win down the road.”
The ensuing years brought some payments from the detention center to the city; Central Falls received a total of $5.3 million in impact fees from Wyatt from 1994 through 2008, according to a 2012 joint legislative commission.

But Wyatt also brought escapes, lawsuits over detainee mistreatment, criminal charges against staff members and wardens, a receivership, and — most notably — the 2008 death of an ICE detainee involving medical neglect and mistreatment.
The death of that detainee, Hiu Lui “Jason” Ng, prompted ICE to withdraw from the Wyatt for a decade. In 2019, the agency returned, amid an outcry from community groups, the Rhode Island ACLU, and elected officials.
Today, the facility boasts a capacity of up to 730 adult male and 40 adult female detainees. According to a report in late March, the facility held 617 detainees for the U.S. Marshals Service (590 male, 27 female), and 116 detainees for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (112 male, 4 female). One of those male ICE detainees was Schmidt.
He was housed in 10-by-7-foot cells with thick, pneumatically locking steel doors. One cell looked out over Macomber Stadium, where Central Falls High School plays athletics.
The food was so bad, he said, he wouldn’t feed it to his dog. Breakfast was some kind of “oversalted…flour soup,” Schmidt said, along with a pinkish sausage of unknown origin, a dry piece of cornbread, and a serving of lukewarm milk. Lunch and dinner consisted of food that came from a can — chicken, green beans — and powdered potatoes that tasted like cardboard.
Schmidt’s account of the food provided at the Wyatt echoes a March report by the community organization Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance (AMOR), which states, “In the first two weeks of March, AMOR received messages from 16 people detained by ICE who specified that they would not have enough to eat without help purchasing food from the Commissary.”
Schmidt was scared, sad, and depressed during his weeks at the Wyatt. He missed his daughter, his partner, his dog.
“Mentally, you have to learn how to block that out in prison or else you’ll ruin yourself,” he said. “You have to be able to be like, ‘OK, I’m not gonna miss my dog today.’”
In April, Hodgkins shared a note Schmidt wrote in a Facebook post: “Time moves differently in here. It drags, heavy and cruel…I haven’t seen the sky in weeks.”

After Schmidt was moved to the Wyatt, Hodgkins spent hours on the phone — with him, his family members, attorneys, and others — trying to strategize how to secure his release and ensure his safety and comfort until then. She was forced to navigate the substantial financial burden of having a loved one detained at Wyatt.
To supplement the Wyatt’s food options, Schmidt needed to purchase food items from the commissary. He needed money to buy more toothpaste and soap because supplies issued to detainees didn’t last very long. Hodgkins created accounts so Schmidt could receive packages and communicate with her, via phone or video-chat.
“Every single thing that you do at the Wyatt Detention Facility requires (a) form of payment,” she said.
A receipt Hodgkins shared on Facebook shows, between March 12 and May 6, she spent more than $2,600 in deposits into the facility’s TouchPay system — deposits requiring fees ranging from around 6% of a deposit to more than 40%. In one instance, she was charged a $4.30 fee for a $10 deposit. The total fees, across 25 deposits, add up to more than $220.
Here, again, Hodgkins’ experiences aligned with conditions described in AMOR’s report, which says Wyatt contractors charge “exorbitant” rates for basic services, including phone calls, text messages, and food to supplement insufficient nutrition.
“In the first two weeks of March, 20 people detained reported to AMOR that calls were too expensive,” the report’s authors write. “During the same period, 43 individuals made new requests for Commissary help.”
As she navigated these new challenges, Hodgkins said she was dealing with waves of her own anger, anguish, and sadness. She was fearful for Fabian’s health and safety, that he would be deported, that they would lose the life they had built together.
Hodgkins rearranged her work schedule so she could make the 80-mile drive from Nashua to Central Falls in time to meet the facility’s strict rules that visitors arrive at least 30 minutes before visiting hours. During one visit, she saw an elderly woman with a walker turned away for arriving too late.
Hodgkins found the facility intimidating: a massive concrete building with small windows surrounded by tall razor wire fences. The “visits” were, in fact, a phone conversation with Schmidt while the two were separated by glass in a room lit by fluorescent lights. Once, when she washed her hands inside the facility, she noticed the water had a yellowish tinge.
“I really hope that no one has to go there to see their loved ones, because it’s truly horrible,” she said.
ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When Rhode Island Current reached out to the Wyatt with detailed questions about the conditions both Hodgkins and Schmidt described, a spokesperson responded: “The Wyatt has no comment at this time.”
No problem with international travel in 2017
When protesters assembled outside the Wyatt on March 18 to call for Schmidt’s release, his lawyer, David Keller, said Schmidt’s past issues in California had been resolved and there hadn’t been any new official charges pressed against his client.
“Imagine yourself being charged with a crime, held, and not even knowing what the crime is,” he told reporters. “That’s essentially his situation.” (Keller was unavailable to comment for this story.)
About a week later, Schmidt finally learned the reason for his detention: a misdemeanor charge for drug possession from California that had already been resolved. Schmidt had pleaded no contest to the charge in 2015, despite disputing that the drugs were his; he was unaware that the controlled-substance conviction marked him in the immigration system as inadmissible. He said he was never notified of these implications of a no-contest plea, nor had he been stopped by CBP after an earlier international trip in 2017.
Once the immigration charges against Schmidt became clear, lawyers for Schmidt on both coasts swung into action. In California, a criminal attorney re-opened the drug case and was able to get it dismissed from the system. (Grounds for that dismissal: the substance Schmidt was charged with possessing had never been tested to confirm what it was.) In Boston, his immigration attorney worked to secure a hearing with an immigration judge.
The hearing finally happened on May 8. The judge dismissed Schmidt’s immigration case in minutes.

Schmidt and Hodgkins finally reunited outside of ICE’s Boston field office in Burlington, Massachusetts. The days since then have been joyful. Shortly after his release, Schmidt proposed to Hodgkins. He has enjoyed regular walks with his dog, cooking dinner with Hodgkins, and reconnecting with friends.
But the couple’s life together is much different from the way it used to be. Schmidt estimates his time in custody cost him at least $65,000, between legal fees, lost wages, and the many costs of his Wyatt detention. An online fundraiser by his mother raised over $34,000. A second fundraiser launched by Hodgkins “to help aid other legal immigrants with injustice” is ongoing.
The emotional toll has also been steep. In the early days after his release, he couldn’t take a nap while home alone, afraid people might come for him while he was sleeping. Routine activities like a trip to the grocery store can now trigger waves of panic. He is wary about driving, fearful of being pulled over and detained again over a minor infraction.
“I have to be strong when he’s not, and I can’t show my fear as much because I don’t want him to get fearful,” Hodgkins said. “We’re going to spend the rest of our life healing from this trauma.”

The couple have embraced new roles as advocates for immigrants navigating an unforgiving system. They are calling for more transparency in the detention process, to spare others from the weeks of confusion they experienced. And they are speaking out against the heavy-handed response Schmidt faced for what was essentially a paperwork issue.
As dark as his experience was, Schmidt said he benefited from privileges many other ICE detainees lack. He’s a white man who speaks fluent English, with access to a top-notch legal team.
“I don’t even want to know what’s happening to other people,” he said.
Although the Wyatt holds immigration-related detainees, Hodgkins wants people to understand it is designed to hold criminals. She said the staff there had no interest in helping her with the logistics of visitation or keeping her partner comfortable and connected while inside.
“They’re not going to be nice to you,” she said. “They’re not going to be helpful to you.”
Schmidt went back to work in early June. When he was away, his projects were either put on hold, or his work had to be delegated to other people, Wilson, his coworker, said.
“I’m very relieved that he’s been released,” he said, “and very concerned for our judicial system.”
In a June 2 Facebook post, Hodgkins wrote about feeling anxious, even as Schmidt was excited about his first day back to work.
“No one prepares you for the fear and uncertainty that comes with being separated from a loved one under such traumatic circumstances,” she wrote.
“But today, we’re beginning to find our rhythm again.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is pushing to reshape the federal housing safety net by slashing spending and shifting the burden of housing millions of people to states, which may be ill-equipped to handle the mission.
President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
Trump’s hopes for next year
The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate, and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults, and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Lisa Bowman, director of marketing and communications at the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Bowman wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” she wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

Negotiators from the House and Senate still have a vast array of differences to hammer out, but both chambers advanced proposals that axed the state campaign finance watchdog.
Barring a veto by Gov. Mike DeWine, it seems likely the commission is on its last legs. The question is how exactly lawmakers plan to wind down the agency and reassign its responsibilities.

The Senate’s plan
Instead of an independent seven-member commission, the Senate proposes a five-member body known as the Ohio Election Integrity Commission housed in the Ohio Secretary of State’s office. The secretary would choose the chairman. Majority and minority leaders in the state House and Senate would get one pick each.
Currently, the governor selects six of the seven members on the Ohio Elections Commission evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, and the seventh member is selected by those six and must have no partisan affiliation.
Under the new proposed set-up, all of the commission members would be selected by partisan elected officials, creating a situation where one party or the other would have a 3-2 advantage on the commission.
Speaking to reporters before the budget was approved, state Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, argued that the Secretary of State’s office is a better home for campaign oversight.
He said many lawmakers don’t think it’s as “effective as it as it should be. Didn’t have a lot of teeth,” he explained. “We feel it’s going to be better to monitor elections in the Secretary of State’s office. I think it’s a natural fit.”
Ohio House budget would eliminate independent campaign finance oversight

The Senate proposal also requires the commission chair to be either an attorney or someone with at least four years’ experience in election administration. The remaining commission members must meet the same requirements or be a former general election candidate. The new commission would also investigate voter fraud allegations.
The changes address some of the loudest critiques leveled against the agency.
In the Ohio House, Finance Chairman, state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, dismissed the commission as seven people “playing judge,” who don’t need to have any legal training at all.
“That’s a silly system,” he argued.
He and several other lawmakers have also bristled at the pace and demands of Ohio Elections Commission hearings. They argue the agency takes too long reach a decision and hearings, held in Columbus, demand too much of their time.
Reactions
Ohio Senate Democrats blasted the chamber’s budget proposal on several fronts including the elimination of the Ohio Elections Commission.
“From public schools, to universities, to health care, to the Elections Commission,” Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, argued, “this bill is complete garbage that attacks the average Ohioan to benefit rich Republican donors.”
Outside observers have criticized the idea of eliminating an agency — particularly one tasked with campaign finance oversight — in the state budget rather than in a standalone bill. Folding the changes into the spending bill avoids public hearings with attention focused squarely on that policy.
But Senate President Rob McColley defended the approach.
“Anytime you are rearranging agencies, there’s corresponding budgetary impacts to that,” he said at a press conference introducing the changes. “Trying to account for that in another agency, that’s also what would make it appropriate for the budget.”
Sec. LaRose urges lawmakers to keep but reform Ohio Elections Commission

The appropriation piece was a central ask in a letter Secretary of State Frank LaRose sent McColley last month. LaRose stressed that reforming the commission was “long overdue,” but “we need to improve it, not abolish and decentralize its authority.”
The Senate’s plan incorporates several of LaRose’s suggestions for a reimagined commission. The name, legal training requirements, and broader jurisdiction were all ideas LaRose’s staff has shared with lawmakers.
The one thing that didn’t make it was the appropriation. If the Senate insisted on dissolving the commission, LaRose said, his office would need “at least $800,000 in additional operating funds and the possible expansion of office space to accommodate unbudgeted personnel.”
Senators gave him $250,000. They also pared back a business services fund under his umbrella by $200,000 over the next two years. The Ohio Capital Journal reached out to LaRose for comment. He did not respond.
The mood around commission offices?
“Concern, I guess is probably the best word,” longtime Ohio Elections Commission Executive Director Phil Richter admits.
While he’s open to critiques or ideas for improving the agency, he also still believes in its mission. After 30 years working there, he said, “I think it’s fulfilled an important role, an important independent role, enforcing Ohio’s campaign finance laws. To take that away, I think, is a disservice to the citizens of the state of Ohio.”
His overriding concern, though, is what happens between July and January if lawmakers go forward with their plans.
The Senate proposes transferring Ohio Election Commission staff to the Secretary of State’s office, but it’s not clear if the Secretary is getting funding to cover their salaries. The budget proposals also direct the commission to transfer cases to the secretary by Jan. 1, 2026, but appropriations for the commission itself get zeroed out in both proposals.
“It’s one thing to say that the commission remains in existence until January 1,” Richter said, “but if there’s no money in the budget for that? I don’t know. I don’t know how we go about doing the work without money.”

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Elected leaders from the Ohio Statehouse to local school boards have signed on to a national letter opposing the federal budget bill currently being considered by the U.S. Senate.
More than 60 Ohio officials signed on to the letter organized by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), including state leadership, city and county administration from across the state, and school board members from Dayton and Trimble.
The letter urged Congress not to cut public services like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), cuts that the officials say threaten to “destabilize state and local budgets and force deep cuts across the board that will diminish public services and hurt working families nationwide – all to give billionaires tax breaks.”
Ohio House Minority Leader Allison Russo was one of the officials who signed the letter. She said she joined in because the budget “doesn’t just show misplaced priorities,” but rather “shows a complete disregard for working families.”
“Ohioans deserve a government that strengthens public services, not one that guts them to reward the wealthy,” Russo said in a statement on the letter.

Medicaid has been noted as one of the biggest public programs in the country’s budget, and the proposal from Congress looks to cut $880 billion, largely from Medicaid and SNAP. The cuts are projected to leave 29% more spending in the hands of state governments, with Ohio set to be one of the hardest hit by Medicaid cuts alone, according to the Commonwealth Fund.
The projected cuts also come as Ohio’s General Assembly sits in conference committee to combine state operating budget drafts from the House and Senate into a final draft to be sent to Gov. Mike DeWine for approval.
Both the Ohio House and Ohio Senate proposals included a “trigger” provision that would eliminate the Medicaid expansion group in Ohio if federal funding for Medicaid drops below the 90% contribution it currently provides.
Cutting the expansion group would leave more than 770,000 Ohioans without health insurance, according to advocates. The expansion group includes residents who are not eligible for traditional Medicaid, but are still in need of help, such as elderly Ohioans, students and residents with disabilities.
Medicaid cuts would impact more than a quarter of Ohioans, children and the elderly most of all

Earlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office projected 10.9 million people nationwide would lose health insurance by 2034 as a result of the federal budget bill, and that the federal deficit would rise by $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years.
“As government leaders, we understand the importance of rooting out fraud, waste and abuse to keep public services strong, but this plan fails to do that,” the officials wrote in the letter.
Not only would the funding cuts to Medicaid negatively impact states, but proposed work requirements would also “impose huge costs on states,” and administrative costs resulting from a shift of $300 billion to states and local governments for SNAP services would cause cuts to other “critical services like our schools or roads.”
Ohio anti-hunger advocates urge U.S. Senators to reject SNAP changes

“Taken together, the cuts that are included in (House Resolution) 1 will place an impossible burden on states,” the letter read. “Forced to make up for the massive shortfalls in federal funding, every sector of our state and local economies will suffer, from health care to higher education, public safety to public schools.”
Anti-hunger advocates have also urged Congress to avoid hampering food assistance programs at a time when Ohio food banks and providers are straining under ever-increasing demand. They’ve also spent time pleading with the state legislature to help, or at the very least, not cut funding to anti-hunger programs.
One particular cut that has been maintained through the House and Senate proposals is a slashing of funding to the Children’s Hunger Alliance, which took DeWine’s executive proposal of $7.5 million over two years down to $5 million.
The Ohio General Assembly has until the end of June to send DeWine a final draft of the budget approved by both chambers. Negotiations on congressional budget reconciliation are ongoing in the U.S. Senate, having set a July 4 deadline for themselves.

(Photo by Kathiann M. Kowalski/Canary Media)This story was originally published by Canary Media.

After years of delay, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is finally scrutinizing fees that could have enabled FirstEnergy’s bribes and other alleged violations related to House Bill 6, the 2019 law at the heart of Ohio’s ongoing corruption scandal.


The state regulatory board froze its cases related to HB 6 for more than a year to avoid interfering with federal criminal investigations. Delays in FirstEnergy’s production of thousands of documents had held up the cases before that.


After multiple convictions and guilty pleas in federal court, the state utilities commission finally began a ​“consolidated evidentiary hearing” last week for three cases connected to the scandal. The hearing – basically a regulatory trial – is slated to last until the end of June and will allow parties to present witness testimony and evidence to administrative law judges. At stake is whether FirstEnergy will have to pay penalties exceeding half a billion dollars — as well as the very credibility and legitimacy of Ohio’s utility regulatory system, observers say.


“The [utilities commission] has promised to follow the facts wherever they lead,” said Maureen Willis, who heads the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, which represents the interests of the state’s residential utility customers. ​“Now is the moment to prove those weren’t empty words.”


FirstEnergy has already admitted to using dark-money organizations to channel approximately $60 million in bribes to organizations controlled by former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder (R) in return for using his leadership position to help get a law passed to bail out its struggling nuclear power plants. The company also admitted it made arrangements to pay $4.3 million to Sam Randazzo, a former chair of the state utilities commission, shortly before he took office, in return for actions favorable to FirstEnergy and its utilities.


The company agreed to pay roughly $330 million to settle federal criminal and securities law charges, but neither the state nor its customers have received any compensation.


Just before the evidentiary hearing was set to begin on June 10, FirstEnergy lawyers sought to block large parts of expert testimony from opponents on how Ohio’s regulatory regime and certain charges added to customers’ bills enabled its unlawful activities. The contested experts’ testimony supports challengers’ requests for hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties. FirstEnergy’s utilities took the position that the experts’ statements are irrelevant and outside the scope of the cases.


One of the three cases that regulators are considering deals with what FirstEnergy did with more than $450 million collected under a bill ​“rider” that the Ohio Supreme Court found to be unlawful in 2019, because the utilities commission didn’t spell out how the money should be used when it approved the charge. A second case is about whether the company improperly used an account for utilities’ capital expenses to hide payments for a side deal with Randazzo and other unlawful activities. The third case asks whether FirstEnergy’s generation and distribution companies improperly colluded in actions related to HB 6 and Randazzo. A fourth HB 6-related case, which is not part of the current hearing, generally asks whether FirstEnergy used money from customers for political or charitable ends.


The Ohio Consumers’ Counsel’s request for more than $500 million in restitution and penalties is supported by testimony of its expert Ashley Brown, a former state utilities commissioner who headed the Harvard Electricity Policy Group. The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association Energy Group is asking FirstEnergy to credit roughly $770 million back to Ohio customers, supported by testimony of John Seryak, CEO of the energy consulting firm RunnerStone.


More than money is at stake, Seryak said in his written testimony: ​“Corrupting the regulatory process in such an appalling manner cuts to the core of our functioning democracy in Ohio. It is in a category of its own, and deserves a penalty that far exceeds the direct financial gains and interest of the case, severe enough to be a sufficient deterrent for future corruption of the regulatory process.”

FirstEnergy’s utilities have asked the commission to strike parts of Brown’s and Seryak’s testimonies on what the company sees as ​“extraneous issues.” Among other things, the company objects to Brown’s assertion that ​“FirstEnergy Corp. acted more like a lobbying firm with an electric utility company as a side business, than a utility merely looking out for its own self-interest.” The utilities also objected to many of his statements supporting requests for penalties.


FirstEnergy’s utilities argue that the background of the bill charge that was eventually held unlawful shouldn’t matter, because the companies had a right to collect the money until the Ohio Supreme Court found it was unlawful. The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio announced in January 2022 that an audit by Daymark Energy Advisors found ​“no evidence revenues from [the rider] were used to fund lobbying activities.”


In fact, the money went into a joint account which could be used for multiple purposes, and the report said the use of that joint money pool prevented the auditors from tracking the funds to any specific use. And its utilities’ dividends to FirstEnergy increased substantially once the bill charge took effect, according to an earlier interim report by Oxford Advisors. In Seryak’s view, that amounted to ​“free cash” that let FirstEnergy carry out lobbying and unlawful activities.


Statements by FirstEnergy’s lawyers during the June 10 cross-examination of an outside auditor who reviewed charges to an account for capital investments similarly suggested a narrow view that the commission should care only about how much more customers may have paid on their bills. Under that approach, dozens of improperly recorded transactions wouldn’t matter if they were above annual caps set by the commission.


In contrast, questions by challengers’ lawyers to Donna Mullinax of Blue Ridge Consulting Services, a witness for the Public Utilities Commission staff, suggested that all the payments mattered — and that the auditor and regulators at the utilities commission should have done more to flag irregularities, especially once the HB 6 scandal became public.


FirstEnergy’s arguments for keeping out expert testimony are ​“outrageous” and ​“insulting to the commission,” Brown told Canary Media. In his view, the commission needs a full understanding of the utilities’ history and corporate culture, along with regulatory audits and changes in FirstEnergy’s corporate practices, to properly impose potential penalties, which he says should be more than $500 million.


“The last thing you want to do is keep information from the decision-maker,” Brown told Canary Media.


Rulings in other cases have kept out evidence about House Bill 6 and circumstances that challengers say made it easier for former executives to divert company money and bribe former heads of the Ohio House of Representatives and the Public Utilities Commission. Regulators told stakeholders that the commission would eventually consider those issues in a future case.


“We are finally now at that case, and we should be able to proceed with a full and fair proceeding,” said Kimberly Bojko, a lawyer representing the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association Energy Group. The effort to block the experts’ testimony did not surprise her. But, she added, ​“I think it’s baseless.”


June 16 is the deadline for the manufacturers’ association and Ohio Consumers’ Counsel to submit legal briefs responding to FirstEnergy’s move to block the expert testimony. It’s also the deadline for responses to a separate company filing challenging the testimony of Joseph Perez, an analyst for the consumers’ counsel. Administrative law judges Megan Addison and Matt Sandor are expected to rule on the issue of expert testimony before the witnesses take the stand, which is tentatively scheduled for the week of June 23.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)With days left to go before the planned adjournment date on Wednesday, Maine lawmakers are continuing to cast votes at a breakneck pace.
Here’s an overview of some of the biggest items of debate Friday and Monday as well as what happened with legislation and issues that we’ve followed all session.
Both chambers
With the House voting 64-79 on Monday, both chambers have now voted down an amended version of LD 1299, which would prohibit a person from storing a handgun in an unoccupied vehicle, unless it is out of view and locked specifically in a hard-sided container with the car locked. 
Members of the House voted 79-62 to align with the Senate against passage of LD 613, a bill supported by the Maine Medical Association that allows terminally ill patients to waive the current 17-day waiting period for access to life-ending medication.
Not enough members of the House or Senate backed enactment of an emergency bill LD 365 that would impose a three-month moratorium on the sale of mobile home parks unless it is the park residents making an offer to purchase the park.
Legislation (LD 525) that would clarify that someone has the right to discharge a firearm within 500 feet of school property if acting in self defense of their property is essentially dead after both chambers insisted on their positions Monday, with the House in favor and the Senate opposed. 
Another bill (LD 1743) that would allow municipalities to adopt policies prohibiting firearms within municipal buildings and polling places is also dead after the chambers failed to agree, with the Senate in support and the House opposed. (Read more about this and other gun bills here.)
The House voted 76-69 and the Senate 20-12 to back legislation (LD 670) that would explicitly name behavior patterns known as “coercive control” in state statute under types of domestic violence, allowing victims to seek protection and abusers to be arrested or prosecuted. (Read more about this issue here).
After significant back and forth, the House on Monday agreed to align with the Senate in backing a controversial bill (LD 297) that extends a loophole for out-of-state waste to be brought to Juniper Ridge Landfill. Even lawmakers who supported the bill said they did not want to extend the loophole but were concerned about obligations to local municipalities and said if no action is taken, it would mean “serious problems at the landfill.” (Read more about this issue here).
The Maine House and Senate also passed legislation (LD 1868) updating renewable and clean energy procurement laws. Among other changes, it clarifies that the Public Utilities Commission may coordinate with other states to procure transmission capacity, capacity resources, renewable energy credits or clean energy credits if it determines that the likely benefits to Maine ratepayers will exceed the likely costs.
Legislation (LD 1784) requiring law enforcement agencies to make their policies and procedures publicly available, and provide orientation training for all officers on those procedures, was backed by both chambers.
Both chambers have also passed legislation (LD 1691) to create a loan program under the Finance Authority of Maine to eligible residents interested in providing legal services in an underserved area of the state and who are enrolled or intend to enroll in an accredited law school, or who have recently graduated from law school and have outstanding loans.
The House on Friday insisted on its rejection of a proposal (LD 1200) that would prohibit the sale of items intended to be used to inhale nitrous oxide for recreational use. Following the Senate’s insistence on passage, the bill is now essentially dead.
Legislation (LD 1138) which sought to better align the state’s transportation projects and planning under the Maine Department of Transportation and Turnpike Authority with the Climate Action Plan was also killed after both chambers failed to agree, with the House opposed and the Senate in support.
Both chambers rejected legislation (LD 1318) that sought to enhance data collection requirements related to immigration status and asylum seekers, with the Senate voting 21-13 and the House 78-70. 
Senators voted 20-12 to pass a resolve (LD 244) directing the Department of Corrections to contract with a community-based organization to establish a transitional housing pilot program to provide for individuals recently released from correctional facilities.
Both chambers have now rejected legislation (LD 1321) that would have significantly restricted the state’s clean energy credit program, known as net energy billing, by reducing the capacity of eligible projects, limiting compensation, increasing transmission costs for program participants. (Read more about this and other proposals here.)
Legislation (LD 1938) that, among other things, changes the definition of “smoking” to include natural or synthetic tobacco or other plant products as well as electronic smoking devices — thus prohibiting their use in places where smoking is banned — passed late last week.
A bill (LD 1723) that would amend the laws governing mobile home communities to protect against excessive rent and fee increases passed the House 78-67 and the Senate 20-12 on Friday. The chambers also voted to back a proposal (LD 1765) increase requirements on owners applying for licenses for a mobile home park, which proponents say will help enhance oversight.
The House voted 77-69 and the Senate 19-13 to back a proposal (LD 340) that would establish the Maine Speedy Trial Act, which would create time limits for a defendant’s criminal trial in an effort to address the significant backlog in the state’s indigent defense system. (Read more about this issue here).
Lawmakers rejected a provision (LD 165) that would modify school discipline policies regarding out-of-school suspension of students in grade 5 or below. 
Both chambers unanimously backed legislation (LD 1944) that makes several changes to the Maine Criminal Code in an effort to protect individuals from threats of unauthorized dissemination of certain private images, including AI images.

(Matt Kleinmann)On June 14, I joined thousands of folks marching around the Statehouse in Topeka. We weren’t there for any politician. It wasn’t about left or right. It was about the Constitution.
The same thing happened in other Kansas towns. Lenexa, Pittsburg, Lawrence. Some stood on sidewalks. Some just held signs at busy intersections. All told, more than 11 million people across the country showed up for “No Kings” rallies.
The next morning, a friend texted me, “What does that even mean — ‘No Kings’?” She wasn’t trying to debate. She really wanted to know.
Honestly, I think a lot of Kansans are in that boat. They care. They vote. They work hard. But they’re not tracking court rulings every day. So I tried to explain it the best I could.
Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that presidents can’t be charged for a crime they commit if it’s part of their “official duties.” That means a president could order something illegal — say, go after political opponents or refuse to follow a court order — and not face charges, at least while in office. They also could use the military to refuse to leave office.
The legal logic behind this is called the unitary executive theory. It says the president has total control of the executive branch. That Congress and the courts don’t really have a say.
That’s not in the Constitution. But more and more, it’s how power’s being used.
We’ve already seen how that power grab works: Trump tried to end birthright citizenship by executive order. He ignored a federal judge on deportations. He froze money Congress had already approved. He went after lawyers who represent people he doesn’t like. Each of those violated the Constitution or a law.
That’s not how it’s supposed to work. The whole point of checks and balances is to stop that.
Some folks think this is overblown. That it’s all just noise, that all news media is a lie, or that nothing they do will change anything. I’ve seen the comments, and it’s disheartening. Or worse, some claim that using our First Amendment Rights to protest is going to lead to violence.
But I was there. And it wasn’t like that. People were energized but peaceful.
The group that organized it — 50501 — told everyone: no violence. Just show up and be counted, because research shows it only takes about 3.5% of a population showing up like that to tip the scales. Not everyone. Just enough to make those in power pay attention. “No Kings” saw 3.3% of the country show up.
We gathered, we talked with each other, we listened to speakers, and we all left feeling a little less alone.
But once you start naming what’s happening at the national level, it’s not difficult to see those same patterns closer to home.
When one person tries to take over multiple departments in local government. When a handful of people decide who gets to run for office and who gets pushed aside. When decisions happen behind closed doors, and the public gets cut out, and things just move forward anyway.
It might look like streamlining. But it’s really about skipping the process. And the process is where regular people still have a shot to be heard.
Somewhere along the way, we’ve lost trust in the process. In each other. In our government. In how decisions get made. I get it: Our trust is broken. But you don’t rebuild it by staying home or posting to social media. You rebuild it by showing up. By sharing what you have. By making the government work for us again.
It’s not fixed by us waiting around for one strong leader to solve it. They won’t. They can’t. And if we hand them too much power, it almost always corrupts them.
America doesn’t have kings. We forget that sometimes, but we shouldn’t. The freedom to govern ourselves is what our forefathers fought and died for: a government by the people and for the people.
The Declaration of Independence says: “Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.”
That still matters. Or at least it should.
That’s why I marched. Not to yell. Not to fight.
But to remind folks that democracy takes showing up. Even when it’s hard. Especially when it’s hard.

Pro forma doublespeak from religious right-wingers who specialize in spinning oppressive fundamentalism as family-forward enlightenment.
Ohio’s largest religious right lobby (and permanent fixture at the Ohio Statehouse) spewed that bunk on a biblical scale in a recent online takeaway of the Ohio Senate budget passed last week. 
“This is the most pro-family, pro-parent budget we’ve seen in years” gushed a lobbyist with the Center for Christian Virtue about a budget draft that dishes up unholy hell and hardship for countless Ohio families. 
But the CCV conveniently glossed over the slashed funding and eliminated programs part of the Ohio Senate Republicans’ budget that gutted efforts to bring down infant mortality rates, provide crucial continuous health care coverage to children up to age three, improve birth and maternal health outcomes with stable housing, increase notoriously low state eligibility rates for publicly funded child care, restore the proposed $1,000 per-child tax credit to give struggling low and middle-income families a financial lifeline with rising rent, food and child care costs.
The group’s spin doctor also ignored devastating budget hits to food banks that feed millions of Ohio families in all 88 counties of the state. 
The operating budget before Senate and House negotiators would set food bank funding back to 2019 levels, about 23% less than what was spent this year in a state where nearly 1 in 3 Ohioans qualifies for help. 
Feeding some of the poorest students in Ohio with free meals, even with a pared down funding request from an anti-hunger coalition, is not even on the table in current budget negotiations.  
Neither is fully funding public schools (especially those in high-poverty, low-performing districts) that serve the vast majority of Ohio students. 
The Senate Republican budget version not only shortchanges the education of young Ohioans it also puts them at greater personal risk with inexplicable cuts in funding for overdose prevention, lead abatement programs, pediatric cancer search and a clean water initiative successfully improving community drinking water. 
But when the Center for Christian Virtue — once designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center — boasted that the Senate budget “protects children,” it didn’t mean from genuine threats such as drug addiction, lead poisoning, or malnutrition, but from “ideological agendas” that don’t align with the ideological extremes of the religious right.
“From safeguarding children from obscene content in libraries to affirming the biological reality of male and female to empowering families,” the CCV’s policy director proclaimed, the Senate-approved budget “puts parents back in the driver’s seat, protects children from harmful agendas, and affirms foundational truths that should have never been up for debate.” 
Top of this list of so-called family-affirming budget provisions was the regressive (and expensive) flat tax proposal that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Ohioans at the expense of the poorest families in our state.

Instead of setting income tax rates based on people’s ability to pay, this special interest group endorsed a system that would enshrine even greater inequity in the tax system (the rich get richer) and force major cuts in income-tax revenue for education, health care, public safety, and more. 
Other proposals highlighted in service to the bogus CCV “pro-family” narrative included amending mandatory religious instruction release time policy in secular public schools to spread the gospel of religious groups, like the Ohio-based LifeWise Academy, on a near-weekly basis. 
The Ohio Senate Republican plan would also require districts to allow LifeWise and other ministries to send participating students back to their home schools with goodies and other materials to distract and drum up business with pliable peers.
Additional budget items touted as “prioritizing the needs of Ohio families over activist interests” involved “requiring transparent abortion reporting, including earlier and more detailed disclosures,” creating a $5 million grant “for ultrasound machines at pregnancy resource centers” that present as health care clinics but “engage in purposely manipulative and deceptive practices that spread misinformation on sexual health and abortion” and the go-to transgender scapegoat of “prohibiting taxpayer funding for gender transition promotion (???) including in youth shelters and mental health services.” 
Their agenda seems to be about dominating political, cultural, and social life, not about serving the least among us with a hand up. 
The CCV’s propaganda on the Ohio Senate budget as “a decisive step toward restoring what matters most: truth, freedom, and the fundamental role of the family in our society” falls apart with hard facts:
The cruel elimination of a Medicaid waiver that would have helped infants and young children access critical health care. The Medicaid trigger language in the Ohio House budget — kept by the Ohio Senate — that would wipe out health insurance for hundreds of thousands of working Ohioans.
It falls apart with indefensible budget cuts that would needlessly cripple the ability to reduce opioid overdoses or prevent kids from being poisoned by toxic lead or get food to hungry Ohio children and families or decrease the state’s unacceptably high infant mortality rates. 
The Center for Christian Virtues embraced legislation that is not pro-family, pro-life, or pro-children in any merciful sense, but is ideologically compatible with its right wing agenda so high-fives all around, right? No matter who gets hurt?

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is pushing to reshape the federal housing safety net by slashing spending and shifting the burden of housing millions of people to states, which may be ill-equipped to handle the mission.
President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners

Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
 Trump’s hopes for next year

The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Cities lead bans on algorithmic rent hikes as states lag behind

Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Lisa Bowman, director of marketing and communications at the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Bowman wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” she wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
 For housing providers, uncertainty is growing

For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesClayton County father of three Arterio Clements said he felt sticker shock after receiving a $400 electric bill while also paying more for other expenses such as homeowner’s insurance.
The 46-year-old Riverdale resident voted Friday for Robert Jones, a former utility executive in California in the Democratic primary for the Georgia Public Service Commission. But he said he will support whoever the Democratic nominee is this fall.
“I can’t believe how much my bill has gone up,” Clements said. “I’m doing everything I can to save money. Nothing’s going to change unless we can send a message (this) election.”
Clements’ frustration is common among many Georgians who have watched state regulators approve a series of Georgia Power rate hikes and sign off on the utility’s increased reliance on fossil fuel sources in recent years.

Even so, turnout has been ultra low in the primary election for a pair of commission races on the ballot this year. After three weeks of early voting, turnout sits at 1% – with about 75,000 voters casting a ballot so far. Tuesday is the last chance to vote in the primaries.
This year’s commission races represent the first time since 2020 that voters will have a chance to change the makeup of the panel. The elections were delayed for several years due to a lawsuit challenging the statewide method for the district-based seats, which plaintiffs argued dilutes the strength of Black voters.
The commissioners have faced criticism for allowing Georgia Power to raise rates by an average of $43 per month since 2023.


Georgians who vote Tuesday will need to choose a Democratic or Republican ballot.
Unsure where your polling place is? You can check here.

Georgia’s polls will be open Tuesday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. for the Republican and Democratic primaries that will decide who will appear on the Nov. 4 ballot.
A runoff will be held July 15 between the top two vote-getters in the Democratic District 3 race if nobody receives more than 50% of votes Tuesday.
The winners of November’s election will begin their term in a year when commissioners are expected to consider requests from Georgia Power to recoup costs from storm damage and overrun fuel costs. These expenses fall outside of the proposed rate freeze announced last month.
On Tuesday’s District 3 Democratic primary ballot, three candidates are vying to challenge Republican Commissioner Fitz Johnson later this year. The Democratic candidates are Keisha Waites, a former Atlanta City Council member and ex-state representative; Peter Hubbard, founder of the clean nonprofit Center for Energy Solutions; and Robert Jones, a former utility executive in California.
Commissioners are normally elected to six-year terms, but the winners in this year’s elections will serve shorter terms to get things back on schedule after the delay. The District 3 winner will be up for election again next year, while the District 2 seat is set to go back up in 2030.
Candidates must live in a given district but are elected statewide, meaning Georgians across the state decide who represents a district on the commission.
In the District 2 Republican primary, incumbent Commissioner Tim Echols is seeking re-election to serve a third term against Lee Muns. The winner of the GOP primary will face Savannah Democrat Alicia M. Johnson in November. District 2 includes a large swath of east Georgia.

The metro Atlanta Democratic primary was upended June 11 when likely frontrunner Daniel Blackman was disqualified for not meeting the commission’s residency requirement. Candidates must live within the boundaries of the district for 12 months to be eligible to run for office.
The ruling means that Blackman’s votes will not be counted, potentially resulting in thousands of ballots being discarded. Voters in Georgia will be notified of Blackman’s eligibility by signs posted in voting precincts Tuesday.
In 2020, Blackman came close to winning a seat on the commission, later going on to serve as the Environmental Protection Agency’s Southeast regional administrator under the Biden administration.
Atlanta’s Joe Hornbuckle said he was aware of Blackman’s ineligibility when he voted Friday in the Democratic primary. The EMT said he’s worried about the long-term damage to the environment if state regulators allow Georgia Power to continue investing in fossil fuel energy sources.
“Why are we still using coal if there’s a way for other options that would be better,” Hornbuckle said. “I’m not the biggest expert on something like this but it makes sense to me.”
Later this summer, the commission will make key decisions on Georgia Power’s plan to invest heavily in fossil fuels and renewable energy to meet what the utility says is its forecasted demand, which is primarily driven by data centers.
Additionally, the commission is set to hold a June hearing on Georgia Power’s request to freeze its base electric rates for the next three years.
Kennesaw State University professor of political science and former Cobb County Republican Party Chair Jason Shepherd said the low turnout is disappointing but understandable, considering the election centers on a utility commission that’s not well known statewide by the average person.
Shepherd said he voted for Echols because of Echols’ efforts to promote the state’s solar and electric vehicle industries.
“Having a market-based view of green energy, rather than having the government force the hand, helps create all the incentives that allow for innovation,” Shepherd said Monday. “In addition, yes, it took forever to get Plant Vogtle online after overrun costs, but it finally happened, and that’s going to secure Georgia’s energy supply for the next several decades.”

(Photos by Christine Sexton and Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)People with developmental and intellectual disabilities (IDD) who rely on Medicaid won’t have to worry about reapplying for services every year.
As part of the budget agreement, legislators agreed to pass SB 2514 which among other things changes the law so that people with these disabilities don’t have to annually prove to the state they remain eligible for the safety net program for poor, elderly and disabled. 
It’s one of a bevy of health care related proposals that legislators agreed to pass in budget conforming bills while meeting in Tallahassee during the extended 2025 session. While the General Appropriations Act or budget is in effect for one year, conforming bills make permanent changes to statutes. Conforming bills include the policy changes legislators say are needed to carry out the intent of the budget.
In addition to the health care conforming bill, there were conforming bills for education, state employees, and the environment. 
Tucked away in SB 2514 were priorities for House Speaker Daniel Perez, others for Senate President Ben Albritton, as well as Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Perez on Monday reminded reporters that IDD-related issues were the reason he ran for the Legislature and have been his top priority since getting elected.
“Someone who has been diagnosed as being permanently disabled should not have to recertify as being permanently disabled every year. Unfortunately, that person isn’t going to be able to move away from that,” the speaker said, while praising Rep. Chase Tramont, a Republican from Port Orange, for championing the issue on behalf of the House.
That change, coupled with a decision to expand statewide a managed care pilot program for people with IDD, are among the biggest accomplishments of the 2025 session, Perez said. The expansion was contained in HB 1103, signed into law earlier this month The Legislature agreed to earmark the money needed to make the expansion possible in the General Appropriations Act.
“When we look back at the successes of this session, we’ll look back at this pilot program as one of our greatest victories. It probably will never be a headline, it’s probably not anything that most people will fundraise off of  or campaign off of. But what I can tell you, I think for me and when I’m long gone and everyone forgets who I am and the names of many people in this chamber, they will remember that we potentially got rid of the wait list (for Medicaid services for people with IDD).”
Albritton used SB 2514 to make a number of changes to state nursing home laws, including requiring facilities to conduct a patient safety and culture surveys at least biennially. These anonymous surveys must be administered by a third party and survey data, including survey participation rates, must be submitted to the state Agency for Health Care Administration.

SB 2514 also requires nursing home facility medical directors to be certified by the American Medical Directors Association or to hold a similar certification by Jan. 1, 2026. The substantive changes are accompanied by $276 million in nursing home rate increases.
Albritton told reporters on Monday the policy changes and spending increases are an effort to make the state’s nursing homes the “envy of the rest of the country.”
“You know, it would be fantastic to get Florida’s nursing home system in Florida so great that people around the country, when they’re thinking about their own relatives, that they first think of Florida. I would love that and that’s really our goal,” he said.
While the Legislature may have been at odds with the governor in recent months over immigration, spending, and tax relief, the Legislature did give the governor aone of his health care priorities by signing off on a plan to fund a new five-year $30 million research incubators for pediatric cancer research and clinical trials. 
The bill also establishes parameters for the existing cancer innovation fund and authorizes money for comprehensive community cancer programs, which are typically hospital-based and manage a high volume of cancer cases, plus integrated network cancer programs which involve multiple facilities within a hospital network that offer integrated cancer services. 
The Legislature did not, however, sign off on other changes to cancer funding, including diverting cancer funds away from National Cancer Institute-designated centers. 
The House and Senate passed SB 2514 unanimously.

Education changes
Lawmakers changed the definition of a persistently low-performing school, expanding how many traditional public schools could have a charter School of Hope co-located inside of it. SB 2510 expands which schools may be deemed persistently low-performing by including those that have been in the bottom 10% of third grade English or fourth grade math for two of three years. In 2023-2024, there were 51 persistently low-performing schools. 
Existing law relies on schools’ overall grade, classifying them as persistently low-performing if it has three years graded lower than “C” during a five-year span. 
The idea was floated but unsuccessful as its own bill during the session. HB 1267 passed the House on party lines; however, the Senate never took it up. And senators weren’t pleased to discover the issue had been included in the budget legislation after voting it down.
Sen. Rosalind Osgood expressed concern about traditional public schools taking on the expenses of the Schools of Hope. 
“If I was on the public school board right now, I would kind of feel a little pressure that my funding in other places could disappear if I don’t go along to get along,” Osgood said. 
The conforming bill eliminates weighted funding for advanced placement and dual enrollment courses and establishes the Academic Acceleration Options Supplement as a categorical fund, leaving the amount of funding for the courses largely unchanged from current levels. 
This would give schools funding based on its student population enrolled in such courses at the same level but through a different mechanism. 
The Florida Education Association said the new way to distribute aids in “reducing transparency and potentially restricting district flexibility in how those funds are used.”
Previously, there was a proposal to lower state funding for those courses, but legislators said constituent feedback prompted maintaining the funding. 
The conforming bill passed the Senate 25-9 and the House 80-24.
Florida A&M University named a new president last month. Her salary has been a point of contention, with the school’s foundation questioning whether it will fund its obligation toward the contract. 
Legislators intervened, including in proviso language allowing FAMU trustees to spend money otherwise unavailable for paying the presidential salary. State law otherwise only allows state funds to pay for the first $200,000 of a president’s salary. Marva Johnson, the new president, opposed by many in the FAMU community, is set to make about $840,000 in her first year and up to about $981,000 in her final year of the contract. 
State group health insurance
Legislators agreed to give state employees a 2% pay raise in the budget and also to not raise state employee health insurance premiums in the coming year. While that will sit well with state employees, there could be a change in the coming year that Florida employees don’t like.
To help keep costs down in the state group health insurance program, legislators also agreed to include in HB 5015 a mandate for the  Department of Management Services (DMS) to  implement a pharmaceutical formulary, effective for the 2026 policy year, potentially narrowing available medicines.
HB 5015 does make clear that DMS is required to submit its formulary recommendations to the Legislative Budget Commission by Sept. 1.  Additionally, that panel must approve the recommendations for them to take effect. 
“We can think it’s a good plan and bring it in for a landing or reject it,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Ed Hooper, R-Clearwater, said when asked about the drug formulary last week.
DMS’ recommendations must include a list of prescription drugs and supplies recommended for the formulary and a comparison of the coverage for the 2025 benefit year. The recommendations must contain a list of prescription drugs and supplies that will require prior authorization. Additionally, the DMS recommendations must spell out any proposed “step therapy” requirements for prescription drugs or supplies. 
Step therapy is a cost-containment approach that requires people to try more affordable drugs when therapeutically appropriate. The approach also is called “fail first” because patients can’t use more costly alternative prescription drugs unless they try the less expensive medication first and those medications fail.
HB 5015 passed  the Senate by a 25-9 vote and the House by a 98-5 vote.

A federal grand jury last week indicted Robert Davis Forney, of Duluth, Georgia, for allegedly leaving voicemails at Fischer’s office and Cruz’s. Prosecutors say he threatened “sexual violence” against both senators, Fischer on Jan. 10 and Cruz on Jan. 9. Authorities say Forney left multiple voicemails threatening “sexual violence” against Cruz and his family.
“Threatening our elected officials and their families is an act of violence that undermines our entire democracy,” said U.S. Attorney Theodore S. Hertzberg, who oversees federal prosecutions in north Georgia. “Political discourse and disagreements never justify resorting to vile attacks against our nation’s leaders.”
The Justice Department prosecution comes on the heels of the successful manhunt that ended Sunday for a Minnesota man who allegedly assassinated a Minnesota lawmaker and shot another. 
The increase in political violence follows a 2024 in which violent threats against lawmakers reached a record high for the second consecutive year.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, survived two assassination attempts during his bid to return to the White House. This year, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, had an arsonist attack the Governor’s Mansion, and two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed in Washington, D.C. 
Fischer offered no immediate comment Monday on the indictment. The FBI and the U.S. Capitol Police are investigating the incidents, according to the release. 
Congressional staffers in recent years have reported increases in the number of angry calls from the public. Most calls from the public to congressional representatives and senators are answered by young staffers who are often college-aged. 
Staffers at the Nebraska Capitol have similarly complained about the increased vitriol from callers during recent debates about legislation seeking to change how the state awards its Electoral College votes for president, proposals for stricter abortion bans and limits on health care for transgender young people.

What college sports isn’t saying out loud,Christine Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/17/the-end-of-amateurism-what-college-sports-isnt-saying-out-loud/,College sports have abandoned amateurism. The question now is whether it will also abandon the people it claims to be about.,"College sports is no longer in transition—it’s in freefall.
The recent flurry of headlines about NIL clearinghouses, NCAA commissions, and backdoor conference deals paint a picture of progress. But what they actually reveal is a coordinated exit from the idea of amateurism —by the very institutions that once swore to protect it.
They’re the coaches, athletic directors, university presidents, and power brokers who now vote, without apology, for a system that mimics professional sports but in an arena whose tenets are founded in education and personal transformation and growth. The public is being sold a narrative of modernization and opportunity. But what’s really happening is far more cynical: the gutting of college athletics’ last remaining principles in favor of money, control, and selective accountability.
College sports have always occupied a strange middle ground. Not quite professional, not quite amateur. But the balancing act is breaking down. NCAA President Charlie Baker’s recent comments signaled a quiet surrender: the idea that the NCAA must “cede” control to institutions and third parties isn’t just bureaucratic repositioning, it is philosophical.
So let’s call it what it is. This is not about fairness. It’s not about athletes’ rights. It’s about replicating the power structure of pro sports —with none of the legal protections for the players.
Five questions that should make everyone squirm

 Who is really driving the elimination of amateurism?Everyone assumes this is a player-led revolution. But athletes didn’t write the policy shifts. They didn’t vote in boardrooms. Athletic directors, coaches, conference executives, and university presidents did. These are the same people who for decades insisted amateurism was sacred. Now, they’re building new models that depend on third-party money and semi-professional structures. So who’s really steering the ship?
 Why are we building a system that mirrors pro sports—but without the paychecks, unions, or labor rights?The system taking shape looks a lot like pro sports—with one key difference: these athletes are still technically students. NIL collectives, transfer free agency, and pay-for-play deals mimic the market-driven ecosystem of the pros. But the infrastructure—academic calendars, NCAA oversight, institutional governance—hasn’t caught up. What happens when those two worlds collide?
 Is anyone truly fighting for amateurism anymore?We hear a lot of indignation about the loss of tradition. But are there actual advocates inside these institutions putting their votes and policy behind the preservation of amateur play? Or is everyone quietly pivoting while using “student-athlete” as a convenient rhetorical shield? The old amateur model was flawed. No question. But let’s not pretend this is purely progress. The transformation we’re witnessing could create deeper inequities, encourage even more commercialism, and hollow out the academic mission of college sports altogether. Are we ready for that trade-off? 
 What’s left for athletes who aren’t in the Power Five?Most of the media attention is on Power Five football and men’s basketball. But the NCAA oversees hundreds of smaller programs that don’t have million-dollar budgets or media deals. Should the same rules and assumptions apply across all divisions? Are we about to impose a semi-pro model on programs that still operate on volunteerism and limited scholarships? Or worse, are we quietly writing off entire divisions and demographics as collateral damage?
 Who’s going to speak up before this all crashes?University leaders aren’t going to. They’re too busy managing PR. Coaches won’t—this system now lets them buy championships. Conference execs? They’re negotiating like agents without the title. If athletes don’t have legal representation and public advocacy, they will continue to be tokens in a game they didn’t design.

Five ways this system fails athletes

 It commodifies them without representing them.The money pouring into college sports is real—but so is the absence of guardrails. Athletes are now revenue generators without contracts, without collective bargaining, and without safety nets. This isn’t equity. It’s the worst kind of market exposure.
 It punishes loyalty and rewards chaos.Every incentive now pushes athletes to leave, jump, chase money. Relationships, development, and long-term growth are being replaced by short-term deals and shallow transactions. That might work for the schools—but it’s toxic for the players.
 It creates legal gray zones with real consequences.No employee classification. No labor law protections. No consistency in NIL enforcement. And when something goes wrong—when a deal collapses or a school pulls an offer—guess who’s left to clean it up? Not the schools. Not the NCAA. Not the new commission. The same fall guy: the athlete.
 It decimates opportunity in smaller programs.We’re already seeing schools cut sports to chase competitiveness in one or two big-name programs. This doesn’t expand opportunity. It narrows it. And it does so disproportionately—hurting women’s sports, Olympic sports, and underserved communities the most.
 It sells players a dream and gives them a job —with no benefits.This is perhaps the most galling part: the system still markets itself as aspirational. Education. Experience. Exposure. But the reality? It’s work. Grueling, public, high-stakes work—without pay, protection, or power.

What now?
If you care about athletes, the answer is not to go back to the old amateurism model. That ship has sailed, and it wasn’t fair to begin with. But the solution isn’t to build a new model that looks like pro sports without any of the rights that pro athletes fought for.
What we need is honesty. Honesty from institutions about what they’ve chosen. Honesty from policymakers about whether they’re willing to regulate this before the wreckage is permanent.
We need a new framework that does more than redistribute money. It must recognize the athlete as a stakeholder, not a pawn. That means legal rights. Employment protections. Transparent governance. Real representation.
Because here’s the truth: college sports have already abandoned amateurism. The question now is whether it will also abandon the people it claims to be about.
Athletes deserve more than headlines. They deserve someone in the room fighting for what’s right, not just what’s profitable.

Ned Lamont will sign Connecticut’s ambitious housing bill, HB 5002, because it would help overcome a legacy of redlining and increase housing equity and affordability for all Connecticut residents.
Our nation and the state of Connecticut confront a housing shortage and high costs due to decades of underinvestment and exclusive zoning which has restricted housing supply and increased costs for all households but particularly for modest income ones that often pay an unsustainable 30 percent and more of their monthly income for housing.

Josh Silver
We got to this point because of an ugly history of racism and segregation that plagued most communities in our country. In the 1930s, the federal government commissioned the creation of maps, using the insights of the housing and lending industries, that classified neighborhoods by risk and the chances that borrowers would default on their loans. These maps all too often classified African-American neighborhoods and those populated by Jews and other Eastern European immigrants as too risky for lending. These were color coded red – hence the name redlining. Over the ensuing decades, these neighborhoods received few loans, contributing to decay and abandonment of the housing stock.
Andrew Kahrl, in his book Free the Beaches, documents how redlining and other forms of discrimination such as covenants against selling homes to African Americans contributed to literally cornering African Americans to certain neighborhoods in Hartford and other cities in Connecticut. For example, the North End in Hartford experienced a rise of slumlords and unhealthy housing infested by rats and incubation centers of tuberculosis and other diseases.
Today, the legacy of redlining remains substandard housing disproportionately impacting communities of color and dramatic racial disparities in wealth significantly due to disparities in homeownership among whites and people of color.
Connecticut HB 5002 represents an opportunity to not only atone for this discrimination but also to provide everyone with a chance for a better quality of life and wealth building through higher rates of homeownership. This benefits all of us since poorly housed populations would then become healthier and increase their economic activity, resulting in a more prosperous economy for everyone.
HB 5002 would require towns to create specified numbers of additional housing, including for low- and moderate-income households, based on calculations of need and housing scarcity. Certain zoning requirements would be eased if jurisdictions wanted to build higher density housing. Minimum parking requirements would be eased. Allowance for more housing types including duplexes and small multifamily housing developments would combat decades of exclusionary zoning that only allowed single family housing and restricted the housing supply.
If the governor signs the bill, these provisions will help increase the housing supply and bolster integration. What stakeholders also need to consider is how to apply the incentives under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in innovative ways. Congress passed CRA and President Jimmy Carter signed CRA in 1977 to combat redlining by requiring banks to serve all communities, including low- and moderate-income ones. Banks receive ratings or grades based on how many loans, investments, and services they offer in modest income communities. 
In my recently published book, I describe how CRA provides incentives for banks to partner with cities and counties to embark on affordable housing and community development. For example, Bank of America and PNC recently committed to investing $100 million in formerly redlined neighborhoods in Baltimore.
Connecticut towns could approach banks and figure out how to combine public subsidies with bank loans and investments to build new affordable housing developments and rehabilitate existing housing stock. State and local low down payment programs for homeownership could be better coordinated with bank mortgage lending to expand upon homeownership opportunities for those that have been underserved. Jurisdictions could develop housing plans that not only specify the numbers of additional homeowner and rental units but also how these would be funded.
It is time for bold plans. Segregation and redlining have contributed to polarization, distrust, and economic stagnation. Embracing a new future of integration and mutual aid will make for a more prosperous and harmonious state. Governor Lamont should make this his message in a grand bill signing ceremony.

The GOP-led Legislature approved a $115.1 billion budget for the next fiscal year, plus a $1.3 billion tax cut package, nearing midnight on Monday after a tumultuous and unusually long legislative session.
The final votes came more than six weeks after the scheduled end of the typically 60-day session and just two weeks ahead of the July 1 beginning of the new fiscal year, as legislative leaders wrangled over the state’s spending pace and dueling tax cut proposals.
“In my knowledge, there’s been no other process of a budget like this year,” said Senate Budget Chair Ed Hooper. “We are in Day 105. We have had shouting matches; we have had finger-pointing with our friends across the rotunda. We’ve had discussions, but at the end of the day, we sat down and we got a deal.”
Lawmakers are celebrating that the 2025-26 budget is $3.5 billion smaller than this year’s and half a billion less than Gov. Ron DeSantis’ proposal. The Senate unanimously voted for the budget, whereas two Democrats in the House voted against it.
Done deal: Florida legislators reach budget, tax agreements

Who’s getting what in tax cuts?
When it came to taxes, the legislative leaders settled on a package, 70% of which will go toward permanently eliminating the sales tax on commercial leases. Eliminating the tax on business rents — Florida is the only state that has such a tax — is projected to lower revenue by $904.8 million.
Other tax exemptions that will benefit businesses include full repeal of the aviation fuel tax, reducing cardroom taxes by 2%, and exempting NASCAR Championship Race tickets from taxes. The tax package unveiled Friday also makes recurring sales tax exemptions for back-to-school items during August, some supplies for hurricane preparation year-round, and state park admissions, among other items.
Overall, the tax package lawmakers approved represented a departure from the proposals that led to the breakdown in budget talks during the regular session. House Speaker Daniel Perez on March 26 dropped the big idea of permanently lowering sales taxes by .75%, saving taxpayers nearly $5 billion annually. In response, Senate President Ben Albritton put forward a plan to exempt taxes on clothing under $75.
Both leaders rejected the notion that the final package didn’t deliver as big of savings for Floridians as their original ideas.
“I don’t think it’s fair to minimize the major expansion and creating the recurring nature of the back-to-school and the disaster,” Albritton said, referring to those sales tax exemptions. “Those are two things that Florida families see huge value in.”

Perez had criticized the governor for touting sales tax holidays as the feud between the two escalated earlier in the year.
“We’re passing the largest recurring tax cut in the history of the state of Florida, that was the goal of the House,” he said, saying that his plan to permanently lower sales taxes would have been just one way of achieving the goal.
Not only does eliminating the business rent tax strengthen the economy, it directly helps Floridians who own shops, the legislative leaders told reporters ahead of the vote Monday night.
“When I think of eliminating the business rent tax, I think about the mom and pop locks in the shop, that is who we are helping,” Perez said. “It’s very easy to judge the conclusion that you’re helping a Walmart, for example. No, what you’re helping is, you’re helping small businesses.”
While the tax package drew bipartisan support, an association representing local governments asked the lawmakers Friday to maintain the revenue stream for counties. Seven Democrats in the House and two in the Senate voted against the tax package.
“The majority of these local option taxes were voted on via referendum by the local citizens, including local business owners, to fulfill important needs ot the local community like local transportation, and local hospitals, and other critical infrastructure,” said Jeff Scala, deputy director of the Florida Association of Counties.
Still, Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman, who voted against the tax cut deal, said most of the savings benefited businesses over Floridians.
“We’re not putting any new, great ideas in here to really help the individual citizens in the state of Florida,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Saving for potential recession
Since lawmakers returned to Tallahassee to hash out the budget, they have emphasized a plan to stash $1.5 billion over the next two fiscal years in the Budget Stabilization Fund to weather a potential recession.
Although Hooper and Albritton had expressed that the emergency fund could help Florida get through the looming federal funding cuts, the Senate leader took a more reserved tone on Monday, saying that he supports President Donald Trump’s approach to rein in federal spending.
Democrats had argued during budget talks that if the state would soon need to shore up more funds to pay for Medicaid, food assistance programs, and emergencies, putting the money in a restricted fund would make it more difficult to navigate those changes.
Lawmakers last dipped into the Budget Stabilization Fund, which now contains $4.4 billion, during the Great Recession.
Other budget deets


The budget includes a 2% raise for state employees, with a minimum increase per worker of $1,000.
In the education silo, the budget increased by $945 million, and 71% of that new money will be funded by local property taxes. The increased reliance on local property taxes comes amid a push from the governor’s office to eliminate property taxes, with lawmakers agreeing to fund a study on the effects of repealing the tax.
The K-12 education budget is $34.6 billion, with $20.9 billion funded by state and federal funds, while the remainder is up to local governments. The higher education budget totals $11.7 billion, of which $8.9 billion is state and federal funds.
Jewish day schools and public schools will get $20 million each to harden security. The budget includes $637.7 million for the Bright Futures scholarship program and no college tuition increase.
As part of the K-12 agreement, the chambers compromised on allocating an extra $101.6 million toward teacher salary increases statewide, targeting an area Florida has lagged in.
The budget includes more than $120 million for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for the citrus industry, including $104.5 million for research.
In the final budget deal, Albritton compromised on funding two food grant programs through FDACS, securing $38 million for food bank infrastructure and for farmers to grow food for those food banks. However, that was $12 million less than what he originally wanted.

Mike Lee is facing criticism from a number of Minnesota politicians after appearing to make a joke about the suspect accused of shooting two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, claiming it was the result of “Marxism.”
That outcry includes several state Republican lawmakers, who pushed back on Lee’s attempt to connect the alleged shooter to Democrats. The chair of the state’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party called Lee “one of the most dishonorable senators in American history.” Minnesota Democratic Sens. Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar said the joke was inappropriate and “fuels this hatred and misinformation.” U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison, a Democrat representing the west metro, said Lee’s comments represented “the watershed moment where things need to change.”
Vance Boelter was arrested Sunday night, suspected of the murder of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home. Charging documents allege Boelter wounded state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in a separate shooting. Police say Boelter had a “hit list” of dozens Democratic elected officials and abortion clinics. He’s facing several charges, including first-degree murder.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the shootings “an act of targeted political violence”; law enforcement cautioned against drawing hasty conclusions about motive during a Sunday briefing.
Lee, who posts frequently on his personal X account, took to social media on Sunday, claiming Boelter has ties to Democrats and liberal politics.
“Nightmare on Waltz Street,” Lee wrote, attempting to connect Boelter to Walz, with his name misspelled. Lee’s post featured two images of Boelter, including one taken from the crime scene.
Boelter was initially appointed to a Workforce Development Council by former Democratic Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton in 2016, then reappointed in 2019 by Walz. Minnesota state government is home to hundreds of nonpartisan boards and commissions, and an appointment often only requires volunteering.
“My plumber is connected to me and my wife. That doesn’t mean we have anything to do with his other activities,” wrote Minnesota state Rep. Walter Hudson, a Republican from Albertville, in a social media post, arguing “this has nothing to do with Governor Walz.”
Lee also made two other posts tying Boelter to “Marxism,” the political philosophy serving as the foundation for communism that’s often used by Trump-aligned conservatives to insult Democrats. That includes a post featuring the same image from the crime scene that read “This is what happens … When Marxists don’t get their way.”
Lee’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

Lee, a prolific poster, made the comments on Sunday morning around 9 a.m. on his personal account on X, where he is known to be more inflammatory.
Hours later, at 2:30 p.m., Lee posted from his official U.S. Senate account, where he typically takes a more measured tone, writing “These hateful attacks have no place in Utah, Minnesota, or anywhere in America.”
“Please join me in condemning this senseless violence, and praying for the victims and their families,” the post reads.
The Utah senator has since faced widespread backlash for his comments, including calls for his resignation. Critics have pointed out that Boelter was targeting Democrats, that his “hit list” included abortion clinics, and that his roommate told reporters Boelter was a Trump voter.
“Senator Lee’s heinous lies have only made the pain that Melissa’s loved ones and colleagues are going through even worse. Using Melissa’s murder to spread these lies is an act of evil that will cement his legacy as one of the most dishonorable senators in American history,” said Richard Carlbom, chair of the Minnesota DFL, in a statement to Utah News Dispatch.


“I wanted him to hear from me directly about how painful that was, and how brutal it was, to see that on what was just a horribly brutal weekend,” Smith later told reporters.
“He didn’t say a lot, frankly. I think he was a bit stunned.”

Smith, the junior Minnesota senator, confronted Lee in Congress on Monday, telling him his comments were “brutal and cruel.”
“He should think about the implications of what he’s saying and doing. It just further fuels this hatred and misinformation,” she said, according to CNN. “I wanted him to hear from me directly how painful that was and how brutal that was to see that on what was just a horribly brutal weekend.”
Smith said Lee “didn’t say a lot. Frankly, I think he was a bit stunned. … He certainly didn’t promise to take it down or say anything publicly about it. … He seemed kind of surprised to be confronted.”
Speaking on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Monday, Klobuchar said she also plans to confront Lee.
“What I’m going to tell him is this isn’t funny what happened here. This is an incredible woman,” she said, adding that “there was no Father’s Day” for Hortman’s children.
“I’ll tell him about the law enforcement that did incredible work here,” Klobuchar continued. “That’s what I’m going to tell Sen. Lee when I get back to Washington today. Because this is not a laughing matter and certainly what we are seeing in increasing violence and this evil man who did this, this is not a joke.”
Morrison, a first term congresswoman, took to X on Monday accusing Lee of promoting “dangerous and harmful rhetoric we need everyone to call out and condemn.”
“This is the watershed moment where things need to change,” Morrison said, urging Democrats and Republicans to condemn Lee’s remarks.
“This was posted one day after my friend — one of Minnesota’s elected representatives — and her husband were assassinated in a politically-motivated attack. One day after another elected representative and his wife took 17 bullets from the assassin,” she said. “We cannot accept this from a sitting United States Senator.”
Minnesota state Rep. Nolan West, a Republican from Blaine, posted to X that he has “tremendous respect” for Lee.
“But it doesn’t mean he is immune from the base impulses social media incentivizes. People say stupid stuff on the internet all the time. The best they can do is admit they shouldn’t have and be better,” he wrote.
Speaking on the Senate floor Monday, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, said he was “deeply disappointed” in Lee, accusing him of taking “cheap political shots at the other side.” Lee’s comments, Schumer said, risk “escalating a perilous moment.”
“What the senior senator from Utah posted after the shooting was reckless and beneath the dignity of his office,” Schumer said. “For a senator to fan the flames of division with falsities while the killer was still on the loose is deeply irresponsible. He should take down his post immediately and apologize to the families of the victims.”

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate 02/28/2023)The Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality is fining one of South Arkansas’ bromine producers for Clean Air Act violations after a company it hired didn’t actually complete reported leak detection inspections for 10 months.
Lanxess, formerly Great Lakes Chemical Corporation, has agreed to pay the division $27,000 in civil penalties, according to a consent administrative order posted online. A DEQ inspection last year of the company’s South and Central plants in Union County found it had not been following federal air pollution rules regarding monitoring for leaks from its chemical production units at those plants. Lanxess neither admitted to nor denied the “factual and legal allegations” in the consent order. 
According to an inspection report filed by DEQ inspectors, the manager of the plants, Kevin Hazen, contacted the regulator’s headquarters in North Little Rock last February to report that Alliance Technical Group, a firm hired by Lanxess to conduct leak detection and repair (LDAR) inspections, had “failed to conduct approximately 10 months of LDAR readings” between January and October of 2023. 
The company became aware of the issue in October 2023, documents from DEQ show. It notified the state regulators in February 2024.
The latest consent order comes after Lanxess was fined $68,520 in August 2023 by DEQ over leak detection violations, after Lanxess reported that certain components in some of its production units — including some listed in the 2025 consent order — had been listed as “out-of-service” for an undetermined period of time. The division and the company entered into a consent order alleging that Lanxess failed to maintain equipment leak records.
“Unfortunately, about 10 months of LDAR readings were not conducted due to the Alliance staff not performing them,” wrote Demetria Kimbrough, the head of DEQ’s air office, in a February 2024 email to colleagues summarizing Hazen’s verbal report to the division.

A voicemail requesting comment directed to the Alliance office in Little Rock was not returned.
A Lanxess audit of “invalid” inspections supposedly conducted by Alliance during the timeframe reported examining the time between inspections “to evaluate if the rate of inspections was realistic given the analyzer response time and distance between components.” The audit found that the “time between inspections was often only a few seconds, providing further indication that these inspections were invalid.”
Specifically, DEQ is fining Lanxess for “failing to conduct accurate GPS coordinate logging of LDAR monitoring.” The Clean Air Act has a variety of leak detection provisions for different industries and processes that can introduce pollutants into the air. These requirements are incorporated into the permits obtained by facilities like Lanxess’ bromine production plants in Union County.
The affected processes that had deficient leak inspections included methyl bromide production equipment, oligomer production equipment, phosgene production equipment, dibromostyrene production equipment, PHT-4 production equipment, polydibromostyrene production equipment and tribromophenol production equipment found at the Lanxess Central and Lanxess South plants. Many of the chemicals are used in flame retardants.
Lanxess’ operations have been beset by run-ins with environmental regulators, having been assessed hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties by Arkansas regulators over the last decade for violations of water and air pollution regulations at its bromine production facilities.

Gov. Mike Dunleavy has vetoed a bill that would have increased the transparency of the state’s tax-audit process, citing legal concerns.
As written, Senate Bill 183 would have required the executive branch to provide reports to the Legislature’s auditors “in the form or format requested” requested by legislators.
That bit of arcane statutory work was required, legislators said, because the Alaska Department of Revenue under Dunleavy has stopped providing reports that illuminate the work of Revenue auditors who deal with disputes over oil and gas taxes.
“They cooperated in the past,” said Sen. Elvi Gray-Jackson, D-Anchorage and chair of the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee. “Before Gov. Dunleavy, they have cooperated. It’s just crazy, and the issue matters because there could be billions of dollars in potential oil and gas tax revenue that we aren’t getting, that we should be getting.” 
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, is chair of the powerful Senate Rules Committee, which sponsored SB 183. 
“The real question is, what is he hiding?” Wielechowski said of the governor. 
“Why is he going to such lengths to hide information from the people of Alaska? That is the real question that needs to be answered here and I hope that we’re able to get to the bottom of this, because this is potentially hundreds of millions of dollars that we have lost,” Wielechowski said.
Gray-Jackson had similar comments on Monday.
“Accountability suffers when we, the Legislature — and by extension, the public that we represent — cannot see clearly how state revenues are tracked and how they’re assessed or collected,” she said. “Come on now, Governor.”
The leaders of the House and Senate viewed SB 183 as so important that they wrote a letter to the governor, asking him to not veto it. 
“This letter accompanies the bill not as a routine legislative communication, but as a reflection of the extraordinary nature of the circumstances we face,” it read. “The ongoing obstructions by the DOR must not be allowed to become a precedent for future administrations. We must reinforce, not erode, the norms of oversight and accountability that are vital to Alaska’s republican form of government.”
State legislators passed SB 183 by a combined vote of 59-10-1 earlier this year. Forty votes would be needed in a joint session of the House and Senate to override the governor’s decision.
Already, lawmakers are planning to vote on an override of the governor’s decision to veto millions of dollars in education funding.
That vote is not expected to take place until lawmakers reconvene their regular session in January.
Wielechowski, a member of the Senate majority caucus leadership, said SB 183 will “absolutely, yes, 100%” be a subject of an override vote as well.
The governor’s office declined to comment on the veto beyond the formal letter to the Legislature that accompanies every veto.
In that letter, the governor writes that he believes SB 183 “would enact a sweeping and likely unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority” to the Legislature’s audit committee and auditor.
“The Alaska Supreme Court has long held that a grant by the Legislature of a sweeping discretionary mandate without guidance or limitation is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power,” the letter states.
Wielechowski said he’s not sure what the governor meant by that. SB 183 was written with the guidance of legislative attorneys who know the Alaska Supreme Court’s case law.
“I have not had any indication that they thought there were any constitutional issues with it,” he said of the bill.
Gray-Jackson said she sees the Legislature’s powers as clear.
“The (Alaska) Constitution and the state statutes give the Legislature authority to audit executive branch agencies so that we can ensure that public funds are properly managed,” she said. “The auditor relies on these agencies in order to get the information that she needs.”
Asked whether the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee might now sue over access to the audit records that inspired SB 183, Gray-Jackson said she couldn’t answer that question until she spoke with the Legislature’s attorneys.

Mike Lee is facing criticism from a number of Minnesota politicians after appearing to make a joke about the suspect accused of shooting two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, claiming it was the result of “Marxism.” 
That outcry includes the chairman of the state’s Democratic Party, who called Lee “one of the most dishonorable senators in American history;” Minnesota Democrat Sens. Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar, who said the joke was inappropriate and “fuels this hatred and misinformation;”; Minnesota Rep. Kelly Morrison, also a Democrat, who said Lee’s comments represented “the watershed moment where things need to change;” and several state Republican lawmakers, who pushed back on Lee’s attempt to connect the alleged shooter to Democrats. 
Vance Boelter was arrested Sunday night, suspected of the murder of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home. Boelter allegedly wounded state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in a separate shooting. Police say Boelter had a “hit list” of 45 Democrat elected officials. He’s facing several charges, including first-degree murder.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the shootings “an act of targeted political violence,” although police have yet to publicly announce Boelter’s motive.  
Lee, who posts frequently on his personal X account, took to social media on Sunday, claiming Boelter has ties to Democrats and liberal politics. 
“Nightmare on Waltz Street,” Lee wrote, attempting to connect Boelter to Walz, with his name misspelled. Lee’s post featured two images of Boelter, including one taken from the crime scene. 
Boelter was initially appointed to a Workforce Development Council by former Democratic Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton in 2016, then reappointed in 2019 by Walz, according to the Minnesota Reformer. 
“My plumber is connected to me and my wife. That doesn’t mean we have anything to do with his other activities,” wrote Minnesota state Rep. Walter Hudson, a Republican from Albertville, in a social media post, arguing “this has nothing to do with Governor Walz.” 
Lee also made two other posts tying Boelter to “Marxism,” the political philosophy serving as the foundation for communism that’s often used by Trump-aligned conservatives to insult Democrats. That includes a post featuring the same image from the crime scene that read “This is what happens … When Marxists don’t get their way.” 
Lee’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. 
Members of Congress on edge after assassination of Minnesota state legislator

Lee, a prolific poster, made the comments on Sunday morning around 9 a.m. on his personal account on X, where he is known to be more inflammatory.

Hours later, at 2:30 p.m., Lee posted from his official U.S. Senate account, where he typically takes a more measured tone, writing “These hateful attacks have no place in Utah, Minnesota, or anywhere in America.”
“Please join me in condemning this senseless violence, and praying for the victims and their families,” the post reads. 
The Utah senator has since faced widespread backlash for his comments, including calls for his resignation. Critics have pointed out that Boelter was targeting Democrats, that his “hit list” included abortion clinics, and that his roommate told reporters Boelter was a Trump voter. 
“Senator Lee’s heinous lies have only made the pain that Melissa’s loved ones and colleagues are going through even worse. Using Melissa’s murder to spread these lies is an act of evil that will cement his legacy as one of the most dishonorable senators in American history,” said Richard Carlbom, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party, in a statement to Utah News Dispatch. 
Smith, the junior Minnesota senator, confronted Lee in Congress on Monday, telling him his comments were “brutal and cruel.”
“He should think about the implications of what he’s saying and doing. It just further fuels this hatred and misinformation,” she said, according to CNN. “I wanted him to hear from me directly how painful that was and how brutal that was to see that on what was just a horribly brutal weekend.”
Smith said Lee “didn’t say a lot. Frankly, I think he was a bit stunned. … He certainly didn’t promise to take it down or say anything publicly about it. … He seemed kind of surprised to be confronted.”

Speaking on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Monday, Klobuchar said she also plans to confront Lee.
“What I’m going to tell him is this isn’t funny what happened here. This is an incredible woman,” she said, adding that “there was no Father’s Day” for Hortman’s children. 
“I’ll tell him about the law enforcement that did incredible work here,” Klobuchar continued. “That’s what I’m going to tell Sen. Lee when I get back to Washington today. Because this is not a laughing matter and certainly what we are seeing in increasing violence and this evil man who did this, this is not a joke.” 
Morrison, a first term congresswoman, took to X on Monday accusing Lee of promoting “dangerous and harmful rhetoric we need everyone to call out and condemn.” 
“This is the watershed moment where things need to change,” Morrison said, urging Democrats and Republicans to condemn Lee’s remarks. 
“This was posted one day after my friend — one of Minnesota’s elected representatives — and her husband were assassinated in a politically-motivated attack. One day after another elected representative and his wife took 17 bullets from the assassin,” she said. “We cannot accept this from a sitting United States Senator.” 
Minnesota state Rep. Nolan West, a Republican from Blaine, posted to X that he has “tremendous respect” for Lee. 
“But it doesn’t mean he is immune from the base impulses social media incentivizes. People say stupid stuff on the internet all the time. The best they can do is admit they shouldn’t have and be better,” he wrote. 
Speaking on the Senate floor Monday, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, said he was “deeply disappointed” in Lee, accusing him of taking “cheap political shots at the other side.” Lee’s comments, Schumer said, risk “escalating a perilous moment.” 
“What the senior senator from Utah posted after the shooting was reckless and beneath the dignity of his office,” Schumer said. “For a senator to fan the flames of division with falsities while the killer was still on the loose is deeply irresponsible. He should take down his post immediately and apologize to the families of the victims.”

Despite the bill’s sweeping reforms, it leaves many tasks undone for future years, including figuring out the contours of future consolidated school districts.

MONTPELIER—The Vermont Legislature on Monday passed the year’s landmark education reform package, setting in motion years of transformation to the state’s public school and property tax systems. 
H.454 would radically alter Vermont’s education funding and governance landscape over several years, consolidating school districts and shifting the balance of power over district budgets from the local to the state level. 
Despite months of contentious debates and moments when the entire package looked bound for failure, the final vote was anticlimactic. House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, announced the vote the chamber was considering, and when no one immediately stood up to begin debate, she called the vote by voice. That meant individual members did not have their position tallied, and no rank-and-file members spoke for or against the legislation on the floor before the vote. 
After the ‘yeas’ and ‘nays’ rang out, representatives appeared surprised by what they’d just done. 
Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, stood up in disappointment.
“I’m a little shocked actually at the speed that that vote was called,” he said. 
Though the legislation proposes generational change, the bill is replete with caveats and contingencies, requiring years of further work until the biggest transitions begin in 2028. Among the most significant moves, H.454 would start to create a new education funding formula, impose class-size minimums and reimagine income-sensitive property tax relief. 
While Gov. Phil Scott has said the bill will save “hundreds of millions,” the exact financial implications are impossible to predict without knowing what future school districts will look like. The bill’s supporters insist it will bring stability to districts and bend the cost curve that’s caused property taxes to rise rapidly in recent years.

Earlier in the day, the Senate had passed H.454 despite most of the chamber’s Democratic caucus voting in opposition. In the Senate — and later in the House — the bill survived attempts to kill it on procedural grounds.
After the House’s voice vote, Krowinski allowed representatives to stand and discuss the bill after the fact. 
For his district in Barre, Rep. Teddy Waszazak, D-Barre City, said H.454 would transform public schools for the better by bringing the district’s funding more in line with the state’s average.
“The status quo is killing us,” he said.
Rep. Leanne Harple, D-Glover, a teacher, stood to express her “unapologetic” opposition to the bill she said would lead to the closure of small rural schools. 
“I’ve heard the word equity to justify this bill, but I believe that word is being misused,” she said. “There is nothing equitable about putting a child on the bus for two hours a day.”
The bill drew ire from the associations representing Vermont’s education community, and over the weekend, superintendents and school board members went public with their opposition.
In an interview, Don Tinney, president of the state teacher union VT-NEA, criticized how H.454 consolidated power in Montpelier.
“I think that we know that the best decisions for students are made by people who know their students,” the union leader said. “Our local school boards currently make those budget decisions, policy decisions for kids within their community, and so the centralization of power within the education system to Montpelier gives real cause for concern.”

Tinney argued the state doesn’t need to change how much it pays for education, but rather how it levies taxes. To that effect, the teachers union has called for funding schools with an income tax rather than a property tax, an idea that received little air time this year. 
“I would ask any policymaker, any legislator to spend a week in the school, to substitute in classes, to work in the cafeteria, to ride the school buses for a week, and at the end of the week, decide where all the fat is in the budget,” he said. 
Before Monday, H.454 had unusual backing for such a controversial bill. 
The Democrats leading the House and Senate had voiced support, as had Scott, a Republican. Yet a majority in either chamber was far from certain, with a slice of both Democrats and Republicans opposed, though perhaps for different reasons. Some have argued the bill spends too much. Others say it underfunds schools. Some fear it will gut rural school districts and shutter small schools. Still others argue it shifts too much power out of local hands and into Montpelier.

What’s in the bill?
Lawmakers describe H.454 as working toward two broad goals: expanding educational opportunity across the state, and making public education more affordable for taxpayers. 
To that end, the bill would consolidate Vermont’s 119 school districts into larger, regional bodies, and move the state to a new education funding formula.
The state would gradually pivot to funding its education using a foundation formula beginning in fiscal year 2029. The method — used in most states across the country — moves primary authority over how much school districts can spend from the local to the state level. That’s a huge change from the current system, which gives the vast majority of authority to local officials. 
Under the foundation formula, districts would receive money based on the number of students enrolled, with additional dollars for students who are more expensive to educate, such as English learners and students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Districts could choose to spend more —but not less — than the formula provides. 
To ease the transition to the new formula, lawmakers proposed phasing in the new system. As intended, that process would slowly pull back funding from districts that spend well above average now, and ramp up spending in historically low-spending areas. 
Lawmakers, with the help of Scott’s team, devised a new income-sensitized property tax discount. The framework would allow Vermonters making $115,000 or less to exempt a portion of their house value from property taxes, with the possibility of increasing the income threshold in the future. The exemption creates a sliding scale, with lower-income homeowners eligible for bigger exemptions. Up to $425,000 in home value is eligible for the discount. 
The bill would put into effect average class-size minimums in first grade through high school for certain subject classes. But school districts would only face the possibility of repercussions for being out of compliance after three years of not meeting the minimums. Plus, a waiver process would allow schools to petition for an exemption. 
Despite the sweeping changes outlined, almost as many details need to be hashed out. The bill’s biggest unknown is what future consolidated school districts could look like. A task force will hash out not more than three possible configurations this summer that the Legislature would need to vote on as soon as next session. In rough terms, that group might bring back plans with anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts.
Those maps, as well as the new funding formula, would take effect in July 2028. 
Other key, outstanding details include how to handle existing district debt and different teachers contracts in new, consolidated districts. Lawmakers also need to figure out how to pay for — and bring down the cost of — special education, and how money would be allocated to career and technical education and pre-kindergarten. 
The bill is structured so that if certain future requirements are not fulfilled, the transformation falls apart. The foundation formula is contingent on creating consolidated school districts. Several aspects rely on future studies and the outcomes of those analyses.

(Photo by Getty Images)The Maine Legislature passed a bill to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine.
If this bill, LD 1164, ultimately becomes law, it would require 16% of the revenue generated from internet gaming to go back to the state to fund services to address gambling addiction programs, substance use disorder, emergency housing relief and veteran housing. 
However, there are still remaining hurdles until that is guaranteed. 
Last Thursday, the House passed the bill 85-59 but the Senate split over the legislation before tabling it. When it took the bill back up Monday, the upper chamber first attempted to reject the bill but fell short of doing so with a 17-18 vote. The Senate ultimately passed it without a roll call. 
Both chambers therefore followed the recommendation from the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee to support the measure. 
But Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services opposed the bill during its public hearing. While Press Secretary Ben Goodman declined to share an official stance from Gov. Janet Mills, instead saying the administration is “monitoring” the bill, Wabanaki leaders say there is not much appetite from the governor, presenting the possibility of a veto. 
Legislature considers paths to afford Wabanaki Nations more revenue from gambling

The federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 codified that tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming on their lands, unless the state in which it operates prohibits such gaming under its criminal laws. 
However, the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act has made it so the Wabanaki Nations are treated more akin to municipalities than independent nations, one way being that the Tribes are unable to benefit from any federal law passed after 1980, unless they are specifically mentioned in the law.
In 2022, the Maine Legislature amended the Settlement Act to permit Tribes to handle sports betting, so the legislation being considered this session would build off of that earlier expansion. 
“The proposal to authorize igaming for Maine’s tribes is more than a revenue conversation,” Brian Reynolds, the new Tribal Representative for the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, said during debate on the House floor Thursday. “It’s about laying a foundation for self-reliance through modern tools. This is a chance for us to meet economic needs without waiting on federal grants or new appropriations. It allows us to stand on our own.”
The Department of Health and Human Services’ opposition largely centered around not wanting to incentivize more gambling. 
“While the bill directs a portion of revenue collected, which will be used to further prevention and treatment efforts, the number of individuals who may need support and resources will continue to increase along with the public health concerns associated with gambling and internet use,” Puthiery Va, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention under DHHS, testified during the public hearing. 
Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) presented a rebuttal to this view during a speech on the floor Thursday. 
Noting that it is tempting to try to legislate morality, “that’s not our job,” Roeder said. “It’s our job outside of this chamber to talk to our families, to talk to our children about why we don’t become addicted to gambling, why we shouldn’t drink to excess, but that’s not our job to legislate.”
Other proponents argued internet gambling is already happening and the bill presents an opportunity for greater oversight. 
“Regulating igaming gives us the tools to enforce safeguards like age verification, betting limits and addiction resources that the offshore platforms ignore,” Reynold said on the floor. “By bringing this market under Maine’s laws, we’re not only protecting the Maine gaming market, we’re protecting people.”

The bill also presents an opportunity for the state to benefit on gambling that’s already happening, Passamaquoddy Tribal Rep. Aaron Dana said in an interview with Maine Morning Star.
“If we allow that type of gaming and regulate that gaming here in the state of Maine, then we have the ability to have geo fencing and firewalls so the illegal online gaming is not happening anymore and the state is actually gaining revenue from it.”
Dana sees this added revenue as particularly key in light of the tight budget year. 
“I think it would be a win-win,” he said. 
Maine’s privately owned casinos — Hollywood Casino, Hotel and Raceway in Bangor and Oxford Casino Hotel — are opposed because it would create an internet gaming monopoly for the Wabanaki Nations and, they argue, hurt their businesses by diverting revenue to the online options.
“Oxford Casino has delivered on its promise to Maine — creating jobs, paying taxes, and supporting local businesses,” Matt Gallagher, the casino’s general manager, testified during the public hearing. “LD 1164 undermines this success.” 
Dana argues the demographics of people who use online gaming are different from those who go to brick-and mortar-casinos. 
Roeder also argued “the brick-and-mortars will not suffer because they offer something that igaming does not,” which is a social experience.
The Legislature is also considering another gaming bill that pertains to the Wabanaki Nations this session, though it has yet to receive floor votes. 
Rather than altering the structure of who controls gaming, LD 1851 seeks to provide equality among the Wabanaki Nations in how much revenue they are provided from slot machine income in the state. 
It would increase the total net slot machine income to be collected and distributed by a casino from 39% to 46%, which would only impact Hollywood Casino, as Oxford Casino is currently at that percentage. 
It would then provide 7% of that income to the tribal governments of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and the Mi’kmaq Nation. This is roughly the same revenue, around $3.5 million, that Oxford already provides the Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation.
While both gaming bills could be passed, Chief of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Clarissa Sabattis told Maine Morning Star she anticipates the slot revenue bill will not be as necessary should the Tribes gain control of internet gaming, though she sees that path as the less likely outcome.

(Photo by Douglas Rissing/iStock/Getty Images Plus)As someone who has spent three decades working in environmental policy and regulation in Alaska, I’ve witnessed firsthand how energy costs crush family budgets across our state. Today, I’m writing as a homeowner who recently made the switch from heating oil to a heat pump system — and as an Alaskan who believes our federal representatives need to defend the tax credits that make energy independence possible.
The numbers tell a stark story. Here in Juneau, we’re paying nearly $5 per gallon for heating oil. In rural communities, families face even steeper costs—up to $9 per gallon. These prices represent more than an inconvenience; they constitute a genuine crisis for working families trying to keep their homes warm through Alaska’s long winters. According to the Juneau Renewable Energy Strategy, nearly 70% of Juneau households rely on fuel oil for heating, making this cost burden nearly universal across our community.
My husband and I installed an 18,000 BTU Daikin heat pump system in March, replacing our old oil-fired boiler. The financial impact has been immediate and substantial. Previously, we burned through 22 gallons of heating oil weekly—that’s over $400 monthly just for heat. Since installing our heat pump, our electricity bills have run $110-120 per month, even during this unusually cold spring.
The federal 25C and 25D tax credits helped make this transition possible, and we’re looking forward to claiming our credit to help offset the cost of our installation. But we also moved forward because the economics made sense. The relatively mild climate of southern coastal Alaska and lower electricity rates, combined with modern heat pump efficiency — typically three times the efficiency of the average fuel boiler — create genuine savings that compound month after month, year after year.
This represents exactly the kind of energy independence that should appeal to conservative principles. Rather than remaining dependent on volatile global oil markets and complex supply chains, we’ve taken control of our heating costs using Alaska’s abundant hydroelectric resources. We’ve eliminated our vulnerability to geopolitical disruptions, supply chain breakdowns, and the boom-bust cycles that plague fossil fuel markets. As the Juneau Renewable Energy Strategy notes, Juneau’s small, captive market means we pay higher prices for imported fuels than most Americans, making us particularly vulnerable to international political and economic upheavals that drive price spikes. Juneau currently spends $140 million annually on fossil fuels that could instead circulate within our local economy, supporting jobs and families rather than enriching distant suppliers.
And the benefits extend beyond economics. Decommissioning our old 550-gallon fuel tank will free up valuable yard space and eliminate environmental risks like potential leaks. We will no longer worry about running out of fuel during extended cold snaps, and our new heat pump runs more quietly while maintaining more consistent temperatures throughout our home. We’re not alone in this experience: according to the Juneau Ductless Heat Pump Market Survey, 93% of heat pump owners in Juneau report being satisfied with their decision overall.
The federal tax credits play a crucial role in accelerating the adoption of heat pumps and other high-efficiency energy technologies. While my family would have proceeded without the tax credits due to the clear economic benefits, many Alaska families operate on tighter budgets. The Juneau Ductless Heat Pump Market Survey found that 43% of residents cited cost and expensive installation as the primary barrier to installing heat pumps. The credits help bridge this gap between upfront costs and long-term savings, making energy independence accessible to middle-class families who need it most.
U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan must recognize that defending these tax credits means defending Alaska families’ ability to control their energy costs. This isn’t about environmental activism or federal overreach — it’s about economic survival, in a state where energy costs can consume enormous portions of household budgets.
The alternative — leaving Alaska families trapped in cycles of rising energy costs and supply uncertainty — serves nobody’s interests. We need representatives who understand that energy independence begins at home, delivered through practical solutions that make economic sense.
Alaska families deserve better than hoping energy prices moderate. We deserve the tools to take control of our energy future.

MONTPELIER — The Vermont Legislature adjourned its 2025 session Monday night after approving a bill that would make generational changes to the state’s education system. The Senate gaveled out at 7:37 p.m., while the House gaveled out at 8:35 p.m.
Monday’s adjournment brought an end to a session that was well into overtime. For months, lawmakers had said the last week of May was their deadline for finishing their work, including on the education bill, H.454. But after negotiations faltered on Friday, May 30, legislative leaders punted on adjournment until Monday, June 16 — a day they’d already set aside for potential votes on vetoes by Republican Gov. Phil Scott.
In the end, neither chamber’s Democratic leaders attempted to override any vetoes on Monday, even after Scott last week rebuked bills that would have restructured the state’s response to homelessness and granted supervisors in Vermont’s judiciary the right to form a union.
Both chambers adjourned until Jan. 6, 2026. But they also approved a measure that would allow House and Senate leadership to call their colleagues back into session before then to respond to potential future cuts by President Donald Trump’s administration to the federal funding Vermont receives. (Gov. Scott also has the authority, per the state’s Constitution, to call legislators back if he wants.)
Over the first two weeks of June, a joint panel of House and Senate members haggled over their differences on the education package, both with one another and with Scott’s administration. Meanwhile, both chambers held a number of brief floor sessions to, essentially, head off final adjournment until the negotiators reached a deal. After days of stagnated negotiations last week, that agreement finally came on Friday, June 13. 
Then on Monday, after hours of debate across both chambers — both on the floor and in closed-door meetings — the House and Senate approved that compromise version of the bill, which would fundamentally change how the state governs and funds its K-12 schools. The package now heads to Gov. Scott, who is expected to sign it.
Legislators also approved several other bills Monday, including an expansion of who must file campaign finance disclosure forms and a new disclaimer requirement for images of political candidates that are generated using artificial intelligence.
The House also signed off on a measure, already approved by the Senate last month, that would require school districts to ban students from using cellphones from arrival to dismissal. That legislation is included in a bill, H.480, that also makes a number of smaller changes to the state’s education laws.

For-profit health care has been around for decades. However, activity has accelerated in recent years. From 2010 to 2020, the number of private equity acquisitions in health care tripled.
What is the attraction for health care providers to partner with or sell to private equity firms? Health care has become progressively more complex clinically and especially administratively. Increasing administrative demands have been particularly burdensome for providers, especially physicians. Compounding this problem is the fact that as clinical care has become more complex, so has the demand for new and updated facilities and technology. 
Enter private equity. These firms have brought access to capital to support new technology and upgraded facilities. They also have offered management experience and expertise, which providers may well have lacked.
What have we learned? Suffice it to say many problems have evolved. The central issue is the fact that there is a basic conflict in goals and orientation between private equity firms and health care providers. For private equity firms the single focus is profit. For health care providers the goal is ensuring that their patients have access to care and receive quality care when they need it. Sometimes such care is profitable and sometimes it is not.










As health care facilities are faced with financial stress, communities and boards of directors need to proceed cautiously if they are approached by private equity firms.


The most common approach organizations use when trying to increase   profits is to reduce operating costs. In health care, the biggest single cost is almost always the cost of personnel. That is where private equity firms typically have focused their efforts. The problem of course is that the quality care delivered, be it acute care in a hospital or long-term care in a nursing home, is heavily dependent on the easy and prompt access  to well-trained staff.
Experience has shown that private equity takeover often results in a decrease in staffing levels and a trend toward deployment of staff with lower levels of training. Declines in staffing levels have been associated with increases in medical care errors, increases in post-operative complications, lower levels of patient satisfaction, etc.
Such developments clearly impact the practice satisfaction of physicians. Their ability to provide the level of care desired has been impaired with the net effect that physician turnover in such facilities has increased.
Another approach frequently utilized by private equity managers, especially with regard to hospital care, is to alter the mix of services offered by the facility. Some services such as invasive cardiac procedures are routinely profitable while other services such as obstetrics frequently are not. If profit is the dominant motive, the hospital may well shift the mix of services offered in ways that are not consistent with the needs of the community. 
What about private equity in South Dakota? At this point, it has not played a large role in our state. The national experience, however, provides a warning. As health care facilities are faced with financial stress, communities and boards of directors need to proceed cautiously if they are approached by private equity firms.
What to do? Clearly access to capital and management expertise are important  issues. There is nothing illegal about the strategies that private equity firms have pursued. It would be possible to prohibit for-profit organizations from owning or operating health care facilities.  However, as financial pressures have increased, traditional not-for-profit organizations have followed many of the same strategies as their for-profit competitors.
A more basic and far more complex challenge is embedded in the open market structure on which U.S. health care financing is based. In such a structure, some degree of profit is essential if an organization is to survive. Around the world numerous advanced countries, many with lower costs and better health outcomes than the U.S., have rejected open market structures for health care even if they do have competitive markets for consumer goods, etc.
We face serious and intimidating challenges in financing the cost of health care services. There is no quick fix, but I believe it is time we looked seriously at the basic underlying structure and asked, “is there a better way?”

Idahoans United for Women and Families announced more than a year ago that it would pursue a ballot initiative to establish rights to access abortion, contraception and fertility treatments, among other reproductive health care needs, under state law. Idaho does not allow citizens to pass constitutional amendments, and instead must propose legislation to be passed by a simple majority of voters via ballot initiative. 
The Idaho Attorney General’s Office is responsible for drafting short and long ballot titles that summarize what the legislation would do if passed. Idaho law states that the language must describe the proposal accurately and use common language without phrasing that is likely to prejudice voters. 
 Idahoans United for Women and Families sued state officials over ballot titles, fiscal impact statement

Idahoans United sued state officials in January because the ballot titles did not accurately capture the intent of the initiative, the group said, and the fiscal impact statement included information about the Medicaid budget and cost impacts to the state prisoner population. The group said that was unnecessary and prejudicial information. 
Oral arguments took place in late April. 
No decision yet from Idaho Supreme Court leaves abortion ballot initiative group in the lurch

Justice Colleen Zahn authored the opinion and wrote that the evidence in the court record did not support those conclusions, and it therefore violated Idaho’s law for the Division of Financial Management to prepare an “unbiased, good faith statement” of the fiscal impact of the proposed law. 
Zahn noted that none of the employees with the financial management agency appeared to have spoken with the Idaho Department of Correction about whether it paid for any abortion-related care for prisoners. There was also no evidence to show there would be an increase in Medicaid expenditures if the initiative passed, the justices determined, since federal and state law does not permit Medicaid funds to be used for abortion care anyway except in cases where the procedure was done to save the life of the mother. 
“Without knowing how many of the previously paid claims were for abortion-related complications, it is unclear whether the claims data provides a reasonable basis for DFM’s estimated fiscal impact on the Medicaid budget,” Zahn wrote.
The justices determined the long ballot title substantially complied with the law, but the short ballot title left out two of four key elements they identified: that abortions would be permitted after fetal viability in cases of health emergencies, and that health care providers would be protected from liability for performing abortions. 
The justices did not agree with the initiative group that “fetus viability” was any different from the medical term of “fetal viability,” however.
The Idaho Attorney General’s office could not be reached for comment. 
“Today’s ruling is a significant victory for fairness and transparency in Idaho’s election process,” said Melanie Folwell, Idahoans United’s lead organizer and spokesperson. “The court’s decision to direct AG Labrador and the State of Idaho to make the ballot titles and fiscal impact statement clear, concise, and fair is a win for all Idahoans who value a government that respects the will of the people, not just the power of politicians and bureaucrats.” 
The court declined to grant attorney fees to Idahoans United because there were “mixed results” in the action. 
The Idaho Division of Financial Management must provide a new fiscal impact statement by 4 p.m. Monday, June 23, according to the court order, and Labrador’s office must submit a new compliant short ballot title by the same time.

As the summer solstice approaches on June 20, a recent national survey shows where First Staters should go: the Bayshore Byway.
A survey of more than 3,000 people by Gunther Mazda revealed what residents think the best place in the state to watch the sunrise is, and one of the most breathtaking spots in the country to mark the start of summer.
The Delaware Bayshore Byway, a quiet stretch of Route 9 near the Little Creek Wildlife Area, ranked No. 56 out of 100 top locations across the U.S. for watching the solstice sunrise. Port Mahon Road, also near Little Creek, came in at No. 97.
Known for its scenic tidal marshes and coastal creeks, the Bayshore Byway offers a peaceful escape for early risers.
According to survey participants, the road’s early-morning mist, abundant birdlife, and tranquil setting make it an ideal location for reflecting on the year’s longest day.

Further down the list but still notable, Port Mahon Road was praised for its unobstructed views of the Delaware Bay, where orange and pink hues stretch across the water as the sun rises.
Though well-known to local fishermen, the road remains something of a hidden gem for sunrise seekers.
The survey, conducted in anticipation of the summer solstice, asked Americans: “Based on your own experience, where’s the most breathtaking place to drive to and watch the sunrise on the summer solstice?”
Top national honors went to Mauna Kea Access Road in Hawaii, followed by California’s Sunrise Highway, Virginia’s Blue Ridge Parkway and Skyline Drive, and Alaska’s Chilkat River Scenic Byway.
Gunther Mazda also released an infographic highlighting the top sunrise drive in each U.S. state.
“The summer solstice is the longest stretch of daylight we get all year – and there’s no better way to make the most of it than getting behind the wheel and chasing the sunrise,” says Joseph Gunther IV at Gunther Mazda. “These drives aren’t just about the destination. They’re about the early-morning roads, the changing light, and the sense of freedom that only a great drive can give you.”
For Delaware residents and visitors alike, the survey serves as a reminder that some of the most beautiful moments of summer begin just down the road — as long as you’re willing to wake up early.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-16-at-7.59.08-PM.png,,,2025-06-16 21:01:01.374111

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)For more than two hours, 10,000 protesters coalesced in their anger against President Donald Trump and his policies to march peacefully through scorching Salt Lake City streets Saturday.
They had cheered organizers’ urging for nonviolence and reveled in moments of unity as they walked, from appreciative honks from waiting cars to church bells ringing out for them as they passed St. Mark’s Episcopal Cathedral.
Just before 8 p.m., gunshots sounded, sending the crowd scrambling. Police confirmed Sunday that an individual who they said was “possibly part of the event’s peacekeeping team” had spotted a man with a rifle approaching the marchers, and fired. That man, identified as 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa, sustained a minor gunshot wound and was later arrested and booked into jail for investigation of murder.
An innocent bystander walking in the protest, Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, 39, was also shot. He died of his injuries Saturday night.
A long list of questions remains.
But up until that moment, the message of the event had been the same as protests happening in cities large and small around the country, part of a nationwide declaration of defiance of Trump coinciding with a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C. marking the Army’s 250th anniversary, a date that was also the president’s 79th birthday.

The Salt Lake City demonstration was the last and largest of 11 planned protests across the state Saturday, including a demonstration that drew thousands more to the University of Utah that morning. 
Speaking to reporters on a dark Salt Lake City street about two hours after the shooting, the city’s police chief and mayor both praised the protesters for exercising their rights peacefully and without incident.
“We had thousands of people come out today, not only in Salt Lake City, but in protests around the state, protests around this nation, and they were, by and large, peaceful demonstrations,” Mayor Erin Mendenhall said. “We are a nation that needs our First Amendment right. We deserve to be able to protest in peace. And what happened today, I hope, will not silence the voices of the public who deserve to have their voices heard.”
Protesters’ chants included “This is what democracy looks like,” “Trump is a felon,” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.” 
There were also some unflattering shoutouts to elected Utah officials including Sen. Mike Lee, Rep. Celeste Maloy, Gov. Spencer Cox and state Rep. Trevor Lee.
Despite Utah’s unquestioned status as a red haven, with Republicans consistently holding the governor’s office, all of the state’s congressional seats and a supermajority in the Legislature, Utahns who disagree with Trump’s politics have been making their voices heard in growing numbers since the president began his second term, including earlier in the week.

Some protesters, like Ogden sisters Kimberly and Heidi Cruzatt, marched on behalf of those concerned about demonstrating publicly. They wore scrubs, a symbol of their Peruvian parents’ work as CNAs. 
“I believe it’s not safe for them, and they have a family at home to take care of, so I don’t want to risk them any harm being here,” said Heidi Cruzatt.
Kimberly Cruzatt carried a poster styled after the broadway hit “Hamilton” logo, including the line “Immigrants, we get the job done.”
“It’s about Alexander Hamilton, but since he’s an immigrant, he’s decided, ‘OK, I think everybody who has come from different countries has collaborated in the community,’” she explained. 
Not far from the sisters was Rachel Blackmer, of Taylorsville, who teaches English to adult immigrants and trains foster parents to care for refugee teenagers. In the center of the sign she carried above her head, Blackmer drew a heart with words “Protect the immigrants I love” inside, and dozens of names of her students appearing around it.
“Everyone I care about is being threatened right now. My students tell me about how scared they are, and they carry their ID with them, but that isn’t even good enough. They’re still scared, and I’m really excited to show them my sign and show them their names on it and why I’m here,” Blackmer said. 
Looking at the sea of people around her, Blackmer said she hopes the scale of the recent protests will spur change, comparing it to the height of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.
“I’m really hoping that our country will respond even more than they did back then, this will be even bigger, and more people will respond,” she said.

Those questions, among others, remained unanswered Monday after a man marching in the “No Kings” protest in Salt Lake City, identified as Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, was shot and killed on Saturday. 
According to police, the shooting happened after two men described as “peacekeepers” confronted another man, 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa, who was carrying an AR-15 style rifle. One of the men, reportedly part of the event’s security team, fired three shots from a handgun, grazing Gamboa but also hitting Ah Loo, who police said was an “innocent bystander.” Ah Loo later died at the hospital.

Shortly after the shooting, police arrested Gamboa, and he was booked into jail for investigation of murder. Police say, however, that Gamboa did not fire his rifle. The two “peacekeepers,” who wore high-visability vests, were initially detained by police, but were released after being questioned. Police said the man who fired the three shots is cooperating with police. 
While Utahns grieve the killing of Ah Loo, some applauded the “peacekeepers’” actions to prevent what could have turned into a mass shooting. Others questioned whether the armed man who shot at Gamboa and inadvertently fatally struck Ah Loo acted appropriately. 
What we know — and don’t know — so far
According to an affidavit of probable cause for Gamboa’s arrest, one of the “peacekeepers” told police he saw Gamboa “move away from the main crowd into a secluded area behind a wall.” There, he observed Gamboa take out an AR-15 style rifle from his backpack and begin to “manipulate it.” Then they “called out to him to drop the gun after drawing their own firearms,” according to the affidavit. 
“(Gamboa) then lifted the rifle, and according to witnesses he began to run toward the large crowd gathered on State Street holding the rifle in a firing position,” the affidavit says. That’s when one of the “peacekeepers” fired three rounds at Gamboa. One of the bullets hit Ah Loo, “causing a fatal wound.” 
“The peacekeepers then attempted to provide medical aid to the victim, who was pronounced dead at the hospital,” the affidavit said. “Arturo Gamboa was acting under circumstances evidencing a depraved indifference to human life, and knowingly engages in conduct that creates a grave risk of death to another individual and thereby causes the death of the other individual.”
In a statement issued Monday afternoon, the Salt Lake City Police Department said it’s investigating the involvement of the “peacekeepers,” as well as other aspects of the protests’s organization and staffing. 
“At this time, it remains unclear whether these individuals were hired by or volunteered for the event organizers, or acted on their own initiative,” Salt Lake City Police spokesperson Brent Weisberg said.

Who organized the protest and what do they know about the ‘peacekeepers’?
The “No Kings” protest was organized by a Utah chapter of the 50501 Movement, a grassroots group that organizes rallies to protest actions by President Donald Trump and his administration. 
Utah News Dispatch emailed a list of questions to both national and local organizers asking about the role of “peacekeepers” during the event, how many were in Salt Lake City, how they were vetted, if at all, and whether they had qualifications or training to be acting as armed security during the protest. Those questions, and requests for comment, were not immediately returned Monday.
However, in a Sunday post on the national 50501’s Facebook page, the group said, “In the face of this heartbreaking situation, we would like to affirm our commitment to nonviolence and to our non-negotiable prohibition of firearms policy for anyone representing 50501 at any of our actions or events.” 
“It is clear we do not have a complete understanding of what happened yet,” the group said. “What is certain is that, if no guns were present at this protest, this tragedy would have been prevented altogether.” 
The group added that “our hearts are with (Ah Loo’s) family and community during this time of unimaginable loss and grief.” 

Sarah Parker, a national coordinator with the 50501 Movement, also described the event’s “peacekeepers” as volunteers who helped direct the march and were responsible for keeping attendees safe, The New York Times reported. She also estimated that 15 to 20 such volunteers were at the protest in Salt Lake City, according to the Times. 
Volunteer peacekeeping teams are common for protests, Parker told the Associated Press. But she said organizers typically ask attendees, including peacekeepers, not to bring weapons. Still, she said she believed they likely stopped what could have been a larger mass shooting.
“Our safety team did as best as they could in a situation that is extremely sad and extremely scary,” Parker said. 
In a Facebook post on Sunday, the Utah chapter of the 50501 movement thanked Utahns for their “outpouring of support for the victim’s family.” It also addressed criticism that the group had disclosed the victim had died before Salt Lake City police released that information to the media, saying “our team was directly involved.” 
“Some of you seem to think a keyboard and social media give you a free pass to be nasty and accusatory,” the Facebook post said. “Our teams just had to deal with something extremely traumatizing and when faced with personal risk to their own lives, chose to run towards the danger in order to serve this community.”
Salt Lake City police’s ongoing investigation includes ‘peacekeeper’ role
In a lengthy statement Monday as questions and criticism swirled around the “peacekeepers” and their role, Weisberg said the term was first used in a probable cause affidavit for the arrest of Gamboa and later appeared in a news release Sunday, “reflecting how one of the men questioned self-described as a ‘peacekeeper’ during interviews with SLCPD detectives in the early stages of the investigation.” 
“The SLCPD will be learning more, through its investigation, about the event staffing during this event, including the roles, responsibilities, and terminology of individuals who may have been assisting during the event,” Weisberg said. 
He added that the term “peacekeeper” does not “represent any formal designation recognized by the Salt Lake City Police Department or the City.” And he said there is “no information, at this time, about whether this is an official term used by the event organizers.”

“There is no record in the event’s permit indicating the presence of organized or armed security,” he said. “Based on the information currently available to the Salt Lake City Police Department, neither of the men identified as ‘peacekeepers’ are current or former members of law enforcement, including the Salt Lake City Police Department.”
Earlier Monday, Utah News Dispatch submitted a list of questions to the Salt Lake City Police Department asking to what extent, if any, the Salt Lake City Police Department had coordinated with event organizers or teams acting as security. The Dispatch also asked whether Salt Lake police officers were aware of “peacekeepers” concealing or carrying firearms and if they were investigating their qualifications to be acting as security. 
“While the Salt Lake City Police Department was aware that Saturday’s demonstration would include people in support roles, such as those helping to marshal or guide the crowd, these functions are entirely internal to the event,” Weisberg said. “They are not overseen, sanctioned, or trained by the Salt Lake City Police Department. From the department’s standpoint, these persons are considered members of the public, subject to the same rights and responsibilities as any other person in Utah.”
However, Weisberg said the Salt Lake City Police Department’s public order unit and its police liaison officers “worked with event organizers prior to and during Saturday’s event to coordinate with the goal of having a peaceful and lawful demonstration.” 
“The Salt Lake City Police Department does not direct or manage security roles and responsibilities unless that requirement is outlined in the event’s approved permit, of which it was not,” Weisberg said.

Charges not yet filed
The case remains under investigation. Charges, as of Monday afternoon, had not been filed against Gamboa or anyone else involved in the shooting. 
The Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office declined to say whether prosecutors are considering filing any charges against the “peacekeepers” who were involved in the shooting. 
“As this continues to be an active investigation, any comment at this time would be inappropriate,” Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said in a prepared statement.

Utah gun laws
Utah is a “constitutional carry” state, which means it allows the open and concealed carrying of firearms without a permit for those who are legally allowed to possess them. In 2021, with HB60, the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature eliminated the state’s concealed carry permit requirements. Now, anyone 21 and over who can legally possess a gun is free to carry it loaded and hidden in public. 
Unlike 26 other states, Utah has not adopted a law prohibiting the carrying of long guns at state capitols or political protests, according to Everytown Research & Policy, an organization that produces research on gun violence and advocates for gun violence prevention. The group has ranked Utah as No. 36 in the country for “gun law strength.” 
No information has been released about the “peacekeepers,” including how old they are and whether they were legally able to carry and conceal firearms. 
“While Utah law governs when and how a person may carry and use a firearm, the lawfulness of any individual’s possession or use depends on the specific facts and circumstances of each case,” Weisberg said. 
In the wake of Saturday’s shooting — as well as a shooting the following day at WestFest, a carnival in West Valley City, that left three dead, including an 8-month-old baby — gun control advocates called for change.

“From marching in our communities, to attending carnivals, the recent tragedies in our state makes it clear we are not safe until our state addresses our gun violence crisis,” said Jaden Christensen, a Utah chapter leader of Moms Demand Action. “This is not freedom, it’s a failure of leadership. The gun violence we’re seeing across our state and country should be a blaring alarm for lawmakers: it’s time to act with the urgency this moment demands. Enough is enough.”
Utah House Democrats also issued a statement called the shootings in Utah — along with the slayings of lawmakers in Minnesota — “heartbreaking, but unfortunately, not surprising.” 
“The conditions for this kind of violence have been building for years, driven by a toxic combination of hateful rhetoric and easy access to firearms,” Utah House Democratic leadership said. “That rhetoric, often amplified by leaders at the local, state, and federal levels, has created an environment that often leads to violence.”
They added that their Republican colleagues “insist that ‘guns don’t kill people — people kill people.’ Yet many of those same leaders use their platforms to target marginalized communities, spread misinformation, and stoke division.”
“We urge all elected officials to reflect on the impact of their words and how they contribute to the dangerous climate we face today,” they said. “As a caucus, we remain committed to advancing policies that reduce gun violence, promote accountability, and protect the safety and dignity of every Utahn. We call on others to join us in that commitment.”

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)The man accused of killing DFL House leader Melissa Hortman and her husband, and shooting DFL state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, went to the homes of two additional state lawmakers in the early hours of Saturday morning, federal officials said Monday.
Vance Boelter, 57, is facing several state and federal charges for the murders of Melissa and Mark Hortman and the shootings of John and Yvette Hoffman, and related other crimes. The Hoffmans survived but remained hospitalized.
Boelter’s path took him, in total, to the homes of four state lawmakers in the northwest metro of the Twin Cities before he got in a shootout with police officers outside the Hortmans’ home in Brooklyn Park and fled the scene.
Boelter was captured Sunday evening by state and federal agents in a field about a mile from his home in Green Isle, about an hour west of the Twin Cities, following a 43-hour manhunt.
Boelter maintained notebooks with a list of Democratic elected officials, including Hortman and Hoffman, along with addresses and the names of abortion providers. He has been described by those who knew him as a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump, who was facing financial hardship after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Federal authorities say that after Boelter shot the Hoffmans, he drove to a home in Maple Grove belonging to a state representative. Boelter, dressed in a fake law enforcement uniform and wearing a mask, knocked on the door and said “This is the police. Open the door,” according to surveillance footage from the home referenced in federal charging documents.
The representative and her family were not at home. No one answered the door.
Authorities declined to name the representative who lived at the house. Maple Grove is split into two House districts — one represented by Republican Rep. Kristin Robbins, and the other by DFL Rep. Kristin Bahner.
As word spread about the shooting of the Hoffmans, a New Hope police officer drove to the local state senator’s house to check on the lawmaker. The New Hope police officer spotted what looked like a police SUV parked down the block from the senator’s home. Assuming it was another officer dispatched to provide protection, the New Hope officer pulled up next to the SUV.
Boelter was inside the vehicle, likely still wearing the silicone mask that he wore as he shot the Hoffmans, said Joe Thompson, acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota. As the New Hope officer attempted to speak with Boelter, Boelter stared straight ahead and didn’t respond. The officer then drove down the block to the senator’s house, and Boelter left.
New Hope is represented by DFL state Sen. Ann Rest, and in a statement Monday, she thanked law enforcement for saving her life.
“I have been made aware that the shooting suspect was parked near my home early Saturday morning. I am so grateful for the heroic work of the New Hope Police Department and its officers. Their quick action saved my life,” Rest said.
Boelter then drove to the Hortmans’ in Brooklyn Park, the federal charging documents allege. A notebook recovered from his home included notes about the Hortman family and home.
Brooklyn Park police, responding to the same call for protection following the Hoffmans’ shooting, arrived on the scene moments before Boelter fired his gun as he entered the home through the front door. Boelter escaped through the back of the house, and police officers found Melissa and Mark Hortman — and their dog — inside the home with fatal gunshot wounds.
Here’s a timeline of events, according to federal and state charging documents, and local reporting:



June 9, 2025
Boelter purchased a flashlight, tactical rifle case, ammunition and materials used to create a fake “POLICE” license plate for his SUV, according to a Fleet Farm receipt found by police in Boelter’s north Minneapolis home.
Saturday, June 14
2:06 a.m.: The Hoffmans’ daughter called 911 to report that her parents had been shot.
2:24 a.m.: Boelter arrives at the home of a state representative in Maple Grove and rings the doorbell multiple times. “This is the police. Open the door,” he repeated. No one answered; the family was not home.
2:36 a.m.: A New Hope police officer arrives at the home of Sen. Ann Rest in New Hope to conduct a safety check. There, she encountered Boelter in his SUV, parked down the block from the home. The officer, believing the car was a legitimate law enforcement vehicle, attempted to speak with Boelter, but he did not engage with her. The officer then parked at Rest’s house and waited for other officers to arrive; by the time they arrived, Boelter was gone.
3:30 a.m.: Brooklyn Park police arrive at the Hortmans’ home to conduct a safety check. There, they saw a black SUV resembling a cop car with its lights flashing. Officers saw Boelter standing in front of the house, then firing shots as he entered the home.
Officers then moved to the front doorway, where they attempted to provide medical assistance to Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. Boelter fled the scene, abandoning the vehicle.
6:03 a.m.: Boelter texted his childhood friend and roommate saying that he would be “gone for a while” and “may be dead shortly,” the Star Tribune reported.
6:18 a.m.: Boelter texted his wife and other family members in a group chat, writing that he “went to war last night” and that “there’s gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger-happy and I don’t want you guys around.”
Around 7:00 a.m.: After stopping by his north Minneapolis home, Boelter encountered a stranger at a bus stop in the neighborhood and asked to purchase an electric bike from him. The two took a bus to the man’s house, where Boelter also asked to buy the man’s Buick sedan. The man agreed, and they took the Buick to a U.S. Bank in Robbinsdale, where Boelter withdrew $2200, and gave $900 to the man for the bike and car.
Sunday, June 15
2:30 a.m.: Law enforcement received information about a possible sighting of a man riding an e-bike about two miles away from Boelter’s Green Isle home.
Midday: Law enforcement officials send out an emergency alert in the area of Faxon Township, Sibley County, after locating Boelter’s abandoned Buick within miles of his home. Teams of officers from dozens of agencies fan out across the area, searching homes and rural areas for Boelter.
9:10 p.m. State leaders apprehend Boelter in a field in Green Isle. He was armed, but surrendered without any use of force.

The gathering grew out of a meeting Gov. Maura Healey had with Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who traces her ancestry back to Nova Scotia.
The post ‘Open for business’: Despite tariffs, leaders from northeastern states and Canada pledge to work together appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","TARIFFS, TOURISM, and a talent drain. 
Five northeast US governors and six Canadian premiers and ministers on Monday met at the Massachusetts State House to grapple with taxes on imports, also known as tariffs, as well as how some workers are fleeing the US as their federal research funding is cut or withdrawn, and the drop in visitors coming over the border amid President Trump pushing for Canada to become the 51st US state. 
Gov. Maura Healey hosted her counterparts inside the library of the Massachusetts State House, saying the gathering grew out of a meeting she had with Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who traces her ancestry back to Nova Scotia, after Trump announced a new tariff strategy in April, one he has wavered on in the weeks that followed. Canada counts the US as its largest trading partner, and now faces American tariffs on its goods that are expected to be passed onto US consumers. 
Monday’s convening of governors and premiers was an attempt at a show of unity, to offer a message that the Canadian provinces and northeast US states were “open for business” with each other and see China as the common foe, despite whatever the Trump administration says in Washington.  
Tariffs are already affecting Maine’s craft brewing industry, Mills said by way of example, noting that aluminum and packaging materials used by the industry come from Canada. 
But they also acknowledged as the leaders of states and provinces, they have more limited powers than federal officials. The meeting came as leaders from the G7 countries – the US, Canada, Italy, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom – convened in Alberta. Healey and her counterparts, which also included the governors of New York and Vermont, expressed hope some comity and trade deals could emerge from that G7 gathering. 
But there was still daylight between the two camps. After Healey noted that tourism numbers in the northeastern states are down anywhere between 20 to 60 percent, a reporter asked the Canadian officials at the meeting whether they would encourage their residents to come to America and spend money this summer, or ask people to send a message to Trump by keeping their tourism dollars out of the US economy. 
The Canadian officials demurred. Ontario Premier Doug Ford pitched his province, saying it’s twice the size of Texas. But he added, “We need to get through this, and we’re stronger together. And keep an eye on China. They’re laughing. They’re sitting back laughing.” 
New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt said Americans have to relay to Trump that the tariffs and threats of annexation are hurting the US economy. “I can’t tell Canadians to come visit the US right now,” she said. “I’m going to tell them to go and see my neighbors in Nova Scotia, I’m going to tell them to spend some time at home because the relationship has been challenged by leadership. We need to get back to normal. That’s what we all want.” 
Holt also indicated that Canada sees the situation as an opportunity to attract the “brightest and best” research and development workers as they face federal funding cuts in the US. “Maybe we’ll borrow some of the folks, and then we’ll give them back and build the kind of connected partnerships between our research organizations that will stand through the test of time,” she said. 
Rhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee said a larger group of governors and premiers should be convened. “This dialogue today has been very eye-opening to me. What’s been said from our colleagues here in Canada, we need to listen to,” he said. He then referred to Trump without saying his name, adding, “This rhetoric that is going on, creating division, needs to stop. A meeting like this helps get that message going but it needs to continue to happen.”

Melissa Hortman and her husband and attempting the assassination of other lawmakers, makes his first court appearance Monday, June 16, 2025, in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)The Hennepin County prosecutor will pursue first-degree murder charges against Vance Boelter, the suspect arrested in the assassination of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. Boelter also was charged with six federal offenses, including stalking, murder and firearms charges.
In addition to the murder of Melissa and Mark Hortman, Boelter is accused of shooting state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Both are expected to recover. Boelter visited the homes of two other state legislators who were unharmed, including Sen. Ann Rest in New Hope. The other target has not been disclosed, but officials say she is a Maple Grove representative.
The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office initially charged Boelter with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said the second-degree murder charges were filed on Saturday to obtain a nationwide arrest warrant. These are the highest charges that can be filed through a complaint. Moriarty is now seeking to charge Boelter with first-degree murder, which carries a heavier prison sentence.
The U.S. Attorneys’ office brought federal charges against Boelter on Sunday night. The charges include two counts of stalking using interstate facilities, two counts of murder, and two firearms offenses for the shooting of the Hortmans and Hoffmans. The federal murder charges carry the potential for the death penalty.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi condemned the attack in a press release.
“These horrific acts of violence will not go unanswered: the Department of Justice will prosecute this suspect to the fullest extent of the law and if convicted deliver severe consequences for his alleged crimes.”
Joe Thompson, the acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, said that the attack likely took months of planning. A list of names and addresses, including many DFL legislators, was found in Boelter’s car.
“It is no exaggeration to say that his crimes are the stuff of nightmares,” Thompson said at a press conference Monday. “It’s pretty clear from the evidence that he’s been planning these attacks for quite some time. There’s voluminous writings, as you’ve seen in the reporting, that were found both in his car and his house.”
The state criminal complaint brought against Boelter states that Brooklyn Park police officers saw Boelter shoot Hortman’s husband, Mark Hortman, before he fled. Officers found at least four firearms in Boelter’s car. Another disassembled gun was discovered in the surrounding area.
At a press conference Monday, state officials shared further details about the charges. Bureau of Criminal Apprehension supervisor Drew Evans said that Boelter cooperated with law enforcement when he was arrested Sunday night.
Moriarty addressed misinformation that has been circulating online following the assassination.
“It is a frightening time we are living in. Political violence is prevalent, and the way we talk to and about each other has raised the temperature to unfathomable levels….As our community grieves, I encourage those out there seeking to create additional chaos to stop spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories,” Moriarty said.

Aerion Abney (D-Allegheny)(left) Gina H. Curry (D-Delaware) and Morgan Cephas (D-Philadelphia) to mark the passage of two maternal health bills in the House Health Committee.Two new bills in the “Momnibus” package of legislation to improve pregnancy outcomes for those most at risk in Pennsylvania passed in the state House Health Committee on Monday.
The legislation would expand Medicaid coverage for blood pressure monitoring cuffs for expectant mothers and direct the state Department of Health to conduct an awareness campaign to encourage fathers and partners to be involved in prenatal and postpartum care.
Members of the House Black Maternal Health Caucus celebrated advancing the legislation, which will now be considered by the full House, as part of a reboot of the “Momnibus” package to improve pregnancy outcomes for those most at risk.
The Momnibus — a play on the term omnibus, which is used to describe legislation with many goals — was first introduced in 2024 with eight bills, five of which passed in the House. Two became law last session, one requiring post-partum depression screening for new mothers and the other to provide Medicaid reimbursement for doulas, who care for mothers during and after pregnancy.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We’ve seen Medicaid coverage extended with postpartum care. We’ve opened new doors for maternal health data reporting,” Rep. Gina H. Curry (D-Delaware), a founder of the caucus, said. “These victories matter, but they are only a beginning, because despite those wins, Pennsylvania remains one of the most dangerous places in this country to give birth, especially if you are a black woman.”
Legislation in the nine-bill “Momnibus 2.0” package includes measures to address maternal health care “deserts,” creating a diversionary court for mothers with substance use issues, providing newborn supplies for new parents, and promoting innovation in the practice of midwifery. Additional proposals would provide accommodation of breast feeding with nursing rooms in state buildings and add pumping breast milk to the exemption from the indecent exposure law under the Freedom to Breastfeed Act,
House Bill 1234, sponsored by Rep. La’Tasha Mayes (D-Allegheny), would expand Medicaid coverage for blood pressure monitors to provide one for each pregnancy. Currently, the devices are covered every three years. Legislation requiring private insurance to cover blood pressure monitors for each pregnancy passed the House 143-60 last week.
“In our commonwealth, black moms are two times more likely to die before, during and up to one year after childbirth, compared to white moms,” Mayes said, citing data from the state Maternal Mortality Review Committee. The vast majority — 93.5% of maternal deaths — are preventable with appropriate care, Mayes added. 
Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication marked by increased blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy that affects up to 8% of pregnant mothers. Its results include premature delivery, organ damage and other longlasting effects as well as death.
“The power to change the trajectory of maternal death and sickness is in our hands,” Mayes said. “We, in the Pennsylvania Black Maternal Health Caucus, intend to transform the lives of all moms in our Commonwealth.”
The measure passed the health panel 22-4 with opposition from four Republican lawmakers, who suggested the provision of a blood pressure monitor for every pregnancy was excessive.
“I’m not sure why they can’t just keep using the same one,” Rep. Brad Roae (R-Crawford) said, noting that the state’s contribution to Medicaid is one of its largest expenses and the state budget proposes taking billions from the surplus and rainy day funds. “It doesn’t seem like they’d wear it out.” 
Rep. Tarik Khan (D-Philadelphia), who is a nurse practitioner, said a $40 electronic blood pressure monitor is inexpensive protection against a hospital stay that could cost tens of thousands of dollars. And, he said, such devices become less accurate with extended use. 
Rep. Arvnd Venkat (D-Allegheny), who is an emergency physician, added that an automatic blood pressure monitor needs to be recalibrated every two years, so replacing monitors every three years is insufficient. 
“Like Rep. Khan, as health professionals who have treated patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia, an ounce of prevention absolutely is  worth much more than the price that happens when someone comes into the emergency department with this condition,” Venkat said. 
Rep. Aerion Abney (D-Allegheny) said House Bill 1212, which he sponsored with Rep. Morgan Cephas (D-Philadelphia), is modeled after federal legislation introduced by U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock and former Sen. Marco Rubio in a bipartisan effort to increase fathers’ participation in their partners’ care before, during and after pregnancy.
Abney said the support of fathers and partners during pregnancy is shown to have benefits for mothers and children. According to the legislation, expectant mothers are 1.5 times more likely to receive prenatal care in the first trimester when the father is involved in pregnancy appointments and milestones. 
A father or partner’s involvement during pregnancy can also promote the mental well-being of the mother, the legislation says. 
“Fathers are like pillars. They are like support systems,” Abney said before the committee voted 24-2 to approve his bill. “They’re almost like foundations on the house, right? … That support, that foundation is really important when the flood comes.”

Federal land at Green River, Fremont and New Fork lakes could be nominated for sale, according to a map based on the bill’s language.
The post Map shows iconic Wyoming landscapes could be developed under GOP budget, land sale plan appeared first on WyoFile .","Iconic Wyoming landscapes like Green River, New Fork and Fremont lakes could be developed for housing under the evolving GOP federal budget reconciliation bill, a map showing the federal lands that could be sold reveals.
The Wilderness Society mapped potential sale property based on language being hammered out by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The panel revised the “mandatory disposal” measure Saturday, but has not itself mapped the estimated 258 million acres in 11 Western states that could be nominated for sale.
The Wilderness Society map, however, shows that in addition to the Pinedale-area lakes, many other National Forest and Bureau of Land Management properties could be nominated for sale and development. Some 15 million acres in Wyoming could be nominated for sale, according to calculations made by The Wilderness Society.
All told, an estimated 2-3 million acres across the West would be sold after nomination and secretarial approval, the National Wildlife Federation calculated.
The bill would “drive a dagger into the heart of our Wyoming way of life,” Casper resident Neil Short wrote to friends and colleagues, urging them to ask Wyoming’s senators to oppose the bill. “We hunt, fish, ride horseback, ride ATVs, mountain bike, hike, camp, run, climb, ski, snowmobile, roam and exercise our Second Amendment rights on these beautiful, sacred landscapes,” he wrote.

The map of eligible land includes almost the entire Wyoming Range, the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, swaths of National Forest land surrounding Jackson Hole, Forest Service land on the west side of the Tetons and tracts bordering Star Valley.
West of Laramie, The Wilderness Society mapped large portions of the Medicine Bow National Forest, including Sheep Mountain and parts of Lookout Mountain, as available for sale. Land West of Cody also could be nominated, as well as Forest Service property on both sides of the Bighorn Mountains.
Scattered BLM lands around the state also qualify for sale, according to The Wilderness Society map.
Grazing permits in flux
The budget measure proposed by Utah’s U.S. Sen. Mike Lee requires the sales as part of the Republican plan to reduce the nation’s deficit. The Congressional Budget Office has warned that the bill would not do that; critics say it provides tax breaks for the wealthy and would use land sales to offset them.
The “mandatory disposal” provision would require the secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture departments — who oversee the Forest Service and BLM — to sell land owned by all Americans at fair market value. David Willms, associate vice president for the National Wildlife Federation, estimated the 2-3 million acres on the chopping block after studying the bill.
Interested parties could nominate a parcel for sale, and local governments, not including Native American tribes, would have a right to match the sale price. The land would be developed as housing and “affordability” would be among the criteria a secretary could consider in offering nominated parcels for sale, according to a draft of the measure obtained by WyoFile.
The Senate committee amended Lee’s “mandatory disposal” measure Saturday, adding federal grazing lands used by ranchers to the list of property subject to sale. Land used by ranchers under grazing permits had been exempted from nomination and sale before the revisions.
“Selling off 3 million acres of public lands without public input or consideration is bad for America and is bad for Wyoming’s way of life.” Peter Linn
After news of those changes reached Western states, committee staffers in Washington, D.C., scrambled to protect ranchers, Jim Magagna, executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association said Monday.
“I have been told they have drafted new language that totally protects any land with grazing rights from being sold,” Magagna said. “They assured me anything they go forward with will absolutely protect grazing permits.
“That satisfies our concerns,” pending a reading of the final language, he said.
Along with the deficit-reduction goal, Lee characterized the effort to sell land owned by all Americans as a way to boost affordable housing in the West. He’s been a critic of federal land ownership, supporting the Beehive state’s petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to wrest 18.5 million acres of BLM land from federal control.
There’s no language in the budget measure, however, that requires any development to be or stay affordable.
Any nomination for sale “shall include a description of [how the sale] would address local housing needs including housing supply and affordability,” according to the latest language in the measure.
Willms agreed that the Lee provision now opens the door to the development of resorts and exclusive housing.
The Lee provision also would circumvent federal environmental laws aimed at analyzing and documenting the effects of a sale and requiring notice and comment. The measure would fast-track sales, requiring the two agencies to begin accepting nominations within 30 days of the bill’s passage.
Montana out, Wyoming in
The Lee measure excludes Montana, a concession to U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, who opposes any sales and will be a key vote in passing any bill in the House. The bill also excludes “federally protected lands” like national parks, wilderness areas, battlefields, wild and scenic rivers and other similar areas.
The bill would direct sale proceeds to the general treasury, a “huge shift” Willms said. Today, such funds must be used by the agencies themselves for things like landscape restoration.
Hunters and other outdoor recreationists see trouble in the bill.
Peter Lynn, who operates Pendergraph Outfitters, urged Wyoming residents to speak out. “Contact Senators John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis and tell them selling off 3 million acres of public lands without public input or consideration is bad for America and is bad for Wyoming’s way of life,” he wrote in a post for the coalition Keep It Public Wyoming.
Staffers for Barrasso and Lummis did not respond to WyoFile last week when asked about the senators’ views on Lee’s proposal. In a separate statement, Lummis did express support for Lee’s general approach to public land sales.
The Wyoming Outdoor Council posted a “red alert” saying “selling public lands to the highest bidder to fund tax cuts flies in the face of our Wyoming values.”
Casper resident Short told his friends “if our precious landscape is sold, multi-billionaires would own our sacred lands and we would be peasants, locked out forever.”

(Commonwealth Media Services)The Pennsylvania Treasury invested an additional $25 million in Israel Bonds last week, hours before the country launched a series of air strikes targeting Iran’s nuclear program and military capacity.
A spokesperson for Treasury Secretary Stacy Garrity said the decision to make the investment had been made a day or two prior to its finalization Thursday, and that the timing in relation to the strike was a coincidence. Garrity herself said the investment was made for reasons both financial and geopolitical.
“This decision was made first and foremost because Israel Bonds are a sound investment … making them a smart and dependable choice for the Commonwealth,” Garrity said in a statement. “This investment is also a reflection of our commitment to standing with Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Garrity also directed the investment of $20 million in Israel Bonds after the October 7, 2023 attack on the country by the militant group Hamas, which kicked off the ongoing conflict in Gaza. That fight has led to widespread decimation in the Gaza Strip and has since spread, with Israel trading attacks with  Iran-funded militias in Yemen and Lebanon, and striking targets in Syria.
The investment will bring Pennsylvania’s total investment in Israel Bonds to $64.5 million as of July 1, according to a Treasury Department press release. 
“It’s especially important to show our support at a time when Israelis and Jews — both abroad and here in the United States — continue to face horrific acts of antisemitism,” Garrity said.
Before the investment was finalized, on Wednesday, President Donald Trump expressed growing skepticism that the U.S. and Tehran could reach a deal over Iran’s nuclear program, which Israel has long opposed. That evening he said some U.S. military personnel and their dependents were being moved out of the Middle East because “it could be a dangerous place.”
Reporting had also indicated that U.S. and European officials believed Israel was preparing for a strike on Iran.
So far, it’s been reported Israeli strikes have killed over 200 Iranians and Iranian counterstrikes have killed more than 20 Israelis.

WINOOSKI – Sita Luitel was all smiles as she pointed out the two strips of woven cloth she created.
“It makes me happy,” said Luitel, 66, in Nepali, with her daughter translating, as she ran her fingers over one of the long striped multicolored pieces.
This was her first time weaving on a hand loom, she said, it feels good and brings back old memories but she has back problems so she isn’t sure she can continue it.
“I love all the colors,” said Hari Luitel, 25, admiring her mother’s work at the Winooski Senior Center Thursday, where strips of colorful weaves made by women in a recent workshop were exhibited.
The Luitels came to Vermont 14 years ago from a refugee camp in Nepal. Hari said she has fond memories of Nepali women gathering to knit colorful sweaters, shawls, blankets, even rugs for their families in the refugee camps, where they didn’t have a lot of options and couldn’t afford to buy such items.
“It brought me joy to see how much they enjoyed it,” Hari said.
That connection to country and community was nurtured and celebrated in backstrap weaving classes held twice a week in May and June at the Winooski Senior Center, in collaboration with the Heritage Winooski Mill Museum.
The free activity drew 14 seniors from across Chittenden County, including a small group of Nepali women, who learned how to wrap yarn and weave long strips on small hand looms in colors that represent a timeline of their lives, said Miriam Block, executive director of the museum.
“That got a little complicated with the language gap, so we focused on colors from places they lived in,” she said.
Block has a background in textile design and took on a teaching artist role for the summer program. She used a traditional backstrap loom that literally ties the weaver to the craft.
“You could see the pride when people came in to watch their family members weave the way they had weaved in Nepal,” she said. “They weaved together in the refugee camps but many of them forgot it.”

There has been a lot of interest in the Nepali-Bhutanese community about such crafts, according to Block. Last year, some of them participated in a quilting project, each making colorful squares they stitched into a larger piece, which is now displayed in the senior center. Some were quite skilled in tapestry making, Black said.
The project drew their families to the mill museum to learn about the French Canadian immigrants who came to work there a century ago, and they were excited to make the cultural connection, she added. 
It’s been particularly heartwarming to see multigenerational families stroll through the doors to watch or weave this year, said Barbara Pitfido, program director at the Winooski Senior Center.
What started as a fun summer activity grew into something deeper, she said, giving participants a space for connection and creativity, helping them learn or hone a skill and resurrect techniques and memories. Some of the women have taken home the mini looms provided during the project so they can continue weaving.

On Thursday they celebrated the culmination of the weaving project with Nepali and Indian food for lunch.
In Vermont for a decade, Beli Wagley from Colchester said she enjoyed watching her aunties knit. She fingered the familiar patterns on the strips exhibited on a white wall and said it reminded her of the vibrant colors they weaved and wore years ago in Nepal.
“Just by looking at it I can tell the pattern is from Nepal,” she said.
One of the weaves hung on the wall is particularly special, with green and red triangles alluding to Nepal’s flag and the Himalayas, said Wagley, who didn’t participate in the project but came to see what her aunties created. The familiar patterns are reminiscent of how women would weave hats and scarves back home in Nepal.

Some of the colors and shapes are great to make for Vermonters, especially at Christmas, she said, pointing at the mountain-like patterns in the weave made by her aunt Chhali Poudel, 61, who came to the Green Mountain State about a decade ago and lives in Winooski.
Nepal’s flag is the only non-rectangular one in the world, made up of two red pennants with a crescent moon and a sun, bordered by a thin blue line.
Another weaver, Chhali Khadka of Burlington, said, via translation, that she was happy to participate in the project. Khadka, 64, lives in Burlington and came to Vermont 13 years ago via the refugee resettlement program. She used to weave a long time ago and it reminded her of home. She’d like to continue it, but her fingers are too stiff, she said.
Bhutanese refugees of Nepali descent first started to relocate to Vermont around 2008. They were part of a larger diaspora who were forced out of Bhutan amid political violence and ethnic cleansing in the early 1990s and lived in refugee camps in Nepal for nearly two decades before the resettlement efforts. More than 90,000 have been resettled in the United States, The Guardian reported.
As the Trump administration amplifies efforts to crack down on migration, some resettled Nepalis targeted with deportation are once again facing uncertainty and statelessness, according to the Guardian.
Thousands of miles away from the camps, many of the older residents struggle with language barriers and often stay home, isolated and unconnected to the greater Vermont community as they have to depend on family members for rides, said Pitfido. So it was wonderful to have a program that provided materials, transportation and food for a few weeks, she said.
“We are used to working on a shoestring budget, but it was nice to have the right equipment and culturally connected food to bring it all together,” she said.
At the exhibition Thursday, Nepali families shared a buffet of daal, fritters, noodles and more. Food was ordered from the Everest restaurant in South Burlington and cooked by area seniors in the kitchen.
The food, the clothes and the weaves all brought splashes of color to the hall in the senior center.
Some of the Nepali women wore traditional clothing like colorful skirts, sarees and warm fleeces in a bright mix of East and West. Some wore gold hoops, large nose rings and had streaks of red vermillion on their foreheads, a symbol of married Hindu women. 
They chatted in Nepali, ate Indian food on plastic-covered American picnic tables, in a rare show of ease, joy and shared camaraderie in a place they now call home.
Arts projects like these help residents from different cultures find community and connection and help to build resilience. Block said she hopes they will continue to take advantage of such programs. 
The mill museum will offer free natural dye workshops this summer at the senior center on Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to noon. Residents can sign up to learn to dye with marigolds on June 18 and 25, use fresh indigo on Aug. 13 and learn about natural dyes with a garden walk on Aug. 20.
The program was supported by Age Well Vermont, which has funded lunch at the senior center via a federal grant for new Americans. The arts program was funded by a $4,000 creative aging grant from the Vermont Arts Council.
The Arts Council has dedicated approximately $100,000 toward creative aging projects since 2021 and has been distributing money to senior centers, libraries and arts entities across Vermont to encourage arts activities for adults aged 60+, said Troy Hickman, arts education programs manager at the council.
The grant cycle will open in August and he encouraged other entities that support senior programs to apply.

The legislation, which includes an expansion of who must file campaign finance disclosure forms with the state, was looking unlikely to pass late last month.

Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, explains details of an election reform bill on the floor of the Senate at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Monday, June 16. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
The House and Senate both passed a slimmed-down version of a bill that would make myriad changes to the state’s election procedures Monday — even after the legislation, in a different form, seemed unlikely to advance when legislators last convened in full at the end of May.
Election-related bills are often contentious — “because nobody loves to debate elections more than elected officials,” said Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, on the Senate floor just before the chamber approved the bill, H.474, Monday morning. Later in the day, the House passed the legislation, too, sending it to Gov. Phil Scott for his consideration.
That outcome was far from certain, though, after Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, tied the bill’s fate in the Senate to an unrelated Burlington charter change proposal he was sponsoring. (The election bill had cleared the House in March.) Baruth told Rutland Republican Sen. Brian Collamore, who chairs the Senate committee that was reviewing the election bill, not to advance it to the floor unless the charter change advanced out of a House committee.
Fast forward two weeks, and the charter change, which would ban guns from bars and other establishments in the city that serve alcohol, hasn’t moved — but the election bill has. 
Among many other measures, the election bill would require more people to file campaign finance disclosure information and prohibit candidates who lose a primary election from running in the general election under another party, or as an independent. It would also require local officials to perform an audit of voter checklists in House and Senate districts that span multiple towns, a direct response to errors that plagued a Bennington County House race last fall.
Before approving the bill, the Senate stripped a number of measures from the bill, though, including a study of using ranked-choice voting for Vermont’s presidential primaries. Collamore said on the floor that, with the bill facing dim prospects last month, he asked the Secretary of State’s Office — a key backer of the bill — for a list of “absolute, must-have provisions” from the many that cleared the House.
The result of that conversation, Collamore told his colleagues, was the “much-thinned” draft legislators approved Monday.
Rep. Matt Birong, a Vergennes Democrat who chairs the House Government Operations and Military Affairs Committee — which was reviewing the Burlington charter change bill — said in an interview Monday that the city’s proposal, and the election bill, were now “politically bifurcated.” Birong, along with Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas, had previously panned the election bill’s holdup.
Birong added, “the attention it received from the media helped people in the public understand what was going on and helped get this elections bill separated from that political desire,” referring to a VTDigger story late last month on Baruth’s move to link the two measures.
Asked about the legislation Monday afternoon, Baruth said he was “never opposed to the election bill,” but he was frustrated by how the charter change hadn’t moved forward despite getting nearly 90% support at the polls on Town Meeting Day earlier this year. 
“I wanted equal consideration given to the voters of Burlington. It became clear that that wasn’t going to happen,” Baruth said in an interview. “But we wanted to make sure (town) clerks had what they needed … and there was still time to do that.”

The Vermont Senate passed the year’s landmark education bill late Monday afternoon on a 17-12 vote, a majority built on strong Republican support.
H.454 would entirely transform Vermont’s education funding and governance landscape over several years, consolidating school districts and shifting the balance of power over district budgets from the local to the state level. 
The House approved the proposal via a voice vote later in the evening.

Toward the end of last week, Gov. Scott signed into law S.69, a bill that aims to make social media platforms safer for minors.
Known as the Kids Code by advocates, the law requires social media companies like Tiktok and Instagram to adjust their design codes for users under 18 by modifying certain algorithms and features to make them less addictive. Under the new law, social media platforms and other web sites will also have to strengthen default privacy settings for young users.
However, it’s likely the law will face headwinds in the courts, where Big Tech lobbying groups have attempted to tank similar regulations passed in other states in a flurry of litigation. Lawmakers have said Vermont’s Kid Code was crafted with those cases in mind and would likely withstand legal scrutiny.  
​​”With ongoing lawsuits in other states, I recognize this new law will likely face a legal challenge,” Scott said in a statement upon signing the bill. “But I’m hopeful with the enactment of this law delayed until January 1, 2027, it will allow enough time to provide clarity and change the law if necessary.”

On the move
The House on Monday passed S.23, a bill that would require certain publishers of images  generated using artificial intelligence that depict political candidates to also publish a disclosure stating that the content is fake. These “deepfakes,” as they’re often called, would have to be published within 90 days of an election in order for the disclosure requirement to apply. The bill has already cleared the Senate and is now set to head to Gov. Scott.

Meanwhile, the Senate approved a conference committee report Monday for S.51, which would set out tax credits benefiting low-income families, workers and veterans, as well as retirees and people receiving military pensions. Last month, Senate conferees sided with the House’s version of the bill, leaving out their colleagues’ previous proposal for an unpaid caregiver tax credit — a fact that drew some resentment on the floor Monday. 
The package, which is expected to cost about $15 million, will now head to the governor.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — A member of the artificial intelligence data center industry said Monday that South Dakota’s lack of incentives makes the state less competitive for development.
Data centers house powerful computer systems designed to store, process and analyze massive volumes of data.  
Nick Phillips is the executive vice president of external affairs for Applied Digital, which is headquartered in Texas. He spoke at a Rotary Club of Downtown Sioux Falls panel on AI infrastructure. The company is proposing a multi-billion-dollar data center in Deuel County in the northeastern part of the state, and has already built one in North Dakota.
Phillips said North Dakota provides sales tax exemptions.  
“In North Dakota, they exempt the computer equipment, cooling equipment, batteries, things like that,” he said. 
Massive data centers consuming large amounts of energy have eyes on South Dakota

Phillips said the lack of similar incentives in South Dakota means building a data center here can cost up to $400 million more than building the same facility in North Dakota. He said North Dakota is one of 36 states that offers tax breaks on data center equipment.
Phillips’ concerns echoed the debate during last winter’s South Dakota legislative session over a failed bill that would have provided sales tax refunds on data center equipment. 
“These projects are going to other states right now,” said the bill’s sponsor, then-Sen. David Wheeler, R-Huron, who has since resigned to become a judge.
The bill, which failed 17-18 in the state Senate, would have provided sales tax refunds for data centers. The refunds would have applied to items such as computer hardware, servers, routers, cooling and power systems, backup generators, battery systems and more.
During debate in the Senate, supporters of the bill described it as a way to provide “regulatory certainty” that developers need for large-scale projects. 
Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, voted against the bill and noted that South Dakota already offers a sales tax refund program administered through the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. The program requires developers to apply for a rebate. Wheeler said at the time that a guaranteed refund in law would provide more certainty than a program with an application process.
Other opponents, including Sen. Mykala Voita, R-Bonesteel, raised concerns about tax fairness, energy consumption and the cost to the state. 
“We’re always so focused on giving breaks to big companies that can afford it that we forget the people that pay the big lump sum of our state budget,” she said. “So, consider that, please.”

Phillips said South Dakota has other attributes that make it appealing — including a cold climate that cuts down the cost of cooling a room full of hot servers, and abundant wind energy, which is considered one of the most cost-effective renewable energy sources, to help keep operating costs down.
He also highlighted the potential economic impact. Phillips said the North Dakota data center will pay $2.1 million annually in property taxes. 
“In Ellendale, North Dakota, in about a year or so, we will be about five times larger than the next largest property tax payer in the county,” he said. 
Applied Digital’s proposed data center near Toronto in Deuel County would use about 150 megawatts to start and could eventually use about 400 megawatts. Another company is proposing a 50-megawatt data center in McPherson County, near Leola. Phillips said it takes about 20 megawatts to run a city like Madison. 
Nationally, the massive power usage of data centers has caused concerns about demands on the electrical grid and about the impacts to climate change from the use of fossil fuels to produce the electricity.
While data centers’ contribution to climate change did not come up during the panel, Phillips told South Dakota Searchlight “somebody is going to create services like this.”
“And it can be done in places where there are environmental controls, such as here,” he said. “Or it can be done in places that maybe don’t care so much, like China or other countries without controls in place.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EM8A2917-scaled-e1750115615858-1024x686.jpg,,,2025-06-16 20:01:41.177841

District Judge Brent Dishman decided Friday that the group of parents, grandparents and teachers who filed the lawsuit failed to cite any applicable law or rule that was broken when the Oklahoma State Board of Education approved the new standards this year.
Final review of new academic standards, which mandate what topics Oklahoma public schools must teach, rests with the state Legislature, which permitted the new social studies standards to take effect, Dishman wrote.
Additionally, the plaintiffs’ case relied on a section of the Administrative Procedures Act that has no bearing on academic standards, the judge found. The plaintiffs contended the Oklahoma State Department of Education failed to follow proper transparency procedures when presenting the new standards to the state board.
They had asked the judge to invalidate the new standards, which they said “do not align with best practices” and “represent a distorted view of social studies.”
Former Attorney General Mike Hunter, who represents the plaintiffs, said he intends to promptly appeal the district judge’s decision to the Oklahoma Supreme Court.

“This case is an important one for the Supreme Court to be the final word on,” Hunter said Monday afternoon. “It affects hundreds of thousands of young people in Oklahoma public schools. It deserves a review by the highest court in the state, and that’s what we’ll be seeking.”
The state Board of Education approved the new standards on Feb. 27, but half of its sitting members later said they had been unaware the Education Department added new language without drawing attention to it. 
The new language, which the Education Department didn’t publicly post or acknowledge until weeks after the board’s vote, cast doubt on the integrity of the 2020 presidential election results.
State Superintendent Ryan Walters said the district court decision is a victory for pro-Bible and pro-America education. Along with the 2020 election language, the new standards require public schools to teach students Bible stories that influenced the country’s founders and culture.
“Oklahoma kids will be taught facts not indoctrination,” Walters said in a statement Monday. “They will be taught to critically think and not to become liberal activism.”

Clarity last year was about 40 feet worse than in the late 1960s. Runoff from roads and air pollution are leading causes.,"In summary
Scientists and officials say they need to figure out why the famed alpine lake isn’t improving despite decades and billions of dollars in efforts. Clarity last year was about 40 feet worse than in the late 1960s. Runoff from roads and air pollution are leading causes.


Lake Tahoe’s iconic blue waters were the third murkiest on record last year and the worst they’ve been in several years, according to data from scientists who have studied the lake for decades.
Clarity of the alpine lake — measured by dropping a white disk into the water and noting when it disappears from sight — is a signal of its overall health. Tiny particles are major culprits of reduced clarity, including the sediment and other pollutants that wash into the lake from runoff and air pollution and the plankton that grow in its waters. 
Researchers with UC Davis’ Tahoe Environmental Research Center reported today that the average murkiness in 2024 was exceeded only in 2021, when fires blanketed the lake in smoke and ash, and in 2017, when the lake was clouded by sediment-laden runoff during a near-record wet year.
The report says that clarity levels are “highly variable and generally not improving,”  and recommends that “future research should focus on examining the nature of the particles that affect water clarity.” 
In 2024, the white measurement disk disappeared 62.3 feet from the surface — about six feet shallower than the previous year, and only 1.9 feet deeper than the worst record set in 2017. 
Last year’s average clarity was about 40 feet worse than in the late 1960s, when scientists began tracking the long decline. 
Lake Tahoe, surrounded by snowy slopes in the winter and forested trails in the summer, draws 15 million visitors every year to enjoy boating, skiing and hiking — three times more than Yosemite National Park.
It’s the clearest large lake in the world, and one of the deepest. Yet despite billions in state and federal dollars spent to improve Lake Tahoe’s health, its famed clarity dropped steeply through the 1990s and, though it leveled off, has not improved. The 2024 levels fall about 16 feet short of the state’s clarity goals for 2031, and will need to improve by 35 feet to return to historical levels by 2081,  according to the state’s Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board.
“The water clarity is not getting noticeably worse, but it’s also not getting better. So the big question for us now is why.” STEPHANIE HAMPTON, UC DAVIS
“I see something that we should celebrate, which is the success of management and restoration in slowing or potentially halting the decline,” Stephanie Hampton, director of the Tahoe Environmental Research Center and a professor of environmental science and policy at UC Davis, said. 
Still, she added, “the water clarity is not getting noticeably worse, but it’s also not getting better. So the big question for us now is why.”

The lake is clearer in winter than in summer. But last year, both winter and summer measurements were the third worst seasonal measurements on record. 
The winter murkiness came a year after the lake had shown an unusually dramatic wintertime improvement — nearly 92 feet of clarity in winter of 2023, compared with about 72 feet in winter of 2022 — because of deep mixing that brought clear water to the surface. 
The murkiness, however, reappeared that summer. And in 2024, summer measurements brought a mystery: Even after particle levels dropped, the lake didn’t get clearer, “suggesting unobserved factors or more complex dynamics affecting summer clarity,” the report said.
“That caught our eye, because it made us wonder, is there something that we’re not measuring that is affecting the clarity?” Hampton said. One possibility is that tiny plankton — smaller even than the ones the scientists are tracking — could be keeping the water murkier than expected.

“Tahoe is changing in several ways all at once,” Hampton said. As climate change continues, “the water is getting warmer, summer is getting longer, and that could boost some of that growth.” Sudeep Chandra, director of the Global Water Center at the University of Nevada, Reno, said the continued decline of summer clarity means that things are more complicated than previously thought and more research is needed.“Scientists continue to sound the alarm at Tahoe and elsewhere that we need support to not just measure the heartbeat or pulse of the lake by measuring clarity, but also the other vital organs,” said Chandra, who is not involved with the UC Davis clarity research. That includes the watershed and streams, and the lake’s ability to process nutrients and other materials that wash into it, and the effect of climate change on snowpack and drought.
Many environmental and community groups have criticized the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency — a California-Nevada governmental agency created in 1969 to protect Lake Tahoe — for allowing commercial development, tourism and growth.
For instance, the Tahoe Blue Event Center, which opened in Nevada last year, is a multi-purpose, 5,200-seat arena with an expansive luxury condominium development planned across the street. Also, the Village at Palisades Tahoe project in Placer County would add 850 condo and hotel units — nearly 1,500 bedrooms — to the year-round resort. The developer projects that the resort will draw 300,000 visitors a year.

But officials with the Tahoe planning agency have said development projects don’t detract from their efforts to understand and restore the lake and its surroundings.  “The lake is still visible to 60 feet of clarity — it’s incredibly clear, and that’s something that we’ve managed to stop from further harm,” said Jeff Cowen, public information officer with the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. “The clarity loss is like a locomotive where they took the steam off the engine but it’s still rolling along. And to see it stabilize is … a pretty good sign of progress.”
Cowen said roadway work has helped keep more than half a million pounds of sediment from reaching the lake. Nutrients that fuel algae growth have also been cut by thousands of pounds every year, and more than 1,400 acres of improved or restored wetlands help filter out pollutants and reduce erosion. “It is concerning, for sure… We’re leaning on the science and the research, and it’s concerning to see that there are trends that are not reacting to the investments,” Cowen said. “We want to know what more we need to do.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/092724_DRONE-Pollution-Lake-Tahoe_MG_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-16 19:04:20.090427

(Daily Montanan photo)The ACLU of Montana says it should be compensated for the legal work in proving a law that strictly classified residents as either male or female was unconstitutional, even though attorneys for the state claim the attorneys fees are too much. 
The fees stem from Dandilion Cloverdale et al. vs. Austin Knudsen et al, which sought to find Senate Bill 458 as unconstitutional. That law also classified state residents as either male or female, based solely on reproductive capacity.
During the course of that case, the ACLU enlisted Holland and Hart, a large Mountain West law firm that has an office in Billings, for part of the legal work. Holland and Hart also had a separate agreement with the individuals represented in the case, who they performed pro-bono legal work for.
Judge Shane Vannatta oversaw the arguments on Monday. The ACLU is seeking attorney’s fees for both itself and Holland and Hart. 
Numerous bills looking to restrict legal protections for LGBTQ+ people have been found unconstitutional by state courts during the past few years, causing attorneys for the state to fight on behalf of the Legislature’s eventually doomed laws. 
Reforming the state’s judiciary branch was a key focus of the Legislature in 2025, but very few pieces of Republican-backed legislation made it to the governor’s desk.
An expert witness, Missoula attorney Charles Hansberry, who was called during Monday’s hearing, said seeking these fees are, in part, to send a message to the Legislature. Hansberry, who formerly worked for Holland and Hart, mostly deals with large commercial cases, he said. 
“I think it’s important to set the precedent that if the Montana Legislature is going to just pass unconstitutional acts, there’s going to be a price associated with that,” Hansberry said in response to a question from ACLU lawyer Alex Rate. “I also think that it’s important for the ACLU to recover fees in this situation, because it is just step one in this overall trend of attacks on that population. It’s one of the most marginalized populations in the state.”
Hansberry also gave information on the rates lawyers are charging in the state, saying it’s increased as more large firms open offices in Montana. He also noted that following the COVID pandemic, rates have increased as well.
ACLU lawyers said in court there is a stipulation in their agreement that firms can seek money if they so choose. In this case, the money that Holland and Hart collected from their attorney’s fees would be donated back to the ACLU, Rate said while on the stand.
State lawyers called that “double dipping” and also said it was a constitutional violation, saying it was “compelled speech,” because of taxpayer money supporting the ACLU.
“If you award, then ACLU is double dipping, because the agreement is that they’re going to get that donated back to them so they would get their attorneys fees that they charge, and then so, so virtually, what they’re making is roughly about $500 an hour in attorney’s fees,” said Thane Johnson, a state lawyer. “That’s completely unreasonable.”
Patrick Risken, a former assistant attorney general, was brought as a witness by the state and said the ACLU was seeking around $100,000. He estimated they should get between $30,000 and $35,000.
Brianne McClafferty, a lawyer for Holland and Hart, said what the ACLU was seeking was reasonable when considering the importance of the case. They’ve been mostly successful, she added.
“Success is not possible without competent, skilled, capable counsel,” McClafferty said. “The rates that were charged in this case, I believe, as the evidence has shown through Mr. Hansberry’s testimony and through the declarations that have been submitted in this case, were reasonable in light of the importance of this case and the means that this case required.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201220_mslabuildings_tm_024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-16 19:04:20.090427

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A divided North Dakota Republican Party elected a newcomer its new chair Saturday, with a nearly tied vote reflecting a split in the party.
Matthew Simon, vice chair for NDGOP District 8 who met many State Committee members for the first time at the meeting, narrowly defeated longtime party member Shane Goettle for the position.
The NDGOP State Committee, made up of district chairs from around the state, also passed resolutions criticizing actions from the recent legislative session. Republicans hold all elected statewide offices and supermajorities in the Legislature.
“It’s obvious they don’t think much of the governor and the Legislature,” said Speaker of the House Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, who participated in the meeting as a proxy. “That, to me, was very apparent throughout the day. There’s a definite shift in the party.”
With North Dakota Republican Party at a ‘crossroads,’ 3 candidates seek to be chair

Goettle, a former national committeeman who previously worked for U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, sought to bring his experience to the party chair position. Former chair Sandi Sanford did not seek reelection.
It took five rounds of secret ballot voting before a chair emerged, according to those who attended the meeting, which was not open to the public. 
Former lawmaker Judy Estenson withdrew from consideration on Saturday, which led to Goettle and Simon tied at 23-23. Goettle was viewed as a more establishment candidate while Simon saw support from the rising populist wing of the party. 
After lunch, the vote shifted to 24-22 in favor of Simon.
“I think the outcome really does reflect the division of our party, and the party needs to be governed with that division in mind as a reality,” Goettle said Monday.
Simon said disagreements are bound to come up as the party moves forward.
“I was very upfront with my social and fiscal conservative leanings,” he said. “However, I have always been one that has an open ear to anybody that comes with a good-faith argument and is a well-reasoned person.” 
3 Bismarck Republican lawmakers skip local endorsing convention

Rep. Bernie Satrom, R-Jamestown, chair of NDGOP District 12, said he believes the right-wing members of the State Committee have a “general disdain” for Republican legislators and statewide office holders. 
A resolution passed Saturday expresses disappointment with the property tax bill backed by the governor and adopted by lawmakers, calling it insufficient and inadequate. Another resolution criticized the governor for vetoing a library content bill and expressed disappointment that lawmakers failed to override the veto.
“There’s just a general nastiness that’s just not necessary,” Satrom said. “We can affirm protecting our children. We can affirm being concerned about what kind of things they have access to. But it’s really counterproductive to throw the governor and legislators under the bus.”
Satrom added he has not had much interaction with Simon, but he believed his business acumen makes him a qualified candidate.
“I guess it’s going to be interesting to see if he is going to want to unite the party or if he wants to alienate and divide,” Satrom said.
When asked about the potential for Republican Party loyalty tests, Simon said the state party has a limited amount of power over the endorsed candidates and Republican members at the district level.
“As a voluntary association, inevitably there is some sort of litmus test, which is what the party platform is for,” he said. “As far as me standing here and dictating who is and isn’t a Republican, no, that would be wholly inappropriate. That’s not my call.”
Satrom called the right wing of the party “out of step” with everyday Republicans in the state. 
“I don’t think they particularly care for independent thinking and they like to do an educational process to kind of tell people what they should think,” Satrom said.
Advocate for 10 Commandments in schools wins NDGOP support to lead public education

Rep. Karen Karls, Bismarck, chair of NDGOP District 35, called it “worrying” that she had not met Simon before Saturday’s meeting, while there were two other experienced candidates well known in the party.
She said she was offended by some comments made by committee members about state lawmakers.
“I kind of felt bullied, frankly,” Karls said. “No matter how much you tried to reason with people, to explain your point of view, to explain what your experience is, it didn’t matter.”
The meeting also featured about 20 new Republican district chairs, Goettle said, including some who had not previously held leadership positions. He added he respects the results of the leadership election and plans to continue advocating for Republican candidates and the state party. 
“I think new energy is always good and I think there’s a balance between having consistency and new energy, between having reliable, trusted structure versus trying new things,” Goettle said.

(Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)State lawmakers in New Mexico began reviewing their security plans on Monday following the assassination of a high-ranking state legislator in Minnesota.
State and federal prosecutors are seeking murder charges against Vance Boelter, who is suspected of assassinating Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. He is also accused of shooting a state senator and his wife, who are expected to recover. Federal charging documents state that Boelter, while disguised as a police officer, also visited the homes of two other state lawmakers on Saturday.
“House and Senate leadership are working with the Legislative Council Service and law enforcement to review security protocols so that every member of our legislative body can safely perform their constitutional duties and continue the important work of serving the people of New Mexico,” said Sens. Linda Lopez and Debbie O’Malley, both Albuquerque Democrats, in a statement provided to Source NM on Monday.
In December 2022 and January 2023, Lopez and O’Malley — along with New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez and Bernalillo County Commission Vice Chair Adriann Barboa — were targeted in drive-by shootings orchestrated by failed state House candidate Solomon Peña, who is scheduled to receive his prison sentence next month. Barboa did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Martínez and other House Democrats issued a statement Saturday condoning the violence, which noted that, “We have seen far too much political violence in our nation, including shootings at the homes of lawmakers and elected officials here in New Mexico. It is increasingly urgent for all of us to speak up against this violence, as well as the dangerous extremism and misinformation that fuels it.” Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also issued a statement Saturday condoning the shootings in Minnesota.
In their statement, Lopez and O’Malley noted the importance of “public servants at all levels of government” being able “to carry out their duties without fear for their safety or the safety of their families.
“Targeting elected officials threatens not only individual lives but the democratic process itself,” they said.
Lopez and O’Malley offered their condolences to the families affected by Saturday’s shootings and said they stand in solidarity with their colleagues in Minnesota.
“We remain steadfast in our commitment to protecting democracy and the safety of all who serve in public office,” they said.
The U.S. Senate is slated to meet privately on Tuesday to hear from federal law enforcement officials about protection for lawmakers and the safety of their families.
Members of Congress on edge after assassination of Minnesota state legislator

Julian Duque, communications director for U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.), told Source NM on Monday that the congresswoman’s office continuously works with state, local and Capitol Police to evaluate any security threats.
“Political violence has no place in our democracy,” Duque said. “The targeted attacks in Minnesota this weekend were absolutely heartbreaking and horrifying. We hope tensions deescalate. In the meantime, we will continue the work of democracy unafraid.”

Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark announced Monday that she and 54 attorneys general from U.S. states and territories agreed to sign on to a $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma, maker of the painkiller OxyContin, and the Sackler family, owners of the drug firm.
If the bankruptcy court approves the agreement, Vermont will receive up to $21.85 million to  support opioid prevention, treatment and recovery programs. The settlement would also make public more than 30 million documents related to Purdue and the Sacklers’ opioid business.
A bankruptcy court hearing is scheduled on June 18. If the settlement is approved, the case would go to state court for approval as well, according to the attorney general’s office.  
This settlement was reached after the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned the previous settlement, which would have provided about $6 billion to treatment programs and victims of the opioid epidemic but also shielded the Sackler family from future opioid-related lawsuits.
Purdue and the Sackler family agreed to the new settlement in January with a bipartisan coalition of states, including Vermont. The settlement, which resolves litigation over the role Purdue and the Sacklers had in the opioid crisis and ends their ability to sell opioids in the United States, is the nation’s largest to date with individuals linked to the opioid epidemic.
“Purdue and the Sackler family created and perpetuated a crisis that has stolen the lives of our loved ones, neighbors, and community members,” Clark wrote in a press release. “This settlement will never undo the suffering that has touched nearly every Vermont family, but it will hold Purdue and the Sacklers accountable for causing the devastating opioid crisis.”
According to the Vermont Department of Health, the wide majority of accidental and undetermined drug overdose deaths in the state involve opioids. The number of opioid-related fatal overdoses peaked in 2022 with 244 deaths, and then decreased by 22% between 2023 and 2024. 
The settlement agreement states that Vermont’s funds would be divided to allocate 15% to the state,15% to municipalities, and 70% to the State Opioid Abatement Fund to tackle the opioid crisis.
“While we can never be sure about delays or complications that may arise, the parties worked very hard to address the concerns raised by all constituencies to the bankruptcy and the US Supreme Court,” Amelia Vath, outreach and communications coordinator for the attorney general’s office, wrote to VTDigger. “We feel confident about the prospect of approval.”

BURLINGTON — A federal judge has ordered a competency hearing for a California man accused of setting a fire at the Burlington office of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders a little more than a year ago.
Judge William K. Sessions III said Monday in federal court in Burlington that a hearing to take testimony on the competency of 36-year-old Shant Soghomonian would be set within the next 30 days. 
A recent evaluation of Soghomonian conducted by a psychologist raised questions about his competency to stand trial and effectively assist in his defense, Sessions said during Monday’s hearing.
The evaluation has been filed with the court under seal, preventing the public from seeing it.
Michael Desautels, Soghomonian’s attorney, said in court Monday that he wanted a competency hearing set to take testimony from the psychologist who did the evaluation and potentially other witnesses, including Soghomonian himself.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Lasher, the prosecutor, told the judge the only witness he anticipated needing for that hearing would be the psychologist, who is based in California. 
Desautels said his client wanted the psychologist to testify during the competency hearing in person in the Burlington courtroom. However, Lasher objected, and Sessions agreed to allow the psychologist to testify remotely by video from California.

Soghomonian pleaded not guilty a little more than a year ago to a charge alleging that on April 5, 2024, he “maliciously damaged, and attempted to damage and destroy” the building at 1 Church St. in Burlington, which houses the local office of Sanders, Vermont’s independent senator 
Specifically, according to police and court filings, Soghomonian has been accused of setting fire to the entryway leading to Sanders’ office in the historic downtown building. 
The senator was not in the office at the time, according to court records, and none of his seven staffers who were in the building were physically injured.
The building, which also contains other businesses, including a law firm and bank, sustained water damage, and the door leading to the senator’s office was charred, the court filings stated.

No motive for the fire has been revealed through court records or by authorities who investigated it.
Soghomonian appeared in court Monday wearing a green prison uniform and talked at times with his attorney during the hearing. He has been in custody since his arrest shortly after the fire in April 2024.
Soghomonian, who had previously lived in California, had been staying in hotels around Chittenden County in the days leading up to the fire, court records stated.
If convicted, he faces a mandatory minimum of five years behind bars, with the possibility of up to 20 years in prison.

But GOP leaders are hoping to raise the debt limit in their mega-bill since that avoids having to make any concessions to Democrats in order to avoid a default on the debt.",,,,2025-06-16 19:04:20.090427

While the average soil moisture conditions rate 70% adequate for topsoil and 60% adequate for subsoil conditions, some regions of the state have much drier conditions, according the crop progress and condition report prepared by U.S. Department of Agriculture.
In southeast Iowa, topsoil moisture rated 34% short and 10% very short, and subsoil moisture rated 48% short. Southwest Iowa had similar figures, topsoil moisture rated 33% short and 10% very short and subsoil rated 44% short and 11% very short. West central Iowa had topsoil moisture conditions fairly close to the average for the state, but 21% of subsoil in the region rated very short of moisture.

Despite the less than desirable soil moisture conditions, the regions were on par with the state averages for crop emergence for corn, 97% emerged, and soybeans, 93% emerged. Six percent of soybeans across the state were blooming.
Corn and soybean crops continue to rate well, with both at more than 80% good to excellent condition. 
Hay condition was similarly rated across the state and 88% of hay acres have undergone a first cutting, and 16% have already had a second cutting. 
Oats also rated well with an average of 19% coloring. Pasture condition dropped slightly from the week prior to 69% good or excellent and no major livestock concerns were reported.
Northern parts of the state received the most rain during the June 9 through June 15 reporting period, but also suffered from large hail that damaged crops and trees. State Climatologist Justin Glisan said the state had an “unsettled weather pattern” with multiple showers and thunderstorms. 
Glisan said even though the rain was “widespread” the average precipitation was about half an inch below normal.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig noted the storms during the week damaged some crops, but said the overall mix of rain and warm temperatures “helped the crops progress.” 
“As summer officially arrives this week, forecasts are showing warmer-than-normal temperatures and continued chances of storms and widespread showers,” Naig said in a statement.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)All eyes will be on the Senate Committee on Judiciary Wednesday with the panel set to decide on whether to advance a proposed ban on assault-style weapons to the floor for a full vote by the chamber.
The agenda posted for the 10-member panel Monday afternoon lists the companion legislation by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat and Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, among 21 bills up for consideration. 
“We’re really happy to see the bill posted,” Melissa Carden, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence, said in an interview. “The House bill is a good bill.”
Knight’s amended bill passed the House 43-28 after nearly five hours of debate June 5. 
The legislation, which was already revised before advancing out of the House’s Committee on Judiciary, would prohibit the sale and manufacturing of assault-style shotguns, handguns, and rifles beginning July 1, 2026. 
Assault-style firearms purchased before July 2026 would also be exempt from the legislation, along with weapons passed down through family. Violators of the proposed ban would face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and would have to forfeit their assault-style weapons. Gun owners could voluntarily register their weapons with police to receive a certificate of possession under an amendment that has drawn the ire of opponents who say it’s unconstitutional.
DiPalma’s bill is still listed in its original form on the Judiciary Committee’s calendar. The panel is still working on amending the legislation to match Knight’s version, Senate spokesperson Greg Paré confirmed via text message Monday afternoon.
‘The feeling is it’s deadlocked’
RI Gun Rights sees the committee’s Wednesday meeting as their last shot advocates to sway lawmakers from passing the bill, according to a post on X.
“If it makes it out for that committee it will pass the Senate and be signed into law,” the group posted on X Monday afternoon.
Frank Saccoccio, president of the Rhode Island Second Amendment Coalition, said outreach will be crucial to ensuring enough gun rights supporters in yellow shirts turn out g to sway committee members. 
“We just got to get people up there and see if we can hold it back,” he said in an interview. “The feeling is it’s deadlocked.” 
But the likelihood the committee advances both bills remains unclear.
Three Democrats who serve on the committee — Sen. Andrew Dimitri, a freshman Democrat from Johnston, newly elected Cranston Sen. Todd Patalano, and Sen. Leonidas Raptakis of  Coventry — each voiced opposition to the proposal during the initial hearing on DiPalma’s bill on May 14. 
Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat and federal firearms dealer, has also said he does not support banning assault-style weapons as drafted in Knight’s proposal. 
“We know it’s a difficult committee, but there are still ways to get this to the floor for a vote,” Carden said.
Senate President Valarie Lawson, who is a co-sponsor of DiPalma’s bill, could advance Knight’s to the floor for immediate consideration, Carden said. A similar move was done by the late Senate President Dominick Ruggeiro in 2022 to pass the state’s ban on firearm magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
During the floor session June 12, Sen. Pamela Lauria, a Barrington Democrat, sought to move the proposal to the Senate Committee on Finance. The panel is considered to be more favorable to advancing the bill.
But Lauria’s motion was ruled out of order by Senate President Valarie Lawson, herself a co-sponsor of DiPalma’s bill. Carden called Lawson’s decision “disappointing,” but still remains optimistic that a proposed ban will head to the floor where it has the support of 24 of the chamber’s 37 members.
“We’re keeping the pressure on and going to keep advocating,” Carden said. “We know we have majority support.”

The bill — a generational transformation of Vermont’s education system — still requires a majority vote in the House.

MONTPELIER—The Vermont Senate passed the year’s landmark education bill Monday on a 17-12 vote, a majority built on strong Republican support.
H.454 would entirely transform Vermont’s education funding and governance landscape over several years, consolidating school districts and shifting the balance of power over district budgets from the local to the state level. The House still needs to vote on the proposal, scheduled for later today.
Speaking in support of the bill, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, pointed to the backing it had from Democratic leadership in both chambers, Republican Gov. Phil Scott, and the key lawmakers who drafted the proposal.
“That is huge,” he said. 
Yet while top Democrats voiced their approval of the legislation, H.454 passed without strong support from the Senate’s majority party. In the roll call vote, nine Democrats voted in opposition, with seven supporting. Two Republicans voted “no,” and 10 voted “yes.”
Before advancing, the bill had to first survive a procedural attempt to kill it. Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central, argued the legislation under consideration was against the body’s rules because it strayed too far from the House and Senate’s previously approved versions.
While the Senate’s rules experts decided Vyhovsky’s argument had merit, senators ultimately chose to suspend their rules and allow the legislation to proceed for a vote.

In a tearful floor speech, Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, who voted against the bill, decried the Senate’s work on the legislation starting from the beginning of the session, singling out key senators’ focus on private schools. 
“A lot of the public school community felt ignored by our chamber,” she said.
The vote followed a weekend of intense opposition, including from Vermont’s teachers union, the VT-NEA. School board members and district leaders also went public with their disapproval. 
Last week, the six lawmakers tasked with finding compromise on the controversial legislation reached an agreement that also gained the support of Gov. Phil Scott.

Though the legislation proposes generational change, the bill is replete with caveats and contingencies, requiring years of further work until the biggest transitions begin in 2028. Among the most significant moves, H.454 would start to create a new education funding formula, impose class-size minimums and reimagine income-sensitive property tax relief. 
Major work still needs to be done. A task force will craft up to three maps of consolidated school districts over the summer for the Legislature to consider next year. Lawmakers also need to figure out how to allocate money for pre-Kindergarten, career and technical education and special education.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)The U.S. Supreme Court will weigh a jurisdictional question in an ongoing legal fight between New Jersey’s attorney general and the “crisis pregnancy” centers he’s investigating for deceptive advertising under the state’s consumer fraud law.
Attorney General Matt Platkin and First Choice Women’s Resource Centers, a network of anti-abortion centers the state says masquerade as health care providers to lure women considering terminating their pregnancies, are battling over whether a November 2023 subpoena violated the group’s constitutional rights.
The scope of the high court’s review is limited and won’t answer that question. It will decide only whether First Choice’s federal lawsuit can continue before state courts rule on its constitutional claims.
“First Choice is looking for a special exception from the usual procedural rules as it tries to avoid complying with an entirely lawful state subpoena, something the U.S. Constitution does not permit it to do. No industry is entitled to that type of special treatment — period,” Platkin said in a statement Monday.
The center says the subpoena — which sought a range of records including advertisements, representations of its privacy policies, intake forms, and donor identities, among other things — violates its First Amendment rights to free expression, exercise, and association, as well as Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure.
An attorney for First Choice did not immediately return a request for comment Monday.
A federal judge last January denied First Choice’s request for an injunction, directing them to first pursue their constitutional claims in state court, and a U.S. Circuit Court agreed not long after.
The court fight arises from a consumer alert Platkin’s office issued in December 2022 warning of deceptive practices by anti-abortion centers, charging many present themselves as health care providers despite providing no health care and lacking staff licensed to practice medicine.
The alert added that, because the centers are not licensed medical facilities, they are not subject to medical privacy laws like Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act — more commonly, HIPAA — and could share visitors’ health data.
Platkin has sought to enforce the subpoena in New Jersey courts, and a Superior Court judge has so far denied First Choice’s efforts to quash the subpoena, though the court did narrow the subpoena’s scope to limit the disclosure of donors’ names to those who gave through two of the group’s websites.
There are more than 50 “crisis pregnancy” centers in New Jersey, according to New Jersey Right to Life, and most are religiously affiliated.

Melissa Hortman and her husband and attempting the assassination of other lawmakers, makes his first court appearance Monday, June 16, 2025 in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)MINNEAPOLIS The Hennepin County prosecutor will pursue first-degree murder charges against Vance Boelter, the suspect arrested in the assassination of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. Boelter also was charged with six federal offenses, including stalking, murder and firearms charges.
In addition to the murder of Melissa and Mark Hortman, Boelter is accused of shooting state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Both are expected to recover. Boelter visited the homes of two other state legislators who were unharmed, including Sen. Ann Rest in New Hope. The other target has not been disclosed, but officials say she is a Maple Grove representative.
The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office initially charged Boelter with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said the second-degree murder charges were filed on Saturday to obtain a nationwide arrest warrant. These are the highest charges that can be filed through a complaint. Moriarty is now seeking to charge Boelter with first-degree murder, which carries a heavier prison sentence.
The U.S. Attorneys’ office brought federal charges against Boelter on Sunday night. The charges include two counts of stalking using interstate facilities, two counts of murder, and two firearms offenses for the shooting of the Hortmans and Hoffmans. The federal murder charges carry the potential for the death penalty.
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi condemned the attack in a press release.
“These horrific acts of violence will not go unanswered: the Department of Justice will prosecute this suspect to the fullest extent of the law and if convicted deliver severe consequences for his alleged crimes.”
Joe Thompson, the acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, said that the attack likely took months of planning. A list of names and addresses, including many DFL legislators, was found in Boelter’s car.
“It is no exaggeration to say that his crimes are the stuff of nightmares,” Thompson said at a press conference Monday. “It’s pretty clear from the evidence that he’s been planning these attacks for quite some time. There’s voluminous writings, as you’ve seen in the reporting, that were found both in his car and his house.”
The state criminal complaint brought against Boelter states that Brooklyn Park police officers saw Boelter shoot Hortman’s husband, Mark Hortman, before he fled. Officers found at least four firearms in Boelter’s car. Another disassembled gun was discovered in the surrounding area.
At a press conference Monday, state officials shared further details about the charges. Bureau of Criminal Apprehension supervisor Drew Evans said that Boelter cooperated with law enforcement when he was arrested Sunday night.
Moriarty addressed misinformation that has been circulating online following the assassination.
“It is a frightening time we are living in. Political violence is prevalent, and the way we talk to and about each other has raised the temperature to unfathomable levels….As our community grieves, I encourage those out there seeking to create additional chaos to stop spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories,” Moriarty said.
Boelter is expected to make an initial appearance in federal court Monday afternoon in St. Paul.

MONTPELIER —- On July Fourth, Rep. Mari Cordes is leaving Vermont for Nova Scotia in a move that also marks her resignation as a representative. 
“It’s the day of my own independence,” Cordes, D-Bristol, said Monday in a somber, shaky voice. 
As a queer person, a senior and a nurse at the University of Vermont Medical Center, Cordes had a whirlwind of personal and political reasons that spurred her decision to resign and relocate, she said. 
In her job as a nurse, Cordes is personally feeling the effects of staffing cuts across Vermont hospitals, she said. She simply isn’t getting enough work hours — and watching friends and colleagues make the move to Canada has inspired her to do the same, she said. 
As a lawmaker who sits on the House Committee on Health Care, leaving the state while its health care system faces many challenges is heartbreaking, Cordes said. “It’s not in my nature to not fight,” she said as tears welled in her eyes.

But her pain is not without relief. Cordes has feared for her safety as a member of the LGBTQ community since President Donald Trump’s first presidential term, and in her last six years as a representative she’s received two death threats, she said. 
Besides homophobic attitudes, Cordes is also concerned that Trump will slash Social Security. “I am facing a very uncertain future as an elder,” the 66-year-old said. 
Now, she’s looking forward to starting a new nursing job at a hospital in Nova Scotia. The process has been easy, and a good friend of hers recently did the same, she said. Canada is opening up its medical practices to American doctors in response to Trump’s presidency, according to KFF Health News. 
Outside a doorway to the House floor, Cordes greeted Rep. Emily Carris-Duncan, D-Whitingham, who was walking past with a fellow representative. 
Carris-Duncan rested her hand on Cordes’s shoulder. “We only aspire to continue your legacy,” Carris-Duncan said.

(File photo by Getty Images)South Carolina will receive $72.8 million to support drug addition treatment, prevention and recovery as part of a multi-state settlement with one of the nation’s largest pharmaceutical providers.
Attorneys general, representing all 50 states, Washington D.C. and four U.S. territories, signed onto and will split the $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, the longtime owners of the company.
“This settlement doesn’t lessen the pain of the families who’ve lost loved ones to opioid addiction or overdoses, but it’s a huge step toward holding this company and its founders accountable for the havoc they helped create,” Attorney General Alan Wilson said in a statement about the Palmetto State’s portion of the award.
Purdue, notably is the manufacture of OxyContin, an addictive painkiller that has become a prevalent example of the damage caused by the opioid crisis.
More than 850,000 people have died from overdoses related to overdoses since 1999, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And 2.1 million people in the United States deal with opioid use disorder, according to the National Institute of Health.
As part of the settlement the Sacklers will relinquish control of the Purdue.
This latest deal brings South Carolina’s total opioid-related settlement earnings to nearly $750 million, according to the Attorney General’s Office. Large past deals include:

Andy Beshear joined state tourism officials, historians and the CEO of the Muhammad Ali Center in downtown Louisville Monday to unveil a new statewide tourism trail showcasing Kentucky’s Black history and heritage. 
The Kentucky African American Heritage Trail highlights 57 sites, ranging from Hotel Metropolitan in Paducah to the National Underground Railroad Museum in Maysville to the Lynch Colored School in Harlan County.
DeVone Holt, president and CEO of the Muhammad Ali Center, praised state tourism officials for leaning into important aspects of Kentucky’s past while others “attempt to disconnect us from our history.”
Speaking to an audience gathered at the Ali Center, Holt said, “There are messages in our own backyard that resonate deeply and widely with people from all walks of life, and so now we get a real opportunity to be intentional about helping people plug into these stories, helping people understand the significance of many stories and histories that have gone untold and uncelebrated until now.”

While few enjoy the fame and notoriety of Ali, an acclaimed boxer and activist from Louisville, Holt said the people celebrated on the heritage trail “made incredible contributions to the life that many of us now take for granted.” 
Speakers at the Ali Center credited Kimberly Clay, the Kentucky Department of Tourism’s director of cultural heritage, for putting together the trail. 
Yvonne Giles, a historian from Lexington known for preserving African American history in Kentucky’s second largest city, said the trail is an “education” available to all Kentuckians.
“It’s not easy researching. It’s not easy putting together information. It’s not easy to promote what you know is important,” Giles said. “Because of Kimberly Clay, we have a platform that everybody will have access to.” 
Beshear, who introduced speakers connected to Black history sites around the state, said the trail is a commitment to  “preserving these important stories.” 
The Democratic governor also noted Thursday’s Juneteenth federal holiday, mentioning the executive order he signed last year to make the day a state executive branch holiday. Juneteenth, celebrated on June 19, commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. Beshear criticized the GOP-controlled state legislature for “repeatedly refusing to recognize it as a state holiday.” A bill filed last year by a Democratic state senator to make Juneteenth a state holiday did not get a hearing.  
“This initiative is a chance for us to celebrate and educate ourselves about local history that for far too long has been overlooked,” Beshear told the audience. “As visitors experience the new trail, let’s remember why it matters. It’s not just about recognizing the past, it’s about ensuring we don’t repeat it and creating a better future.” 
Information about the tourism trail can be found online.

Free.,Members of Congress on edge after assassination of Minnesota state legislator,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/members-congress-edge-after-assassination-minnesota-state-legislator,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate will gather behind closed doors Tuesday to hear from federal law enforcement officials about protection for lawmakers and the safety of their families, just days after a gunman said to be posing as a police officer targeted state lawmakers in Minnesota.The briefing from U.S. Capitol Police and the Senate Sergeant at Arms follows years of increased funding for both entities as threats and attempted assassinations against members of Congress have become part of the job.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, said Monday on the floor that the suspected shooter had a list of more than 70 public officials he wanted to target, including several members of the Senate.“My highest priority right now is working with the Senate leadership on both sides, the Senate Sergeant at Arms and Capitol Police, to ensure everyone’s safety,” Schumer said. “This weekend I asked Capitol Police and the Sergeant at Arms to increase security for members, including Sen. (Alex) Padilla and the Minnesota senators.”California Sen. Padilla moved to the forefront of the public debate about immigration and deportations last week when he was forcibly removed from a press conference after trying to ask Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem a question while she was still speaking.Schumer said the briefing would be an opportunity for USCP and the SAA to “convey what they’re doing for members to keep them safe.”He urged senators to “come together” to oppose political violence in all forms, before criticizing Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee for social media posts. Lee made two posts that drew condemnation.“I was deeply disappointed and sickened to see a member of this chamber use the tragedy in Minnesota to take cheap political shots at the other side on social media and risk escalating a perilous moment,” Schumer said. “What the senior senator from Utah posted after the shooting was reckless and beneath the dignity of his office.“For a senator to fan the flames of division with falsities while the killer was still on the loose is deeply irresponsible. He should take down his post immediately and apologize to the families of the victims.”On another social media account, Lee wrote, “These hateful attacks have no place in Utah, Minnesota, or anywhere in America.”Suspect faces state and federal chargesMinnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Sunday during an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the attack on the two state lawmakers and their spouses was clearly motivated by politics.Klobuchar said she has received additional security and that she was concerned about the possibility of more attacks against lawmakers.“I have had threats before, as several of our colleagues have had,” Klobuchar said. “And I think one of the things is, we don't talk about this stuff much because you don't want to see copycats that copy exactly what they’ve done.”The suspected gunman, who was arrested Sunday following a manhunt, has been charged by both state and federal prosecutors with murdering state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, and attempting to kill state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife.The suspect went to the homes of at least two other state lawmakers and had a list of Democratic lawmakers’ home addresses as well as abortion providers, according to police.Lawmakers disclose they were on list of targetsThe U.S. House won’t receive a security briefing this week since its members are out of session on a district work period, typically a time when lawmakers are back in their communities for town halls and other public events, though the shooting has led some members to change their schedules.Michigan Democratic Rep. Hillary Scholten announced Monday she would postpone her town hall in Muskegon, writing in a statement she didn’t want to “divert additional law enforcement resources away from protecting the broader public at this time.”“Nothing matters more to me than the safety and well-being of the people I serve,” Scholten wrote. “After being made aware that my name was on a list connected to the recent tragic shooting in Minnesota, my office has made the difficult decision to postpone our planned town hall in Muskegon.”Scholten added she hoped to “reschedule this event as soon as possible.”Ohio Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman released a statement on Monday, announcing that USCP bolstered his security after his name was found among the suspected Minnesota shooter’s possessions.“On Sunday morning, Capitol Police contacted my office to inform me that the FBI had found my name among the evidence collected during the search for a suspect in Minnesota — who is accused of murdering and seriously injuring lawmakers,” Landsman wrote. “Since the suspect was still at large at that time, we worked very closely with the Cincinnati Police Department to arrange for increased security for my family and me.”Texas Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar wrote in a statement posted to social media that she was among the people the suspected Minnesota shooter had on his list.“This was only a day after protestors were shot in Utah, an extremist drove a car into protests in Virginia, credible threats were made against state lawmakers in Austin and a man pointed a gun at protestors here in El Paso,” Escobar wrote.House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and New York Democratic Rep. Joseph D. Morelle, ranking member on the Committee on House Administration, wrote to Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday, urging him to take action to ensure members' safety. “While we differ in many areas related to policy and our vision for America’s future, Member safety must be an area of common ground. Representatives from both sides of the aisle have endured assassination attempts that changed their lives and careers forever,” the two wrote. “Too many other patriotic public servants have left Congress because they no longer felt safe carrying out their duty as elected officials. We must act to protect each other and preserve this great American institution.”Threats on the rise over the yearsMembers of Congress and their families are no strangers to threats, which have steadily risen for years, attacks and shootings.Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband was attacked in their family home in San Francisco in October 2022 by a man wielding a hammer, who was searching for Pelosi, a California Democrat.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La, was shot and severely wounded in 2017 when a gunman opened fire at GOP lawmakers practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game. Several others were injured during the shooting.Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords survived being shot in the head during a constituent meeting in a grocery store parking lot in 2011 when a gunman opened fire, killing six people and injuring a dozen others.Even President Donald Trump, who has extensive Secret Service protection, was shot in the ear last July while campaigning in Pennsylvania. The gunman in that incident killed local fireman Corey Comperatore and injured two others.The union representing U.S. Capitol Police warned more than a year ago that the federal law enforcement agency was struggling to keep up amid an increasingly hostile political environment and staffing shortages.“We’ve never seen a threat environment like this,” union Chairman Gus Papathanasiou wrote in a statement. “Given the profound divisions in this country and this year’s elections, people ask me if I’m concerned and I tell them I am worried — very worried.”Former USCP Chief Thomas Manger, who retired earlier this year, told lawmakers well before the union’s public statement that he was concerned by how few threats against members of Congress were actually prosecuted successfully.Few threats led to prosecutionKlobuchar, who was chair of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee at the time of the hearing, said USCP referred 458 threat cases for prosecution during 2021, with 40 of those leading to a court case. That was out of 9,625 total threats.Just 22 of the 7,501 threats lobbed at members during 2022 led to prosecution, a USCP spokesperson confirmed to States Newsroom at the time.Threats against lawmakers have continued to increase ever since.USCP investigated 8,008 “concerning statements and direct threats against the Members of Congress, including their families and staff” in 2023 and 9,474 in 2024, according to data from USCP.",,,,2025-06-16 18:01:33.791417

Young // State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/state-government/transportation-gets-upper-hand-in-1-3-billion-spending-accord/,"
The chasm in surtax surplus spending was one half of a broader disagreement between the House and Senate on the scope of state aid to the MBTA.
The post Transportation gets upper hand in $1.3 billion spending accord appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","HAVING SPENT the last two and a half weeks running “numbers games,” House and Senate negotiators struck an agreement Monday on how to divvy up more than $1.3 billion in surplus revenue generated by the state’s surtax on household income in excess of about $1 million.
The compromise budget would divide the surplus surtax revenues more evenly than the House had approved but not as close to a 50/50 split as the Senate had backed. The accord includes $716 million for transportation and $593.5 million for education. All six conference committee members signed off on the agreement when they met Monday afternoon to finalize it.
“It really is a compromise. We landed pretty much in the middle,” Senate Ways and Means Chairman Michael Rodrigues of Westport said of the package. “We in the Senate, we focused on whether it’s aid to cities and towns, supplemental Chapter 90, or our RTAs regional equity in transportation, deferred maintenance in our public higher educational institutions, and we’re very happy.”
The negotiated bill could reach Gov. Maura Healey’s desk as soon as Wednesday, when the House and Senate each plan to meet in formal sessions.
Of the $716 million for transportation, $535 million or just shy of 75 percent would go towards improvements and transportation infrastructure upgrades across the MBTA system that mostly serves Greater Boston. That includes $300 million to replenish the T’s budget reserve account, $175 million in workforce and safety funding to pay for implementation of Federal Transit Administration recommendations, $40 million for physical infrastructure upgrades, and $20 million for the T’s low-income fare relief program.
“I feel very comfortable and happy with the final result, particularly that we kind of balance the scales back towards transportation,” House Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz of Boston said.
Whether it was for money for the T or another spending item that needed to be resolved, Michlewitz said that “whether they went higher or we went higher, you know, we got pretty much somewhat in the middle of where we both were.”
“A lot of it was more numbers games,” he said.
The chasm in surtax surplus spending was one half of a broader disagreement between the House and Senate on the scope of state aid to the MBTA. Combining the surtax surplus bill and the annual state budget that remains in conference negotiations (among the same group of six lawmakers who hashed out the surtax agreement), the House would provide the T with about $1.4 billion while the Senate versions would give the agency roughly $820 million total. Both would be in addition to the T’s dedicated portion of the state sales tax.
Last week, the MBTA Board approved a $3.24 billion fiscal 2026 budget that increases total expenses by $222 million or 7 percent. Officials said the agency’s budget deficit is projected at $168 million in the fiscal 2026 budget, compared to $307 million in the fiscal 2025 budget. T officials said in a presentation to the board that the budget assumes a $361 million or 13 percent increase in revenue “due to proposed investments made in Governors H1 budget and FY25 Supplemental Budget, and increased Fare Revenue.” It also assumes a $40 million or 3 percent decline in state sales tax revenue to the T due to “[d]ecreasing consumer sentiment and motor vehicle sales.”
Michlewitz, whose branch had approved about $793 million for the MBTA in its version of the surtax spending bill, said he thinks the compromise bill’s $535 million support for the T “is sufficient for now, but certainly we’ll continue this conversation.”
“Sounds like, from what the numbers have been coming through for FY 25, that we’re going to have another significant surplus discussion at some point next year … and I think we’ll continue to have that conversation throughout the next year,” he said, alluding to last week’s news that the surtax may generate $3 billion in revenue this year. “But I think for now, this is a significant number for us to be moving forward, and I think we’re very happy with it.”
The bill also includes $103 million in transportation-related aid to cities and towns. Among that sum is $80 million for supplemental Chapter 90 aid ($40 million of which is earmarked to help small and rural communities), $16.4 million to address problems with municipally owned small bridges and culverts, and $7 million for the improvement and maintenance of unpaved roads. 
There is also $73 million in the bill targeted for regional transit initiatives. That figure includes $25 million for capital improvements at regional transit authorities, $25 million for workforce recruitment and retention efforts at RTAs, $13 million for ferry infrastructure improvements, and $10 million for “on-demand micro-transit shuttles and Last Mile grants fostering an innovative multimodal transit system.”
Another $5 million would be funneled into “transportation improvements” surrounding the 2026 World Cup, with seven matches planned at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough. Rodrigues previously called the money a “down payment” for “traffic safety concerns” around the tournament games that start in about one year in Foxborough.
The bill’s $593.5 million for education includes $248 million for special education costs including circuit breaker reimbursements to local school district, $100 million for career technical education capital grants, $45 million for workforce, affordability and quality improvement initiatives in the early education sector, $25 million for “high dosage tutoring” to support literacy among students in grades K-3, $10 million to reduce the waitlist for English language learners, and $10 million to support a Holocaust museum in Boston. 
There’s also $115 million for public higher education deferred maintenance costs, including $10 million to modernize labs at community colleges.
The conference committee bill includes a total of $1.39 billion, with almost all of it coming from fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2024 surtax surpluses and much smaller portions of one-time spending stemming from the Student Opportunity Act Investment Fund and the Transitional Escrow Fund, officials said.
The final contours of the surtax supplemental budget will inform ongoing talks around the fiscal 2026 state budget, which is due by the end of the month. The House passed a nearly $61.5 billion budget in April and the Senate passed its own spending plan of just more than $61.4 billion in May. The difference in spending between the two budgets is $70.3 million or about 0.11 percent, the Mass. Taxpayers Foundation said.
Aside from spending though, budget negotiators have a sizeable list of issues to deliberate: the use of one-time revenues to support spending, how much money to provide the MBTA as well as other transportation and education initiatives funded by the income surtax, whether to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to the health safety net program, whether the state should give up some control over alcohol licenses to cities and towns, the specifics of regulating broker’s fees, whether to allow state health care regulators to cap prices for some medications, whether to pause admissions reforms at vocational and technical schools, and more.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)The man accused of killing DFL House leader Melissa Hortman and her husband, and shooting DFL state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, went to the homes of two additional state lawmakers in the early hours of Saturday morning, federal officials said Monday.
Vance Boelter, 57, is facing several state and federal charges for the murders of Melissa and Mark Hortman and the shootings of John and Yvette Hoffman, and related other crimes. The Hoffmans survived but remained hospitalized.
Boelter’s path took him, in total, to the homes of four state lawmakers in the northwest metro of the Twin Cities before he got in a shootout with police officers outside the Hortmans’ home in Brooklyn Park and fled the scene.
Boelter was captured Sunday evening by state and federal agents in a field about a mile from his home in Green Isle, about an hour west of the Twin Cities, following a 43-hour manhunt.
Boelter maintained notebooks with a list of Democratic elected officials, including Hortman and Hoffman, along with addresses and the names of abortion providers. He has been described by those who knew him as a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump, who was facing financial hardship after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Federal authorities say that after Boelter shot the Hoffmans, he drove to a home in Maple Grove belonging to a state representative. Boelter, dressed in a fake law enforcement uniform and wearing a mask, knocked on the door and said “This is the police. Open the door,” according to surveillance footage from the home referenced in federal charging documents.
The representative and her family were not at home. No one answered the door.
Authorities declined to name the representative who lived at the house. Maple Grove is split into two House districts — one represented by Republican Rep. Kristin Robbins, and the other by DFL Rep. Kristin Bahner.
As word spread about the shooting of the Hoffmans, a New Hope police officer drove to the local state senator’s house to check on the lawmaker. The New Hope police officer spotted what looked like a police SUV parked down the block from the senator’s home. Assuming it was another officer dispatched to provide protection, the New Hope officer pulled up next to the SUV.
Boelter was inside the vehicle, likely still wearing the silicone mask that he wore as he shot the Hoffmans, said Joe Thompson, acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota. As the New Hope officer attempted to speak with Boelter, Boelter stared straight ahead and didn’t respond. The officer then drove down the block to the senator’s house, and Boelter left.
New Hope is represented by DFL state Sen. Ann Rest, and in a statement Monday, she thanked law enforcement for saving her life.
“I have been made aware that the shooting suspect was parked near my home early Saturday morning. I am so grateful for the heroic work of the New Hope Police Department and its officers. Their quick action saved my life,” Rest said.
Boelter then drove to the Hortmans’ in Brooklyn Park, the federal charging documents allege. A notebook recovered from his home included notes about the Hortman family and home.
Brooklyn Park police, responding to the same call for protection following the Hoffmans’ shooting, arrived on the scene moments before Boelter fired his gun as he entered the home through the front door. Boelter escaped through the back of the house, and police officers found Melissa and Mark Hortman — and their dog — inside the home with fatal gunshot wounds.

Megan Hunt of Omaha after his annual State of the State Address. Jan. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has endorsed which way the state should lock the clocks, putting his weight behind ending twice-a-year clock changes by using permanent standard time.
In his monthly radio call-in show Monday, Pillen told a caller from Seward that as a farmer in the “pig business,” he’s “spent a lot of time trying to fool Mother Nature.” He said daylight saving time — the current position of the clocks — is a little like that.
“The hardcore reality is you really can’t fool Mother Nature, and that’s probably, in the simplest version, why, if something comes with it, I would be an advocate for having regular daylight time all year round,” Pillen said.
Clocks “spring ahead” one hour on the second Sunday in March (March 9 this year) and “fall back” one hour on the first Sunday in November (Nov. 2 this year).

Nebraska lawmakers considered three proposals this spring related to the position of the clocks and remain one vote away from sending a bill to Pillen. 
As lawmakers return in 2026, they could again consider whether to lock the clocks at daylight saving time (Legislative Bill 34, usually associated with summer and later sunsets) or standard time (LB 302, usually associated with winter and earlier sunrises).
The end-of-session time crunch meant neither LB 34 or LB 302 was rescheduled for a third and final debate. If both bills passed, Pillen would get the final say.
Both bills would require surrounding states to adopt similar laws before taking effect:

Permanent daylight saving time, LB 34 from State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, would require three adjacent states to Nebraska to adopt a single year-round time.
Permanent standard time, LB 302 from State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, would require Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota and Wyoming to adopt legislation for year-round standard time. Multiple senators have said the list should include Colorado, to prevent putting southwest Nebraska on a possible “time-zone island.”

Lawmakers in Wyoming and Colorado have passed legislation endorsing daylight saving time.

Federal law currently prohibits year-round daylight saving time but allows year-round standard time, which Hawaii and Arizona (excluding the Navajo Nation) observe. President Donald Trump has voiced support for ending the twice-a-year clock changing. In April, he urged Congress to enact permanent daylight saving time.
A third Nebraska proposal, Legislative Resolution 33 from State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, would ask Nebraska’s congressional delegation to “take affirmative action to reform the present approach to daylight saving time,” ambivalent on which way. 
LR 33 did not advance from the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee.
The nation briefly had year-round daylight saving time between Jan. 6, 1974, and April 27, 1975, in response to the 1973 oil and energy crisis, which Pillen said he’s old enough to recall.
Pillen said the clock changes are probably not a topic that anybody needs to plant a “flag in the middle of the field on, but, you know, we all have stuff.”

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source New Mexico)New Mexico’s prison system must negotiate with the union representing prison guards before it makes any changes to their work schedule, the state’s labor board ruled last week.
Under their labor contract with the state government, prison guards have the opportunity, by seniority, to submit bids for jobs.
In a prohibited practices complaint filed on June 3, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) alleged that when the New Mexico Corrections Department announced the bids, it “made unilateral changes to the rosters at various correctional facilities around the state.”
At the time, negotiators representing the department and the union were in the middle of bargaining over the work rosters at eight prison facilities across New Mexico.
Stephen Curtice, an attorney for the union, said during a Public Employee Labor Relations Board hearing last Thursday that the parties had agreed on some of the positions that would be included in the rosters.
However, Curtice said, they hadn’t agreed on whether those posts are mandatory, meaning they must be filled, or non-mandatory, meaning the worker in that post can be pulled away to fill another one, if needed.
PELRB Hearing Officer Matthew Huchmala on June 12 issued a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the department, blocking it from conducting the planned post bid until it bargains with the union.
AFSCME Council 18 President Connie Derr told Source NM in an email that she could comment on the ruling but could not be reached by Monday afternoon.
The two sides had agreed on positions at three of the state prisons in Grants, Santa Rosa and Springer, said Art Maldonado, a lieutenant at Southern New Mexico Corrections Facility and statewide president of the AFSCME Local 3422, during a hearing last week.
But they had not reached any agreements about job classification at any prison, Maldonado said.
“These unilateral changes have the potential to jeopardize the safety and security of the officers at the facilities,” Curtice said, because they could impact the workers’ sleep patterns and days off.
Taylor Hartstein, an attorney for the state, argued that it’s difficult to maintain the status quo because the situation inside the prisons is constantly changing. He pointed to 300 people being newly incarcerated at the Guadalupe County Correctional Facility, making the status quo “impossible.”
“The department wants to make sure that people actually get the shifts that they’re bidding on,” Hartstein said.
Deputy Director of Adult Prisons Timothy Hatch said during the hearing he expects guards at GCCF to work in different positions because the department recently opened a second housing unit there and needs guards for it.
“The shift lieutenants are going to have to figure out where to get people to put them in positions for new facilities that we’ve opened,” Hatch said.
In issuing the injunction, Huchmala pointed to the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the Corrections Department, in which the state government agreed to submit any proposed changes to the roster to the union and bargain the changes in good faith.
The department has an obligation to bargain with the union over any changes to the rosters for their facilities, including the resulting shift bids, Huchmala wrote, and all three witnesses in the hearing on Thursday said that didn’t occur in this case.

“I think everybody was shocked and shaken,” Bjornson said.

He said he received several messages from legislators thanking him for taking the initiative. 
Website administrators and information technology staff were able to remove the address field from legislators’ bios and from a contact page quickly. 
Bjornson said a more long-term policy will be discussed next week when legislative leaders meet during the Legislative Management Committee meeting. 
“Security is something we too often take for granted until something like this happens,” said Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot. 
Bjornson said legislators have had the option not to include their home address or phone number with their bio. 
Candidates for public office in North Dakota are obligated to provide information to the Secretary of State’s Office, which becomes a public record.
“Ultimately, we have to follow state law,” Sandy McMerty, deputy secretary of state said Monday. 
While an address must be submitted to show eligibility to represent a legislative district or other geographic area, some candidates and officials use a post office box for a mailing address or for fundraising.

Sen. Ryan Braunberger, D-Fargo, said he has advised candidates considering a run for office about using a post office box and to consider their families when making that decision. 
“I think it’s important that we balance our security over availability,” Braunberger said.
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, said she and her family have taken safety precautions since she began serving in the Legislature, but Saturday’s shootings have likely shaken lawmakers around the country.
“It’s just shocking, but I guess that’s another reality we have to look at,” Myrdal said.
Braunberger said hearing the news of the shootings of the Democrats in Minnesota on Saturday morning did not make him hesitate to attend a No Kings protest that afternoon at City Hall in Fargo. 
“It made me more vigilant about knowing my surroundings,” Braunberger said. He said he had no negative interactions at the protest. The event was interrupted briefly by a truck blaring its horn in the parking lot. 
The suspect in Minnesota, Vance Boelter, was arrested Sunday. The Minnesota Reformer reported that Boelter had a list of potential targets — including Rep. Melissa Hortman who was killed along with her husband, and Sen. Steve Hoffman, who is recovering from gunshot wounds. Abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin also were on the list. 
Rep. Karla Rose Hanson, D-Fargo, who has sponsored bills supporting reproductive rights, said gun legislation she backed created the most negative reaction — including direct threats.
She also attended Saturday’s protest and reflected on the shooting in a social media post.
“The way to express political disagreement is through peaceful protests like today’s event and through the electoral process — never through violence,” Hanson said.

Over the next three weeks the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration is set to hold informal public hearings on a proposed rule to require employers to create a plan to evaluate and control heat hazards in their workplace, and clarify their obligations as well as the steps needed to protect employees from hazardous heat.
Frank Houston, senior state policy manager for Michigan at the BlueGreen Alliance said that while Michigan’s own Occupational Safety and Health Office is great and does try to prioritize workers, there are limitations.
Although employers generally have protections and plans in place for workers to mitigate heat stress and other illnesses-tied to heat, not all employers have good plans in place because they’re not required, Houston said. This places a number of workers at risk, he said, pointing to migrant workers, warehouse workers and farm workers as workers impacted by the lack of requirements.

Christina Hayes, a paid leave organizer with Mothering Justice, which advocates for policies in support of Black mothers, noted her experience working for an airline in the summer.
“You could only imagine the levels of heat that gets inside of an airplane where you’re loading luggages at: Very hot,” Hayes said. “Airlines offer water breaks and whatnot, so they can ride around with popsicles for employees, things like that. But the heat affects everyone, all Michigan workers and mothers are included in that bunch of workers.”
As the federal government hears testimony in support of increased heat protections, members of the “Heat Justice Now” Coalition hope that OSHA will put good national standards in place, Houston said. If not, members are ready to head back to the state administration to push for greater protections.
Derek Dobies, chief of staff for the Michigan AFL-CIO noted that farm workers have been strategically excluded from most labor laws, with the union looking to raise awareness of the threats these workers face.
“We have individuals that are literally feeding our state, feeding our communities, you know, harvesting those crops that are out there, potentially breathing in pesticides, working in extreme heat. And not only do our laws not protect those individuals from heat, but those individuals can’t even collectively bargain for those provisions in a union contract,” Dobies noted. 
While having standards in place at the federal level would be great, Dobies said pursuing those protections at the state level may be an easier route, noting that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration and key lawmakers in the State House and Senate had worked to advance a number of policies to support workers rights. 
“Michigan is one of the top agricultural producers in the country, so we have a role to play in helping to advance heat stress policy to extend collective bargaining for farm workers and so on,” Dobies said.

Three people were still unaccounted for in Wheeling as of Monday afternoon.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey encourages Ohio and Marion County residents to report any property damage to FEMA in order to receive assistance at emd.wv.gov/disastersurvey

“This is a very difficult time for West Virginia,” Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Monday at a press conference in Fairmont. “My heart continues to go out to the families who have lost loved ones.”
More than 40 people have been rescued from the water in Marion and Ohio counties since Saturday.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground, according to Morrisey. A lack of funding of state flood relief money makes West Virginia especially reliant on the federal government when it comes to flood recovery. 
“We want to receive every bit of assistance that our citizens deserve … I’m not going to predict what’s going to happen,” the governor said.
Water ripped through the Wheeling-area and Fairmont Saturday and Sunday.   
Rushing water tore apart the Fairmont Village Apartment building, leaving people’s beds, bathrooms and more exposed to the outside. The building’s 29 residents are accounted for, officials said, and Fairmont State University is housing those displaced individuals. 
More rain is forecast this week as recovery efforts are underway. When asked what the state could do to prevent another round of devastating floods, Morrisey said in some situations, the state was just dealing with Mother Nature. 
Wheeling was hit by flooding last year, and around 200 tombstones were washed out after powerful storms. The flooding in northern West Virginia is the second severe weather event to hit the state this year. In February, deadly flood waters ripped through the state’s southern coalfields, where three people died as a result.
While deadly flooding events are becoming more common in the state — and as dangerous flood zones are expanding due to climate change as well as continuous flooding — leaders have failed to fund efforts that could help prevent the most severe consequences of these events and assist communities in recovering from them. 
Going into the 2025 regular legislative session, Morrisey’s proposed budget included no money for the state’s Flood Resiliency Trust Fund. Lawmakers didn’t propose the funding, either.
“There will be additional discussions with the Legislature and others about the importance of flood prevention … I want to make sure we’re learning from the past,” Morrisey said.

Search efforts continue in Wheeling
Search efforts continue for at least three missing individuals in Ohio County, and the Division of Natural Resources is currently utilizing drones, 4×4 vehicles, dive teams and more.
Three to four inches of rain fell over a 72-hour period Saturday, washing through the areas of Wheeling, Valley Grove and Triadelphia.
“ … Because we saw so much rain in so little time, that caused significant flooding,” said Jason Frazier, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh. “We saw nearby Wheeling Creek within basically an hour, rose about seven feet, and that led to the unfortunate results and damages in that region.”
  Del. Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio
Del. Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio, said, “The entire bottom valley is completely gone or altered. I’m not sure that we’ll ever see it back the way it was before.”
Debris in creeks before the downpour contributed to the flooding, Flanigan noted. He spent time with the area’s first responders over the weekend walking along water banks looking for people’s vehicles that had washed away. 
“The crew I was with, we found 14 cars,” he said, adding that the area’s first responders had worked around the clock over the last few days. 
Holy Family Child Care in Wheeling is offering emergency child care for families who need to clean out their homes.
“Tragedy has hit our community and families are suffering,” said Terra Crews, executive director for Holy Family Child Care.” We want to extend our help to those who are serving those in need or suffering during this time. Having a safe place for their children will alleviate some of the burden they are facing.”
The state Department of Highways has brought in 29 pieces of heavy equipment to the area to work on damaged roads and bridges and clean up massive debris, MetroNews reported. A news release from the city of Wheeling on Monday said Appalachian Power is working to restore power to roughly 1,700 homes after several utility poles were damaged.

Flood prevention fund still empty 
In April, weeks after flood waters killed three people in McDowell County, Flanigan was one of 10 Republicans in the House that voted to put $50 million in a flood prevention fund. 
This measure, sponsored by House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, failed. The fund was set up in 2023 under the State Resiliency Office to help protect communities affected by flooding events and implement recommendations included in the state’s flood plan. Since its inception, the fund has never been allocated money.
“We’ve seen increased flooding in West Virginia than I noticed as a kid. It wasn’t as rapid and wide as what’s occurring,” Flanigan said. “It makes sense we have a flood fund in place. Let’s get it operational.”
In a statement Monday, the West Virginia Democratic Party urged the state to put funding into the state flood resiliency trust fund. 
“In West Virginia, it’s not a matter of if we’ll see flooding — it’s when and where,” said Hornbuckle, D-Cabell. “We have the data, we have the plans and we have a fund already on the books. What we don’t have is the political will from Republican leadership to invest in our people’s safety.”
In 2024, former Gov. Jim Justice asked the state Legislature to approve $50 million for the emergency flood fund. On the final day of session, however, lawmakers axed that line item from the final version of the budget bill. That April, in the lead up to a special session, Justice said he planned to include the $50 million Flood Resiliency Trust Fund appropriation in his call. But when the call came out, the flood emergency funding wasn’t included.
Statewide, only 1.2% of residential structures in West Virginia were insured for flood damage through FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program in 2024, according to data from the federal agency. That data does not include residential structures covered through private insurance.
  Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion
A 2023 report from researchers at West Virginia University found that 94% of West Virginia communities are considered “Special Flood Hazard Areas,” meaning they are at high risk of flooding.
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, said that the recent floods around the state show a need for the resiliency fund. It would make sense to put time and resources into working with local governments on preventative measures, he said. 
“If there are things that can be done with storm water infrastructure, if there are areas where we need to make sure that debris is being removed from certain places — all those things should be options,” he said.

(Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Just over a month after being forced to let an Indigenous man at the Adult Correctional Institutions in Cranston wear a religious headband, the Rhode Island Department of Corrections faces new legal challenges over claims it has refused to accommodate other inmates’ religious practices.
Three prisoners of Indigenous ancestry filed a lawsuit Friday in U.S. District Court in Providence, alleging corrections officials denied their requests to hold religious ceremonies and powwows, consult with a Native American elder, and access traditional religious items such as medicine bags and dreamcatchers.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Tyler Smith, Kyle Moreino and Joseph Shepard by the ACLU of Rhode Island and the Roger Williams University (RWU) School of Law Prisoners’ Rights Litigation Clinic.
By denying the requests, the ACLU claims the Department of Corrections violated the prisoners’ right to the free exercise of religion as protected by the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.
“This is not a new problem,” the lawsuit states. “For years, Native American prisoners have complained about the absence of any religious accommodations at the ACI, but RIDOC has ignored those concerns.”
Such was the case for Wolf Pawochawog-Mequinosh, who is serving a life sentence at the ACI for two first-degree sexual assault convictions. He sued the department in January 2024, claiming prison officials repeatedly denied his request to wear a White Mountain Apache Tribe headband, which was not on the Department of Corrections’ approved list of religious items.
The Department of Corrections agreed to settle the suit April 30, allowing Pawochawog-Mequinosh to wear a headband. The department was also required to establish a way for inmates whose religions are not explicitly recognized by the prison to request approval for religious items and services consistent with their beliefs within 120 days.
So far, the state “has adopted no policies,” according to the new lawsuit.
“We call on the Department of Corrections to fulfill their obligation to accommodate the religious needs of Native Americans imprisoned at the ACI, who for years have been denied all opportunities to observe their religious traditions,” Jared Goldstein, director of the RWU Law Prisoners’ Rights Litigation Clinic, said in a statement.
Department of Corrections spokesperson J.R. Ventura declined to comment on the new lawsuit.

Interim LSU President Matt Lee tapped Tommy Smith, current associate vice president of budget and planning, to fill the position Kimberly Lewis vacated in February. 
“Because I am committed to ensuring stability and momentum for all of LSU, we will be taking a series of steps in the coming days to shore things up for the Flagship campus and the System,” Lee wrote in a campus wide email announcing Smith’s appointment. 
Lewis, who previously served as former Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards’ revenue secretary, served as the university’s CFO starting in 2022 until she resigned earlier this year. Her letter of resignation implied she was asked to step down. 
Several other top administrators – including President William Tate, Provost Roy Haggerty, LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor David Guzick and LSU System General Counsel Winston DeCuir – left LSU within a few months of one another. The departures come as Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has gained control of the state’s four higher education boards. His appointees have taken an unprecedented interest in the day-to-day operations of the state’s universities. 
Smith will supervise the following LSU departments: Auxiliary Services, Budget & Planning, Accounting Services, Risk Management, Procurement and Trademark Licensing. 
A permanent CFO is unlikely to be hired until the LSU Board of Supervisors hires a president to replace Tate, who is taking the same job at Rutgers University. 
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard said members will soon announce a presidential search committee, which he predicted would work over the next six months or so to conduct a nationwide search for Tate’s replacement.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) Louisiana lawmakers are sending $7.5 million into three LSU System institutions to help replace lost federal research funding. 
The Louisiana Legislature usually spends some money annually on higher education research, but Senate President Cameron, R-Metairie, said there was a greater need this year after President Donald Trump’s administration rescinded grants and has proposed a reduction in reimbursements. 
“That hit them flat footed,” Henry said. “The reduction happened and we wanted to make up for that. That doesn’t mean they’re going to get it every year … at least we can stand them back up and let them prepare for future reductions.” 
In its first months in office, the Trump administration has made drastic moves to upend how science is funded. The White House has paused funding for many scientific projects believed to be related to diversity, equity and inclusion and proposed slashing resources for administrative costs related to research funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. NSF is also pausing funding of all existing grants and will stop awarding new grants.
The state budget, approved on the last day of the legislative session Thursday, includes $3 million for the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, $2 million for the LSU AgCenter and $2.5 million for research equipment at a facility LSU Health Shreveport is setting up in a recently acquired former department store. 
“The one-time state funds outlined in the supplemental budget bill are to provide relief for federal funding reductions due to loss of subawards through collaborators whose funding has been suspended, potential reductions to indirect cost rates, or the overhead costs associated with research operations, and possible reductions or terminations of grants,” Pennington spokesman Ernie Ballard said in a statement to the Illuminator. 

While research-specific, line item appropriations were limited to the LSU System, the state’s other university systems received several million dollars in one-time funding for their priorities. 
“Each school has always set individual priorities … Whether or not all of our schools got everything they asked for, I do think schools were generally successful in some of their priorities they set,” University of Louisiana System Rick Gallot said. 
LSU and other research institutions in Louisiana spend close to $1 billion annually on research. The sudden loss of federal funding for university research is expected to have a detrimental impact to Louisiana’s economy. Each dollar spent on research is estimated to have triple the fiscal impact, according to numerous economic impact studies the universities have published. 
The universities will receive the funding unless Gov. Jeff Landry uses his line-item veto power to remove it from the budget, but it is unlikely he will do so.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)For 121 years, the Rhode Island General Assembly has discussed, debated and passed laws in nameless chambers of the Rhode Island State House.
Senate President Valarie Lawson wants to change that.
Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, has proposed naming the Senate chamber after her predecessor, the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio. Ruggerio died on April 21, ending a four-decade career as a state lawmaker, including seven years as Senate president.
“As the Dean of the Senate, and the longest-tenured member of the General Assembly, Senate President Ruggerio left an indelible mark at the State House,” Lawson said in a statement. “Honoring his incredible record of service to his constituents, the Senate, and the state of Rhode Island through the naming of the President Dominick J. Ruggerio Senate Chamber is an appropriate tribute to our dear friend.”
Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, Senate Majority Whip David Tikoian and Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, among others, have signed on to the bill to rename the room “President Dominick J. Ruggerio Senate Chamber.”
Lawson’s bill is slated to get a first hearing before the Senate Committee on Special Legislation and Veterans Affairs Tuesday afternoon. If advanced out of committee, it could come before the full chamber Wednesday, Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson said.
Across the rotunda, the House of Representatives chamber remains nameless. There is  no record of attempts to designate the room for someone, Larry Berman, a House spokesperson said. However, other State House rooms have been named in remembrance of deceased lawmakers, including Senate room 212, named for former Rhode Island Senator Roger Badeau, a Woonsocket Democrat who died in 2008.

The Hennepin County prosecutor will pursue first-degree murder charges against Vance Boelter, the suspect arrested in the assassination of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. Boelter also was charged with six federal offenses, including stalking, murder and firearms charges.
In addition to the murder of Melissa and Mark Hortman, Boelter is accused of shooting state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Both are expected to recover. Boelter visited the homes of two other state legislators who were unharmed, including Sen. Ann Rest in New Hope. The other target has not been disclosed, but officials say she is a Maple Grove representative.
The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office initially charged Boelter with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said the second-degree murder charges were filed on Saturday to obtain a nationwide arrest warrant. These are the highest charges that can be filed through a complaint. Moriarty is now seeking to charge Boelter with first-degree murder, which carries a heavier prison sentence.
The U.S. Attorneys’ office brought federal charges against Boelter on Sunday night. The charges include two counts of stalking using interstate facilities, two counts of murder, and two firearms offenses for the shooting of the Hortmans and Hoffmans. The federal murder charges carry the potential for the death penalty.
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi condemned the attack in a press release.
“These horrific acts of violence will not go unanswered: the Department of Justice will prosecute this suspect to the fullest extent of the law and if convicted deliver severe consequences for his alleged crimes.”
Joe Thompson, the acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, said that the attack likely took months of planning. A list of names and addresses, including many DFL legislators, was found in Boelter’s car.
“It is no exaggeration to say that his crimes are the stuff of nightmares,” Thompson said at a press conference Monday. “It’s pretty clear from the evidence that he’s been planning these attacks for quite some time. There’s voluminous writings, as you’ve seen in the reporting, that were found both in his car and his house.”
The state criminal complaint brought against Boelter states that Brooklyn Park police officers saw Boelter shoot Hortman’s husband, Mark Hortman, before he fled. Officers found at least four firearms in Boelter’s car. Another disassembled gun was discovered in the surrounding area.
At a press conference Monday, state officials shared further details about the charges. Bureau of Criminal Apprehension supervisor Drew Evans said that Boelter cooperated with law enforcement when he was arrested Sunday night.
Moriarty addressed misinformation that has been circulating online following the assassination.
“It is a frightening time we are living in. Political violence is prevalent, and the way we talk to and about each other has raised the temperature to unfathomable levels….As our community grieves, I encourage those out there seeking to create additional chaos to stop spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories,” Moriarty said.

Tim Walz said during a press conference that the shooting ""appears to be a politically motivated assassination."" (Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)The suspect charged in the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband at their home over the weekend had a hit list and various writings that included the name of at least one Michigan official and possibly several others.
Vance Luther Boelter, 57, who was apprehended following a 43-hour manhunt – the largest in Minnesota state history – was said to have had a list of names and a manifesto that mentioned U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids), U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) and U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), various news outlets have since reported.
The first indication that Michigan officials may have been targeted came from law enforcement officials who spoke Sunday night following Boelter’s capture.
Boelter is expected to be charged with first degree murder in the killing of Minnesota House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who died Saturday morning after she and her husband were shot and killed in their home in Brooklyn Park, a Minneapolis suburb.
Boelter is also charged in the wounding of Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, who were shot multiple times early Friday evening in their home in nearby Champlin.

Police say Boelter fled from officers when they confronted him outside Hortman’s home. Inside his car, which he left at the scene, officers found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers, including Hortman and Hoffman, and other officials on it, including prominent Democratic lawmakers from other Midwest states, including Michigan.
“We are in coordination with our federal partners and our fusion centers in those states to coordinate with local law enforcement and the FBI in those states and the state fusion centers that are there to be able to provide that information and notify those individuals that they were on that list,” Drew Evans of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said at the Sunday night press conference.
Although officials have not released the specific names of anyone on the list, Scholten confirmed her name was among those on the list when she released a statement after deciding to postpone a town hall meeting that had been scheduled for Monday night in Muskegon.
“Open, honest dialogue with West Michigan is at the heart of my service – and I will not be deterred from standing up for this community,” Scholten said. “Out of an abundance of caution and to not divert additional law enforcement resources away from protecting the broader public at this time, this is the responsible choice.”
Meanwhile, Rosie Jones, spokesperson for Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) told Michigan Advance that Brinks took “very seriously” the concerns of political violence.
“She is staying in close contact with state and local law enforcement. I defer to the Michigan State Police for information regarding the Minnesota shooter and the latest developments with that case,” Jones said.
The Detroit News reported that Tlaib and Dingell were mentioned in Boelter’s writings, but noted that it was not immediately clear if they were on a hit list or if they were just a part of the many property records and other writings found on his person at the time of his arrest.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island will receive nearly $30 million as part of a national $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, Attorney General Peter Neronha announced Monday.
The settlement was supported by the attorneys general in all 50 U.S. states plus Washington, D.C., and four territories. The settlement resolves litigation against Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers for their role in fueling the opioid crisis, largely through aggressive marketing of the long-acting prescription opioid, OxyContin.
“The role of Purdue Pharma, and the Sackler Family in particular, in the opioid epidemic cannot be understated: together they are responsible for hundreds of thousands of lives lost or damaged, families broken, and communities in pain,” Neronha said in a statement Monday. “Purdue and the Sacklers knowingly pumped highly addictive opioids into cities and towns across America, for the sake of greed and profit, no matter the human cost.” 
Under the pending settlement, Rhode Island would receive over $27 million upfront. The remainder would come over the next 15 years, with funds set aside for litigation costs and possible future proceeds from the sale of Purdue’s assets. Eighty percent of the funds will go to the state general fund for opioid response, while 20% will be shared with municipalities across the Ocean State.
The Sackler family contributes $1.5 billion to the settlement, while Purdue adds approximately $900 million upfront, plus additional payments of $500 million in the first and second years and $400 million in the third year. The $7.4 billion settlement with both the family and company comes after both parties upped their offer following a 2024 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to block a previous $6 billion settlement. That settlement would have absolved the Sacklers of any wrongdoing.
The settlement also ousts the Sacklers from control of Purdue Pharma, and forbids the family from future involvement in opioid sales. 
Purdue Pharma told Rhode Island Current in a statement Monday: “Today’s announcement of unanimous support among the states and territories is a critical milestone towards confirming a Plan of Reorganization that will provide billions of dollars to compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives.” 
“We appreciate the extraordinarily hard work of the state attorneys general and our other creditors in getting us to this point, and we look forward to soliciting creditor votes on the Plan after the disclosure statement is approved,” the statement continued.
The settlement is subject to bankruptcy court approval, with a hearing scheduled for June 18, according to Purdue. The company filed for bankruptcy in March and plans to restructure following the settlement. 
Neronha’s office has so far recovered $312 million in funds from national settlements with drug manufacturers and pharmacies connected to the opioid epidemic. 
“These funds are making a real difference for Rhode Islanders, by, for example, expanding the state’s in-patient and out-patient treatment capacity, and driving down overdose and overdose deaths,” Neronha said in his statement.
The Rhode Island Department of Health reported last week that overdose deaths in Rhode Island declined for the second consecutive year in 2024, following a peak in 2022.

Judge Brian M. Morris, the chief judge of the federal district of Montana, said a claim originally filed by a Helena couple, Johnny and Mary Rutherford, could convert into a class-action claim because of evidence that indicates Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield, which is owned by Health Care Service Corporation, routinely denied claims without following state law that required investigation and documentation before a denial.
Morris noted that the company provided little in the way of evidence to halt the class-action suit.
“HSCS provided no substantive response to Rutherford’s motion for class certification,” Morris noted in order, issued Wednesday.
HCSC told the Daily Montanan that it will not comment on pending litigation.
The lawsuit, filed in Helena, outlines the way the insurance company, which covers tens of thousands of Montanans, routinely denies large-dollar claims, more than $50,000, by a formulaic procedure that intentionally doesn’t ask for documentation or support for medical procedures, and doesn’t use specialists when reviewing medical records.
Attorneys John Morrison and Scott Peterson of Helena represent the Rutherfords, and they allege in court filings that as many as 15,000 claims may have incorrectly been denied by HCSC, which does business as Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield, and that Montana law requires it to perform a deeper medical investigation before denying claims.
In the lawsuit, attorneys say that state law requires all insurers to “reasonably investigate claims based on all available information,” and claims that HCSC didn’t just ignore medical documentation, but routinely refused to ask for it.
Morris, in his order, said that it was reasonable to award a “class certification” status to Rutherford and possibly thousands of others because “if HCSC is required to change its standard operation procedure, each class member would be provided a different level of review, potentially changing the outcome of their claim status.”
Originally, the large insurer had sought to dismiss the lawsuit, or keep it under court seal. But newly released documents in the case show that during depositions — when attorneys question the opposing party — representatives of HCSC revealed the large number of claims it denies, and also those denials are usually done quickly, and rarely, if ever, seek other medical records or conversations with medical providers.
In court documents, attorneys for Rutherford detail that any claim for more than $50,000 is flagged for review as a matter of policy, and that HCSC has more than 10,000 pages of medical policies, with checklists of when to pay claims. During questioning, medical reviewers said they checked only the records that were sent to them to ensure they literally checked the boxes. If they did not, an HCSC employee denied the claim and sent it to a doctor for review.
From there, court records said, a medical reviewer would review the work and the record to make sure the medical record did not meet the requirements. The doctors who were hired to review the work were not specialists trained in the procedures they were reviewing, and they told the court they never asked for more documentation or face-to-face meetings with the doctors who performed the procedures which were denied.
“They are not permitted to ask for additional records. They do not contact the treating provider to ask questions. They do not contact the patient. They do not look at the policy,” the lawsuit alleges.
Dr. Kimberly Warren Ellis reviewed Rutherford’s claim, which involved a collapsed vertebrae in his back, but told attorneys she did not have training in spinal conditions or surgery.
“Dr. Ellis testified that she does not think about or consider the impact her denials have on plan members or their families because, ‘that is not (her) job,’” court records indicate.
Nurse Kelly Dunkirk, who originally reviewed Rutherford’s claim, reviewed 64 “large-dollar” claims, sending 17 of them for review by physicians — approximately 27%. Meanwhile, Ellis on the same day denied 9-out-10 claims, according to court records. According to Ellis’ timecard, she spent less than four minutes reviewing each file.
During the court discovery process, attorneys for Rutherford got a larger look at how the state’s largest insurance company treated claims.
“In the last five years, HCSC says it has denied 15,127 claims in Montana alone as ‘not medically necessary,” the court filings say. “According to HCSC, 3,841 (25%) of these claims were appealed by the (patient); 1,165 (30%) of the appeals resulted in the denial being reversed and the claim being accepted and paid.”
A recently retired employee from HCSC who was involved with handling Rutherford’s claim testified that denying claims was part of the system.
“People usually just wind up paying the bill when a claim is denied,” said Yvonne Hencley.
Attorneys for Rutherford said the HCSC practices specifically violate Montana law which states that “no person may … refuse to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available information.”
While HCSC finally agreed to reverse its decision for Rutherford, state law allows those denied coverage unfairly to continue to seek damages, including suffering or attorneys fees as a way of discouraging large insurance carriers from denying legitimate claims.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stethoscope.jpeg,,,2025-06-16 17:03:44.097371

The House unanimously passed House Bill 1012 in late May, approving another round of aid for the western mountains. It includes long-requested grants for small businesses and money for local governments to rebuild infrastructure.
But the bill has been frozen in the Senate, as Republican leaders from both chambers negotiate a compromise on the state budget. Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) has signaled he would prefer that the Helene aid be part of that discussion.
Democrats plan to use a procedural maneuver and attempt to force the bill to the Senate floor for a vote.
“Senator Berger wants the legislature to recess for two months while hurricane survivors are still living in uninhabitable homes, facing washed-out roads and waiting for their classrooms to reopen,” Senate Democratic leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said in a statement Monday.

But Democrats’ plan, formally called a “discharge petition,” is unlikely to receive the support it needs to succeed. The petition requires signatures from two-thirds of members in order to bring a bill out of committee and onto the floor.
The state of negotiations between the House and Senate remains murky. Budget proposals between the two chambers differ greatly on key topics like state worker raises and taxes.

He works hard and is motivated to make them happy.
So they were at first baffled when Henry, their middle child of five and their oldest boy, didn’t take to academics.
Henry and his siblings were homeschooled in part so they could spend more time with their father, Aaron Dunbar, an air traffic controller with an irregular schedule.
The setup worked well for his two older sisters. Even his younger sister, then a toddler, started picking up knowledge by osmosis. But concepts like letter sounds or days of the week didn’t stick in Henry’s brain.
“When he was very little, it was almost like he was messing with you,” said his mother, Abbey Dunbar, the family’s primary educator. “Because it was like, gone, truly gone. As if we’d never done it.”
The family tried postponing kindergarten for a year, joining a homeschooling co-op and sending Henry to an Olathe public school for special education services.
The services helped, but didn’t seem like enough. Henry, normally a happy, energetic kid, would come home drained and discouraged from spending part of the day in a loud room with classmates who teased him.
Finally, the family turned to Horizon Academy, a private school in Roeland Park that enrolls students who have dyslexia and similar disabilities. Henry is formally diagnosed with a severe auditory processing disorder and appears to have dyslexia based on testing at school.
Dyslexia is common. An often-cited figure is that 20% of people have symptoms, though some estimates are lower. But parents around the metro area told The Beacon help wasn’t readily available.
Horizon serves as a small-scale — and pricey — example of what it looks like to orient education around helping dyslexic students succeed.
Henry, who recently turned 10, has started to thrive in an environment that’s geared toward his needs, with highly trained staff, minimal distractions and tiny classes grouped by skill level.
“It’s less tiring and my brain doesn’t have to worry about all that stuff,” Henry said. “I’m on the same pace as everybody else.”
 Providing enough resources 

A pediatric occupational therapist and mother of three, Kelly Reardon noticed her oldest child, Lily, was slow to catch on to early reading skills.
At first, teachers at her Catholic school in Johnson County weren’t worried.
“I didn’t want to be that hypochondriac parent,” Reardon said. “I would always lean on her teachers to fact check my own perceptions.”
As Lily entered kindergarten, Reardon’s worries grew. Teachers still said Lily was doing great.
“She’d come home and fall apart,” Reardon said. “I know what that means. ‘We’re not actually doing great. We’re just holding it together, barely getting by.’”
In first grade, a teacher validated Reardon’s concerns, prompting her to seek dyslexia testing.
Reardon saw Lily’s diagnosis as a way to explain to others — and to her smart, perfectionist daughter — why it was harder for her to learn certain things and what support she needed.
She also knew she needed more resources. So she enrolled Lily in Horizon Academy’s summer program.
“Lily had come home from camp and said, ‘Mom, can I go to school here next year?’” Reardon said.  “For a first grader to ask to make a change to a new school, that’s a big decision.”
Reardon doesn’t blame Lily’s original school for not having all the support she needs.
”What was more challenging for me was the amount of pressure on me to be that advocate for her and convince myself and convince others that she needed that,” she said. “It makes me sad to think about the other families that have no idea.”
Though families’ first instinct is often to trust that schools will alert them to dyslexia and provide appropriate services, some find the burden is on them to notice the problem, seek testing, advocate for services and search for the most effective school or private tutoring.
Horizon encourages parents to be involved and educates them about dyslexia, but some say the school’s expertise lifts the burden of feeling it’s all on them to figure out a solution.
“Before we found Horizon, we had a lot of fear, because we were kind of carrying it all,” said Abbey Dunbar. “To walk into a place where they’re not afraid at all of these challenges and they see it every day and they know exactly how to help … It’s just kind of that relief.”
 How Horizon works

A walk down the hallways gives a sense of what Horizon Academy is all about.
One section showcases stickers students earn for using vocabulary words in context. Another uses colorful ribbons to illustrate the components of skilled reading. Yet another features photos and descriptions of famous people with dyslexia or other learning disabilities.
“We just want our kids to be aware that it’s only one part of you,” Head of School Vicki Asher said. “We’re going to teach you how to read, but look at all these other gifts that you can develop and nurture.”
The Dunbars are struck by the focus on Henry’s strengths, something the family also leaned into when they realized he struggled with academics. When he spoke with The Beacon, Henry was still excited about getting chosen to drive a robot that day in school.
Henry Dunbar holds his cat, Everest. His parents say he is working hard at Horizon Academy and making good progress with education tailored to his needs (Vaughn Wheat/The Beacon).
They also appreciate the school’s attention to detail — such as not scheduling lawn mowing at distracting times — and the high capacity for tailoring instruction to Henry’s needs.
During the fall of 2024, Asher said Horizon had 117 students and 46 faculty members, less than a 3-to-1 student to teacher ratio.
Although students might meet in groups of 12 or more for homeroom, specials and certain subjects, they study key topics like reading and math in tiny groups with similar skill levels.
The average reading group includes about three students, Asher said, but some receive one-on-one attention.
Reardon said since switching to Horizon, Lily is making progress, experiencing successes and having less emotional difficulty after school because she’s not overwhelmed.
“They’re matching her with kids that have similar missing skills, and then the instruction is taught specifically targeting those skills,” Reardon said.
Faculty members are trained in Orton-Gillingham, a method designed specifically for people with dyslexia.
Gabi Guillory Welsh, Horizon’s director of therapeutic language and literacy, said most of the school’s teachers hold an associate level certification that requires a 60-hour course and 100-hour practicum.
The high proportion of highly trained faculty comes with a high price tag.
Asher said the school raises funds to provide scholarships for 35 to 40% of students. In the past, scholarships have been about $8,000 on average and up to about $17,000. Tuition was nearly $30,000 for the 2024-25 school year and will be nearly $31,000 for 2025-26.
As a business owner, Reardon understands the price tag.
“They’re paying people. They’re providing this expensive training to each staff member that works there to provide the best service to these kiddos,” she said. “Of course it costs an arm and a leg.”
But she worries about families who can’t afford Horizon.
“The worst thing would be ‘I know my child needs to go there, but I just can’t afford that,’” she said.
Horizon is open to students from kindergarten through ninth grade.
The school is looking for students it thinks it can serve well based on its expertise, Guillory Welsh said, often meaning that their primary diagnosis is dyslexia.
Horizon generally can’t serve students who are primarily diagnosed with behavioral or emotional issues, though it finds receiving proper instruction can help with some of those concerns, such as reducing school anxiety.
Students arrive at various ages, often a few years into elementary school.
“Our goal is to bring them in, remediate, rebuild them and then return them to their traditional school,” said Asher. 
For most children, that could mean attending for two to five years.
When The Beacon visited in fall 2024, Horizon had two kindergarten students for the first time and only a few first graders. Meanwhile, there were two whole homeroom classes of fourth graders and two more classes that were mixes of fourth and fifth graders.
Guillory Welsh said that pattern represents a paradox: The best time to intervene is in the early years, but it’s rare to get a diagnosis that early.
“Students have kind of missed that window (for early intervention) by the time they start failing,” she said. “They could have been learning differently.”
 How dyslexic kids learn

After years of struggling to get proper services for her son, also named Henry, Annie Watson knew he needed a way to catch up on his reading skills.
Full-time tuition at Horizon Academy wasn’t an option.
“We couldn’t afford that,” she said. “But we could afford the tutoring — barely.”
Henry Watson, 11, runs track with a club team at Discovery Middle School in Liberty. His mother, Annie Watson, said running is a big part of Henry’s life and has been good for his mental health (Vaughn Wheat/The Beacon).
So Henry started to attend twice-weekly sessions after school, followed by a summer intensive program, both through Horizon. He progressed so well that his regular teachers were confused why he had a special education plan.
Henry’s tutor “saved his life,” Watson said. “That one person, and the fact that we made it work financially.”
Watson thinks one of the keys to Henry’s progress was the Orton-Gillingham method.
Teaching methods that don’t focus on phonemic awareness (the ability to recognize and play with speech sounds) and phonics (the relationship between letters and sounds) make it harder for many students to learn to read — something some state governments are trying to fix.
For dyslexic students, proper reading instruction is especially crucial and they might need more repetition and multisensory teaching methods for the information to click.
Full-time and tutoring students at Horizon learn little-known rules of the English language, like why “forgotten” has two Ts but “traveling” only has one L. (It has to do with which syllable of the root word is accented.)
Recently, Watson said, she and her daughter disagreed about how to pronounce a word. Henry told them they were both wrong, citing a rule so elaborate she wondered if he was pranking them. But when she looked it up, Henry was right about the pronunciation and the obscure rule.
Henry Dunbar, the full-time Horizon student, is at an earlier point in his education. But his parents said they were already struck by his progress.
“It feels so good to be on this side of things, as things are starting to work and things are clicking,” Aaron Dunbar said.
Henry has “been working diligently here. He’s been fitting in so well. He’s made great friends. He’s doing excellent with the teachers, and he’s now reading, which before he wasn’t doing,” he said. “Like he’s actually — he knows how to read.”

That will soon change.
A provision in the new capital budget requires 10 legislators be given a guided tour of the upper reaches of the historic building during the fiscal year that starts July 1. Another 10 must get the same opportunity in the following year.
“It’s a happy day for the institution,” said state Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, who’s been on a mission to ease restrictions that have boxed lawmakers out of the dome. It’s not right, he said, that lawmakers “cannot visit all the places they oversee.”
Schoesler recalled when he arrived in the Legislature in 1992, there were public tours to the loop walkway at the base of the dome and to the cupola. He was up there, along with former colleagues, and the late secretary of state, Ralph Munro, was the guide.
Some access restrictions took effect in 1996. After the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, there were repairs and seismic upgrades that took until 2004 to complete. The Department of Enterprise Services, which manages the Capitol grounds, would have likely restricted access further in that period, an agency spokesman said.

Rules imposed in 2007 effectively barred anyone except top agency officials and the Washington State Patrol from ascending anywhere near the top.
For several years, Schoesler has succeeded in getting language into the capital budget to provide elected leaders some degree of access. Each time, then Gov. Jay Inslee vetoed the provision, citing safety concerns.
It’s not an easy trek. To reach the dome, one must climb three types of metal stairs, with 266 steps in total, according to the Department of Enterprise Services’ policy restricting access. The majority of the path is up a steep, narrow, spiral staircase.
“The Olympia Fire Department has assessed this space in the past, and, among other issues, reported that it could not use a firefighter’s rescue technique in this space or use a gurney to assist an injured person,” Inslee wrote in his 2023 veto message.
Schoesler didn’t encounter opposition this year as the new governor, Bob Ferguson, left in his budget provision and the Department of Enterprise Services did not flag the fire department’s previous concerns.
This year’s wording is different from 2024.
The language vetoed last year would have allowed the director of the Department of Enterprise Services to shepherd any lawmaker and their guest to the peak of the century-old building. It did not cap the number of lawmakers who could make such a request.

This year’s version sets limits. The agency director “must provide an annual guided tour” to no more than 10 legislative members in each fiscal year. They may need to sign a release of liability form as a condition of participating.
The Department of Enterprise Services “is looking forward to working with both the Legislature and the executive branch in implementing dome access,” agency spokesman Adam Holdorf said in an email. And the agency “is working to update the policy on dome access accordingly.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/inside-of-washington-state-capitol-rotunda-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-16 17:03:44.097371

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Amid new restrictions imposed on federal grants that aid victims of sexual or domestic violence, multiple groups from 17 states including Virginia signed onto a complaint challenging its legality. 
In a complaint filed this week against the U.S. Department of Justice and others, several victims’ service groups from multiple states are seeking an injunction on new restrictions that the federal government has placed on the grants. Plaintiffs include the Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance along with entities from 16 other states. 
Since taking office earlier this year, President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted  a range of federal funding in opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and institutions that support transgender people. The new restrictions placed on the federal grants for sexual and domestic violence victims mean that organizations deemed to “promote gender ideology” or operate DEI programs could have funding blocked. 
This goes against how congress established and amended the grants over the years, the plaintiffs argue, as grantees cannot be discriminated against on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or disability. 
As Congress controls the nation’s purse strings, the plaintiffs allege that Trump’s imposed restrictions on the grants overstep his authority. The grants, created over 30 years ago, stem from the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Violence Against Women Act and have bolstered organizations that support victims through legal services, housing assistance and crisis counseling. 


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


Nonprofit organizations like the Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance have tapped into the federal funding to support their programming and assistance to victims. 
“Holding this field’s already very limited funding hostage is unconscionable, and it undermines the fundamental right of all survivors to access safety, justice and healing in the aftermath of violence,” said Action Alliance executive director Kristi VanAudenhove in a statement. 
Jonathan Yglesias, also with Action Alliance, called the restrictions “arbitrary” and “vague.” 
The funding restrictions appear to be in alignment with an executive order Trump issued earlier this year titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.” 
Action Alliance, Yglesias emphasized, does not discriminate against the domestic violence victims it serves. 
He also underscored the role his organization acts as a resource for people as they sort out what types of assistance they may need in a crisis. Yglesias said that transgender people or immigrants have called Action Alliance’s hotline for initial advice following their alleged experiences with sexual or domestic violence to “test the waters,” before they may feel comfortable reporting to local law enforcement or reaching out to hyperlocal organizations. 
Lack of clarity around what the Trump administration would consider “illegal DEI” means grantees could potentially set themselves up for litigation or fines if they accept a grant and are deemed to operate outside of the administration’s impositions on it, Yglesias explained. 
“I think the intent of that message is that ‘your choice is to stop accepting these funds or change your work to fit the mold that we’ve created,’” Yglesias said. 
But before that perceived intention turns into actual consequences, Action Alliance and others in the suit spanning 17 states said they hope an injunction will be placed on the Trump administration’s changes.

(File/Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)Part of the Greenville County jail has reopened to juvenile offenders under state control, with the goal of keeping Upstate youth closer to home and reducing overcrowding at the main Columbia detention center, according to the state Department of Juvenile Justice.
Reopening the Greenville juvenile wing, which closed due to staffing issues in March 2022, will “provide much-needed relief” to the agency’s frequently overcrowded main detention center in Columbia, DJJ said in a news release.
The number of teens at the Columbia facility varies, but the center regularly houses as many as 120 youth, far more than the 72 is was built to handle, agency director Eden Hendrick has said.
The Greenville detention center, when fully staffed, can hold up to 40 children, age 13 and older. The agency relocated four teens  there from the Columbia center last week, according to the agency.
The plan is to gradually move any detained youth who have family in Greenville or Pickens counties out of Columbia and into the 22,000-square-foot Greenville facility, where they can be closer to home. Then, in July, the agency expects to start accepting any new admissions to the facility of youth from those two counties.
SC DJJ to rent jail for youth in Greenville to reduce overcrowding

If the center still has space, DJJ will open admissions to other parts of the Upstate, according to the news release.
Along with relieving overcrowding in Columbia, law enforcement won’t have to transport the teens to and from court appearances, since they will be housed nearby, the agency said. Fewer children means the agency also can start long-overdue renovations to the Columbia center
DJJ won’t operate the Greenville juvenile wing directly. Instead, the agency contracted with Wayne Halfway House, a Tennessee-based nonprofit, to run the facility. How much the nonprofit will receive depends on the number of youth and staff needed to supervise them.
The maximum cost is estimated at $10 million over two years, agency spokeswoman Michelle Foster said in an email. That’s on top of the $657,930 the department will pay Greenville County annually for use of its jail over the next five years, she said.
Bill requires SC counties pay more to jail teens at DJJ. It could lead to fewer arrests.

Greenville County closed the juvenile facility three years ago because it was struggling to hire enough officers for its adult wing.
Overcrowding at DJJ worsened again last year when Richland County, facing a U.S. Department of Justice investigation, also moved its juveniles in custody to the state agency’s facility to focus on staffing the adult side of its jail.
That closure sent 45 more children to the state’s detention center and “only compounded this already bad situation,” Hendrick said in a letter to the Department of Administration asking to reopen the Greenville detention center.
Charleston is the South Carolina county that still operates its own juvenile detention center. Most opt to pay the Department of Juvenile Justice $50 per youth per day to house any pre-teens and teenagers arrested in their area.
In the state budget starting July 1, legislators added a charge of $125 per child per day for the first 25 days they spend at the facility. A trio of state senators introduced the measure to help offset renovating and maintenance costs and to encourage local governments to reduce overcrowding by making fewer youth arrests.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_8410-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-16 16:02:42.731399

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who led the state’s dual civil and criminal charges against contractor Barletta Heavy Division Inc., wants to funnel the bulk of the settlement money into a privately managed fund focused on providing dental care to low-income children in Providence. But Rhode Island House Republicans say Neronha’s proposal violates state law, insisting that only the Rhode Island General Assembly can control revenue derived from settlements. 
Republican Reps. Brian Newberry of North Smithfield and George Nardone of Coventry unveiled a competing plan for the Barletta settlement money Monday. They will formally ask the rest of the lower chamber to back their plan Tuesday afternoon as an amendment to the state’s fiscal 2026 budget.
Floor amendments are characteristic of the often lengthy and fiery debate on the state’s annual spending plan. Newberry hoped that unveiling the idea a day early would get his colleagues on board.
“Leadership will never allow an amendment to pass on the floor that is sort of a surprise,” Newberry said in an interview Monday afternoon. “We want to get out in front of this, and make it hard to vote the amendment down.”

How Attorney General Peter Neronha wants to spend Barletta settlement money 

$10 million to the 6/10 Children’s Fund for dental care and other health needs for children in low-income Providence neighborhoods, to be managed by the Rhode Island Foundation
$750,000 to the AG’s office for investigation and prosecution costs
$250,000 to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, which investigated claims of contamination on the 6/10 construction project




The dispute hinges less on how to spend the money — Newberry and Nardone’s proposal offers a $1 million chunk for pediatric dental care via the Rhode Island Dental Association — but instead, on its oversight.
The Republican lawmakers describe Neronha’s spending proposal as an “abuse of power,” pointing to state law requiring settlement proceeds to be returned to the general fund, which is controlled by lawmakers. 
Newberry also alleges that Neronha has publicly acknowledged the overreach of statutory power in delineating $10 million from Barletta settlement to a fund that would be managed by the Rhode Island Foundation. 
But Neronha says otherwise.
“Directing funds from the resolution of a criminal case brought by this office and authorized by a court to solve severe and unmet oral health challenges for Providence children is well within the authority of my Office,” Neronha said in an emailed response Monday. “We are prepared to defend attempts to argue otherwise.”
Since 2003, the state has required settlement money from multi-state lawsuits be returned to the general revenue fund. A separate section of state law enacted in 2023 addresses “non multi-state initiatives,” creating a new restricted receipts account for money from settlements with opioid manufacturers.
“All settlement proceeds from non-multi-state initiatives, except those deposited in this restricted receipt account pursuant to this section, shall be deposited into the general fund,” the law states.
But Neronha instead looked to the courts for guidance, telling NBC 10 earlier this month that the Rhode Island Supreme Court has upheld his office’s constitutional power over litigation.  
Neronha also pointed out that former Attorney General Peter Kilmartin determined how the $4.1 million share of state settlement money from an emissions lawsuit against Volkswagen.
On Monday, the attorney general blasted Newberry and Nardone for “doing nothing” to combat the crisis over lack of dental care for local children. 
“I didn’t ask the voters for this job to smoke cigars and talk,” Neronha said in a post on social media app Bluesky Monday. “When we see a problem, from Trump’s dismantling of our democracy to severe tooth infection in 25 percent of Providence schoolchildren, we use our authority expansively and we ACT. 
Newberry, in turn, inferred that Neronha was acting like a “king,” and threatened his prosecution powers.
“Yes, he is a ‘constitutional officer’ so without a constitutional amendment we couldn’t eliminate his position, but if we chose we could defund it nearly entirely, and then set up a completely different department of government headed by someone else to handle prosecutions,” Newberry said.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi attempted to remain above the fray, pledging to listen to the debate Tuesday, the same as he would for any other budget amendments.
The Rhode Island Foundation did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
The House will take up the proposed $14.3 billion spending plan at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday.

MONTPELIER — Bill Fraser attended his final City Council meeting as the capital’s longest-serving city manager on Wednesday night. 
Fraser was voted out by the City Council in February and plans to exit the role at the end of the month. Fraser’s ousting followed a potential 24% tax increase that the city decided to prevent by cutting municipal staff, a decision he pushed back on. Councilors also cited a desire for new leadership as a reason to prematurely end Fraser’s contract. 
Fraser’s exit entitled him to a severance package of almost a quarter of a million dollars after the council triggered the involuntary nonrenewal clause in his contract. Kelly Murphy, the assistant city manager, plans to take over the role until a replacement is hired.
“You’re always juggling something,” Fraser said. “We have police, fire, public works, rec, parks, finance, I’m sure I’m forgetting something. There’s just a constant information barrage and push and pull for priorities. Sorting that and keeping yourself on an even keel while facing these pressures, and criticisms.” 
Fraser got involved in local government thanks to his family — his parents were both public educators and his grandfather, Emile Fraser, was a state legislator in Maine — and the Watergate scandal. 
“I was in junior high during the Watergate era,” Fraser said. “We all watched the hearings on television and politics and government just kind of became a thing. So I got interested in it.”
He officially got his start in politics working an internship in the town manager’s office in Brunswick, Maine. 
“You see the people that you help right in front of you,” Fraser said. “You see the results right in front of you every day as opposed to working in state or federal government where you can work on something and it’s hundreds of miles away.” 
After four jobs in local government, including a stint as town manager in Ogunquit, Maine, and a master’s degree in public administration from the Harvard Kennedy School, Fraser became Montpelier’s city manager in 1995.
“One of the reasons I stayed here and my family stayed here for as long as we did is that it was a great place to live and raise a family,” Fraser said. “Also the work has just been really challenging and interesting for a small little city like this. We have ambitious goals and we have people with a lot of values and it’s really never been a dull place to work.”

One of the toughest, and most meaningful moments for Fraser was leading Montpelier through the floods that hit the capital in 2023. Fraser led the city through the flood, which put downtown Montpelier under several feet of water, and cost the city’s businesses more than $20 million in damages. Despite all the devastation, Fraser said residents “showed real resiliency” during that time, noting that 2,000 people signed up on the city’s volunteer list despite only having 8,000 residents.
“They care about the community. They care about their downtown. They care about their neighbor,” Fraser said. “There are differences of opinion about policy and about taxes and budgets and all those things, but when it comes to the health and welfare of the community and each other, people are right there, and that’s one of the great things about Montpelier.”
At the end of Wednesday’s meeting, Fraser said he was not going to miss the late nights and was looking forward to the next chapter in his life. 
“I want to be retired,” he said. “I’m going to vacation, play in a band. Maybe do some part-time consulting or whatever, helping communities, but I don’t really want to work full time anymore.”

(Photo by Annie Davenport/OU Daily)OKLAHOMA CITY –  The University of Oklahoma Board of Regents last week voted to raise tuition for the fifth consecutive year. 
 A 3% increase will apply to tuition and mandatory fees for most undergraduate and graduate students on  OU’s Norman campus and online programs, the university announced. 
Students at the health sciences center will see a 2% to 4% increase for most undergraduate and graduate programs and 10 professional programs.
OU President Joseph Harroz said the average cost for a freshman resident to attend OU is less than six years ago, despite tuition increases, because the university has given more need-based aid and scholarships.
Raising tuition and fees will help the university recruit and retain faculty and staff, as well as expand students’ options for study abroad, undergraduate research and “high-impact learning experiences,” Harroz wrote in a June 12 letter. OU also will use the funds to address critical deferred maintenance projects, he wrote.
The increase will become effective this fall. OU did not respond to requests for additional comment.
In a June 4 press conference, Gov. Kevin Stitt said  a tuition increase isn’t necessary. 
“My gut feeling is, no, we don’t need a tuition increase at this point,” Stitt said. “I don’t think we’ve gotten all of the efficiency out of our universities.”
Key lawmakers also expressed concerns.
“The Senate and Senate Education Committee has been clear for years that an increase is not in the best interest of students,” said Sen. Chuck Hall, R-Perry, the Senate’s budget leader. “Universities should do what they can to help students attending their schools learn while doing everything they can to make it affordable.”
Oklahoma State University won’t see any tuition increases after the Oklahoma A&M Board of Regents voted against it for the fourth year in a row. 
“For Oklahoma State University to keep tuition and mandatory fees flat this year puts students and families first,” said Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, who leads the Senate Education Committee. “As tuition continues to rise nationwide, OSU’s choice to hold the line demonstrates a commitment to affordability without compromising educational quality.”",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/66ea468c03080-1024x650.webp,,,2025-06-16 16:02:42.731399

Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesAs super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.


What’s happening in Georgia: 
Five cases of measles have been reported in Georgia so far this year.
The cases involve two metro Atlanta families who were unvaccinated and became exposed to the virus after someone in the family returned from a trip outside of the state.
The first cases happened in January after someone contracted measles while traveling within the United States, and the virus then spread to two other family members. In May, someone who traveled outside the country became a new confirmed case, with the virus later spreading to a family member.
Last year, Georgia had six cases of measles. Before that, except for 2019 when there were 18 cases, Georgia has little to no confirmed cases of measles for the last 15 years.
“The MMR vaccine remains the best protection against measles,” Dr. Cherie Drenzek, who is the state epidemiologist, said at a recent board of public health meeting.
–Jill Nolin


And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”
In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”
 Outbreak moves north

In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”
Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
As measles outbreaks grow, Trump cuts hinder vaccination efforts

It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
 ‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas

According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 13, there are 1,197 confirmed cases affecting 34 states. Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
Some measles response plans crash to a halt after Trump cuts

There have been 21 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois’ fiscal year 2026 budget into law Monday, taking shots at President Donald Trump’s budget management to defend hard choices state lawmakers were forced to make this year.

The $55.1 billion spending plan set to take effect July 1 is the largest in state history and is supported by $55.3 billion in anticipated revenue, including more than $700 million in new taxes and more than $500 million in one-time revenues.

Democrats approved the budget shortly before midnight on May 31 with only a handful of Democrats opposing it and all Republicans unanimously voting against it.

The budget’s passage came after months of discussion about closing an initially projected $3 billion deficit and growing concerns about Trump’s treatment of state funding in Washington. Pritzker, a possible 2028 presidential candidate, used Monday’s budget signing ceremony in Chicago as an opportunity to draw a contrast between his and Trump’s budgets.

“While the Trump administration goes on Fox News lying about being fiscally responsible, Illinois is showing a better way: Balancing the budget while maintaining the programs that most people rely on,” Pritzker said.

“Congress is about to pass a federal budget that has one of the largest budget deficits ever in a year without a war or a pandemic. By contrast, Illinois is balancing its budget and prudently improving its fiscal condition,” he said.

Pritzker and other Democratic leaders acknowledged that crafting the FY26 budget was challenging but continues to make investments Democrats believe are priorities. Discretionary spending will increase by less than 1% in FY26, Pritzker said. Despite the minimal increase, the FY26 budget still spends about $2 billion more than FY25.

Democrats “ace the challenges and uncertainty head on, and the result is a budget that is truly balanced with no gimmicks,” House Speaker Chris Welch, D-Hillside, said.

But that’s not how Republicans view the budget’s fund sweeps and delayed transfers that free up hundreds of millions of dollars that can be used in FY26.

“This approach sets Illinois up for failure by FY27 and continues a pattern of short-term thinking,” House Minority Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, said in a statement.

Senate Minority Leader John Curran, R-Downers Grove, condemned lawmakers for failing to deliver significant tax cuts since Pritzker took office in 2019 when Illinois’ budget totaled about $40 billion.

“You know it’s a bad budget when it’s based on nearly $1 billion in tax increases and enhancements,” he said in a statement.

The governor also used his broad authority to reduce a pair of technical errors in the budget. The changes lower spending by $161.2 million from what lawmakers passed. 
Tax increases on tobacco and vape products, businesses

The tax plan will raise $709 million in new revenue through what House Majority Leader Robyn Gabel, D-Evanston, characterized as “smart new sources of revenue.” They include new taxes on businesses, sports betting and tobacco and vape products, according to a list provided by the Senate Democratic caucus.

The budget will not raise personal income, corporate income or sales taxes after Pritzker told reporters that he will veto any budget containing “broad-based” tax increases just days before the bill passed.

The largest sum of new taxes – $336 million – are on businesses outside of Illinois that lawmakers call “leveling the playing field” and will require businesses to pay more income tax to the state on their profits.

Consumers will face new taxes on specific items, including taxes on tobacco, vaping and other nicotine products, which are increasing to 45% to raise $50 million. An existing telecommunications tax will also rise from 7% to 8.65% and raise $49 million to fund the statewide 988 hotline.

A new tax on sports bets will charge betting sites 25 cents for the first 20 million wagers and 50 cents for each bet following that. It’s projected to raise $36 million. Sports betting sites FanDuel and DraftKings have both announced they will implement 50-cent transaction fees on Illinois customers in response to the tax.

Short-term rentals will have to begin paying the state’s hotel operator’s tax. The charge is already applied to hotels in the state, and Airbnb already pays it voluntarily, but more companies like Vrbo will now be required to pay the tax expected to raise an additional $10 million.

A pair of tax amnesty programs are expected to raise $228 million. Those programs are meant to incentivize taxpayers to pay overdue taxes.

Fund sweeps, delayed transfers free up more for spending

The budget deploys a series of tactics designed to free up more money for spending in the general fund in FY26 without repeating as a revenue source for the following year’s budget.

It suspends the monthly transfer to the “rainy day” fund for one year, freeing up $45 million for general fund use. Pritzker has taken pride in the fund’s increase in recent years as it’s grown to a balance of $2.3 billion, up from less than $60,000 when he took office. The fund is still estimated to grow by $161 million from interest and contributions from other funds in FY26.

The state will also pause the final transfer of motor fuel sales tax revenue to the road fund in order to free up $171 million. That scheduled transfer was set in motion by the state’s 2019 infrastructure plan, with the sales tax supporting bond debt taken out to complete road and bridge projects. This year was to be the final year of incremental transfers that took place over the past five years.

Juliana Stratton; Rep. Kam Buckner, D-Chicago; House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch, D-Hillside. Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado, D-Chicago, is not shown.


The budget package also establishes a new $100 million BRIDGE fund that the governor can tap into “in the event of unanticipated delays in or failures of revenues.” The measure, an apparent nod to the uncertainty of federal funding amid ongoing congressional budget negotiations, will come from money swept from 57 different funds.

When combined with the tax amnesty program, the fund sweeps and delayed transfers add up to at least $544 million of one-time revenue in this year’s state budget that will not be available in FY27.

Health and Human Services

The most notable change to health care funding is the elimination of the Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults, or HBIA, program that provided certain low-income noncitizens between ages 42 and 64 with state health care benefits akin to Medicaid. Eliminating the program saves the state $330 million, but the $110 million Health Benefits for Immigrant Seniors, or HBIS, remains in place.

“This was part of the challenge that we had to address,” Pritzker said. “It was a program that had been growing significantly in cost. I do believe that everybody should have health care. I also know that we have to live within our means in the state of Illinois.”

HBIA’s elimination comes after a recent audit found the two programs have cost the state at least $1.6 billion since their inception, far exceeding original estimates for the program. Last year, the state put new guardrails in place to limit enrollment into the programs and reduce costs through co-pays and other measures.

HBIA’s elimination also comes as Congress debates a domestic policy plan that could reduce reimbursements to states that provide health care benefits to noncitizens.

In anticipation of broader reductions to health care and Medicaid reimbursements to the state, Illinois lawmakers also increased spending on other health care and social service programs:


$40 million for Federally Qualified Health Centers. These centers could provide care for people who lose coverage under HBIA turn.
$18 million from the General Revenue Fund for five safety-net hospitals in the state’s Medicaid managed care program. Another $100 million from Fund for Illinois’ Future will go to support the Medicaid managed care program at 12 other safety net hospitals.
$60 million for administrative expenses for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. That’s a $20 million increase from FY25 as Congress has proposed requiring states to cover half of administrative costs.
$263.7 million for HOME Illinois, a program created to reduce homelessness in Illinois. Housing advocates calculated that between Home Illinois and other housing line items, the budget includes $354 million in funding. That’s about a $14.6 million decrease from a year ago, which marks about double of what Pritzker proposed cutting in homelessness funding in February.
An 80-cent hourly wage increase for direct service professionals who service individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in community care settings. However, overall flat funding for the program means 305 positions in the program will be eliminated, according to the They Deserve More coalition. Community Care Program workers at the Illinois Department on Aging will receive a 75-cent hourly wage increase.
A new $25 million Prescription Drug Affordability Fund to support certain pharmacies in Illinois in competition against larger pharmacy benefit managers.
$15 million for the Medical Debt Relief Pilot Program that purchases medical debt from patients at a fraction of the total debt.
A $4 million increase for the Department of Children and Family Services aimed at hiring 100 additional staff members.
A child tax credit created in 2024 at 20% of the Earned Income Tax Credit will double to 40%.

Education

The state’s evidence-based funding model for K-12 schools calls for $350 million in additional funding each year, with a portion of that going to a property tax relief fund and the rest directly to schools. The proposed budget fully funds the K-12 education increase at $307 million but does not add $43 million in property tax relief funds.

Funding for higher education operational expenses is only going up 1%. Pritzker had proposed 3%. Democrat budget leaders have said the spending plan includes ways to increase funding by an additional 2% if there are significant cuts in federal funding for higher education, however.

The budget also includes:


A $10 million increase to the Monetary Award Program grants for lower-income college students.
$8 million for a minority teacher scholarship program.
$2.9 million for the state’s Common App initiative to make it easier for high school students to apply to Illinois colleges and universities at one time.
$212 million for Pritzker’s Smart Start early childhood education program.
$21.7 million for the newly created Department of Early Childhood

Others spending areas

Part of the budget package created a new Tier 2 reserve fund that can be accessed if there are violations of what’s known as the federal “safe harbor” law. Lawmakers appropriated $75 million for the fund this year, in line with Pritzker’s proposal. Broader reform to Tier 2 was not considered this spring.

“With this fix going into effect, we're protecting our taxpayers and state workers from future shortfalls that could cost the state much more,” Pritzker said.

Attorney General Kwame Raoul is receiving a $15.7 million general fund increase as his office engages in a growing number of lawsuits against the Trump administration. Raoul told lawmakers he needs more attorneys to handle the cases and a generally growing workload in his office. However, because of declining revenue in other funds, total funding for the office largely remains flat in FY26.

The budget sent to Pritzker included a 5% pay raise for state lawmakers, to $98,304. State law sets the pay for legislators to increase annually with inflation, and lawmakers took no action to stop it from occurring in FY26.

The budget also includes:


$500 million for the Department of Central Management Services and Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity for the Surplus to Success program to prepare idle state properties for economic development.
$17.9 million for the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation to implement a new licensing system
$40 million for immigrant Welcoming Centers
$6.2 billion for Department of Transportation construction projects, including $4.5 billion for roads and bridges.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-16 19:38:39+00:00,CT Mirror,How far did CT’s ‘fiscal guardrails’ move? Depends whom you ask,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/16/ct-budget-fiscal-guardrails-debate/,Did CT reform its budget caps or subvert them in the next biennial budget? Most officials agree the discussion on Connecticut’s savings habits has just begun.,"Gov. Ned Lamont and the General Assembly either eviscerated the budget caps that have generated unprecedented surpluses or barely adjusted them, leaving too little for education, human services and municipal aid.
It depends on who’s talking.
But while the reality lies somewhere in the middle, most officials agree on one thing: the discussion on Connecticut’s savings habits has just begun.
With Congress expected to slash federal aid soon, and with the latest state budget employing stopgap measures to comply with caps, that debate likely will resume soon.
“We created those [fiscal] guardrails, and they’ve worked,” said state Comptroller Sean Scanlon, who served in the 2017 legislature that ended a nine-month debate by creating a bipartisan package of fiscal controls to end a string of deficits and tax hikes. “But they were created during a crisis, when people were tired and frustrated.”
That’s a nice way of saying there wasn’t enough time to consider long-range impacts.
Connecticut has stayed deep in the black since then, adding $4 billion to reserves and using another $8.6 billion in surplus to reduce pension debt.
But over the same eight years, Connecticut has slipped into a new crisis, one of affordability that restricts access to health and child care, housing and other services, said Scanlon, a moderate Democrat from Guilford.
Despite an income tax rate cut in 2023 and expanded relief for the working poor, the state’s own fairness studies show Connecticut’s low- and middle-income households face an effective combined state and municipal tax burden that significantly exceeds that of the wealthy — and the gap is worsening.
Progressives say Connecticut has over-corrected for past fiscal mistakes, saving excessively and strangling core programs, even in times of high inflation or shrinking federal aid.
Conservatives counter the state’s debt is still too high and that any deviation from savings practices is a road to fiscal chaos.
Scanlon says state officials can find a way to balance both concerns, but it may be particularly tricky over the next few years. That’s because legislators pledged in legal covenants with bond holders not to alter the state’s caps dramatically before July 1, 2028. 
“We have to have a long-term conversation adaptive to the moment that we’re now in,” Scanlon said.
New CT budget has critics from across the political spectrum
But not everyone sees the current “moment” the same way.
For the political left, the $55.8 billion two-year budget lawmakers adopted just before the 2025 session closed June 4 offered modest new investments, at best, in long-neglected core services. And that’s hard to fathom, they say, considering the state will wrap this fiscal year with the second-largest surplus in its history — $2 billion plus — and analysts project hefty financial cushions through 2028.
Legislative leaders pledged a $75 million increase in Medicaid rates starting July 1 for doctors who treat the poor then peeled back 80% of that promised growth in the adopted budget. The payment schedule hasn’t been adjusted comprehensively for almost two decades, leaving many insured patients unable to find care. 
Municipal aid and funding for nonprofit social services grew, but towns and nonprofits both lose hundreds of millions annually because state payments haven’t matched inflation for decades.
Hopes for a new $600-per-child state income tax credit aimed at hundreds of thousands of households eventually became a flat $250 payment — and only to families making about $67,000 per year or less. It would distribute about 1/8th of the projected $300 million cost for a full child tax credit.
But with state officials expecting to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from Washington, and with Lamont blocking progressives from increasing state taxes on the wealthy as a safeguard, Connecticut officials were wary to dole out much tax relief.
“The governor chose to protect the interests of Connecticut’s wealthiest communities — including his own — and made only modest adjustments to the fiscal roadblocks at a time when bold, urgent action was needed,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of Connecticut For All, a coalition of 60 faith, labor and civic organizations.
The single-largest investment tied to the new budget was a $220 million endowment created to expand child care services between now and the early 2030s.
But to make that happen, Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority launched the fund outside the formal budget and therefore outside the spending cap — an accounting gimmick decried by conservatives.  
Reluctant to openly exceed the cap, officials also moved some municipal aid outside the budget via borrowing and underfunding guaranteed worker health care benefits, creating a built-in account shortfall before the new fiscal year even begins
“Tampering with the guardrails means they’re not really guardrails — they’re really just ‘guard-suggestions,’” said Carol Platt Liebau, president of the conservative Yankee Institute for Public Policy. “Every time they’re loosened, it becomes easier for politicians to weaken them again, and the special interests have already signaled they can’t wait for a repeat performance.”
Lamont: ‘I’m proud of where we are’
Republican legislative leaders also chastised Lamont, a fiscal moderate and professed supporter of fiscal controls, for circumventing cap limits.
But the governor invited GOP leaders to brush up on history.
“The only people that broke the spending cap were Republican governors, about seven different times,” Lamont said, referring to fiscal emergencies declared between the late 1990s and 2007 by then-Govs. John G. Rowland and M. Jodi Rell. 
Lamont didn’t mention that those emergencies, which allowed spending to exceed the cap, were endorsed by Democratic-controlled legislatures.
Lamont insists Connecticut’s budget controls remain strong but conceded that convincing Democratic lawmakers to adhere to them wasn’t easy.
“I did find that negotiating how much you increase spending and investments is just as tricky with this legislature as it is negotiating cuts, which was the norm about 10 years ago,” he said, rejecting some Democrats’ assertions that the spending cap — which ties budget growth to household income and inflation — can function like “a straitjacket.”
This cap “works on the basic premise that your spending can’t go up faster than your income,” said Lamont.
But the system isn’t as simple as the governor suggests.
Traditionally, a few large segments of the state budget grow far faster than household income or inflation, gobbling up all allowable spending growth and leaving other programs to stand pat or lose funding.
For example, while the capped portion of the budget grew just 7% between 2015 and 2019, required contributions to pensions for state employees and teachers combined increased 36%. 
Medicaid costs have jumped 46% over the last four years, but the capped portion of the budget has grown just 30%.
Still, Lamont says he tries to govern from the center. Spending for human services, K-12 education and municipal aid has grown — albeit not by as much as Democrats want — and Connecticut will again dedicate much of the outgoing budget’s $2 billion-plus surplus toward reducing pension debt.
“That’s what we’ve done in this budget, and I’m proud of where we are,” he said.
GOP: CT’s budget is getting more secretive
Republican legislative leaders say the governor shouldn’t be too proud, because circumventing cap limits fosters secrecy, even as its risks deficits.
For decades, Connecticut has maintained hundreds of accounts outside the formal budget, most holding small sums and serving technical purposes.
But the easiest way to spend more than the cap allows is to create more off-budget funds. 
The governor can openly exceed the cap by declaring a fiscal emergency in writing and securing a 60% vote of approval from lawmakers, which all but guarantees some public criticism.
Launching an off-budget fund takes a simple majority vote, and officials still can claim that cap limits — which don’t extend beyond the formal budget — haven’t been broken.
“At least provide people with honesty and transparency,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield, who noted that off-budget accounts generally don’t receive much attention from state analysts or the news media.
“I think [the budget caps] have been disrespected,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford, who fears rank-and-file lawmakers see them as nothing more than legal orange cones to drive around before the budget can be increased. “I think everyone entering the legislature should probably have to take a quiz on how these budget controls work.”
Progressives: Spending controls are as constrictive as ever
But progressives counter that many officials also pay little attention to the damage being done to core programs in the budget.
For example, Lamont often touts the high marks Wall Street credit rating agencies give Connecticut’s budget controls. 
But progressives note those marks don’t consider how the state treats nursing home residents, students with special needs or families struggling to afford child care. Wall Street wants to know if taxes are stable, budgets are balanced — and if the state will pay its debts to bondholders.
The governor praised new investments in education, which include $95 million more in general aid to K-12 schools next fiscal year and an extra $30 million for special education. 
But the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities says communities effectively lose $400 million annually because state aid hasn’t matched inflation for a decade.
New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker last week chastised Lamont, “whose obsession with the state’s ‘fiscal guardrails’ and belief that urban school districts don’t need additional funding is causing real harm to our students in New Haven and students across the state.”
Lamont administration officials note the governor agreed this spring to scale back a second cap, one that forces legislators to save a portion of income and business taxes on grounds they are too volatile, or fluctuate too wildly from year to year.
The governor agreed to reduce the “volatility adjustment,” which has captured an average of $1.5 billion annually since 2017, by $600 million.
But lawmakers still won’t find it easy to do anything other than save that money, because the new budget falls just $900,000 under the spending cap starting July 1. 
In other words, the $600 million goes back into the budget, but lawmakers can’t spend more than $900,000 of it without bumping into the cap.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, compared the system of fiscal controls to a household that increases its “surplus” or “savings” by spending too little on nutrition, health care and education. 
“It’s not smart, and it’s not safe, he said, adding, “I think we’re at the beginning of this conversation,” about reforming budget caps.
‘Guardrails’ debate could begin this fall
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said the balance between spending and paying off Connecticut’s considerable debts — the state carried almost $80 billion in unfunded obligations and bonded debt entering this year — will remain a “major topic” for some time.
Both he and Scanlon suggested legislators might form a panel of interested parties and stakeholders to offer advice.
But Ritter rejected arguments from those who say the budget controls have been nullified or who insist they’ve blocked any significant new investments in key programs.
“I don’t have the luxury of being as rigid as people who want to write op-eds can be,” he said, adding “the fact that 100 people in our [House Democratic] caucus voted for it showed there was enough give on the governor’s part.”
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, also said savings efforts were not gutted but added he believes legislators need to plan their next step soon. If Congress significantly cuts funding for Medicaid, certain K-12 education programs, and other services later this summer or fall, many will look to state government to at least mitigate that pain.
And that will necessitate more spending.
“The world has changed since 2017,” Looney added, “and we need to have more flexibility.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0604_SR_SessionLastDay_167-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-16 16:02:42.731399

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A bill that would open early childhood classrooms to uncertified adjunct teachers failed to become law this year, but lawmakers could consider it again in 2026.
House Bill 2125 passed the House and narrowly survived the Senate Education Committee, but the legislative session ended without it being heard on the Senate floor. 
The bill’s author, Rep. Clay Staires, R-Skiatook, said he intends to work with senators over the summer with the goal of passing HB 2125 next year. It’s still eligible for consideration when the state Legislature reconvenes at the Capitol on Feb. 2.
The bill would allow school districts to fill pre-K through third-grade teaching positions with adjunct teachers, who are defined as having relevant career experience but aren’t required to have a college degree nor any educator certification.
State law allows districts to hire adjunct teachers except for early childhood and special education positions. Emergency certified teachers, who must have at least a bachelor’s degree in any subject, are required to complete a state-approved training to work with students in early grade levels.

Staires, a former teacher, said his bill could open up more options for district superintendents dealing with a shortage of qualified teaching candidates. HB 2125 isn’t the only answer to the teacher shortage, he said, but it could be part of the solution.
“You and I both assume that the superintendent isn’t just looking for a warm body,” Staires said. “Definitely, they want to get the best person available for that position. And I’ve heard from some superintendents that there are very good people that they could choose from, but right now the law doesn’t allow it.”
The bill faced pushback, including from the state’s largest teacher union, over objections to lowering the qualifications to teach at a critical point in a child’s education.
The leader of the Senate Education Committee was among the bill’s opponents. 
Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, said adjunct teachers could be a quality option at higher grade levels, like an engineer teaching a science or math class, but lower elementary classrooms need educators who are trained to teach the foundations of reading and math skills.

Lawmakers in recent years have increased requirements for current and future teachers to be trained in the science of reading, which emphasizes phonics. Allowing candidates without that expertise into early childhood classrooms seems like “taking a step backwards,” Pugh said, especially when considering Oklahoma’s poor reading scores and high numbers of emergency certified teachers. 
“In this particular stage (of a child’s education), I felt like you need the people who are trained properly and who know how to engage the classroom,” Pugh said. “That’s a specific skill set.”
The Senate Education Committee approved an amendment to HB 2125 that would require adjunct candidates to complete a science of reading training by the end of their second year in the classroom. Pugh noted during committee debate, though, that students are “toast” if they have an early childhood teacher who hasn’t yet completed any training.
Staires said he is open to adding a certain number of training hours or specific courses to the bill for adjunct teachers to complete.
“What I’m hearing from superintendents (is), yes, there is technical training that is very important,” Staires said. “But the superintendents I’m talking with are saying that’s something we can train them. What we can’t train is love for children and a love for teaching.”
HB 2125 could be considered on the Senate floor next year. Staires said he is confident the policy will pass both chambers of the state Legislature.

Melissa Hartman talks to colleagues during a special legislative session Monday, June 9, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Leaders in Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives offered a moment of silence for Minnesota Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, who were shot and killed on Saturday morning in what authorities are calling an assassination.
“I know so many of us did not have the pleasure of meeting Melissa and Mark and knowing them personally,” House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) said on Monday. “However, there’s pain collectively in our hearts this afternoon, as we begin a week of legislative session.”
Hortman, who was among the most influential Minnesota elected officials of the past decade, died on Saturday morning after a man impersonating a police officer shot her in her Brooklyn Park home, Gov. Tim Walz said.
Vance Boelter was arrested on Sunday night for the assassination of Hortman, and her husband and the shooting of Democratic-Farmer-Labor state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Multiple federal charges were filed against Boelter on Monday.
As McClinton offered prayers for the victims, their families, and the communities they serve, she described the violence as “more than an attack on solely two elected officials.”
“It was an attack on the democratic ideals that our nation was founded on and that each of us collectively represent every day,” McClinton said.
McClinton referenced Gov. Josh Shapiro being the target of an arson attack at the Governor’s Residence earlier this past April, as well as the two assassination attempts on Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign as other examples of political violence that should be condemned.
“They can not become commonplace,” McClinton said. “Now is an opportunity for us to stand together in condemning these cowardly acts of political violence and to commit to treating each other with dignity and respect.”
House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery), described the attacks as “immoral, unconscionable. It is a threat to our great democracy.”
“The dangers of political violence have become all too real in recent days, whether targeted at then a former president, now our current president, or our current governor, simply this type of evil knows no party,” Bradford said.
“If you love our country, you cannot hate your political enemies,” Bradford said, and added that the nation has seen “too much of this in the last few years.”
“It is the obligation of all political leaders, regardless of party, to condemn it without equivocation, without false equivalency,” he said. “It is simply the work of evil. It reminds us all of the need for civility, grace and kindness, not just towards each other, not within just this building, but within our society.”
House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford), also offered his condolences to the people of Minnesota.
“We have spoken on tragedies in this chamber on too many occasions over my past decade in office,” Topper said. “We always know that there will be madness and evil and the acts of disturbed individuals in the world. But I think what we also know is that the relationships that are built among colleagues, among our constituents: these are great forces of light that can shine in times of darkness.”
“I can only say that moving forward, we cannot become so consumed with what we see in the hatred and the evil in the world that we lose that sense of relationship and that purpose with one another,” Topper added.
Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (D-Philadelphia) sent out a co-sponsorship memo on Monday about his plans to introduce legislation designed to keep candidates and public officials safe.
“In September 2024, the Federal Election Commission voted to allow federal candidates and officeholders to use campaign funds on professional security personnel and services,” Kenyatta writes. “However, this new rule does not cover state candidates and officeholders.”
“To extend such protections to state-level candidates and officeholders, I will be introducing a legislative package that includes allowing for the use of campaign funds for these services. This will ensure that public servants in our state have access to security services if needed, regardless of their means,” he added. “Political violence threatens the free and fair functioning of democracy at every level of government. I ask that you sign on to support this important public safety measure.”
Boelter is a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump and opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights, according to interviews with his childhood friend and videos of his sermons posted online. A list of potential targets — including Hoffman and Hortman — included abortion providers and other Democratic elected officials from Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Trump condemned the violence as “horrific,” according to an ABC News report on Sunday, although he also accused Walz of being a “terrible governor” and said he “may call him” after the attacks.

Free.,Trump directs ICE to target 3 big Democratic cities for raids,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-directs-ice-target-3-big-democratic-cities-raids,,"WASHINGTON —  President Donald Trump announced late Sunday that he was directing U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement officers to conduct immigration raids in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, the nation’s three most populous cities that are all led by elected Democrats in heavily Democratic states.The announcement escalates a week-long conflict in Los Angeles, where large protests started after immigration officials began arresting day laborers at Home Depot stores across the city. Trump directed 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to LA amid the protests without California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s consent.“I want ICE, Border Patrol, and our Great and Patriotic Law Enforcement Officers, to FOCUS on our crime ridden and deadly Inner Cities, and those places where Sanctuary Cities play such a big role,” Trump wrote on social media, referring to cities that don’t coordinate with federal immigration officials for civil enforcement. “You don’t hear about Sanctuary Cities in our Heartland!”Trump’s Sunday social media post to target immigration enforcement in cities came after a June 12 post in which he acknowledged that his immigration crackdown was harming the tourism and agriculture industries. Republican-leaning states generally have fewer big cities and more rural areas.“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” Trump wrote last week.The president directed ICE to pause raids on farms, after speaking with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, according to the New York Times.The Agriculture Department has estimated that roughly 40% of farm workers do not have legal authorization.However, advocates for farmworkers, such as United Farm Workers, said that immigration officials have not paused on enforcement.“If President Trump is actually in charge, he needs to prove it: stop the sweeps on hardworking Californians,” UFW said in a statement.A June 10 immigration raid at a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, where roughly 80 workers were detained, set off several protests in the city.Trump wrote in his social media post that it should be taken as a presidential directive.“ICE Officers are herewith ordered, by notice of this TRUTH, to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,” he wrote.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to States Newsroom’s request about details on the president’s Sunday directive to ICE officers.Noncitizen votingTrump took aim at Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, saying during an interview at the G7 Summit with world leaders in Canada on Monday that Chicago was “overrun with criminals.”“They think they're going to use them to vote,” Trump said of people without citizenship who live in cities run by Democrats.The president, without evidence, claimed in his Sunday post that the “Core of the Democrat power center” of Chicago, Los Angeles and New York allowed people without citizenship to vote in federal elections, which is not true. The practice is illegal and, according to studies, exceedingly rare.A federal judge last week blocked Trump’s executive order that would have required states to mandate voters in federal elections provide documents proving their citizenship.Last week, Pritzker and the Democratic governors of Minnesota and New York testified before Congress for eight hours on their states’ policies to not coordinate with federal immigration officials.House Republicans brought in the mayors of Boston, Chicago and Denver in March on the same issue.Focus for protestsThe president’s directive to ICE followed a weekend military parade to celebrate the Army’s 250th anniversary that also coincided with Trump's 79th birthday and sparked anti-Trump protests.Millions of people across the country held “No Kings” protests against the Trump administration, according to estimates from organizers. The protests often included rebukes of ICE’s aggressive immigration crackdown.The protests in LA, which have led to a legal standoff between the administration and the state, have been over immigration raids.Since returning to the White House, the Trump administration has given immigration officers expanded authority to rapidly deport immigrants.In Trump’s second week in office, DHS reinstated a 2019 policy known as expedited removal, meaning that immigrants without legal authorization anywhere in the country who encounter federal enforcement must prove they have been in the U.S. continuously for more than two years.If they cannot produce that proof, they will be subject to a fast-track deportation without appearing before an immigration judge for due process.",,,,2025-06-16 16:02:42.731399

Melissa Hortman and her husband. Boelter also was charged with six federal offenses, including stalking, murder and firearms charges. 
In addition to the murder of Melissa and Mark Hortman, Boelter is accused of shooting state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Both are expected to recover. Boelter visited the homes of two other state legislators who were unharmed, including Sen. Ann Rest in New Hope. The other target has not been disclosed, but officials say she is a Maple Grove representative.
The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office initially charged Boelter with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said the second-degree murder charges were filed on Saturday to obtain a nationwide arrest warrant. These are the highest charges that can be filed through a complaint. Moriarty is now seeking to charge Boelter with first-degree murder, which carries a heavier prison sentence. 
The U.S. Attorneys’ office brought federal charges against Boelter on Sunday night. The charges include two counts of stalking using interstate facilities, two counts of murder, and two firearms offenses for the shooting of the Hortmans and Hoffmans. The federal murder charges carry the potential for the death penalty. 
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi condemned the attack in a press release. 
“These horrific acts of violence will not go unanswered: the Department of Justice will prosecute this suspect to the fullest extent of the law and if convicted deliver severe consequences for his alleged crimes.”
Joe Thompson, the acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, said that the attack likely took months of planning. A list of names and addresses, including many DFL legislators, was found in Boelter’s car. 
“It is no exaggeration to say that his crimes are the stuff of nightmares,” Thompson said at a press conference Monday. “It’s pretty clear from the evidence that he’s been planning these attacks for quite some time. There’s voluminous writings, as you’ve seen in the reporting, that were found both in his car and his house.”
The state criminal complaint brought against Boelter states that Brooklyn Park police officers saw Boelter shoot Hortman’s husband, Mark Hortman, before he fled. Officers found at least four firearms in Boelter’s car. Another disassembled gun was discovered in the surrounding area. 
At a press conference Monday, state officials shared further details about the charges. Bureau of Criminal Apprehension supervisor Drew Evans said that Boelter cooperated with law enforcement when he was arrested Sunday night. 
Moriarty addressed misinformation that has been circulating online following the assassination. 
“It is a frightening time we are living in. Political violence is prevalent, and the way we talk to and about each other has raised the temperature to unfathomable levels….As our community grieves, I encourage those out there seeking to create additional chaos to stop spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories,” Moriarty said.

Just hours after Minnesotans learned that Democratic House leader Melissa Hortman had been assassinated, right-wing influencer Collin Rugg, who has 1.8 million followers on X, posted a “report” that hinted that she’d been killed because of a recent vote on ending undocumented adults’ ability to enroll in MinnesotaCare, a subsidized health insurance for the working poor.
Mike Cernovich, another right-wing influencer who has 1.4 million followers on X, took Rugg’s post and amped it up, but in the “just asking questions” style of many conspiracy theories:
“Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
They were deeply ignorant about the MinnesotaCare issue.
Walz and Hortman — who was instrumental in passing legislation allowing undocumented people to sign up for MinnesotaCare as speaker of the House in 2023 — negotiated a compromise with Republicans in the Minnesota Legislature to end eligibility for adults, but keep it for children. They did so to win necessary Republican support in the 67-67 House to pass a state budget. Without it, state government would have shut down on July 1.
Both Hortman and Walz signed the compromise agreement in mid-May. This week, Hortman spoke tearfully about how difficult the vote was for her, but she was bound to vote yes on the issue because of the prior agreement.
The “theory” of Hortman’s killing was further undercut by the vote of Democratic Sen. John Hoffman — who was also targeted by the suspect — against rolling back MinnesotaCare for undocumented Minnesotans.
Rugg and Cernovich’s posts were shared widely and just the start of the disinformation.
Once law enforcement sources began revealing a suspect, right-wing influencers ran with an insignificant detail: That Vance Luther Boelter was a “Walz appointee.”
Like many states, but even more so here, Minnesota is home to hundreds of nonpartisan and bipartisan boards and commissions, which are composed of thousands of people who typically win the appointment by simply volunteering. There are currently 342 open positions on Minnesota boards and commissions. Boelter was appointed to the Workforce Development Council by Walz’s predecessor Gov. Mark Dayton and reappointed by Walz.
It was the equivalent of calling a Sunday school volunteer an “appointee of the bishop.”
No matter, the Murdoch media machine, specifically the New York Post, had their headline: “Former appointee of Tim Walz sought….”
Cernovich had his greasy foil hot dog wrapper and began constructing a hat:
“The Vice President candidate for the Democrat party is directly connected to a domestic terrorist, that is confirmed, the only question is whether Tim Walz himself ordered the political hit against a rival who voted against Walz’s plan to give free healthcare to illegals.”
Walz had no such plan. He had signed an agreement to end eligibility for undocumented adults.
Joey Mannarino, who has more than 600,000 followers on X, was more crass:
“Rumor has it she was preparing to switch parties. The Democrats are VIOLENT SCUM.”
It was a ridiculous “rumor.” One of the last photos of Hortman alive was an image of her at the Democratic-Farmer-Labor’s big annual fundraising event, the Humphrey-Mondale dinner, which took place just hours before her assassination.
No matter, Cernovich wanted his new friends in federal law enforcement to act:
“The FBI must take Tim Walz into custody immediately.”
Finally, fresh off his humiliating defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump, world’s richest man Elon Musk quote-tweeted someone again falsely alleging Hortman was killed by “the left”  and added:
“The far left is murderously violent.” 
The suspect’s “hit list,” according to an official who has seen the list, comprised Minnesotans who have been outspoken in favor of abortion rights. CNN reported that it also included several abortion clinics, which doesn’t sound like the work of “the left.”
Right-wing influencers marred Hortman’s death and smeared Walz on a pile of lies.
In a different, saner world, they would be humiliated and slink away. But the smart money is that during the next moment of national crisis and mourning, they will again lie for profit.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A new bill would bar companies from using artificial intelligence to act as a licensed mental health professional. 
Members of the Assembly Science, Innovation and Technology Committee unanimously advanced the measure Monday.  
The bill would make the practice unlawful under the state Consumer Fraud Act. Violators would face fines of up to $10,000 for a first offense, and up to $20,000 per subsequent offense. 
The legislation comes amid a rise in people engaging AI chatbots for mental health advice and treatment, a low-cost and insurance-free alternative. One in three people in the U.S. live in an area with a shortage of mental health workers, with low-income areas and communities of color most affected, a report from Mental Health America found. 
AI therapy comes with risks. A Stanford study found that while AI therapy chatbots offer benefits like making therapy more accessible, the chatbots lack effectiveness compared to human therapists and show increased stigma to conditions like alcoholism and schizophrenia compared to depression. 
The bill also signals that state lawmakers will continue taking regulation into their own hands to limit the harms of AI — which could be derailed by President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” that includes a 10-year moratorium on local and state AI laws. 
In April, Gov. Phil Murphy signed a law making the creation and dissemination of AI-generated media known as “deepfakes” a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. At least 20 states enacted laws last year to regulate political deepfakes.

Spaun dropped out at CCJ; but Sunday, he persevered",Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/16/8-months-ago-j-j-spaun-dropped-out-at-ccj-but-sunday-he-persevered/,"In a memorable display of perseverance and sheer grit, J.J. Spaun won the U.S. Open.","Eight months ago, the first week of October 2024, J.J. Spaun walked the lush fairways of Country Club of Jackson in the Sanderson Farms Championship, trying to unlock the incomprehensible secret of winning golf. His stay in the Capital City was brief. He shot a first-round 75 and then withdrew from the tournament, presumably due to an injury.
“Presumably” is used here because Spaun’s withdrawal was not newsworthy enough to warrant even the briefest of investigations as to why he chose to drop out. After all, he ranked 98th on the tour’s earnings list at the time. 

Rick Cleveland 
Truth is, Spaun has never really distinguished himself in Mississippi’s only PGA TOUR tournament. In five previous appearances here, he never finished higher than a tie for 36th place. That was in 2019. As recently as 2021, Spaun played so poorly he lost his PGA TOUR status. Until Sunday, Spaun was the epitome of the term “journeyman” pro. 
No more. Never again. In a memorable display of perseverance and sheer grit, Spaun, all stockily built, 5 feet, 8 inches of him, won the U.S. Open. This was the ultimate test of golf, amid brutal conditions on surely one the most difficult golf courses ever designed: Oakmont Country Club, just outside Pittsburgh.
One by one, golf’s biggest names faltered: Scottie Scheffler, Rory McElroy, John Rahm, Xander Schauffler, Brooks Koepka, Colin Morikawa. Oakmont’s thick rough, deep bunkers, slick, undulating  greens and severe weather conditions took no prisoners. The golf course was like a 7,500-yard torture chamber. I mean, who ever heard of a 301-yard par-3, a 530-yard par-4, a 667-yard par-5? The greens were more than undulating. They appeared to have hippos and elephants buried in shallow graves. The rough was such that the golfers sometimes prayed their golf balls would find one of the deep sand bunkers instead of the brutally thick primary rough.
In an era when it often takes 25-under par or better to win a PGA TOUR tournament, only one player bettered par for 72 holes: 34-year-old John Michael Spaun, who goes by J.J. Through some of the worst breaks imaginable, Spaun’s expression never changed. He didn’t smile. He didn’t frown. He just stared intently. Once, when a perfectly struck approach shot hit the flagstick and bounced wildly back down the fairway, nearly 50 yards away, he stared in disbelief as an almost sure birdie turned into a bogey. One hole later, another Spaun shot hit a rake and nestled into the thick rough, resulting in another bogey. For a while there on the front nine, it was Murphy’s Law applied to golf. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong. He bogeyed five of the first six holes. After leading or staying close to the lead for much of the tournament, Spaun turned into a chaser, which he has been for nearly the entirety of his career.
This time, he caught – and passed – everybody.
This was something akin to Mr. Ed beating Secretariat, Citation and Man O’ War. This was the old Kansas City A’s winning the World Series, the New Orleans Saints winning the Super Bowl. It happened. Once.
Sunday, you got the feeling it may happen again, perhaps many times, for J.J. Spaun. Maybe, he didn’t find the secret to winning golf eight months ago in Jackson, but he has found it somewhere along the way.
You may have heard his press conference afterward. Said Spaun, “It felt like, as bad as things were going, I just still tried to just commit to every shot. I tried to just continue to dig deep. I’ve been doing it my whole life.”
Spaun refused to go away. It was like the story of his career. He kept his head up, retained his steely focus, kept plugging away. He birdied the last two holes, with the rain pouring and all the pressure one can face in golf on his shoulders.
Of all the most intriguing facts and statistics of the week at Oakmont, this one stands alone: In the long and storied history of the U.S. Open, dating back to 1895, there have been five men, including four legends, who have birdied the last two holes to win the championship. They are Ben Hogan (1953, Oakmont), Jack Nicklaus (1980, Baltusrol), Tom Watson (1982, Pebble Beach), Jon Rahm (2021, Torrey Pines) – and now, J.J. Spaun. What Spaun achieved against all odds at Oakmont was legendary, indeed.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/16120341/AP25167025035093.jpg,,,2025-06-16 16:02:42.731399

A UMMC spokesperson declined to answer Mississippi Today’s questions about the change. 
Mississippi does not require hospitals to collect citizenship information from patients.

Patients are not legally required to disclose their immigration status if they are asked by a health care provider, according to the National Immigration Law Center. Hospitals must provide emergency medical services to patients regardless of their citizenship status under federal law. 
Texas hospitals began collecting patient citizenship information last November after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order mandating that facilities collect the information. 
The order seeks to quantify the financial burden Texas bears as a result of illegal immigration. Hospitals must report the cost of medical care provided to undocumented individuals quarterly, but individual identifying information is not shared with the governor. Texas hospitals were directed to inform patients that responses to questions about citizenship would not affect their care.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is pushing to reshape the federal housing safety net by slashing spending and shifting the burden of housing millions of people to states, which may be ill-equipped to handle the mission.
President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners

Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
Trump’s hopes for next year
The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Lisa Bowman, director of marketing and communications at the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Bowman wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” she wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

(Photo by Kate Brindley/New Hampshire Bulletin)Negotiators with the New Hampshire Senate agreed to accept a House proposal to add new documentation requirements to absentee voting Monday — against the wishes of disability rights advocates who say it would make it harder for people with disabilities to vote.
Under an amended version of Senate Bill 287, people seeking to vote absentee in New Hampshire would be required to either bring a photo ID into a clerk’s office, send in a photocopy of their ID, or send in a notarized signature in order to request their absentee ballot.
On Monday, the Senate’s negotiators agreed to accept the House’s version of the bill during a committee of conference. Now, the bill will go back to the full chamber for a final vote. If it’s approved, Gov. Kelly Ayotte will have the final say. She can sign it, veto it, or allow it to become law without her signature.
Democrats on the committee objected to the new requirement.
“I think it’s important to talk about the practical realities of what you guys are imposing,” Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, a Portsmouth Democrat, said during negotiations Monday. “This is again just further ways that we’re making it harder for people to vote.”
During a press conference last week, James Ziegra, senior staff attorney at the Disability Rights Center of New Hampshire, said the new requirement would be burdensome as it requires anyone unable to go to a clerk’s office in person to have access to a photocopier or accredited notary. Many people with disabilities are unable to drive themselves, he pointed out.
SB 287 was one of a pair of bills adding requirements to absentee voting. Senate Bill 218 goes even further and seeks to require absentee voters to submit hard-copy proof of their citizenship — such as a birth certificate or passport — when registering to vote in New Hampshire. This law would build upon a 2024 law that required in-person voters to do the same, though that law, which created the strictest standard in the U.S., has been challenged in court.
Rep. Ross Berry, a Weare Republican and the chairman of the House Election Law Committee, framed this in the context of his and his colleagues’ opposition to early and absentee voting.
“The House’s concern and the position of the House has always been that as much of Election Day should happen on Election Day as possible,” he said during negotiations Monday. “It should just be like that.”
Berry said the discrepancy between what is required of in-person and absentee voting “is something that the House is interested in closing up.”
Sen. James Gray, a Rochester Republican, decided the Senate wanted more time to deliberate, so he suggested the committee return to SB 218 Wednesday.
Disability rights advocates also oppose House Bill 613, which would allow towns and cities to not offer voting machines designed to be accessible for people with disabilities if no one requests it at least two months before the elections. HB 613 is also the subject of negotiations between the House and Senate this week.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/votingregbills-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-16 15:05:09.567724

Attorney Andrew Abood did not say what the misdemeanor was but did say that the plea did not involve a cooperation agreement with the Michigan Department of Attorney General.
Baxter was bound over to face trial last year on a felony perjury charge, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. Her trial was set to begin on June 23.
But a surprise entry in the Ingham Circuit Court register of actions for Baxter’s case on Monday was updated to include a plea hearing before Judge James Jamo. The hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m.
A message seeking comment from a department spokesperson was not returned at the time of publication.

Baxter was charged with perjury for her alleged part in the campaign finance scandal. 
The department and Attorney General Dana Nessel alleged that she and Heather Lombardini had illegally raised funds for Unlock Michigan, a campaign committee that aimed to repeal the gubernatorial emergency powers law used by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer during the worst days of the COVID pandemic. 
Nessel said Baxter misled state investigators while providing testimony under oath, which the attorney general noted was a serious crime.
Baxter was involved in fundraising efforts for Michigan! My Michigan!, which was tied to former Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake) and other Republican lawmakers. Meanwhile, Lombardini was the president of Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility and the treasurer of Michigan! My Michigan!
Lombardini’s case is pending a motion to quash her bind over to the circuit court for trial.
Shirkey and the various donors to Unlock Michigan, which were disclosed recently in open court during a June 4 hearing on Lombardini’s motion to quash, were not charged in the matter.

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Three people — including an 8-month-old infant — were killed and two teenagers were injured in a shooting late Sunday night at WestFest, a carnival held every year in West Valley City. 
Officers arrested a 16-year-old boy in connection with the shooting, according to West Valley City Police Department spokesperson Roxeanne Vainuku. She told reporters he’s the “only suspect in this case” as police continue to investigate what happened. 
The suspect began firing shots after “two groups of people” seemed to have “some sort of verbal altercation,” Vainuku said. She noted two of the three dead — the 8-month-old infant and a 41-year-old woman — were bystanders “not connected to any of the people in either of the groups.” An 18-year-old man was also shot and killed, who “we believe is connected and was part of the opposing group that the suspect was in,” she said. 
It’s too early to say whether the shooting was related to gang violence, Vainuku said, as police are still investigating.

The shooting in West Valley City — Utah’s second-most-populated city, behind the state’s capital of Salt Lake City — comes on the heels of a deadly shooting that occurred during an otherwise peaceful “No Kings” protest in downtown Salt Lake City. 
Saturday, one man, 39-year-old bystander Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, was killed, after police say one of two armed men “possibly part of the event’s peacekeeping team” confronted another man, 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa, who was carrying an AR-15 style rifle. One of the men, reportedly part of the event’s security team, fired three shots, grazing Gamboa but also hitting Ah Loo, who was marching with protesters. Ah Loo later died at the hospital, police said.

The dust was barely starting to settle from Saturday’s tragedy when the shooting at West Valley City broke out Sunday — capping off a chaotic and violent weekend in two separate, crowded public places in Utah. 
The shooting at WestFest occurred shortly after 9:20 p.m., Vainuku said, after officers who were working at the carnival spotted “two groups of people who seemed to be having some sort of a verbal altercation.” 
“The officers approached these two groups in order to kind of break things up and calm things down,” she said. As the officers neared, they saw the suspect pull out a gun and start firing it at the other group. 
She said one of the officers fired gunshots toward the suspect, but didn’t hit him or any of the victims. However, “they were able to very quickly take the suspect into custody.”
Of the five people who were hit, two were injured by gunshot wounds to their arms, according to West Valley City police. One was a 17-year-old girl; the other was a 15-year-old boy. It’s unclear whether those teens were connected to the groups involved. 
In the panic after the shots were fired, a pregnant woman was injured trying to climb a fence to get away, Vainuku said.
Several people witnessed the shooting, and police are interviewing them as part of their investigation, she said.
Vainuku called the shooting at the city’s annual festival “heartbreaking.” 
“WestFest is something that is a celebration of our community, a celebration of all of the things that make our community great, a celebration of the diversity and the fun and the good, hard-working people of our community,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking …  for all of us to see something like this happen as something that is just a real treasure, something we really enjoy in our community.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A 39-year-old man died Saturday night after being shot during Salt Lake City’s “No Kings” protest while a crowd of about 10,000 people marched near 151 S. State Street, the Salt Lake City Police Department confirmed Sunday.
Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, a Utah resident, was shot at the demonstration. Despite life-saving efforts from SWAT medics and Salt Lake City Fire, Ah Loo died at an area hospital.
As of Sunday morning there were still unreleased details about the incident as the investigation is ongoing, Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said in a news conference.
A chaotic scene ensued after two armed men in high visibility vests, who Redd described as “possibly part of the event’s peacekeeping team” saw 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa separating from the crowd, moving behind a wall, pulling out a rifle and starting to manipulate it.
“Gamboa was then confronted by these two men, witnesses say. Gamboa raised the weapon in a firing position and began running toward the crowd,” Redd said on Sunday. “One of the individuals fired three rounds, striking Gamboa, and tragically striking the man who later died.”
The preliminary police investigation found that the victim was not the intended target, “but rather an innocent bystander participating in the demonstration,” Redd said. Gamboa also sustained a minor gunshot wound in the confrontation.
As the scene unfolded, a bystander took a backpack from Gamboa that contained an AR-15 style rifle and a gas mask, Redd said.
Gamboa’s motivations for being at the protest are still unclear, and there is no indication that others were working with him, Redd said.
Detectives booked Gamboa into the Salt Lake County Metro Jail for investigation of murder, police said in a release.
Gamboa has no criminal history, police said. Jail documents state he is being held without bail.
Police had not taken any action against the two peacekeeping members as of Sunday, Redd said. The man who fired the shots is cooperating with police.
The scene was chaotic and unfolded very quickly, Redd said, but many people assisted the officers.
“The crowd actually pointed him out to law enforcement, and their actions were heroic,” Redd said.
In a Facebook post Sunday morning, Utah 50501 — the group that organized Saturday’s protest — said it is currently working with police.
“Our team was directly involved. We have been in direct contact with law enforcement,” the Facebook post read. “Some of you seem to think a keyboard and social media give you a free pass to be nasty and accusatory. Our teams just had to deal with something extremely traumatizing and when faced with personal risk to their own lives, chose to run towards the danger in order to serve this community.”
The group said it’s working to set up a vigil for the victim.
“We respectfully ask to refrain from speculation about the alleged shooter’s motives and identity — that information will come out soon enough. It is better to wait for the facts, even though it is difficult given the emotional and charged nature of this incident,” the group said in a separate Facebook post Sunday morning. “This was a horrific moment of violence in a historic day full of thousands of Utahns exercising their right to protest. Nothing will ever change the undeniable strength of our community.”

Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, were also shot and killed in a separate incident. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said during a press conference that the shooting ""appears to be a politically motivated assassination."" (Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)The man accused of killing DFL House leader Melissa Hortman and her husband, and shooting DFL state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, went to the homes of two additional state lawmakers in the early hours of Saturday morning, federal officials said Monday. 
Vance Boelter, 57, is facing several state and federal charges for the murders of Melissa and Mark Hortman and the shootings of John and Yvette Hoffman, and related other crimes. The Hoffmans survived but remained hospitalized.
Boelter’s path took him, in total, to the homes of four state lawmakers in the northwest metro of the Twin Cities before he got in a shootout with police officers outside the Hortmans’ home in Brooklyn Park and fled the scene.
Boelter was captured Sunday evening by state and federal agents in a field about a mile from his home in Green Isle, about an hour west of the Twin Cities, following a 43-hour manhunt.
Boelter maintained notebooks with a list of Democratic elected officials, including Hortman and Hoffman, along with addresses and the names of abortion providers. He has been described by those who knew him as a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump, who was facing financial hardship after quitting his job to embark on business ventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Federal authorities say that after Boelter shot the Hoffmans, he drove to a home in Maple Grove belonging to a state representative. Boelter, dressed in a fake law enforcement uniform and wearing a mask, knocked on the door and said “This is the police. Open the door,” according to surveillance footage from the home referenced in federal charging documents. 
The representative and her family were not at home. No one answered the door. 
Authorities declined to name the representative who lived at the house. Maple Grove is split into two House districts — one represented by Republican Rep. Kristin Robbins, and the other by DFL Rep. Kristin Bahner.
As word spread about the shooting of the Hoffmans, a New Hope police officer drove to the local state senator’s house to check on the lawmaker. The New Hope police officer spotted what looked like a police SUV parked down the block from the senator’s home. Assuming it was another officer dispatched to provide protection, the New Hope officer pulled up next to the SUV.
Boelter was inside the vehicle, likely still wearing the silicone mask that he wore as he shot the Hoffmans, said Joe Thompson, acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota. As the New Hope officer attempted to speak with Boelter, Boelter stared straight ahead and didn’t respond. The officer then drove down the block to the senator’s house, and Boelter left.
New Hope is represented by DFL state Sen. Ann Rest, and in a statement Monday, she thanked law enforcement for saving her life.
“I have been made aware that the shooting suspect was parked near my home early Saturday morning. I am so grateful for the heroic work of the New Hope Police Department and its officers. Their quick action saved my life,” Rest said.
Boelter then drove to the Hortmans’ in Brooklyn Park, the federal charging documents allege. A notebook recovered from his home included notes about the Hortman family and home.
Brooklyn Park police, responding to the same call for protection following the Hoffmans’ shooting, arrived on the scene moments before Boelter fired his gun as he entered the home through the front door. Boelter escaped through the back of the house, and police officers found Melissa and Mark Hortman — and their dog — inside the home with fatal gunshot wounds.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2219572717.jpg,,,2025-06-16 15:05:09.567724

(Courtesy of State Ethics Commission) A new lawsuit filed by the New Mexico Ethics Commission alleges the nonprofit New Mexico Safety over Profit failed to report at least $56,000 spent lobbying against medical malpractice reform before the legislative session.
The group’s executive director, Jon Lipschutz, manages Democratic gubernatorial candidate Sam Bregman’s campaign. Bregman, who also serves as the 2nd Judicial District attorney, could not be reached for comment Monday morning.
Lipschutz initially incorporated his organization last year under the name Fairness for New Mexico Patients, as Searchlight New Mexico reported earlier this year. New Mexico Safety Over Profit operates as a 501c(4) nonprofit, putting it under no federal legal obligations to disclose its donors, thus earning the moniker “dark money groups.”
That federal status, however, does not exempt the organization from the disclosure requirements of New Mexico’s Lobbyist Regulation Act or Campaign Reporting Act, the Ethics Commission noted in a news release announcing its June 10 civil complaint, which it filed in the state’s 2nd Judicial District.
The complaint stems from an advertising campaign by the group that lobbied against a medical malpractice reform bill during the last legislative session. Proponents, such as Think New Mexico, said capping attorney fees and ending lump-sum payouts, among other proposals, would help address the state’s physician shortage.
The State Ethics Commission noted that the nonprofit correctly reported other spending during the session but failed to “report the contributions, pledges to contribute, expenditures and commitments to expend for the advertising campaign,” in 2024 within 15 days after the end of the 2025 legislative session, violating state law. The complaint showed photos of advertisements purchased in the Albuquerque Journal and Santa Fe New Mexican in addition to $56,000 in ads on Facebook. The Ethics Commission requested a judge order New Mexico Safety over Profit to fully account for spending in 2024 — including releasing the name and occupation of donors on the campaign — and to pay $5,000 in penalties.
In a written statement provided to Source, Lipschutz characterized the lawsuit as a “distraction and troubling escalation,” and said his organization is “confident that we have complied with both the letter and the spirit of New Mexico’s campaign finance laws.”
And, he said: “At a time when out-of-state hospital corporations and insurance interests are spending heavily to influence healthcare policy behind closed doors, it’s telling that the Ethics Commission has chosen to single out the one organization fighting to protect patients.”
New Mexicans have the right to know who is funding lobbying campaigns, State Ethics Commission Executive Director Jeremy Farris said in a written statement Monday.
“This right is particularly important when the lobbying campaign concerns how New Mexico should understand and address its shortage of healthcare professionals,” Farris said. “NMSOP has publicly stated that transparency and accountability are core to its mission, yet it refuses to comply with basic disclosure obligations required by the Lobbyist Regulation Act. This lawsuit is about ensuring that all organizations advocating for legislative change follow the same legal standard.”

(LRC Public Information)A Louisville Democrat accused of inappropriate conduct toward women asked a court to intervene in a Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission complaint against him. A  judge denied the motion Monday, a day before the commission is scheduled to meet. 
Rep. Daniel Grossberg filed the lawsuit in Franklin Circuit Court on Friday asking that the commission be barred from proceeding further with its investigation. The representative’s 23-page complaint alleges “retaliatory and discriminatory actions” by the commission. 
Judge Thomas Wingate ruled Monday that Grossberg “failed to meet the standard for injunctive relief” and that the court would not “upend the status quo” of the commission’s proceedings. 
“What has been shared with the Court is that a complaint or complaints have been filed against (the) Plaintiff and the Commission has a meeting set for June 17, 2025, to determine whether there is reason to believe that (the) Plaintiff has committed a violation of the Kentucky Code of Legislative Ethics,” Wingate wrote. “Therefore, Court intervention to halt such (a) meeting and/or any ‘investigation’ would upend the status quo — which is for the Commission to follow the statutory procedure set forth in KRS 6.686.” 
Details of the complaint against Grossberg are not known because Kentucky law makes the ethics commission’s proceedings, including complaints and other records related to a preliminary inquiry, confidential until the commission makes a final determination.
The lawsuit names all members of the Legislative Ethics Commission and its executive director as defendants. 
Grossberg’s motion was heard Monday morning in Frankfort. 
Grossberg has been expelled from the House Democratic Caucus and faces calls from within his party to resign from the legislature following allegations against him for inappropriate behavior toward women, as reported by the Lexington Herald-Leader last year. House Democrats sought an investigation by the Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission. 
Grossberg’s attorney is Thomas E. Clay of Prospect. 
According to the lawsuit, Grossberg says the caucus and community members “have engaged in a pattern of activities intended to destroy the reputation of the Plaintiff, his family, and his ability to freely represent his district.” Grossberg, who is Jewish, claims that he was targeted for introducing a House resolution to condemn Hamas for attacking Israel in October 2023.
Grossberg also says that he faced microaggressions as a Jewish lawmaker such as all food at a caucus retreat having pork in it without any vegetarian or kosher options as well as “pointed questions about celebrations of the Sabbath, Jewish bourbon in his office and his mezuzah.” 
Grossberg’s complaint claims that former House Democratic Caucus Chair Cherlynn Stevenson and former Democratic Whip Rachel Roberts sought a retaliatory investigation from the ethics commission into Grossberg. However, neither of them are named as defendants in the lawsuit. 
Stevenson is running for the U.S. House  in Central Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District. A spokesperson for her campaign told the Kentucky Lantern Monday that she would not be “be distracted by a baseless lawsuit that is full of bogus claims and is in denial of Daniel Grossberg’s vile sexual misconduct” and is instead focusing on issues like protecting “access to health care for families across the commonwealth.” 
“He has an appalling and documented record of preying upon women — which is why Cherlynn voted to remove him from the caucus and leaders across the state demanded his immediate resignation,” the spokesperson said. 
Last year, the Herald-Leader reported three women who work in politics were asked about inappropriate text messages sent by the representative to them in a Legislative Research Commission investigation. Later, a Louisville strip club said it banned Grossberg for life after he inappropriately touched a dancer.
Grossberg continued to represent the 30th House District in the General Assembly earlier this year, though Kentucky Democratic Party Chair Colmon Elridge blasted Republican leaders in the legislature for assigning Grossberg to three House committees.
The state’s top Democrat, Gov. Andy Beshear, was also among those calling on Grossberg to resign. Speaking to reporters ahead of the party’s Forward Together Dinner in Owensboro Friday night, he said the representative “is not a victim” and should resign from office.
“Daniel Grossberg needs to work on himself and not work in Frankfort,” Beshear said. 
Grossberg has gained primary challengers for his legislative seat in next year’s election.

Assembly lawmakers discussed a bill that would require structural assessments for transportation projects near mines after I-80 sinkholes.,"Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-Morris), pictured in 2022, represents the district where sinkholes caused by old mines prompted officials to close Interstate 80 for six months. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers are considering new requirements for roadway and other infrastructure projects near underground mines, hoping to prevent collapses like the sinkholes that have shuttered parts of Interstate 80 for more than six months.
A new bill, which the Assembly Transportation and Independent Authorities Committee discussed but did not vote on Monday, would require transportation agencies to conduct structural assessments on transportation projects near operating or abandoned mines.
“This is an issue that we have to continue to address. Let’s not just respond to the larger big potholes, which are sinkholes. Let us be able to predict them. Let us not just fix the damage, but let us prevent it,” Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-Morris) told the committee.
The move comes more than half a year after the first in a series of sinkholes opened on Interstate 80 in Wharton last December, shuttering lanes on the highway and forcing traffic to redirect through local roads that could not bear the congestion. Wharton is in Dunn’s district.
The highway’s westbound lanes reopened on Saturday, and its three eastbound lanes are due to reopen on June 25.

“I’m the town next to Wharton where the holes were found. The impact really does stick. It was just traffic and just a very terrible time for literally thousands of people,” said Assemblyman Christian Barranco (R-Morris), who shares Dunn’s district. “I can tell you the relief is very real and very welcome.”
Lawmakers hope to prevent similar disruptions by requiring the Department of Labor’s mine safety section to determine whether proposed transportation projects are within close proximity of a mine and whether a structural assessment is needed to ensure safety.
The bill would require the transportation agency in charge of the project to perform the analysis, with post-construction monitoring for mines found to be at risk of collapses that could damage above-ground infrastructure.
That monitoring would include ground-penetrating radar scans and periodic elevation measurements to ensure no part of the roadway is falling through the ground. The bill authorizes the transportation commissioner to stop work on sites not in compliance.
The bill was sponsored by Assemblyman Clinton Calabrese (D-Bergen), who chairs the panel that heard testimony on it Monday. It has no Senate companion.
Some lawmakers expressed surprise at the Department of Labor’s role in the proposed regulatory scheme. Current New Jersey law on mine safety dates back more than 70 years, when iron and sulfur extraction were major state industries, and deal mostly with workplace safety within mines.
State records list nearly 600 abandoned mines, nearly all of which fall in the state’s northwest.
“This issue, in my opinion, should not be in the Department of Labor. It’s clearly not their wheelhouse. This to me seems to be an environmental protection issue, something like that, perhaps [the Department of Community Affairs] because of the impact it would have on applications before state agencies and local agencies,” said Assemblyman Greg McGuckin (R-Ocean).
Mining is less prevalent in the state’s economy today, and what remains has taken a different character. In 2019, state mines extracted $367 million in minerals, but virtually all of that value came from crushed stone, sand, or gravel, according to U.S. Geological Service data.
The decades-long mining decline presents lawmakers with another issue: The state hasn’t updated its mine maps in years and in places relies on contemporary maps that are more than a century old.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Department of Correctional Services)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Department of Correctional Services on Monday named the three construction companies bidding to construct a new state prison close to Lincoln, all of which officials said would stay within proposed state appropriations.
The department said officials are reviewing bids for the proposed 1,512-bed facility to replace the aging Nebraska State Penitentiary. The bids, received through 2 p.m. on June 3, came from Clark Construction/MCL Construction (a joint venture), Hausmann Construction and Sampson Construction/Caddell Construction (a joint venture). Each bidder has at least some Nebraska ties.
Among them, Sampson built Correctional Services a reception and treatment center that opened in 2022, a 114,000-square-foot addition plus 3,200 square feet of renovations.

Correctional Services Director Rob Jeffreys said in a statement that “from day one,” the department’s engineering team had approached the new prison project “the Nebraska way,” focused on fiscal responsibility and building a facility to support the state’s needs.
“All of the bids received will keep this project within the proposed budget and the funding appropriated by the Legislature,” Jeffreys said. 
The department did not immediately release the bid estimates. Bids will be evaluated through mid-July, and when an “intent to award” a bid is signed, the bids will become public, according to NDCS.
The facility, once built, will be located north of Interstate 80, adjacent to North 70th Street, close to Lincoln.
‘I’ll believe it when I see it’
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who led legislative opposition to the new facility, said he would love to see the bid numbers, because he’s heard the new prison could cost more than the $350 million approved by lawmakers.

He’s one of a handful of lawmakers who have expressed worries that state prison costs could balloon, as correctional costs in other states have, too.
“I’ll believe it when I see it,” McKinney said Monday.
McKinney said he doesn’t think a new prison is needed, particularly considering the state’s budget woes and that many Nebraskans in state facilities are eligible for parole but haven’t been released.
A Nebraska Supreme Court decision in favor of the Legislature in April, against Attorney General Mike Hilgers, upheld expanded parole eligibility passed in 2023.
McKinney said Correctional Services administrators could repair and maintain the Nebraska State Penitentiary for less money.
“If they’re gonna say that we need a new prison, then they shouldn’t oppose demolishing the State Pen after it’s built,” McKinney said. “The fact they won’t proves to me a new prison is not needed.”
Second chance relief
There have been other recent efforts to help with prison reform and overcrowding, such as Legislative Bill 215 this year, which sought “second chance relief” for certain long-term inmates through an increased, collaborative chance for sentence commutation or parole. The Nebraska Board of Pardons — Hilgers, Gov. Jim Pillen and Secretary of State Bob Evnen — opposed it.

State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, who introduced LB 215 and selected it as his personal priority for 2025, had said he’d visited every adult correctional facility in Nebraska, some multiple times, and met Nebraskans serving life sentences who were model individuals and mentors to younger inmates. He said he’d be comfortable with many as a “next-door neighbor.”
Before joining the Legislature, Holdcroft said he would have thought, “You do the crime, you do the time,” but he said politicians need to be willing to hear both sides and be willing to move.
“After visiting with some of these lifers and breaking bread with them and talking to them, one-on-one as human beings, I truly believe that the sentences of many of these individuals should be given a second look,” Holdcroft said.
The measure, which advanced the first of three debates 25-14, could return in 2026.
‘Very pleasing news’
  State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said Jeffreys’ commitment was “wonderful,” citing the state’s closed-for-now budget shortfall.
“I was not sure how much we would have to fund in excess, but that’s very pleasing news. Glad to hear that,” Clements said. “I’m looking forward to the project moving forward.”
Clements said the facility is needed to provide more beds than the current prison, partly to ease overcrowding and partly to provide more space for needed programming for inmate rehabilitation and successful reentry. He said the new facility would also be more modern and more secure for staff.
Said Jeffreys: “We look forward to launching construction and appreciate all Nebraskans who have supported this rehabilitation-focused facility.”

Pittman is being targeted in political action committee social media ads. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — A political action committee targeted Leavenworth’s mayor on social media in May for her “liberal agenda,” accusing her of holding back progress in the northeast Kansas town. 
The Defend US PAC ran three advertisements in May on Instagram and Facebook that tagged Mayor Holly Pittman. One said Pittman’s agenda was to “waste taxpayer money, lose good-paying jobs and call it ‘progress.’” All three ads encouraged people to call Pittman. 
The ads did not directly mention the city’s disagreement with CoreCivic, a private prison planning to reopen as an ICE detention facility, but that is the most recent controversy that could affect community jobs.  
Leavenworth city officials went to court to force CoreCivic to follow its development process and apply for a special use permit before reopening. The prison closed in 2021. 
CoreCivic did not reply to a question about whether it was involved with running the advertisements. 
“I was disappointed to see this PAC targeting and spending money against me,” Pittman said. “As the mayor, I serve as one of five commissioners on the Leavenworth City Commission. Decisions are made collectively by the entire commission, not by me alone.” 
She said the ad misrepresents the process and ignores the “collaborative approach” taken in Leavenworth. 
Marina Pino, counsel at the elections and government program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the issue of PACs spending money at the state and local levels is “especially acute” right now. The Brennan Center has researched dark money funding and its effects on the political process.
Dark money is a term used to denote funds affecting politics that can’t be traced to specific donors.
“When you have these hidden funders of advertising, they often hold economic interests in the contests where these outcomes could have significant and immediate impact on their bottom lines,” Pino said. 
One concern about PAC donations is the way they may shift local elections. 
“Local elections and potentially local issues are low-information elections compared to national elections,” she said. “What that means is it may not take much advertising to sway voters.”
Facebook highlights the range of dollars to run an ad. For instance, one of the ads paid for by Defend US Inc. cost between $600 to $699. Defend US spent $2,900+ on the Pittman ads. 
“What they spent was a pretty insignificant amount of money in most terms,” Pino said. “When we did this report in 2016, we found that these dark money groups across several states were spending amounts in the low one hundred thousands, or even low ten thousands. For those groups, that’s a modest business expense, but it’s also a major hurdle for local candidates. They’re not spending that type of money on elections.”
Pino said the Brennan Center did a recent report looking at dark money spending in the 2024 elections. Although it didn’t consider local election spending, the two tend to trend the same way, she said. 
“We saw the dark money spending in the 2024 election break a serious record,” she said. “It was around $1.9 billion that was spent in the 2024 elections. That’s the money we can trace. It’s becoming increasingly more difficult to trace.”

The Miss Delaware Scholarship Organization’s annual competition, held Saturday night at the Independence School, highlighted candidates from across the state, celebrating scholarship, service, talent, and style as they competed for state titles and the opportunity to advance to national competitions this fall.
Mack, who won the Miss Delaware title, stood out for her colorguard routine to “Uccen” by the Taalbi Brothers, her initiative promoting women in STEM called “Shoot for the Stars,” and her poised presence throughout the event. She earned $10,750 in scholarship funds and will represent Delaware at Miss America 2026 in September.
“Being named Miss Delaware is a dream come true,” said Mack. “I never in my wildest dreams imagined that I would have the opportunity to connect with so many incredible people and I am honored and excited to continue inspiring young women in STEM over the next year. I am incredibly grateful for each and every person who helped me make this dream a reality and can’t wait to start serving my home state.”
Martinenza earned the Teen crown following a performance titled “HERStory,” in which she spoke about her drive to support the fight against cancer. She also impressed judges during the interview segment and was recognized for her work with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. She received $2,800 in scholarship awards and will compete at Miss America’s Teen 2026.
“Winning Miss Delaware’s Teen is truly a dream come true. Every bit of hard work led to something unforgettable,” Martinenza said. “I’m especially excited to use this platform to spotlight the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society — bringing attention to a cause so close to my heart. I look forward to the year ahead and am so thankful for everyone who’s been part of my journey thus far.”
Other honors from the competition included:

Miss Delaware 2025 First Runner-Up: Rebecca Bristow
Miss Delaware’s Teen 2025 First Runner-Up: Adria Windish
Miss Delaware 2025 Second Runner-Up: Samantha Mason
Miss Delaware’s Teen 2025 Second Runner-Up: Tierra Shockley
Miss Delaware 2025 Third Runner-Up: Jaylynn Rogers
Miss Delaware’s Teen 2025 Third Runner-Up: Carly Favoroso

Both Mack and Martinenza will now begin a year of community engagement, school visits, and service work tied to their social impact platforms as they prepare for the national stage.
“The Miss Delaware Scholarship Competition is more than a crown — it’s a celebration of service, scholarship, and the extraordinary potential of young women across our state. We are proud to provide a platform that empowers them to lead, advocate, and inspire,” said Sue Kuhling, Executive Director and President of the Miss Delaware Scholarship Organization. 
“We are thrilled to welcome Avery and Hailey as our Miss Delaware’s Teen and Miss Delaware 2025. Their passion, poise, and commitment to service embody everything this organization stands for. I can’t wait to see where their year of impact and leadership takes them — it’s going to be something special.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Avery-Crowning-1-819x1024.jpeg,,,2025-06-16 14:05:59.766660

(Alaska DOT&PF photo)A stretch of the Dalton Highway near the Saginavirktok River was washed out by flood waters on Saturday, leading to an 80-foot-wide gap in the only road leading to Prudhoe Bay.
As a result, the highway is closed between Milepost 305 and 356. 
The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, which said the washout was due to a failed culvert, expects to reopen the road by Wednesday.
The North Slope experienced a cool spring followed by a stretch of warm weather that contributed to a rapid breakup on the Saginavirktok River and other bodies of water in the far north.
DOT said on Saturday that water was overtopping the road at another spot near the washout, there were places with shoulder damage, and at a site nearer Prudhoe Bay, water was being trapped against the raised roadbed due to a partially blocked culvert. 
This year’s flooding, while significant, is less than what occurred in 2015, when huge stretches of the highway were washed out, causing an 18-day halt to traffic.
Climate change and permafrost thawing are making the North Slope’s ground increasingly unstable and are contributing to chaotic river breakups across the state.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54591675574_8b44ee2064_o.jpg,,,2025-06-16 14:05:59.766660

(Getty Images)Five attorneys at risk of losing their jobs running local public defense offices accused State Public Defender Rémy Starns of discriminating against the women who have run those offices. 

The attorneys said Starns has targeted women for layoffs, having sought the termination of six of the 11 women who have led Louisiana’s local public defender offices over the past three years. 

The State Public Defender Oversight Board deferred a vote Monday on whether to affirm Starns’ decision to lay off the five attorneys, three of whom are women. A board committee is expected to meet Wednesday to further review Starns’ recommendation that the lawyers lose their jobs. 
Starns forcefully denied allegations that he has targeted women who report to him. 

“Those statements are false, and I believe they knew them to be false,” Starns said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The attorneys Starns wants to fire include Michelle AndrePont in Caddo Parish, Brett Brunson in Natchitoches Parish, Deirdre Fuller in Rapides Parish, Trisha Ward in Evangeline Parish and John Hogue, who works in Tensas, Madison and East Carroll parishes. 
The board’s decision to delay the vote came after testimony from the targeted attorneys accusing Starns of discrimination. 
“My termination is not just unwarranted, it’s retaliatory. …. It’s because I’m a woman,” AndrePont said. 
Brunson and Hogue, who are men, said Starns is attempting to force them out of their jobs because they have defended their women colleagues. 

“His targeting of women was unacceptable,” Brunson told the board. 

The five attorneys also said Starns was trying to remove them from their jobs because they had spoken out several times against Starns’ policies in legislative and state public defender board hearings over the past few years. 

Starns was first appointed state public defender in 2020 by former Gov. John Bel Edwards and rehired last year by Gov. Jeff Landry. 
Monday’s board meeting testimony is the latest installment in a months-long fight over whether Starns has the right to fire the five public attorneys. Their job contracts have not been renewed beyond July 1, when Starns said he planned to have interim public defender chiefs take over their duties. 

“Reject the fiction that these are routine contract renewals. They are not,” Hogue said.

Among the voting council members is James Moore, an addiction recovery advocate in Hattiesburg. He said his local lawmaker, Republican House Medicaid Chair Missy McGee, called him Wednesday and asked him, on behalf of Speaker of the House Jason White, to serve as a voting member of the council. 
Earlier that day, Mississippi Today published a story about how Moore and other parents who’ve lost their children to addiction were upset that local city and county governments were spending opioid settlement money on items not directly related to recovery and without their input. 
Moore said he is looking forward to hearing from others with expertise addressing addiction as a public health problem — like those who’ve struggled with and treated substance use disorder.
“I’ll be reaching out to those folks to try to give me direction, so that I can pass that on to the decision makers,” he said. 
The people tasked with appointing the advisors have submitted 13 of the 15 members who will vote on state opioid settlement grant proposals, and 21 out of 22 nonvoting seats, according to the Mississippi Attorney General’s office. 
State lawmakers passed Senate Bill 2767 in the spring, and Gov. Tate Reeves signed it into law April 10. The law calls for creation of an advisory council that would develop a grant application process to spend an estimated $259 million of national opioid settlement money the state has been receiving. The committee is asked to make recommendations of which grants to approve, and legislators can accept or reject those. 
The law instructed a variety of powerful Mississippians to appoint the council members by last Monday, 60 days after the bill was signed into law. Reeves, who did not respond to questions about the advisory committee, is responsible for assigning the last two unassigned voting members. State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney is supposed to nominate the last nonvoting council seat — a representative of the state’s private addiction treatment facilities.
Mississippi State Health Department spokesperson Greg Flynn said that Edney would send his nominee to the attorney general’s office last week, but the seat was unassigned as of Friday afternoon, according to the Attorney General’s office. 
Another member of the voting block, Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones, said he would like to see projects that prioritize addiction prevention education for the general public and overdose response tools for law enforcement officers, like the overdose-reversing drug naloxone. 
“This is something our communities are plagued with,” he said. “By having law enforcement personnel at the table, we have firsthand knowledge of the effects opioids have in the community.” 
As members of the advisory committee, Moore and Jones’ recommendations will still need legislative approval. Moore knows this, and he said people tend to listen to his ideas when he shares his family’s experiences. 
“I’m not speaking about statistics and numbers,” he said. “I’m speaking [as] an individual. I’m speaking by an empty chair at our table.” 
The law says the council’s first meeting must be held by July 9.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/03165931/3X0A2637.jpg,,,2025-06-16 14:05:59.766660

(Photo provided by U.S. Army National Guard/Sgt. 1st Class Brad Mincey)South Carolina Army and Air National Guard members can now apply for $12,000 in annual state aid to help pay for college.
Legislators, in the new budget year beginning July 1, more than doubled the annual allotment for what’s known as the South Carolina National Guard College Assistance Program.
“These enhancements clearly demonstrate the state’s appreciation for military service and will strengthen South Carolina’s future workforce,” said Jeff Perez, the head of the state higher education agency which administers the financial aid.
For the 2023-2024 school year, 910 guard members participated in the program and received $3.8 million in assistance, an average of $4,000 annually per student.
If those enrollment numbers remain steady, spending on the program could rise as high as $10.9 million for the 2025-2026 school year.
“This investment reaffirms South Carolina’s commitment to valuing service, believing in the potential of its Guardsmen, and supporting the futures of its Guard members,” Adjutant General Robin Stilwell said in a statement.
Funding is limited to $4,000 per semester, so students would need to enroll in fall, spring and summer classes to receive the full annual benefit.
Also. while the program has been around since 2007, its funding is not guaranteed year-to-year. And there is a lifetime cap on the amount of money each applicant receives: $25,000.
To be eligible, applicants must have completed basic training and be active members of the South Carolina Army or Air National Guard. The money can be used to help cover the cost of a certificate program through the state technical college system, courses associated with a registered apprenticeship program, an associates degree or a bachelor’s degree.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54575799228_e21e3a59a6_c.jpg,,,2025-06-16 14:05:59.766660

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Payday lending reform appears bound for passage in the Rhode Island General Assembly this year after more than a decade of failed attempts.
The Rhode Island House of Representatives was scheduled to vote Monday afternoon on legislation that would cap the annual percentage rate for short-term, small-dollar loans at 36% — compared with the up-to-260% APR that deferred deposit providers can charge now. Meanwhile, the Senate Committee on Commerce is poised to advance a similar proposal Tuesday, setting the stage for the bill’s forthcoming debut on the Senate floor: the first time in its 15-year history.
“I cannot tell you how happy I am to see this bill finally going to the floor,” Sen. Ana Quezada, a Providence Democrat and legislation sponsor, said in an interview Monday. “I couldn’t believe it when I saw it on the [legislative] calendar.”
Quezada continued, “This is a huge step for payday lending reform after all these years.”
It’s not a done deal yet — both chambers must still approve the legislation, along with a signature from Gov. Dan McKee, who supports it. But Quezada was confident that a majority of the upper chamber supported the repeal of predatory lending practices. And the House of Representatives already signaled strong support in a sweeping 70-2 vote for nearly identical legislation in 2023.
The perennial push to bring Rhode Island’s payday loan policy in line with 22 other states, and federal government, began in 2011 under former Democratic Rep. Frank Ferri, of Warwick, and Sen. Harold Metts, of Providence. 
But it has gained increasing attention and traction on Smith Hill in more recent years. McKee and the rest of the state’s general officeholders signed a petition urging lawmakers to approve the reform in the waning days of the 2024 session. 
The major barrier for at least the last eight years has been the late former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio. Advocates pinpointed Ruggerio, who as Senate president decided what legislation advanced out of committee to the full chamber, as their biggest obstacle. Ruggerio died on April 21.
“I always felt under Senate President Ruggerio this bill would never see the light,” Quezada said.
Senate President Valarie Lawson, who succeeded Ruggerio in Senate leadership elections, supports the bill, Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson, said in an email Monday. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi also expressed support in a separate emailed statement.










I cannot tell you how happy I am to see this bill finally going to the floor.


– Sen. Ana Quezada, a Providence Democrat and legislation sponsor


The Senate leadership has changed, but criticism by institutions that offer speedy access to cash at triple-digit APR has not. 
William Murphy, the former House Speaker who now works as a lobbyist for Purpose Financial Inc., parent company of Advance America, reiterated the payday lending company’s opposition when asked for comment Monday.
“Passage of this legislation will cause Advance America’s employees to lose their jobs and health coverage that they and their families depend on,” Murphy said in an email. “The State will now have eight additional vacant storefronts. Importantly, thousands of Rhode Islanders will lose much needed immediate access to credit and the ability to make their own personal financial choice. There are no equal alternatives for people in Rhode Island.”
Alan Krinsky, research and fiscal policy director for the Economic Progress Institute, said the bill does not force any storefront or lending company to shut down.
“It simply requires them to play by the rules of any other lending institution,” Krinsky said in an interview.
Murphy has repeatedly said that Advance America only charges a 10% fee per transaction. Krinsky has disputed this claim.
“Their math is wrong on that,” Krinsky said, noting that a single interest rate is not the same as the annual interest rate.
Research by Pew Charitable Trusts shows that borrowers in need of quick access to cash take, on average, eight cycles to repay their original loan, compounding the interest rate with each cycle.
In 2022, the most recent data available, Rhode Island borrowers paid an estimated $2.8 million on interest and fees associated with payday loans, based on the $28.2 million of money borrowed across 80,650 loans, according to a January 2025 report by the Center for Responsible Lending.
Research by Pew and the Center for Responsible Lending also contradict opponents’ arguments that payday loans help people who lack access to traditional financial services. However, in states where payday loans aren’t available, borrowers have successfully turned to friends, negotiated with debtors or cut other costs. Annual percentage rate caps on short-term loans in other New England States have saved those residents an estimated $252.7 million a year.
Seeking compromise, lawmakers have agreed to push back the start date of the cap on payday loans. Original legislation called for the annual percentage rate cap to take effect immediately. But the amended version being voted on in the House Monday delays the start till Jan. 1, 2027. 
Rep. Karen Alzate, a Pawtucket Democrat and bill sponsor, said she pitched the later start date to give employees of payday lending operations time to find new jobs. 
Krinsky agreed that it “made sense” to give existing payday lenders time to “wind down operations,” if they choose not to continue offering loans at lower annual percentage rates.
Margaux Morisseau, co-chair of the Rhode Island Coalition for Payday Lending Reform, would have preferred an immediate start date.
“It’s not ideal because it leaves a whole ‘nother year for people to be taken advantage of,” she said.
But, she added, “In the sense of compromise, this was where we are most comfortable compromising.”
The Senate companion does not yet contain the later start date yet, though Quezada said she intends to advocate for the tweak prior to the committee’s vote Tuesday. If passed out of committee, the Senate companion could be taken up by the full chamber Wednesday, Paré said.
